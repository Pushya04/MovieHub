Beautiful bore,"Kirsten Dunst is ""Marie Antoinette"" in this anachronistic 2006 film directed by Sofia Coppola. The other stars include Jason Schwartzman, Rip Torn, Judy Davis, Marianne Faithful and Molly Shannon.I can only guess that the reason for making this film was to show a teenage Queen of France cavorting with her girlfriends and shopping until she dropped while remaining oblivious to the plight and unhappiness of the French people. In actuality, that's probably pretty close to the truth about this historical figure. Norma Shearer was very good as Marie Antoinette, but she wasn't a kid. I think this version had the right idea. The only thing Coppola omitted was Marie's story, so the movie is instead about the above-mentioned teen partying, shopping, being unfaithful, wandering the grounds, while giving us a look at royal tradition, gorgeous costumes and dazzling scenery. Little else.Marie Antoinette's life was full of drama - her liaisons with Axel von Fersen, the Affair of the Necklace, her husband's medical problem which prevented the couple from having children for so long, the revolution, the family being taken to prison, and the guillotine. Some of this is touched on or mentioned in passing; most of it is left out. There are five exciting minutes or so toward the end of the film.In a way, it's a shame, because this film could have given us great insight into Marie Antoinette by having a very young woman play the Queen as these events swirled around her. But in order to do that, characters would have to have been developed, and there didn't seem to be any interest in that. If you love color, beautiful costumes and scenery, this is the film for you. Don't bother if you're looking for any kind of content; like the vacuous queen, there's no there there.",6.0,Anonymous,History
No idea what this movie is about,This movie simply has no storyline. It's like glimpses of her life in France. The scene of having meal at the same dining table repeats over and over again like 10 times. Nothing propelled a story forward. The ending was just a quick wrap up. Nothing explained.,6.0,Anonymous,History
"Geez, I wish someone had told me this before I saw it...","Something you should know about this movie before you see it is that it does NOT attempt to be historically accurate. In fact, many scenes were purposely ""sabotaged"" with anachronisms to remind us that this is not a historical biography; instead it's meant to be a parable for the modern world.If I had known that, I might have enjoyed the movie instead of grinding my popcorn with searing hatred through most of it.Most noticeably, we're hit with a very non-18th century soundtrack: Adam Ant, Siouxie & the Banshees, The Cure, New Order, Bow Wow Wow, etc. And it's not just atmospheric background music either. There's actually a ballroom scene where they're rockin out to 80s post punk. If you don't realize the purpose of this odd juxtaposition, you might find yourself strangling the person sitting next to you.Other anachronisms are more subtle but equally bizarre. When Marie Antoinette goes on her shoe shopping spree (to the tune of ""I Want Candy"", no less) if you look closely you'll see a pair of Converse hi tops in the picture. That's probably when it should sink in that the director is messin with you.So the point of my review is to warn you NOT to expect any sort of historical accuracy, or even proper historical context. ""Marie Antoinette"" is more like the story of a 21st century teen growing up in a world of social jealousies, confused politics & cliquish loyalties. Only instead of the highschool hallways it happens in the Palace of Versailles.That explains why the film ""missed the opportunity"" of chronicling the French Revolution, the royal flight to Austria, the subsequent trial for treason and other landmark events that you'd think would be covered in a film called ""Marie Antoinette"". But no, those weren't within the scope of the film.In the IMDb ""goofs"" section, people have listed everything from ""The real Marie Antoinette didn't wear underwear"" to ""18th century French forks should have 3 tines, not 4."" Ooook. I'm sure those historians hated the movie like I did. But literally as I type this review, I'm hating the film less & less, and I might even try watching it a 2nd time. ""Marie Antoinette"" is definitely not your typical period piece, though the lavish visuals and big budget might lead you to believe it is. Approach it instead as an experimental indie type film with no rules, and you might really enjoy it.For me it might be too late, but if you haven't seen this movie you should have fun if you know to expect a modern day story that's ironically set in the late 1700s. It's a good flick, although I question why it won at Cannes (actually, when you see the end credits and realize how much money this production brought to France, maybe there's no question why it won). Definitely do not expect an 18th century European history lesson. For that, stick with the excellent period piece ""Amadeus"" and the very entertaining 1961 Sophia Loren film set during the French Revolution, ""Madame"".",,Anonymous,History
Only In Dreams..,"I have seen this film yesterday after a lot of hype up and waiting since in my little town everything comes out a month after the release date. I was looking forward to seeing this movie..a lot. But I must say that the trailers I had seen and the film have a completely different feeling. This isn't a bad film but I think that it well get a lot of criticism for not being historically accurate, not serious enough, being too long, being 'unfinished'... but those are not he bad points of this movie. The style is original and Sofia Coppola succeeds at showing Marie Antoinette's personal side. Her suffering through gossip and humiliation by her husbands lack of 'interest' in her etc. She succeeds in showing Marie Antoinette as a naive girl in the beginning..who hugs her first lady, cries at parting with her dog and announcing that the morning ceremonials are ridiculous. We see Marie Antoinette at the beginning trying to fit in with the strict life at Versailles but further on it's clear that with the gossip following her she stops caring and starts to have fun her own way which leads to her ruin. The negative points of the film is that Sofia Coppola uses the same techniques, the same scenes through out the movie. The trying on of shoes, the hairdressing, the patisserie dishes and the champagne. We see Marie Antoinette frolicking around in the grass too many times. Sofia Coppola apparently tried to show a girl out of touch with reality who lives just to have fun..to escape the wagging tongues of Versailles. But if that was her point the film should've ended long before. This is a biography of Marie Antoinette...even though not a completely serious or historically accurate one...but if Sofia Coppola is trying to show this French queens personality and human side then I can assure you there was more to her than the frilly lace, the satin shoe, the bakery department and the champagne. Marie-Antoinette was a mother who cared about her children and was involved with them..though we hardly we see this in the film except the sequence of her and her daughter on the farm. The relationship and the feelings she had for her husband aren't very clear and his for her aren't very much elucidated. This is a visually beautiful film but I think Sofia Coppola could've delved deeper into this rich personality. In the end you're left with the impression of stepping out from a hazy rose petal fragile dream that from someones tumultuous life. But a dream that's still worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,History
more costume than drama,"In 1768, Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) is a young princess in Austria. Her mother sets her to marry the future French king Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). She is naive and inexperienced in the ways of the Versailles court. There is King Louis XV of France (Rip Torn), his mistress Madame du Barry (Asia Argento), and Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis). The Dauphin is distant and Marie struggles to connect with him. They are not sexual and she's under pressure to give an heir to the throne.Sofia Coppola delivers a bright, light Marie Antoinette. She's very modern. There is some nice tension as the pressure builds for a baby. The movie fades away after that as France falls into revolution. Dunst is better as the young teen more than the older queen. The movie has the costumes but the drama isn't always there.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty sets. Not much else.,"I had high hopes for this one since I love reading biographies. Granted that not everything is accurate nor can be fit into a movie we can only make do with what is presented in this case an overlong rock and roll video that has pretty sets and costumes. Marie Antionette came off a little slow and boring though life in the French Court and it's protocols were very amusing to quote MA in the dressing scene ""This is ridiculous."" Sofia Coppola could've have focused a little more on MA's loneliness in a lousy marriage and the court intrigues and a little less on the extravagant shopping sprees. What is surprising is the infamous Necklace Affair wasn't even included since most modern historians agree MA was innocent from that scandal. Acting wise Kirsten Dunst pulled off a difficult job of playing a childlike queen upfront but a woman who suffered humiliation behind the scenes however it is Rose Byrne who stole the show (along with the sets, costumes and the yummy cakes) as the Duchesse de Polignac a role she plays with believable aplomb. Asia Argento looked a little old for Madame Du Barry and Mary Nighy is nice as the Princesse Lamballe, another unfortunate victim of the Revolution. Jason Shwartzman plays a rather stiff Louis XVI while Jamie Dorman is hot as Count Axel Fersen. Everyone else like Judy Davis, Shirley Henderson and Molly Shannon had nothing to do but gossip and look silly. Marianne Faithful floored me with her regal Maria Therese. In the end the movie was a little shallow and the rock and roll soundtrack seemed out of place. It was like watching a 80's music video.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A MODERN PERSPECTIVE ON TWO TRAGIC HISTORICAL FIGURES,"I actually rather enjoyed the film. Beautiful art direction. Kirsten Dunst (luminously) portrays Marie Antoinette; a young soon-to-be queen, full of love and yet terribly flawed, a royal with nothing but her bloodline to offer France. The film offers a female perspective on what it must have been like to be a bargaining chip to maintain peace between 2 powerful countries. In the film, Marie Antoinette is not unlike many privileged and wealthy young people today; easily bored, constantly seeking distractions and amusements, and in desperate need of direction, attention, and affection. She is a young woman who appears to have held no real interest in politics--she simply wants to fulfill her duties as wife and mother. At heart, she is a ""country girl"" in many regards. She seems happiest in when in the country with nature and with children. It was insightful to see Marie Antoinette portrayed as a woman with foibles and weaknesses--in the framework of most histories of the French Revolution, she is painted as a conniving villainess. This movie offers a more human perspective on this period of time in history, and reminds the viewer that these two monarchs were just teenagers; terribly ill-equipped to manage the responsibility of ruling a country that was already deeply in debt. I appreciate the viewpoint of this film...it's a fresh portrait of the history of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The contemporary music mixed with classical reminds us that history can and will repeat itself. The films is a cautionary tale against allowing wealth-based leaders to override the needs of a struggling nation. Too much decadence pushed under the noses of the poor will only lead to a revolution.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A very overly criticised movie,"This movie was a solid 7/10. It wasn't groundbreaking but it was entertaining, Dunst was endearing and of course very visually pleasing. I find it amusing and rather telling how critical most of the reviewers are of the director and think if. Sofia was named Simon they would not be mentioning her so much. I enjoyed it and it taught me some new things about Marie Antoinette.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A sensory delight,"Based on the recent Marie-Antoinette biography by Antonia Fraser, Sofia Coppola's film focuses on the personal qualities of the character of Marie-Antoinette and thus participates in the character's historical rehabilitation. Antoinette is seen as a respectful loyal daughter, a loving mother, a patient wife, who had to withstand a flood of vindictive criticism since the moment she set foot in the French court. This depiction contrasts strongly with many prior representations of the character in film (""The Affair of the Necklace"" for example), which show her as superficial, selfish and vain.The visuals and auditory elements, which evoke a powerful image of 18th-century Versailles, are the movie's forte. And their effects linger in one's mind (or at least they did in mine) long after one's exit from the theater. As a budding art historian, I was stunned by the intensely lush visual spectacle the film has to offer: the pomp and circumstance of ritualized and regimented 18th-century Versailles. The semi-private world that Antoinette builds for herself to escape Versailles's codified, quasi-totalitarian atmosphere, is evoked through a sequence of fast-moving images of champagne-guzzling, beautifully-decorated cake-eating, and Manolo Blahnik shoe buying. Thus Antoinette's fantasy world is likened to a world recognizable to you, me and Carrie Bradshaw. Some people may scoff at this 21st century world transposed to an earlier time. But as the center of the world in 18th-century Europe, Marie-Antoinette's ""secret Versailles"" would certainly have been as ""hip"" as this, and Coppola has found effective means through sound and image by which to make this hipness accessible.The story zooms in on the character of Marie-Antoinette, played by a ravishing Kirsten Dunst, who arrives at Versailles at the tender age of 14, to become queen of France a mere 5 years later. Coppola emphasizes the loneliness of Antoinette throughout the film: most important is her alienation from the French court by the fact that she is a foreigner (something that made her a scapegoat for all of France's problems during the 1780's). Her powerlessness to ""fit in"" is emphasized also through her sexual alienation from her socially-awkward husband (played by Jason Schwartzmann), her mother's chidings that she has not yet produced an heir to the French throne (and thereby has not secured Austria's political place in Europe), and the bitchy gossip that goes on behind her back at court.Marie-Antoinette is depicted as an intensely personable, friendly and playful person. Coppola fashions a Marie-Antoinette who is a dutiful daughter, a patient wife to Louis (who eventually overcomes his shyness and becomes a loving and protective husband and father), and a caring and tender mother. She is shown as both bold and humble, two qualities which had quasi-miraculous effects on both the court and the angry mob, as is shown in some of the film's most touching moments.Equipped with these ""essential"" personal qualities, the charges traditionally made against Marie-Antoinette fade completely. It is precisely Antoinette's ill-fated attempt at fitting into French court society that causes her escape into a world of idle futility and libertinage. Her escape into the world of ""playing shepherdess"" in her pleasure-house of Le Hameau is shown not as a silly escape from responsibility but as the simple human need to be surrounded by the natural world. This place appears to us as it does to Antoinette: as a refuge from the backbiting, totalitarian regime of Versailles. Even the legendary ""let them eat cake"" statement allegedly made by Marie-Antoinette is discarded as fiction.There is almost no place in the film for the 18th-century reality as it existed outside the bubble-like world of Versailles. This is not the movie's purpose. The end of the film is a bit abrupt: the last image shows the royal family heading to Paris to be imprisoned in the building of the Conciergerie. There is no mention of the guillotine anywhere, which again can seem surprising, but which shows that Coppola deliberately tried to eschew stereotypes and do something different. And it is all to her credit.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Sofia Coppola's Soap Opera,"Sophia Coppola really seems to know how to ruin a potentially great movie concept. Marie Antoinette is a fascinating figure in European history and one would expect the movie to account for at least a few interesting things that happened when she came to France to live with the prince. What we see is another sugarcoated Hollywood movie which is pretty much exactly like those teen highschool movies where rich young girls gossip, obsess with fashion and popularity etc. The only difference here are the costumes and the fact that not all the women in this movie are as young.To top it off, the soundtrack...well, let me first put it this way, as a stand alone compilation, it's terrific to listen to but the way the modern tunes and songs have been incorporated in the sequences looks ill fit. It looks like a the characters have gone to a current day costume party rather than a movie of the period. Moreover, Coppola fails to draw the body language and nuances of the French culture from her actors. Not once does one get the impression that this is a story about France. As a result of bad direction and terrible writing, the performances of the actors suffer even though Kirsten Dunst does the best she could with the given material.The director portrays Antoinette as naive and frivolous. There is no mention of her historical accomplishments or failures. Now it isn't an easy task to convincingly tell the story of a historical figure in two hours but Coppola focuses the entire two hours on Antoinette being fascinated by her riches and partying around. A competent director and writer could have done so much more with the storytelling. In the current case, only near the very end things start to move along but here too the story speeds up at such a superfast pace that the ending is extremely abrupt and contrived.'Marie Antoinette' is like a bad birthday present that is wrapped beautifully but once unwrapped, the gift itself is far from satisfactory.",,Anonymous,History
Struggles badly with pacing and aesthetic,"I like what this film was trying to do, in terms of rethinking the way we remember and treat marie Antoinette, as the villain who said ""let them eat cake"" and not as a real human, doing what seemed right to her. However, I don't actually like this film, for my many reasons, the worst of which being pacing.I don't mind a slow film with lots of shots of very little that help establish emotion and tone, however this film featured many long shots of large buildings and halways, with little emotion, to indicate a grand, formal atmosphere that just make the film really boring.The second problem I have is aesthetically this film won't commit, with some scenes being set to peruod accurate irritating music and ooccasionally others being shot to upbeat modern pop songs. This leads to every pop music scene feeling strange and out of place.On a similar note, the film can't decide ehich language it's using, with some people speaking english, some english with american accents, some english with obviously fake posh accents, some people french and occasionally people saying french phrases in an american accent, which is just wierd.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Hollow Biographical film,"Kudos for settings and costuming. That's where it ends. Actually, Kirsten did do a good job of portraying a flighty, self-absorbed young girl who is is not really cut out for the serious responsibilities of Queenship. Her transformation into a Queenly older woman, however, is far too swift, making it unbelievable. For me, the greatest irritation comes from the musical score. What brilliant person came up with the idea of using very modern music in an 18th Century historical film? It was always jarring, making the scene laughable. There are definitely better made Marie Antoinette films out there, I have no doubt.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A French Story for Americans,"Marie Antoinette,was nominated this year for a Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. In all reality, this was a ridiculous and laughable attempt at ""Americanizing"" the French aristocracy. Starring the crisp Kirsten Dunst, and questionably casted Jason Schwartzman, Marie Antoinette portrays aristocracy and the french revolution as somewhat of a hip music video. Fortunately, Sofia Coppola lends very competent directing, by creating fascinating cinematography to save the film from total disillusionment. Lack of accents diminishes the painstaking role of authenticity, not withstanding the casting of Texas drawled Rip Torn as King Louis XV. Just think, I actually waited in line four hours to view this film at this year's Cannes Film Festival, to be disappointed. How disconcerting is that??Coppola does manage to evoke the feeling of the 18th century way of life for royalty in Versailles. Living in huge palaces with gilded furniture, being waited on hand and foot, and never really worrying about anything was life in Versailles. Gossip, gambling, drinking and coke were also some of the other, more sinful indulgent pleasures the people of Versailles used to escape their miserable lives. Being married to the young Louis XV, Marie Antoinette is a fourteen year old virgin, pushed into this marriage to better the Franco-Austrian relations at the time. Coppola does invigorate the sense of loneliness and alienation Antoinette endured during her stay in France, due to both her naiveness and the fact that she was Austrian. Becoming the queen of France only 5 years later, Marie Antoinette drives herself further away, as she begins to cater deeper to the royal French treatment, it took so long to become accustomed to in the first place.Lavished with beautiful set design, exuberant costumes and exotic pastries this failure as a film will be sure to gather up Oscars in those categories, bereft of any other substance. I do have to admit that had Coppola taken herself less seriously in this attempt, the film would have been more enjoyable. Baz Lurman knew what he was doing in his modern rendition of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, never taking himself too seriously. Maybe Papa Bear Francis Ford never had that DVD lying around the shelves at home. Those looking for an accurate historical depiction of Marie Antoinette look elsewhere, but those looking for an evening of eye candy and Strokes music blaring as Kirsten Dunst dances in a field of lilies, look nowhere else.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"I Thought I'd Like It and...Ta Dah!   I Did! Not Only That, I Love It!!!","Having trashed two of the three movies Sofia Coppola has directed (I didn't see Lick the Star, yuck!) what made me think I'd enjoy Marie Antoinette? I'm old and worse yet, a male. Certainly not the demographic Marie Antoinette is aimed at, so I found when I ventured out to my local Cineplex to check out Ms. Coppola's 4th go at directing. I figured to use the theater as my personal screening-room on a Friday at noon. Oops! It was a school holiday and I entered one of the smaller of the 14 ""theaters"" into a crowd of a dozen or so chatting high school girls. I had mistakenly arrived 20 minutes early so I had an opportunity to eavesdrop on their discussion concerning the ethics paper they were required to write and what they were considering giving up for a week as required by their class. These must have been students at the nearby parochial high school. What public high school has ethic courses? They seemed a perfect audience for a film on Marie Antoinette. The theater continued to fill as film time approached. It filled to approximately ¾ capacity and I was, as best as I could determine, the only male person of my gender.So why did I think I'd enjoy a film by a director whose films seemed directed by a person with a spoiled child's view of the world? Well, what I'd read about Marie Antoinette resonated close enough with Moulin Rouge, Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge which blew me away. ""Lavish imagery and a daring soundtrack set this film apart from most period dramas; in fact, style complete takes precedence over plot and character development in Coppola's vision of the doomed queen"" should sound familiar to Moulin Rouge fans.Well, as soon as the black and shocking pink credits showed up to the sound of The Gang of Four's ""Natural's Not In It"" I knew I was in the right place. Kirsten Dunst was, in my opinion, a perfect choice. She's beautiful but not too beautiful. She has an aura of mischievousness which worked from start to finish. Ms. Dunst, at the young age of 24 or so, already has a long career in Hollywood. And she was only one of many. From Marianne Faithful, to Judy Davis, to Rip Torn, to Jason Schwartzman, to Asia Argento, to many others perfectly cast.For me, the film never dragged or bogged down. The sets were beautiful. (What can you say about Versailles and the French countryside?) The food was reminiscent to me of Wayne Thiebaud paintings, but more colorful. The costumes, the music, added to the sense of decadence I think the film aimed for.Yet Marie Antoinette's character never seemed decadent. Ms. Dunst's openness and delight in all presented to her, came across. Despite her loss of freedom and the difficulty in eventually becoming the Queen of France she was able to ""Party On!""What made the film, for me, exceptional, was how Sofia Coppola was able to make both Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI living, breathing, human beings, rather than grotesqueries. I was moved several times by their connection or lack of the same.There is a lot to see, hear and experience in Marie Antoinette. It is an accomplished and stimulating cinematic experience. I shall view it as much as I am able. This film has prompted me to review both The Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation. The world is certainly in need of feminine perspective and Sofia Coppola has made a statement that she has the potential to be a very Great talent.Pardon my verbosity.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A 2 Hour Music Video of Kirsten Dunst in Great Costumes,"A great cast with incredible wardrobe and makeup. Unfortunately, it lacks any plot and storyline, and focuses far too much on the repetitive nature of the start of Louis XVI & Marie's failed romance attempts. Essentially, that's the entire first hour of the film. (Going to bed, no sex tonight, breakfast, go to bed, no sex tonight, breakfast, and repeat... For an hour.)The rest of the film are very stylized glimpses into Marie Antoinette's lavish and extravagant outfits and socializing sessions with her friends, none of which have much dialogue, with various shots of Kirsten Dunst draping herself over couches and beds giggling to a modern 80's punk soundtrack.The story focuses so much on the parts mentioned above, that it completely leaves out any actual storyline, which should have been the French Revolution and Marie Antoinette's part on it.When the story finally starts to get interesting, the movie stops short and ends! I couldn't believe it. I was shocked that in this 2 hours, we did not get to see the end of Louis and Marie's story, which is undoubtedly some of the most interesting parts of the story.It felt like a complete waste of time. =(",3.0,Anonymous,History

Surprisingly good,"I must admit the subject-matter of this movie didn't interest me much. The only really interesting historical facet for me was how the film-makers handled the love-affair with Axel Von Fersen, whom i wrote an essay about in a distant past. Anyway, the attraction for me was undoubtedly Sofia Coppola, mostly since ""Lost in Translation"" proved to be such a magical experience.What i expected from this movie was something infinitely lighter. A minor and pleasant distraction. A beautiful little film with wonderful costumes, nice visuals and fair acting. Actually the movie surpassed my expectations. While it was not a masterpiece or a movie i'm likely to remember on my deathbed, it was still a lot more entertaining than i imagined it would be. The actors all do a fine job, Jason Schwartzmann surprising me the most as Louis XVI, and the visuals are wonderful. So the movie delivered where i thought it would. The bonus was the fact that the story was more engaging than i expected. The beautiful and frail Marie Antoinette feels like a real person and i actually cared about what happened to her. Sure in retrospect it might be difficult to feel any true sympathy for someone like her, someone who lives in extraordinary luxury while the masses starve. But it's hard not to see her as somewhat a victim of circumstance. A person placed in a time and place she doesn't fully understand, and who tries to make the best of it.Marie Antoinette is sure to please those mostly interested in the beautiful surface. There is definitely enough of that since this is a beautiful-looking movie. It also has a very nice soundtrack to match the visuals, a mix between modern music and more period-like pieces. Surprisingly though there was also more to like beneath the surface, which made this movie that much more enjoyable. Worth watching! 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Gidget Goes to Versailles,"and when she gets there, she gets bored, gossips, reads Rousseau, and has beach-blanket pot parties in Amadeus outfits. I did like the music, there is one inspired masked ball and a good ""watch the sun rise"" scene - the strength of this film is its connection to high school culture, seen through the eyes of a sweet, utterly conventional and finally boring teenage girl, projected from the California suburbs onto 18th century France. This is obviously also the film's weakness: this movie is a beautiful, expensive still life that knows nothing at all about French history, Europe, the Revolution, the Bourbons, how the ancien regime worked, how incompetent wars and not Marie Antoinette's Imelda-Marcos-like shoe fetish ran up the debt, about the conflict in North America with England and Spain, about how leading members of French government actually had brains - the films displays a nitwit, decadent, wig-loving, golden-furniture France as though seen by a France-hater in the Bush administration. As my brother pointed out, the movie also blew the subject of a potentially great movie, which is Marie Antoinette's inspired, sometimes brilliant defense of herself at her later trial. Trying to learn about what happened to the French court from this film is like trying to learn about American corporate culture by watching J.R Ewing's 30 second business deals at the Cattlemen's Club on Dallas. Well sure, politics wasn't the subject of the movie, but why is the ""chick stuff"" buried in diamonds and champagne? That makes these women seem way less tough and intelligent than they actually were in the bloody contact sport of French court politics. As an American watching this in Paris I was struck by the film's lack of historical, political, and cultural sophistication, in which Dunst is in every single frame and it's all one gigantic royal slumber party until the peasants show up in an illiterate wordless mass baying for bread and blood and shaking their satanic harvesting tools.

Shoe in mistake(Spoiler point),"If you don't want to know what happens, then don't read any further past the note about the green converse high tops.In one of the MANY scenes of shoes that Marie Antoinette is trying on, to the right there is a VERY modern pair of green converse high tops. Was that on purpose or should it be labeled a goof? I thought it should have been there because of how modern music was inter-laced with period music. It gave it a more modern feel and completely changed the story. It's too bad that the movie didn't end the way the actual story ended with the queen being beheaded. But it would have taken away from the whole flow of the movie, but I think a disclaimer at the end of the movie should have said what had actually happened to her and why",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Marie-Antoinette at the Court of Versaille at age 14 through to age 30. Her progression from eagerness, disappointment, compensation and the end, which we all know.","A hauntingly beautiful film about how deep disappointment finds an outlet in ""creative"" frivolity. The combination of rock music and the rituals of Versaille never ""shocks"" thanks to the mastery of the direction. There is also a solid mastery of pacing. The slow progression of the film never bores; it reveals in time. The glory of Versailles is not shownat the beginning but only as the film and the psychology of its heroine develop. The films owes a lot to the leading actress and way she is shot. The close-ups of the expressive face of Kirsten Dunst communicate the whole range of emotions behind a women eager to please and to do well, but who is trapped and inwardly anguished and disappointed. Rarely have we felt so close to a famous woman so far back in time. The film also masters the art of depicting ""historical clichés"", such as MA playing milkmaid, very convincingly.

Coppola Brings New Life To A Dead Genre,"I had reached the point in my life where I could not bare the idea of seeing another historical-costume-drama. The thought of seeing another actor attempting the stilted period lingo and mello-drama gives me a headache, BUT Miss Coppola has undone my pain with this fresh take on the period drama, with her lovely and off-beat MARIE-ANTOINETTE. Usually you watch the piece from afar, thinking, ""Wow, life sure was hard back then,"" but you never really can relate to the characters, but Coppola breaks tradition in a completely refreshing way, so that you can really understand these characters. She uses modern day music (not like the horrible A KNIGHT'S TALE did) and hand held camera work. Her style is much more free and alive. She takes her time with the material so that we get a feel for time period and all of the free time they had. The acting is first rate, other than a mis-cast Rip Torn who's a little too over-the-top. If you've enjoyed her other movies (THE VIRGIN SUICIDES & LOST IN TRANSLATION), then you are sure to enjoy this film. But if you are looking for another stilted period drama with forced accents and dead camera work then rent THE PARTRIOT or VANITY FAIR. I really enjoyed MARIE-ANTIONETTE, though I'm not sure how historically accurate it is, it's a fine film. Some have criticized Coppola for making a French subject so American, but that is not the point, she has created an accessible historical biopic, that people of MARIE-ANTIONETTE's age could enjoy and relate to.",8.0,Anonymous,History
what was she thinking?,"I had high hopes for this film. Being a fan of fashion and shoes myself, I couldn't wait to see it. I even had to play rock-paper-scissors with my boyfriend. He wanted to see The Prestige and I, Marie Antoinette. Frankly, I wish I had lost.The movie was too thin. The only reason I knew what was going on was because I had researched Marie Antoinette before. Had you known nothing about Marie, you wouldn't have learned anything whatsoever from this film.Also, Marie pops out three kids, with there being no mention of it.Sofia Copolla did not do a good job in instilling humor in to this film. There were attempts, but very weak ones. She should've hired me.Perhaps, a brief narration throughout the film could've helped. It might've assisted those who knew nothing about the Queen.Save your money and don't watch it. I wish I could get my eight bucks back. Sofia, you owe me.",,Anonymous,History
"Coppola's personal take on a historical figure is keen, hip, too loose and very stylish","Sofia Coppola challenges the idea of doing a costume/period drama with her film Marie Antointte, and it's an interesting exercise in the art of showing how empty and frivolous royalty can be. It also reminded me that, compared with this, Lost in Translation's screenplay is actually much more focused and cohesive- in the sense of the structure of nothing going on (yet things seeming to be going on all the time). It's a European style character study where the characters don't have a whole lot of depth to them, even if the first hour or so delivers on being absorbing entertainment and craftsmanship (err, Craft-woman-ship now I guess). Coppola has her heels dig very well into the history and period detail of it, but she's actually not even that interested in the politics and the main desires of the people of France and elsewhere in Europe (in fact it isn't until the last ten minutes that the audience is really aware of a mass public who hates their guts to pieces). The world of the French royalty in the late 18th century- where Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) is plucked up from Austria at 14 and picked to be the breeder for Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman)- is an insulated one, and the picture really becomes about how these two young people deal with this kind of heavenly constrictive paradise.Coppola does a lot to make the costume drama a lot more spiffy and fun than one might find in the common Ivory/Merchant film. We get 80's pop and new-wave songs on the soundtrack, many times over in the midst of some regular classical music in the halls of the Versailles. And there are many a montage devoted to shoes and pastries and cake. But through this, as mentioned above, the first hour is the most compelling and fascinating, as the first twenty minutes actually come off more or less like it could be all silent- the images totally speak for themselves, in the very restrained, always-pattered way of life that's lead for Marie and the King. It becomes apparent that Louis isn't really all that interested in her- matter of fact not really interested in anything at all, kind of incurious aside from his locks and hunting (kind of sound familiar, cough- Bush- cough). Schwartzman plays this superbly well, with a countering to what Dunst does with her main female protagonist. While Schwartzman is always reserved, a little dim, and trying to always cling to the proper ways up until the last dinner, Dunst's Marie starts off not totally sure what to make of this environment, and finds that the escapism of this world is the only way to find some kind of fulfillment, however shallow it might be.It's in the second half, however, that Coppola's script becomes a little more than meandering. It's like as if things just seem to be happening, though not really at the same time. While there is always the obvious, welcome influence of Antonioni lurking in many scenes (Coppola admitted to him being an influence at the 04 Oscars), particularly towards the end in showing the lack of true emotive connectedness between people in the upper class, there is also a lack of cohesion to all of this that wasn't as apparent in 'Translation'. There is a good sub-plot involving Marie's tryst with an American officer, but more often than not we get scenes with her doing not much at all, wandering aimlessly, fooling around with her kids, wandering hallways, etc. Moments like these are fine over the main context of the first part, as Marie is under pressure to bear children, but after a while the thread, however loose, gets a little un-reeled. Even an interesting moment like transitioning through time via paintings becomes obvious.In the end, I liked what I saw, and liked the intentions that Coppola had with the material, and especially the cast that she assembled (aside from the other two, Judy Davis, Asia Argento, Steve Coogan, Rip Torn, Molly Shannon and Marianne Faithful are among the many talented members of the cast), but it didn't amount to something that would mark it as a great film or even as an important one. It's a well produced, self-conscious interpretation that gives a few sparks to the notion of how material like this can be approached differently, though also longer and not as altogether as it thinks it is. I'd love to find the soundtrack though.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Very American Movie,"Good soundtrack, good eye candy.This film would have benefited - greatly - from scripted dialog and more editing. It was obvious the director was driving at creating an atmosphere of a naive teenaged European monarchy and its trappings. But it was heavy handed to the point of ponderous in that regard. The casual language and rocky improvisation by the main characters came off more sloppy or ""in your face cool"" than anything, in my opinion. I am not surprised it was booed in Cannes, since it's patently American.That said, it was generally fun to watch and marie antoinette's story was credible.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent!,"I am not really a Sofia Coppola fan, but I did love her work in the Virgin Suicides ( I really couldn't care less for Lost in Translation), but her Marie Antoinette is an experience anyone who loves movies should endure. While on a vacation trip to France to visit a cousin, we decided to go see the film, since it had premiered at the Cannes Film Festival just three days before I got there. My cousin had told me that while the reviews over there had been ecstatic and raves, some of the french press booed at the press screening. To be honest, from that reaction, I immediately thought the movie was going to suck, but then I remembered whatever the critics hate, I end up loving, so I gave it a shot. This movie blew me away! I of course had found out before hand that this film has nothing to do with the revolution, or the beheading of the last king and queen of France. So I went in there with knowledge that I wasn't expecting a boring period BBC dramatization of Marie Antoinette. The film is glorious to look at! The costumes are simply the the greatest costumes ever constructed. We are used to seeing 18th century costumes with wild plooms, and explosive beading and diamonds every where adorned, but these costumes were much more simpler but had a dramatic effect to the eyes ( this is so winning best costumes at next years Oscars). The actors were tremendous particularly Dunst, who whenever I would read threads about Antoinette on here would be bashed because some people said that she cant act, or she could never pull off this role. Believe me, she does (if campaigned right, she could so get an Oscar nomination for this)! She excels as the doomed Queen of France in every way imaginable! She is a frightened teenager in the beginning of the film, trying to please everyone even her overbearing mother (played by the wonderful Marianne Faithful), and you automatically identify with her. Here is a girl who has no friends, no close companions, and while she tries to please her husband, he (jason Swarchtzman, great as always) just blows her off, because he feels that he is not the kind who likes to have sex! So she grows up in the palace of Versailles's, and gets her reputation as a bit of party girl who loves parties, clothes, jewelery, company of women (who wouldn't want that if at 19 become ruler of a powerful decadent country) till finally when she has her children you see her mature and become a loving mother, and a devoted wife. Sofia has made an excellent movie. Sure the script does lack a certain depth to some characters, but remember this isn't your mother's Marie Antoinette. This a new wave Marie Antoinette, and Sofia excels in her vision! But this film isn't for everybody. If you have a problem with rock music used in a period film then you may cringe at some of the moments when the songs are used. Also if you expect to see a full blown bio of the Queen, then you are dead wrong, because this film explores how one minute Antoinette was the toast of France, to the last where she finally accepts her fate as the last and doomed Queen of France. It is a very good movie. I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"This movie is gorgeous and has exelent talent behind it, but it's contemporary roots spoil it's weight.","For starters, I don't think it's historical accuraccy (Which is already very muddy) should be considered in a review for this movie, rather the movie should be judged by it's artestry and execution alone.That being said, this movie was GORGEOUS! Almost every frame of this film was a work of art, the costumes, scenery, acting, dialouge was all top notch as espected from the wonderful cast both on and off screen working on this work of art.Why is it not a 8-10 movie? Well.My biggest issue with this movie (which is why I give it a 7) was it's choice of music and the way the movie exibited the luxuries of Marie's life. For starters, the choice of music was awful, I felt the contemporary punk-rock choices like ""I want candy"" when Marie was begining to enduldge in her luxuries was very off place and spoil the magic of this time-piece, also during the second quarter of the movie it felt like the production relied allot on it's awful music choices to push the story forward, laizily pasting montages with this music really took a toll in my opinion of this movie, and for this reason the movie felt allot less elegant till the end.I'd like to finish on a good note by saying that the begining was flawless and also that towards the end the production relied more on classical music and silence to acompany it's scenes which I felt should have been done from the begining.TLDR: How can this movie been better?-Don't use silly contemporary music, rather use classical music
(It did not even have to be of the 1800's just not pop and punk rock from the 90's and 2000's.)
-Appreciate silence and let the scenes not have as much music, specially with such awful choices for music used at the begining
-Instead of poorly executed montages of her clothes eating away at the time, these montages could have been replaced by the cooks making the beautiful food, the architecture and anything else around the gorgeous sets they had to play with.This movie was amazing to watch and is well worth the time, but it could have been much, much better. Much love and I wish the best for the production and crew in their future projects, they are still very talented, just that they made many poor and un-inspired choices during big parts of this project.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant,"I was a bit apprehensive to go see a movie about 18th century France mixed in with some cool hip tunes from the 80's. But this is Sofia Coppola and as expected, she does a magnificent job. It's not a historical movie in the strict sense. You won't learn much about the french revolution or the social context of the times, apart from the fact that the french royalty lived in complete luxury at Versailles. But Marie Antoinette is a very captivating movie about the personal story of this Austrian girl who ends up marrying the heir to the french throne. The images and costumes are simply beautiful. The pace is slow like in Sofia Coppola's previous movies but it's what makes her movies so special. The music is awesome and the acting very good. I just love this movie. Two thumbs way up !!!!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Why No Real Ending?,"I read a biography about Marie Antoinette last year. I'm embarrassed to say I knew very little about her before that book. She led a very brief, interesting and ultimately tragic life. I also watched an older movie last year about her that hit all the major moments I'd learned about in the book. So when I saw this come up on HBO I figured, why not check it out?Like that older movie, this one covers most of basics, but in a much more modern style (even incorporating contemporary music). I'd've used a younger actress to portray Marie Antoinette in the beginning, because to me that's one of the fascinating things about her life- married off at just 14 years old and sent from Austria to France. Kirsten Dunst didn't look young enough during that journey to truly capture how scary that must have been.But then, after covering her maturation and adoption of the ostentatious lifestyle of true royalty this movie ends with her and her family fleeing Versailles just as the mob is moving in. There is so much more to come; her imprisonment, a failed escape attempt and then, of course, her beheading. Not sure why director Sophia Coppola would eschew these essential moments in Antoinette's life but for me, it left me wanting for another half hour of this movie to get to the real tragic stuff.",6.0,Anonymous,History

It pays to be FCC's daughter,"Is it me being numb or it just happened that Sophia Coppola managed to make a movie about 18th century France and fill it with 1980's music? Did she watch A Knight's Tale and decided she has talent enough to copy the concept? It pays to be FFC's daughter. I understand that she was not attempting to make a historically accurate depiction but there is a limit for inaccuracy. Some where I heard that she was trying to attract the younger generation by using the music, ... I am glad that she did not get hold of ""the windows, the walls ..."" and the 2k music.From the beginning it is not good, I am finding myself struggling to zone out the music so i can focus on the scene. There are so many stupid mistakes that even with the totally not fitting music you can not miss them. SC had such a great research team that they failed to tell her this: In France the wedding ring is on the right hand!! How many times do you need to see MA waking up, not sexed yet to get the point? Ms. Coppola really does well trying to enter the sex into the movie by showing KD, naked standing in the distance a couple of times. The genius in little Sophia is proved by the scene at 55 min and 55 sec into the movie. Marie Antoinette is choosing shoes and a canvas converse is in her wardrobe! Light blue and white rubber sole, fat laces! Was she in the edit room that day? Did I see a black man teaching Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna von Habsburg-Lothringen AKA Marie Antoinette, queen of France playing music??!!! 120 minutes into the movie so we can see that MA is spending, gambling and at last has a daughter. Everyone in the movie speaks English, but the little girl utters a few French words to make sure you know that they are French. There are so many talented people that can not get the privileges afforded to Ms. Coppola to make a movie and here she is making a new style of movie making. Her attempt to show MA as a person fails at the part of not showing the true tragic moments of her capture, imprisonment and watching her friends getting behead; most of all Duchess de Lamballe, the original person who said; ""then they should eat cake"". Her own beheading was not even the point. KD does a very good job in regards to portray of the naive and shallow MA.

1. The set and costume design is incredibly beautiful, amazingly designed and utterly hypnotic.
2. The comedy is perfectly timed, risible, but never overwhelming.

4. Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette) and Jason Schwartzman (Louis XVI) deliver brilliant performances.
5. The colour palette is mesmerising with its' rich and luscious colouring that reinforces the extravagant wealth and luxury of the monarchy, especially when compared to the dulling colour that occurs in response to death and revolution.Cons:
1. The alt-rock soundtrack feels wholly distracting and nonsensical.
2. The death of Louis XV (Rip Torn) falls flat as he's barely in the film which means he's not fleshed out that well.

"Stupendous 'translation' of Marie's life and times for those of us alive today.  Allows us to feel and experience what those folks felt and experienced, perhaps?","Sophia Coppola's 'Marie Antoinette' works on all levels. It is a brilliant and spectacular portrayal of a long-past time; yet it also has an immediacy, and intimacy, and a warmth that draws us in and seduces us. The realness of the human dimensions, and the warmth and truth of the movie was truly surprising to me. I expected a bit of a chick flick--- but despite the 2-1/2 hours length, I was engaged right through the ending credits.Part of the success goes to Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman, of course. And the brilliant supporting cast, such as Rip Torn, as King Louis the 15th. And the surprisingly apt Molly Shannon, as the bitchy and cavilling Versailles court snob. But surely a ton of the credit must also go to Coppola, for the insightful writing, and inspired directorial choices.I have seen some of the nay-sayers for this movie criticize it on an historical accuracy basis. Fair enough. Maybe this or that aspect of the life of Marie Antoinette was not displayed fully, or 'just right'. But these critics are missing the whole point of THIS movie. THIS movie is not a 'bio pic', nor a flat, factual 'visual aid' for a history classroom.Think about it for a minute--- how do you portray other times, or other countries and cultures than your own, and those of the likely audience? Some artistic translation is required. If we could go back in time and plant hidden video cameras in Versailles from 1768-1790 (or whatever it was), what would we have? I doubt very much that we would understand any of what was happening. Because the times have changed, and the values and mores and norms and expectations have changed, AND the manner of expression for each of those things has changed--- I don't think 'real time' video footage of a long distant past age would even be comprehensible to us. We need a way to portray the values (etc., as above) in current terms, terms that we can feel and understand NOW.For example--- I noticed a party scene, where Coppola had modern, cool, very So-Cal music playing as the background. One might think 'Hey! That's not the 18th century!', and they would be right, of course. But the party vibe that we, the actual audience in 2006 might feel NOW--- the exuberance, the color, the fast moving interpersonal interactions, the joy and the abandon of a true party goer, lost in the happy, wacky party atmosphere of the moment--- all of that must be evoked to us now. Modern party music is an appropriate way to convey it.I have seen so many movies with an historical aspect, showing parties, dancing, social interactions from previous centuries, using music and speech from the time. That has its place, too. But often, what we get is a remote, stilted, unapproachable and unaccessible museumy-looking piece that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to relate to at all.So we, the audience, might be said to be experiencing and feeling the same vibe the actual 1780 crowd felt and experienced. We just had to have a slightly different means of evoking those feelings within us.It is analogous to a movie about ancient Greece, or modern Mongolia, or even France (if one is not French)--- the movie, if intended for an English-speaking audience, will be spoken in English, because that's what the audience speaks. No one would say--- 'How dare the director not have the actors speaking in ancient Babylonian, or ancient Greek, or Mongolian'. No. Equally, we are not offended when English language movies are translated into other languages, so other folks in other countries can enjoy them too. It's simple. It's called communication.Sophia Coppola, and the stellar cast, did a stupendous job of translating what it might have FELT like for the young Dauphine and then queen in the 18th century for us here in the 21st century. Also, do note that the movie was able to accurately get would it also looked like--- the filming was done on location, at the Versailles Palace itself.So--- tremendous and spectacular job all-round!!!

This is a sympathetic biopic of the 18th-century queen of France , retelling of France's iconic but ill-fated queen , Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) . The queen was a teen then as well as the Dauphin who later becomes Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) . The dauphin was only 16 when he met Marie (who was 15) in the opulent and eccentric court at Versailles . From her betrothal and marriage to Louis XVI to her reign as queen at 19 and to the end of her reign as queen . Marie discovers high society, with the help of Duchesse de Polignac (Rose Byrne) , Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis) , her brothers-in-law and her aunts : Victoire (Molly Shannon) and Sophie (Shirley Henderson) . Her foolishness is at its height when she meets a Swedish count, Axel de Fersen (Jamie Dorman) . He helps her see her fecklessness and she matures from a teenage bride to a young woman and eventual a nice queen of France . In the second half of the film, she avoids an annulment, becomes queen and bears children , and ultimately the fall of Versailles .This is a glamorous as well as opulent film of life of 18th century French queen filled with agreeable drama , luxurious gowns , impressive palaces but lacks good pace and historical events ; as this story is not historically accurate . Based on the award-winning biography Marie Antoinette : The Journey by British author, Lady Antonia Fraser , it tells the story of the most misunderstood and abused woman in history, from her birth in Imperial Austria to her later life in France . Kirnsten Dunst captures essence of title character giving an acceptable acting . She shines in this enjoyable , lavish & sadly neglected film . The movie had thousands of costumes and lavish set designs . Some gowns became extremely heavy due to the embroidery, flounces and precious stones used .

At first, she's a Hapsburg teenager isolated in France, living a virgin's life in the household of the Dauphin, a shy solitary man who would like to be a locksmith . She then matures and becomes a responsible ruler . Over the next few years, France continues to subsidize the American Revolution by giving funds and troops to the new nation to help fight the British, despite the enormous expense . Food shortages grow more frequent, as do food riots in Paris. Marie Antoinette's image with her subjects has completely deteriorated at this point. Her luxurious lifestyle and apparent callous indifference to the common people result in unflattering and obscene political cartoons in the local newspapers and earn her the title ""Madame Déficit"" . Later on , the affair of the necklace and the general poverty of France feed revolution ultimately the fall of Versailles . She is condemned to death by beheading but faces death with dignity . The flick also recounting some important facts as when France played a disastrous role in the Seven Years' War, which among other loses , included losing Canadian territory to the much hated British , the French revolution and kings escape until Varennes . In the film appears some historical characters such as Emperor Louis XV (Rip Torn) , Empress Maria Theresa of Austria (Marianne Faithful) : mother of Mary Antoniette and emperor Joseph II of Austria (Danny Huston) and Madame Du Barry (Asia Argento) ; the latter was a wanton, vivacious young woman, catches the eye & the heart of the aging Louis XV and quickly becomes his mistress . After the death of Louis XV in 1774 she retired to a life of luxury in her private château and kept up a schedule of intrigues & dalliances throughout the reign of Louis XVI . With the outbreak of the Revolution, Du Barry escaped to England in 1793 . Foolishly, she returned to France & was arrested on charges of conspiracy against the New Order.

"""This is ridiculous!"" ... ""This, Madame, is Versailles!""","Avant-garde, 'revisionist' history, with writer-director Sofia Coppola proving to be adept at capturing the look of 1768 France whilst eschewing the textbook facts (which is both boon and bane). A dimply woman-child from Austria is brought to France to be married to the King's grandson, soon to rule as Queen of France, although royal titles mean little to her other than providing an ample opportunity to spend money and revel in lavish parties. Kirsten Dunst gives an amazing performance as Antoinette: neither lascivious nor pretentious, she strikes a nimble chord between giggly girlishness and patient, perplexed young adult. Her Marie never pushes her mostly sexless marriage to Louis XVI. Nor does she put him down for being an inattentive lover (their relationship is fascinating, if a bit undernourished as written). Coppola mostly seems interested in displaying the similarities between life in this Royal Court and the wild partying of today's youth; while certainly a good starting point for the film, the inelegant gossip and game-playing, feminine dress-up occasions and catty speculations eventually fall into a somewhat repetitive pattern--we sense Coppola belaboring her points and the obvious irony. There are, of course, different ways Marie Antoinette's story can be brought to the screen, and this is just one filmmaker's vision; however, the picture is succinct is capturing the imposing introduction she faced entering this snobbish monarchy, the numerous obstacles (of the human and etiquette variety) she came across while attempting to get her bearings. The movie is impeccably cast and scored with an intriguing mix of operatic and classical pieces, lovely mood music and New Wave rock songs (the only one of which that errs is Bow Wow Wow's ""Fools Rush In""--which can be forgiven since it is a great song, yet it sticks out as an artifice). Coppola offers up these anachronisms rather nonchalantly, and her artistic eye never gets in the way of her narrative, which is strongest when centering on the human interaction. Not a great film, but quite a good one. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,History
Don't go to the movies to learn about history. Get a book if that's your intention.,"This is not the best period piece ever made, but in saying that, it is far from the worst.

Likewise, Marie Antoinette was not meant to be a biography either. It's a story based loosely on a historical queen. This film is Coppola's personal twist on the character.I like history, but when I want to learn about it, I go to a library, not a movie theatre. Watch this film as a story, not as a piece of history. If you do, you'll find it a lot more enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Where's the rest of her?,"This film is enjoyable enough for what it is: basically a character study of a misunderstood ""villianess"" of history. It makes you wonder who else isn't as bad as people said they were, and who wasn't so good, (Gore Vidal has made a career of this).But two huge things are missing: the French Revolution and Marie Antoinette's greatest moments. The revolution is simply something that happens to Marie Antoinette. It doesn't happen to France. We don't get to see any of the conditions which caused it. It's just represented by a mob at the end. I guess this is absent because Marie herself never saw it: we are seeing just what she saw. But who says a film has to maintain only one perspective? We hear of some of the mean things critics are saying about Marie and how what we now call a propaganda machine was trying to destroy her. But we see nothing of the propagandists and their motivations. We see nothing of their effect on a crowd of starving, frustrated people. Why not jump back and forth to contrast the Queen's life with the state of the nation? And, of course the entire period of her captivity and her attempts to save her family are removed from the story. The death of two children even before the revolution is reduced to one- in one scene. The fate of her youngest son who ""reigned"" after the death of his father is unmentioned.Versalles has a famous Hall of Mirrors. In this film, we are just looking into one of them.

"Visually stunning, surprisingly touching, and Cool with a capital C!","This movie is the very essence of cool. Who in the world could make a two hour film that captures the incredible historical complexities of the French Revolution and the political intrigues of the court of Louis XVI? The reason that ""The Queen"" works so well is that it focuses on that one week in the life of modern day Britain and the court of Elizabeth II. Truths are stated, complexities described, and the audience gets a real insight into the historical times and the personal stories being told. Try to portray years and years of British history, and the subject would be unwieldy and issues skirted over. Sophia Coppola goes for it, describing years and years in the life of an even more complex time. But she doesn't just do a historical survey. Leave that for the detailed books and college courses. For that is what it takes to come to terms with one of the greatest upheavals in history. Instead, she gives us an Impressionistic fable (worthy of being hung in the Louvre). Visually this is one of the most stunning films I have ever seen. I have visited Versailles twice. It was spectacular and beautiful - but this is probably the first time in my experience where a movie is just as good (maybe even better!) than the real thing! Somehow it is MUCH more fun seeing Versailles with the people in their period costumes rather than with hundreds and hundreds of tourists.I predict that Sophia Coppola is going to become one of the great, even legendary film makers. She takes audacious risks. And she takes them successfully! I've seen the movie now twice. The first time, the juxtaposition of modern dialog and expressions with the 18th century milieu, and the modern music with the late Baroque/Classical was jarring. But before I knew it I was totally seduced by the wildness of these juxtapositions. The moment when I became absolutely knocked out by this film, was Marie Antoinette's first walk through the palace, with the endless bowing, and the children with their bouquet's looking like miniature Marie Antoinettes, and that vaguely Oriental music playing in the background. This was an exotic world - fascinating, dreamlike, and seductive.The result of all this craziness and wildness is a movie which is simply unforgettable. I find myself thinking back on those scenes - and I want to revisit this great Impressionistic canvas of a movie. Hedonistic - of course. But Versailles, in all its hedonism lives on, and will always live on.The movie could have become simply a guilty pleasure, or just a cool, hip statement - but it actually goes beyond that - it actually becomes touching, as we feel the ultimate pain of those baffled royals much in the way we were all sorry for the poor rich princess in ""Roman Holiday"", or our own poor rich princess Diana. Total thanks for these surprisingly strong feelings comes from an extraordinary performance by Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette. There isn't a frame of the movie that she appears in, in which her facial expressions don't speak volumes and volumes - expressions of joy, innocence, wisdom, callousness, and ultimately humanity.I give this movie a 10. Some will say the film is quirky, but I also predict that it will live on as one of the most fascinating films of recent years.",10.0,Anonymous,History

It's both an historical movie and a sensory delight.This movie was criticized because of the use of rock music but I think that it was very effective in making this movie not about a specific period in the past but something timeless.

Certainly a divisive movie. I thought it was stunning and touching.,"Odds are you will either greatly enjoy this film, or leave the theater wondering what the hell the point was. I fall firmly into the first category.This movie isn't a glorification of superficiality; it's the story of a woman who was taken as a young girl and forced into a society that had no place for depth or feeling, especially for a woman. Thus, she escapes by throwing herself into frivolity. Sofia Coppola does a fantastic job capturing the meandering, shallow, every-day-is-the-same feeling that must have dominated the aristocracy of the time. No, this movie doesn't concern itself with the politics of the day, nor does it blame Marie for not involving herself. This movie may seem at times to be a sequence of pictures, but the point is that that was what life was like for these people; a constant sequence of material possessions and sweet pastries. And Marie was caught in the middle of it all, without an outlet for her feelings, and unable to know any better.A fantastic movie, and one of the best of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"beautiful scenery and costumes, terrible movie","I had higher hopes for this movie, in that it would at the least have a somewhat captivating story. I did not laugh, cry, or feel any emotion whatsoever throughout this film. The actors and actresses were not bad at all, but rather the screenplay and direction were terrible. It was like a slow starting novel, where you read 30 pages and it's not quite entranced you yet, and you know that just around the corner your patience will pay off. However, in this version, you wait 2 hours for the payoff, and it never delivers. I felt suffocated by the film, and to be quite honest, the credits were a breath of fresh air. I would recommend this film to anyone devoid of emotion, or with an interest in silent films; you may as well turn off the sound. The clash between old and new, with the background music vs. the modern day soundtrack, was odd, to say the least, and the dialogue was worthless.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Great Costumes & Settings.,"I am a history buff when it comes to Marie Antionette, and in fact her story is extraordinarily relevant to today and how lying and manipulative the press can be. I love the setting and the costumes, those are fantastic, but Coppola takes too many liberties and modernizes it and makes her story a fantasy, there is just so much here that did not or likely did not happen. I guarantee you that Marie was not just like a modern teenage girl going clothes shopping, but that's kind of what this film turns her into, and it's weird to say the least. It is well-directed and photographed, but for me, that's about it. The music is really jarring and annoying, and just follows the trend set y ""A Knights Tale"", only that film was just a silly movie, and it was not about a historical figure, but a fictional one. Some of what's in this film is quite true, but much is not I will never understand, why when reality is so entertaining, we think we must change it? Makes no sense honestly.So much we think we know about her is false, and I really despise several things they do with her moral character in this film because if you know anything about her she was considered a woman of good character and pure. Yes, the Louise and her had a hard time consummating their marriage, but once they figured it out, they had many children. There were many rumors around this woman and her character, she was indeed a very opulent sort and she did revel in her wealth with extravagant clothes, but she was not heartless woman either.At the end of the day, if this interest you in Marie, please do your own research, her life was very interesting, and no she did not say ""Let them eat cake"", as we often say she did, it was quite taken out of context by the press, imagine that. Look into the affair of the necklace, and what led up to the French revolution, it's very interesting, to which this movie was not care to explore.",,Anonymous,History
Marie's gorgeous to behold,"Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette takes a vivid look into the lavish life of the controversial queen. Shot on location in Versailles, the film, along with The Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation is stated to be part of a trilogy of the director's movies concerning women feeling alone.Plot has never been Coppola's strong suit, but should a minimalist approach work in a biopic? To an extent, it does. The film does not cover Marie Antoinette's entire life, but just the years she spent in Versailles. The film's main conflict resides in the necessity of Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) to produce an heir with Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). This is a meager plot to sustain a two-hour long movie, but Marie Antoinette really isn't about the trials and tribulations of France and extraneous character arcs, but about Marie's own personal feelings of being an outsider while living in Versailles.The film successfully conveys her yearning for excitement beyond the confines of the royal court. Dunst gives an honest, respectable performance while Schwartzman gives a surprisingly excellent turn playing against type as the bloated, shy Louis XVI. However, the style and visual beauty of the film outweigh any of the performances. Costume designer, Milena Canonero, who has been producing magnificent work since the '70s in films such as Barry Lyndon and Chariots of Fire, creates a visual feast.Coppola's direction is spot on. Her style shines through with the usage of pink, blue tints and modern music. The music, including songs by New Order, The Cure, Bow Wow Wow and The Strokes, helps a historical film connect with a contemporary audience. By using modern music, one could actually feel the rush Marie felt when sneaking out to a masquerade party. Another device utilized by Coppola was having the actors speak in their own accents, instead of struggling to sound French or Austrian. Where Coppola missed the mark, however, was in the writing. Her decision to sidestep the ultimate fate of Marie Antoinette could have been a great idea, but the ending of the film felt abrupt and incomplete. Coming straight off an Oscar win for her brilliant previous script, Lost in Translation, Coppola's screenplay for Marie Antoinette is disappointing.Even without a perfect script, Coppola finds ways to create character and story without an utterance of dialogue. The simple switch of a portrait shows the death of a child, and the queen becomes aware of her fall in popularity when she applauds at an opera, but no one else joins in. Marie Antoinette had the possibility of being an outstanding film if it had been a reel shorter, but it was still a pleasure to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This movie really stayed with me...,"The whole time I was watching Sofia Coppola's take on the famously ill-fated Queen of France I felt like I was missing something. This came close to hampering my enjoyment of the film, but I must admit that it was this sensation that has caused my mind to linger over the aims and intentions of the film long after I left the screening. Coppola has taken a decidedly idiosyncratic stance on Marie Antoinette's years as a monarch at Versailles, and her youthful, teen-aged approach to her subject goes quite some way to reclaiming a much-maligned character.Kirsten Dunst is transfixing as Marie Antoinette, and the film is relentlessly focused on her performance; mirroring the intense focus of the French Aristocracy on their new monarch. There are some great supporting performances (Rip Torn and Asia Argento amuse as the old King and his common lover) and some not-so-great (Jason Schwartzman - an actor I love - is somewhat miscast as the shyly impotent Louis XVI) but what is important is that the support remains as support, never distracting from Dunst's stellar performance.Filmed on location at Versailles, the film has a rivetingly lavish style overflowing in elegance, but never more beautiful than in the sequence where the Queen sets up her own self- consciously romantic idyll in the form of a rustic village in the grounds of the palace. One of the key criticisms levelled at the historical Marie Antoinette is her extravagant spending in the face of the poverty of the French People and the debt of the monarchy itself. This is the one accusation that it is hardest to answer in defence of Marie Antoinette, and yet in displaying the lush surroundings of Versailles in such minutely sublime detail, Coppola makes it obvious how hard it must have been for a girl of such a young age to align in her mind the warnings of the financial state of her country given her by her husband and ministers with the supremely extravagant lifestyle led by all at court.Sofia Coppola brings to the story of Marie Antoinette a vibrancy that is rarely seen in period dramas, and her decision to focus solely on the years at Versailles and not dwell on the path well travelled by dragging on to the Queen's well-documented fate will leave you pondering the social justice meted out to her and her family by the French Revolution.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Great story told in an incongruous way,"I liked this one because of the theme it tries to dissect. Marie Antoinette was a really controversial figure of the French and European history, remembered mostly as ""the hated woman from Austria"".I was glad that someone actually tried to pry this surface, to uncover the motivations, and reasons behind her actions.The most telling part was the infamous, alleged ""eat then brioche"" quote, which uncovers the deeper depths of the politics, intrigue, disparaging measures and scapegoat finding which was so much a part of the revolution, as the anger and desperation of the lower classes.The theme of the movie served as a perfect base for an excellent history movie. However, it's tone makes it somewhat hard to take seriously - even if I know the target audience was the teenage class. Pity.Still, if it is aired on TV, or your child learns about this period in history class, give it a chance.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A nice entertaining film, even though the Opera Garnier scenery is not historically accurate. But nicely conducted and well thought on the whole.

Sophia's misstep,"An awkward young girl picks up a camera and captures something extraordinary that stirs the imagination of many and stands in defiance of big budget film-making. Francis Ford Coppola envisioned this future event of cinema as counterpoint to his notoriously traumatic experience making 'Apocalypse Now'. In a strange twist of fate it would be his daughter, Sophia, who fulfills the prophecy. Her second film, 'Lost in Translation', was a note-perfect and affecting work filmed guerrilla-style on the streets of Tokyo. This set the benchmark high for Sophia and perhaps out of a desire to push herself to her creative limits she has since chose to follow-up this minimalist success with something from the other end of the spectrum altogether, a full-on costume drama (in the opulent setting of the Palace of Versailles no less), with her latest feature, 'Marie Antoinette'. The question arises whether she can repeat the success that materialized in her low-budget exercise on this grander scale? In more ways then one 'Marie Antoinette' feels like an act of hubris, an attempt by Sophia to tame the beast of big budget film-making with the lessons learned from her past guerrilla experience that never quite succeeds. Here the historical drama is reinvented, as post-modern flourishes are used to modernize historical events while still partially adhering to some procedural accuracy in the depiction of the court of King Louis XVI, the old and the new sitting side by side in a realm of the impossible made possible by our appreciation of the universal themes they explore. The story of Marie Antoinette is not nearly as interesting as the contemplation of excess that she symbolizes, and Sophia understands this as she gives two-thirds of the film over to the voyeuristic impulse of merely watching the empty riches of aristocracy like a fly on the wall undeterred by narrative constraints. The same convincing conversations that filled the Tokyo clubs in 'Lost in Translation' now fill the halls of Versailles, full of indifference to plot-point storytelling. This two-thirds of the film is a lyrical about-face to the genre, and unfortunately stands out as a blemish due to the remaining third of the film which goes on supposing the tone of historical drama. Perhaps as a feeble attempt to justify the budget and the stature of the subject matter, Sophia half-heartedly fills in the historical context of the story with weakly arranged tangents of drama which by their very presence diminish all that surrounds it, making what could have been a bold revision of our perception of history into a creaky history lesson with frills.The fault I find with the film is not its radical departure from the genre but rather its lack of conviction. A better approach would have been to focus entirely on the trivial in the court of Versailles with little mention of the world outside of it, and follow this Austrian girl's trajectory into a world of great opulence that would titillate our own sense of materialism and draw us into the story and give us a place to contemplate our superficial tendencies. Certainly this was one motivation for the work, but it gets lost in half-measures, unsure of itself, and tries desperately to hold some vestige of historical biography into the narrative, but this hubris becomes amplified by the world of make-believe Sophia has fitted her story into; the historical talking-points sound like the misplaced voices of adults in the realm of a child's make-believe and have the same sort of nonsensical function.Part of the problem is the casting, with the choice of comedic actors like Steve Coogan, Rip Torn, and Molly Shannon to play figures in the court of Versailles it becomes problematic when Sophie decides to shift gears and play the story as if it were historical drama when in fact it is pantomime. Similarly Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzmann as the sovereigns Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI could only exist in a sort of hyper-reality fantasy that Sophie has concocted, and when she gives them historical talking-points without the knowing wink it shatters the illusion and forces us to think of the characters as caricatures of history rather than figures worthy of contemplation. Only Judy Davis seems to know her part in the pantomime and plays it up with relish, while everyone else struggles with the disjointed tone Sophia has set.Despite the riches of visual delight in each frame of this film I was never entirely drawn into the story, I always felt outside of it looking in. The costumes, the music, the make-up, the setting, are of course immensely impressive and there is truly a cinematic vision at the heart of the work to rival any of the greats, however it lacks direction. I admire what Sophia tries to do, and I am deeply fond of her aesthetic tastes but I feel with this film she has made a serious misstep and the film sort of falls apart in the editing process, unsure of where it is supposed to go. Maybe there was some hesitation to follow through on the contemplative route due to the upped ante of filming at Versailles and the specter of big budget film-making. Maybe she lost her nerve. It is really unfortunate, because I do think Sophia represents something important in modern cinema, sort of what Tarrantino did in the nineties, a sort of indie cred that she earned with 'Lost in Translation'. There is something about her, her choice of music, her guerrilla ethos, I don't know, something about her films reminds me of the blogosphere, and the variety of grass root enterprises into art that it has spawned. Maybe I am just enamored with the myth of that awkward young girl picking up a camera and making great art.Grade: C+ P.S. I am hoping it was just at my screening but I was wondering if anyone else noticed the film to be out of focus and slightly bluish throughout?",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Marie Antoinette, Bobby-Soxer","Although the nominal star is Kirsten Dunst, the real stars of this 40 million dollar exercise are the Art Directors Anne Seibel and Pierre du Boisberranger, Set Decorator Veronique Melery and Costume Designer Milena Canonero. Everything else is subordinated to their craftsmanship. But two hours of opulence is small potatoes to bring us to the capital moment, the conclusion to a rather common life, as perhaps longed for by contemporary audiences as by French ones in 1792. We may consult Isabel Jewell in ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (1935) if drama is what we're seeking.

Awful,"Truly one of the worst films ever made. The cast looks hopeful but for this film they use the Sequoia National Park method of acting. Frenchmen with American accents, Carry On French accents. In all fairness some of the accents are spot on. French and German to be precise. The problem is the French speak with German accents and the Austrians speak with French accents. Steve Coogan can't get the English accent right and he's English. When the acting doesn't grate your nerves the music does.

artistry orgasm,"Marie Antoinette is simply stunning, stunning, stunning! It doesn't have a lot to tell, and facts-wise, you'd be better off reading the biography. But this movie is great as it delights the senses. I am usually very detached from the environment, but this piece of Sofia Coppola's jolted my senses. In a good way. The decor, the costumes (courtesy of Milena Cananero, the same lady who dressed up the cast of Life Aquatic), and the brilliant soundtrack (chosen specially by Sofia herself I'm pretty sure - the girl has good taste) and the beautiful cinematography (long gaze of the palace, close-up shots of big fat colorful pastries on china's, pretty cards, wine overflowing glasses, among others) all contribute to this artistic masterpiece. Not too mention the amazing acting by Kirsten Dunst. She doesn't explode dramatically like Jolie or act in the stoic way like Johansson, but rather she breathes life into her acting in little subtle moves & expressions, and this to me, is a work of genius.

The Queen of Versailles,"The real Marie Antoinette, like Cleopatra or Joan of Arc (or for that matter Elizabeth II and Margaret Thatcher) never remotely resembles the original historical individual when portrayed onscreen; and pert little modern miss Kirsten Durnst is no more like the woman bitterly described by the French peasantry as ""the Austrian Woman"" than Norma Shearer was nearly seven decades earlier.Actually described in the film as ""looking like a piece of cake"" and, like the rest of this sumptuous production, looking good enough to eat, watching her sashay about Versailles in big hair and the pastal shades of her Oscar-winning wardrobe by Milena Canonero is agreeable enough at first.

"Great movie,","Those who are upset about historical inaccuracies regarding this movie should probably stop trying to make our pasts out to be something sacred. Human history is filled with lots of varying accounts of the same stories--In Plato's day, the stories of heroes were reworked in several ways to produce the desired moral. And do you think King Cymbeline of Shakespeare's play really banished a guy named Posthumus to a Renaissance-based Italy? History is ours to cannibalize, and I say anyone non-living is fair game, because at that point they are the equivalent of a folk tale--they have some place in the collective conscience, but unless you knew them personally, what's the difference? Sofia wanted Marie to tell us something about youth, womanhood, isolation and expectations and did so admirably. Add to that a killer soundtrack, lovely costumes, a little bit of humor, and magnificent natural photography, and I say it's a grade-A movie.It's not a documentary, doesn't try to be one. I think Sofia has perfectly characterized how from Marie's perspective, her indulgence was a good way to ignore the absurd situation she was put into, but at the same time demonstrates how this behavior, in a real, historical type sense, pretty much helped to destroy the country in it's own little way. Cute little bit of duality there. Great flick, in other words.Not the best of the year, looking back, but still a strong picture. Maybe in my top fifteen.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Hollow...but gorgeous!,"The story of Marie Antoinette is a well documented one.We know that she ascended the throne of France as a very young teenager,led a luxurious but vacuous life as empress,and was eventually a victim of the French revolution.Director Sofia Coppola presents this rich - but ultimately empty - existence in her absolutely gorgeously mounted film.The problem lies in the fact that she takes too long to relate this tale.The ennui of life at the French palaces was probably all too real,but to be shown on film,it needs to be presented in an entertaining manner.It is here that Coppola fails.The film appears to be merely a montage of sequences depicting the repetitiveness and weariness of life in the royal halls and galleries of the French monarchy.While Kirsten Dunst in the eponymous role and Jason Schwartzman as her husband,King Louis XVI,are undoubtedly good,the film often gets cumbersome.On the flip side,however,is the stunning location filming,the remarkable art-direction and the absolutely sumptuous costume-design.In fact,I will have to concede that this is perhaps the best looking film I have ever seen! The much debated modern musical score does jar occasionally but is certainly not as much of a hindrance as I had anticipated it to be.Coppola is certainly a thinking director who seems to have inherited her legendary father's genes,but I really hope she picks scripts with a little more meat on them.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Sofia Coppola Does It Again,"It's probably me but I find it hard to believe that anyone would take Sofia Coppola seriously as a film maker if it weren't for her father. I'm not sure what the premise is here (a modern teenager transplanted into the French Court in the 18th Century?). Though the raucous contemporary music is clearly intentional, what does it add to the story? Kirsten Dunst isn't exactly miscast as Marie Antoinette; she is cast without observable rhyme or reason opposite Jason Schwartzman who likewise is dropped into his role as the Dauphin/King from a different planet. What is apparently intended as droll or funny is simply boring. The burlesque of court manners is as overdone as a piece of steak left too long on the broiler. There is absolutely no tension in the film as the French revolution begins and encroaches on the Palace and the life within it. Are we supposed to care about these people?

Beautiful,"Sofia never seems to amaze me. I never once doubted that this film would be beautiful. I mean, after all, Sofia did direct it. I have been a huge Sofia fan for quite awhile, and I had been waiting for this film it seems like forever. I have read numerous amounts of reviews all calling this film ""superficial"", ""boring"", and ""only pleasing to the eye."" Well, if you think this, I guess it just didn't strike the right chord like it did with me.I'm not going to repeat what has been said 100 times, about the costumes being beautiful, etc etc. Yes, they were beautiful, and Sofia really knows how to set a mood just by colors. There was something very beautiful and very sad about this film, seeing Marie spending her teenage years in Versailles and then at the ending, leaving the one place we spent the whole film. This movie is very poetic and lyrical, most people will dislike it. It isn't a straight shooting history film, instead, it has charm and a certain magic to it. The modern music was a fantastic idea, especially in scenes where Marie can't stop thinking about her lover, and The Strokes start playing. Or when Marie and her friends stay up to watch the sun rise while my favorite New Order song was playing.This is definitely not a film for your average film viewer. There is beauty in the silence. Looking back on the film, I can't remember Marie talking a lot, but I can remember her speaking through her actions or eye contact.Fantastic, wonderful, and dream like.

A Royal Flush (of Embarrassments),"There is much that is commendable in this film. For starters, I should mention Kirsten Dunst, who delivers an inspired performance in the role of the newly betrothed Dauphine and eventual Queen of France. The costumes, the scenes at Versailles, the attention paid to the strict protocol observed at every significant interval in the lives of the royals, all of these things help buoy this film above sheer mediocrity. The very best moment of the film occurs when the Dauphine, in a political move, deigns to speak to Mme. du Barry, the Louis XV's upstart, simpering harlot. It is a beautifully delivered, capital moment for Miss Dunst. But there are major problems with this film, as well. I found the American accents jarring and risible, for example. While fake French or Austrian accents might not have been the best solution, they certainly would have had the advantage of preventing actors who play characters of so weighty a history from sounding like they've just been shopping at the mall. I thought the soundtrack, a hodge-podge of mediocre pop music that no one will be listening to for very long, an ill-conceived idea that speaks more to Miss Coppola's (perhaps imperious) determination to do things her way than to the making of choices that best befit a period piece. Finally, the second half of the film is largely devoted to Marie Antoinette's decline into hedonism. We are made witness to a frolicking slapdash of parties and endless champagne and pastoral make-believe in muslin and gauze, to which we become mere spectators and during which we lose our connection to the Queen. Viewers interested in learning more about Marie Antoinette's sartorial excesses should read Caroline Weber's ""Queen of Fashion: What Marie Antoinette Wore to the Revolution.""",6.0,Anonymous,History
Marie Antoinette (2006) -- Review,"Usually, I can watch a movie to the end. But in the case of Marie Antoinette, I failed miserably in the attempt. If ""Marie Antoinette"" is not the dullest movie in existence, then the directors who have come up with worse should be utterly ashamed of themselves.I don't care if a movie, like Marie Antoinette, is not historically accurate. What I do care about is when it does not give us anything of interest to hang on to. Kirsten Dunst's Marie Antoinette comes across as a ditsy teenager, which may entertain some people, but frankly I met so many ditsy teenage girls in my time that I can do without seeing a film about one. Jason Schwartzmann makes a terrible Louis XVI, because all we see is a clueless king. The real Louis XVI was more interesting and complex than the one in the film. He was a product of his own age. He tried to solve the financial crises of his own reign by appointing one minister after the other. But these ministers failed, because they faced outdated Feudal structures, like the provincial parlements and the office-holders, which thwarted any attempt to reform the tax system; reforms that could have generated more revenue and helped solve the financial crises. Rip Torn, who is best doing comic roles, is miscast as Louis XV, a king who in reality is far more complex and far more interesting than Sophia Coppola makes him out to be.But unfortunately the problems don't end there. The different accents (which results from the film director picking an all-star cast and allowing them to speak in their own accents) clash. The excerpts with rock n'roll make the film an awkward experience. It is almost as though film director Sophia Coppola (who also wrote the screenplay) wanted to create a period piece and a contemporary piece at the same time. But since the 18th century was obviously a very different from the 21st century, the result is a jumbled film with fits and starts. What Ms. Coppola should have done was to make 18th century France understandable to her audience -- just as her father Francis Ford Coppola made the secret underworld of the Mafia understandable to his viewers. But that takes a special talent, which I am not sure Ms. Coppola has.It does not help that the film lacks a real plot. First, we wonder whether the wedding between Marie and Louis XVI will succeed -- we wonder, but we don't care, because neither character establishes a connection with us. After the answer to that question is given, we see a disjointed plot with gambling scenes, Marie playing with her children and Louis XVI doing some state business. Finally, the French Revolution sends everything crashing down. But again who cares? The reason why the plot does not work is not simply because it is disjointed and we do not care about the characters, but rather because the events that come to pass on film are not given any meaning. Ms. Coppola could solve that problem in many ways. Perhaps, she could even portray France as it was in the 18th century. A France locked into the Feudal age, in spite of the monarch's pretensions for being absolute. A France that had a hodge-podge of different laws for different provinces and even different towns, resulting in a legal system that was so unequal, so confusing and so unfair that the revolutionaries made a single law code for the whole of France one of their key demands. But these issues are not discussed. Louis XVI's approach to these problems was glossed over. And we do not really understand why the idyllic world at Versailles suddenly came crashing down.Obviously a lot of money was spent on the sets and costumes, but it seems to be such a waste considering what Sophia Coppola finally came up with. I rarely bring environmental issues into a movie review. But if you are going to pollute the planet and wreck the delicate balance that exists between human beings and nature, then at least don't come up with trash like Marie Antoinette. Indeed if Hollywood did not make bad films, they would be doing the environment a big favor.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Ennui Antoinette,"I suppose there is something to be said about a movie that I guess intends to show you boredom (and loneliness), but... wow is it boring to watch. I think the story (much like Lost in Translation) is terribly redundant (and in the case of Marie Antoinette, episodic). There is almost no characterization here other than Marie - and I am being polite. Most of her scenes show her alone and inactive (several times in fact, to the point you want to shout at the screen, ""okay I get it."") We get no sense of what Louis's problem really is other than he is a bit shy. We also get absolutely no sense of what is really happening outside the gates of Versailles; which is a valid point for what I believe is Ms. Coppola's intention. More frustrating is that almost none of the supporting characters have story lines that grow toward anything. Nothing in the story builds - except your frustration.",,Anonymous,History
the music?,"In general a nice flick. It gives a balanced view of the royal situation before the french revolution and the scenery and clothing is excellent. The acting is so so, but i don't know if that was because of the way Coppola wanted to present the situation or because she just didn't wanted to deepen the characters whatsoever. Well basically, if it stayed like this it was an OK movie. But the music! WHo came up with the idea to mix classical music and rock?? Worst thing to do ever, even if it was just a tryout. I mean the editor must have had the same feeling that sometimes the modern music did absolutely not contributed to the scene or the movie as a whole. Just so you know before you watch the movie, do not let the music bother you, it's an OK flick to watch overall.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Better than I expected,"Although this movie tries to go through 19 years in the lives of Louix XVI and Marie Antoinette (from their wedding in 1770 to their departure of Versailles in 1789) in a rather fast pace, I was quite surprised that it does attempt to dismiss at least some of the often repeated image of Marie Antoinette as an empty-headed, frivolous and unfaithful queen. The hostility she met when she first arrived in Versailles and which would culminate in pamphlets accusing her of the most ridiculous things are hinted at, though they could and should have been elaborated a bit more. As with most movies based on some historic event or character, there are bound to be loads of inaccuracies. Two that I did not find mentioned in the ""Goofs"" section are: - Marie Antoinette was born on November 2nd 1755. Louis XV passed away in May 1774, when Marie Antoinette was 18 and a half, going on 19; yet in the movie, she is congratulated for her 18th birthday after Louis XV's death. - One would expect a sunrise on November 3rd in 1774 to be quite chilly of not very cold; not the type of weather where one would sit in the grass next to a pond to watch a sunrise. But all in all, despite the fast pace and lack of some details, despite the elaboration of the often suggested but never proved affair between Marie Antoinette and count Fersen, this movie did better than I expected. Perhaps the great performances and of course the wonderful surroundings and costumes have helped my appreciation.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Sofia Coppola's Independent Style,"The 2006 version of ""Marie Antoinette"" is one of the most beautiful movies to watch that has been put on screen in quite some time. But I say that in reference to the costumes, set design, and art direction. The term 'eye candy' that has been used by some of the critics and moviegoers alike is very appropriate for this film. Worldwide, there seems to be an even split among those who loved the film and those who loathed it.I saw the film for what it was: a director's independent and different vision of a real-life character whose story everyone already knows. We know what the ending for the real Marie Antoinette was. I believe that Sofia Coppola should be highly complimented for her style in telling this version of the Archduchess of Austria & Queen of France.That's not to say this film is without its problems. Though a big deal was made of Coppola's use of rock music during some scenes, it wasn't as 'horrible' as the French critics made it out to be. As a independent director myself, it is my belief that Coppola could have done a better job matching the music with the scenes with which she used them. The timing choices were a little jarring. And there aren't enough technical reasons in the world to excuse some of the obvious technical 'oversights'. I understand why half the people who saw this film had a problem with it - which is the lack of this film being story driven. The 1938 version of ""Marie Antoinette"" (starring the great Norma Shearer and Tyrone Power) is much more story-driven. If I had directed this movie, I probably would have gone deeper in the mind of Kirsten Dunst's 'Marie Antoinette'. There could have been more done visually to explain why the people of France hated Marie Antoinette in the end.Having said that, I would give my right arm to be able to have access to Versailles in France. Sofia Coppola helped make the cinematography lush and gorgeous by agreeing to the pastel colors used for costumes and sets. The real 'behind-the-scenes' stars are Costume Designer Milena Canonero and Set Decorator Veronique Melery - each deserving of an Oscar nomination, at the very least.Kirsten Dunst did well as 'Marie Antoinette'. Marianne Fathfull will probably never get the recognition she deserves for her performance as the Austrian Empress, Maria Theresa. Though her scenes were short, she played the imperial Austrian icon perfectly.I liked ""Marie Antoinette"", and tend to side with critics like Roger Ebert of his assessment of the film. But as historical films go, this movie is not without its critics (some of it very justified). But I praise Sofia Coppola for being courageous enough to try something different.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Some different teenage angst! Touching and original.,"Original, touching and surprisingly humorous account of the famed and ill-fated young Queen of France; definitely with some new touches, such as a rock-pop soundtrack... Out of place? Wrong way to do it? Well, if director Sofia Coppola hadn't made it this way, she probably would've been accused of yet another stale period & costume- piece with nothing new added. Well, this IS new! And needless to say, it's visually gorgeous and nicely acted.I must admit that at first, I was annoyed by the limited narrative perspective of her life. I felt trapped. Then it hit me: the claustrophobic feel is due to the fact that it has to be. This is Antoinettes POV all along- Versailles is a prison, set as a farce of etiquette codes, and her marriage is a lifetime sentence, that says: get pregnant or be gone!

Royalty gone wild,"Having had the privilege of seeing Versailles first hand, I was expecting a sumptuous feast and was not disappointed. Winning an Oscar for costumes, I cannot understand why it was not also a winner for art direction and makeup, but it did go up against Pan's Labyrinth.Written and directed by Sofia Coppola, it was an ambitious undertaking, and certainly to be criticized by historical purists, who think all movies should be documentaries if they dabble with facts. Just as book lovers expect all movies to be faithful renditions of their beloved tomes.I am sure Coppola played loose with the facts, but presented an engaging story of two young royals that were not prepared to lead. Whether spending time hunting or gambling, they were more interested in the pursuit of fun than the problems of France. At least they spent some of that money helping the American rebels throw off the English.Besides Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette, I certainly enjoyed Rip Torn as a randy Loius XV, who had a torrid affair with the lovely Comtesse du Barry (Asia Argento).",7.0,Anonymous,History

Bathos on top of pathos combined with terrible rock. poor Kirsten Dunst had to go into rehab after this... I totally sympathize.What an appalling waste of money and effort.You have to have flunked 3rd grade to get to the end of this.But of course the gang that control entertainment showered it with awards!

Many people will not appreciate this film; it take some patience and an open mind,"I really liked this movie. It was a bit long, and I can certainly see how some would be bored by it, but it flew by for me and I thought it was very entertaining. I've read many comments about the movie saying that it's historically inaccurate and that we hardly see any of the ""politics"" of the era, but obviously this film is simply not about those things. We are seeing the world through Marie's eyes, the sheltered life that knows nothing of poverty or reality. We get to experience the decadence of her lavish lifestyle and see the beauty of her surroundings. I loved the mix of classical music and modern music, it made the film seem more youthful and fun; Marie is, after all, a teenager in most of the film. The acting is wonderful. The scenery and costumes are breathtaking. If you are going to see this movie, I think it's best to go into it with an open mind. Forget everything you know about Marie Antoinette and try to put yourself in her shoes. Just experience the film!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting insight on Antoinette ...,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie; something about watching conspicuous consumption and learning some history seemed intriguing. Although it was not exactly what I was expecting, it was a worthwhile experience.Basically, the movie is about the early life of Marie Antoinette. It starts with her arrival in France and mostly concentrates on the next several years in her life.On the plus side, the movie provides an interesting perspective on the emotional challenges faced by Antoinette. It also nicely depicts what it may have been like for her to become part of French royalty. I did not realize that there may have been a fair amount culture shock in this transition. Apparently, she had to essentially give up her Viennese heritage.On the minus side, her life is put into very little context with regards to historical events. This was probably intentional, but it makes the passage of time a bit confusing. For the most part, I couldn't tell how far apart events were because she looked the same and there was little reference to the outside world. Furthermore, I never really 'felt' the extreme conspicuousness referred to in the trailer for the film. It was there, but it didn't have the strong presence the previews seems to imply.If you're looking for a biographical retrospective on Marie Antoinette, you won't satisfied with the movie. However, if you want to gain some insight into why Antoinette may have acted as lavishly as she did, then you'll benefit from watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Every bit as shallow and superficial as its protagonist, Marie Antoinette is like a great big chocolate cake: Lacking nutrition, but oooh so gorgeous!","Don't just ""Let them eat cake"", let them bathe in it, with diamond bracelets all aglow, amidst a flowery bed of sumptuous 18th Century dresses and gorgeous green countryside. Perhaps this would be the message in Sofia Coppola's latest, and most ambitious, project to date, had it even the glimmer of true substance, amid the confectionery of chocolate and delightful outfits. Kirsten Dunst is Marie Antoinette, the Austrian aristocrat who is sent to France to wed the King's son Louis XVI (Schwartzman). Only fourteen, she is thrust into an all too unfamiliar technique of behaving like a royal, and living in the expectations of a nation.Whilst Coppola has not made a film devoid of emotional depth, the only true reason to enjoy this period epic is to engulf oneself into the self-indulgence of our heroine. She eats, sleeps, parties and buys her way to death, and although we are meant to believe the modern perspective of Marie Antoinette being misunderstood, and exaggerated in terms of self-consumption, the film is too superficial to effect you emotionally. Only briefly do we see Marie express herself beyond stuffing her face with poultry and champagne. But when a film looks as great as this does, are we to care that it lacks depth? Only the GCSE History students need to worry.Whilst the cast possesses competent performances from its leads, the standout acting belongs to Asia Argento, as a former French Harlot, now the royal plaything of Louis XV (Torn), and Rose Byrne, as the wine guzzling Duchesse de Polignac, socialite and friend of Marie. But even they can't compete with the film's real star  the delicious milieu. Marie Antoinette is a sumptuous delight to look at. Forget the story or the characters  the array of pale-faced aristocrats, in delightful corsets, indulging themselves with cakes, confectionery, meat and wine is done with such irresistible style that it almost makes up for the protracted running time. Marie Antoinette is not exactly food for thought, but dresses itself gorgeously enough to leave you satisfied. And it has a rock soundtrack to boot.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I prefer the 1938 version,"The praise lavished on this film by some critics mystifies me. There is no reason (other than enriching a studio's coffers) to do a new version of a well-known historic episode unless the new version adds something new and previously unknown. This film decidedly does not. It obviously attempts to attract a younger audience with its annoying use of rock music on the soundtrack and its inclusion of a pair of modern sneakers amid a pile of period shoes. Things like this worked for Baz Luhrmann in ""Moulin Rouge,"" but they don't work here. The 1938 film of the same name is much better, if only because the great Robert Morley is perfectly cast as Louis XVI, capturing perfectly his dunciness and overall arrested development. Here that part is woodenly played by a clueless Jason Schwartzman, looking like a young Stanley Tucci. Altogether, this film is a bore and a wasted effort. Oh well, at least I enjoyed looking at brief glimpses of Kirsten's bare butt (if it was really hers and not that of a body double).",7.0,Anonymous,History
Marie Antoinette vs Marie Antoinette,"Last evening I had the pleasure of watching the original Marie Antoinette from the 1930's, and today I watched the new (not improved) Marie Antoinette at the theater.The good:(2006) Costumes! Sets! It just doesn't get any better than the costumes and sets on this new Marie Antoinette movie. Hair styles were wonderful. Much of the movie appears to be filmed at Versailles and the gardens.The bad: (2006) Poor casting. I was disappointed to see Louis XVI with a five o'clock shadow at the age of 15. Both Marie and Louis did not portray the parts of a 14 and 15 year old very well. They both looked much to old. Parts of the movie were to drawn out and let my mind wonder away from the film.I anticipated not liking the music score in this new movie but was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked it and that it did not take anything away from the film.After watching both the old and the new Marie Antoinette, I prefer the older version much more, although the story line is almost identical. I think the older version is more a classic and is beautifully done.",7.0,Anonymous,History

That was the whole story behind M.A... she had no grasp of what she was doing, what she was part of. The images, and colors, clothes, even the food--it's all beautiful. Versailles is amazing in person, but this puts it in new light. It's difficult to grasp what life was like then from the little audio devices you get when visiting the palace, and this really put it in place. I love the reflection on her life, and I loved seeing her in a new light, as opposed to being an inconsiderate woman, being a young girl, with no sense of reality, or anything.

French Court a la Hollywood,"Sofia Coppola has produced another interesting and enjoyable offering, though her best effort for me remains ""Lost in Translation"" Marie-Antoinette displays her usual masterly creation of atmosphere--a world so artificial it is difficult to be convinced of its reality. Yet don't we see such a reality every day around us, in Hollywood? In the end I think Coppola suggests that the public's image of Marie Antoinette and the disjunction between their image of her and the real person is just as great as that of actors who achieve fame in Hollywood and become grist for the rumour mill.If you like movies with lots of action, Coppola is not the director for you. If you're drawn to thoughtful movies that rely more on the creation of atmosphere and development of character, you will enjoy this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
An original aesthetic - hats off to Coppola!,"If we believe the feminist viewpoint of one of Alan Bennett's characters (from The History Boys), history is the story of men's inadequate responses told from the point of view of other men. So how would a woman's woman auteur, Sofia Coppola, approach a film about one of the most vibrant and controversial of women in French history? Not in a way that is to everyone's liking, that's for sure.Austrian Marie Antoinette was married off to Louis XVI of France, in part to ratify a treaty between the two countries. She lived with him until the Revolution did away with both of them. There is more than enough tabloid character, scandal and turning-points-in-history in her life to make a colourful epic, or sufficient salaciousness for a hearty romp; and while both of these might be stock-in-trade justifiable, the initial scenes suggest we are in for nothing of the sort.Bright pink opening credits catapult us into 1768 Austria with an intrusive girliness reminiscent of a retro pop-video. They soon give way to nice pastels (even the horses gallop through woods in soft focus) and a feminine intellectual assertiveness that somehow says this will be no re-telling of a man's take on history. The facts, while not exactly misrepresented, are definitely going to be subordinate to the artist's vision.For the talented Kirsten Dunst, it is the most challenging role of her career to date. As the leading actress she delivers Sofia Coppola's interiorised vision with charisma and remarkable aplomb. We see her taken into a foreign world and completely isolated (everything, her last shred of clothing and even her dog is taken from her, so that she has only that which is 'completely French'). We see her suffer the glare of publicity even around her marriage bed, and witness the guilt she feels at not becoming pregnant soon enough. We see her searching inside for something to cling to while surrounded vast opulence; and the requisite public persona can admit no unhappiness. British audiences may even see a reminder of Princess Diana, but the significant achievement is perhaps how we inevitably view the possibility of any woman-living-in-a-man's-world feeling for her condition and, through Antoinette's eyes, we also witness history enacted around her in a way almost distanced from her inner turmoil. Antoinette is envenomed at the openness with which a prostitute is allowed to flirt in court; yet at times she feels she herself is little more than a 'piece of meat' traded for politics and progeny. This queen-elect is bereft of privacy and not allowed to be herself, on top of which she doesn't even have a whore's tricks-of-the-trade to get her inexperienced man making babies inside her.Marie Antoinette soon withdraws to the countryside, getting in touch with nature, her artistic sensibilities, and the rearing of a child. This second phase of the movie allows a warmth and simple intimacy in the human condition that was lacking at the Palace of Versailles.Her young husband, meanwhile, continues his wargames, lending soldiers to the American Revolution even though the French peasants are starving. Through Dunst's humility before the things which her character doesn't understand, we glimpse both the true magnificence of the pre-revolution French court and the seeds of its destruction.With unparalleled access to the Palace of Versailles, Coppola has spared little to convey an authentic artistic vision; but it is an aesthetic which owes more to Warhol than Rembrandt. Pop art is employed almost throughout; from a masked ball overlaid with Siouxie and the Banshee's 'Hong Kong Garden' (""an old custom to sell your daughter""), to posters overlaid with slogans vilifying her supposed excesses; or the swift reintroduction of paintings from which successive infants disappear to indicate early deaths. There is no attempt to disguise accents  why bother? - Coppola's point goes beyond undemanding historical verisimilitude. At one point, Antoinette's outer happiness becomes real and she sweeps the crowd along, breaking with tradition to applaud an opera. In another scene, we see her on a balcony alone, the darkness of the room at her back. The camera pans back to show the vastness of the beautiful Palace around her, empty of all other signs of life. Here, she is like a captured bird in an over-gilded cage.No-one does rich-little-misunderstood-girl quite like Coppola . . .Building through two first acts of eye-candy superficiality, the coda comes as a slap in the face. Gone are pop music and Mozart - say hello, stark reality. It is not too difficult to find analogies to modern top-heavy nations, whether they be Iran or the USA. How many people have to starve before the boys at the top stop playing war and self-satisfaction? Is the vision of the artist (or even of a child and its mother) really a less viable view of the world? Marie Antoinette can be seen as a cutting feminist diatribe or simply the work of a director who views the universe, the established facts from which she culls only what she deems appropriate for the opus, and even the feelings of the nation in question, as nothing more than her artist's palette. There is a similarity to De Palma's Black Dahlia that thumbs its nose at what an audience expects and simply ploughs on with the ingenious lighting and idiosyncratic revelations; but Coppola's quirky, sugary and sympathetic tone may well upset traditionalists. Some people may just find it flippant. A film that relegates the French Revolution, incarceration and guillotines in favour of subtle emotional resonances and gender imbalances will make a lot of people ask if Sofia Coppola has simply missed the plot. But for someone who pits herself against a male-orientated view of the world, she acquits herself quite admirably - and not just with girlish charm. Marie Antoinette goes beyond its individual example in French history: it is the hope of a nation, hidden in that which is most despised.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Strongly visual and dramatic piece of cake (historical spoilers, folks)","Kirsten Dunst is a lovable Marie Antoinette. Her face expression when they take away her dog will set the tone for her ways throughout this film by Sofia Coppola. This is a girls' candy world, and as those sort of worlds are, it is not without sadness and despair. I totally agree with Roger Ebert on this one (I do most of the times): the fact that we know her true fate is only the fatal frame to this bloodless visual feast. Marie is surrounded by strict manners and rituals, is forced to give birth in front of a superficial crowd, is taken away from her family at 14, is given the power of monarchy. ¡She was a teenager, for God's sake! Though there's no tragedy in Coppola's film, you can feel the eerie atmosphere of the pompuous against a doomed political time. Modern music sounds so fresh in this kind of movie. It reminded me of Jesus Christ Superstar, where the anachronic was just a way of tying our world with the past. It serves as a link between what we think we know of that time, and the way we feel emotions today. Marie Antoinette is so beautifully crafted, you almost taste every cherry and dessert. You are living inside this impressive palace, and witness her fragility through Dunst's persona. It is a film about emotions, not facts. And it works so much. It's one of those films you experience, not watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
What else can I say...,"...that hasn't already been said? Historically inaccurate, poor scripting, poor dialogue, poor acting. While others have commented that it may not have been S. Coppola's intent to create a historically accurate piece, why create a historical piece if you don't plan to make some effort to represent the events accurately? And the musical score? It's great -- if the movie had taken place in the East Village in 1985.Kirsten Dunst's performance in the film is wooden at best. While she wasn't given much to work with in the way of dialogue and character development, still, her performance left much to be desired.Loved the visual aspect of the movie, but basically the movie is all style and no substance.

Privileged aimlessness,"The whole point here is that it would be an aimless, frivolous film because it would be about aimless, frivolous lives. It was meant to be perfectly centered in excess, vacuous stultifying excess, and to the degree that it is, it's a successful venture.There are hints of political machinations at work, the wheels of a larger world with this woman at the center of empires, or near it, but they only reach us faintly through the silken curtains, until of course too late when they come marching out the window with torches and pitchforks at hand; again, it is kind of the point that we are as removed from the real world as possible.And the soundtrack of modern music, this perhaps above all, is a great touch to make us once more experience the gilded dream from inside; a world that is not historically embalmed, a series of museum exhibits, but vividly modern, contemporary, as felt at the time.So in all the parts that are meant to convey a world, it's a well structured film. But it does remain a film with the gaze solely invested in this particular world, this particular woman.Sofia likely thought she could personally identify with the material from her own life sheltered in wealth and fame, with its own anxieties and despairs, and carve from those a portrait that would be honest and heartfelt, if nothing else, which is even more troubling the more I think about it, because no doubt she knew we would identify herself in the film, how wistfully she portrays this woman. So exactly because none of the real issues faced then in Paris or elsewhere should be shown to intrude the chic decadence of the palace, it is asserted that there's no real responsibility to be accepted or the lack of it regretted for the kind of life shown here.What is mostly meant to preoccupy here, is some sense of quiet suffering at the heart of that privileged aimlessness. We're meant to understand how even a pampered queen can have problems, oh my, which renders the few tears shed here and there a kind of crocodilian self-congratulation; ""see, I have my own price to pay"".I would have loved to be able to see this with Eisenstein; if only, for getting to note how a montage can shape from nothing a life that is nothing and allow the filmmaker to celebrate this as a kind of meaningful art.",,Anonymous,History
A chocolate box of tastes,"If you wanted to learn about the French Revolution, one way might be to stroll down to your local library, rent out a few archaic textbooks and maybe a BBC video documentary. No doubt you will acquire a great deal of knowledge, facts, and figures.However sometimes you long for being there in the late 18century renaissance; in France, dancing and lounging among Kings and Queens, indulging in the royal and decadent lifestyle. Marie Antoinette offers that eclectic alternative.Far from the fact, however staying within reach of the truth, Sofia Coppola has crafted a chocolate box of luscious exuberant tastes that look to good enough to eat. However in this film, it's the eyes and ears that do all the tasting.Based on the book by accomplished historian Antonia Fraser (who also helped oversee the making of the film), Coppola has crafted not so much a retelling of Marie Antoinette's life (or even death) but a slice of paradise during her time as the Queen. Not knowing anything about the Revolution, I decided to ""educate"" myself on the Cliff's notes of the story. Fraser's story and subsequent documentary was fascinating, at the same time being illuminating. Surprisingly, Fraser who had a large input on the formulation of the film allows Coppola to indulge a fairytale with fancy sweets, dresses and rock music. The effect is a film that is stunning to look at, contains a thin thread of plot but is still entirely believable in context.Copola's script is economically sparse. There are long moments without dialogue; most of it is gossip and a form of recitative in between the scenes. The film relies on real stars - the direction, costumes, and art decoration - to tell the story. It covers the period in Marie Antoinette's life during which she inherits the crown, marries the king and attempts to conceive an heir to the throne.Marie Antoinette played by Kisrten Dunst captures the essence of a young princess, enjoying life at her prime - a most active and beautiful woman. Her soft and vibrant portrayal is well complemented by the pale lighting and ethereal colours of the palace. She plays with aptitude each scene of loss with as much honesty and pathos as she gives her dances and balls a joie-de-vivre.The supporting cast is an amalgamation of actors from different generations and countries - the result is a medley of American, English and French accents. While it sounds anachronistic, it is also refreshing in it's diversity. The bit players are all worth their salt from Judy Davis' staunch allegiance to Rose Byrne's vibrant festivity and the Ambassador Mercy's honest forthrightness.With a smashing pop soundtrack and exuberant visuals, the film will most likely please the young adult female demographic. This theme of female youth is highlighted throughout the film. Several scenes are dedicated to trying on pairs after pairs of shoes and fashioning hairstyles several feet high all while indulging on pastries that deserve to be in an art gallery. Despite not being of the target audience, I still was able to be swept away by the tremendous artistry of the costumes, decor, dresses and shoes; the exuberant hairstyles and clothing.Considering the young female subject of the film, it makes at lot of sense to guide the film in this direction. If it were a modern day retelling, the story might fashion itself as girl inherits money, goes shopping after which she is recovered; finds boy, gets married and starts family. Therefore, it is a surprising change of pace when we are treating to lengthy almost silent dreamlike scenes of Marie-Antoinette drifting through the palace, dozing in the gardens, and strolling through the Petit Trianon.Art decorators Pierre Duboisberranger and Anne Seibeldeserve, and Costume designer Milena Canonero deserve much credit for their contributions in the film which scream attention, almost outclassing everything else in the frame. Filmed entirely on location in France and in the Versailles palace, they make full use of the gardens and the surrounding environments. They have created an palette of pastels and creams in a rich fantasy world.Also deserving a mention is the cinematographer Lance Acord. He served as cinematographer on Coppola's previous film (Lost In Translation) and also for director Spike Jonze, and has made the most of the decadent architecture and fabrics of 18th century France.Like it's subject Marie-Antoinette is an attractive piece, alluring in it's extravagance and bewitching in visage. It's effect on you is not unlike the glazed pastries that Marie-Antoinette consumes during the film - gorgeous to look at, however not much but air inside.Coppola has exquisitely constructed an dreamlike piece on the of eve the French Revolution so that we might have our own Petit Trianon for a few hours.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Director Sofia Coppola turns voyeur in her version of the infamous,"Director Sofia Coppola turns voyeur in her version of the infamous Marie Antoinette. It reads straight out of a Wikipedia entry on the subject (the script is actually based on Antonia Fraser's book) but doesn't aim to educate; rather, it affords a glimpse of the young queen's human side, showing how she lived, which seemed to explain how she couldn't possibly have maliciously intended to ruin France.Kirsten Dunst was a good choice to play the teen queen; she was able to credibly transcend from a 15-year old to a more mature woman. She earnestly played her character, and endured the punishing, intimate shots of intense close-ups and disturbingly quiet scenes. Jason Schwartzman was also adequate in playing the role of Marie Antoinette's similarly young and inept king.The visuals are stunningly rich, with establishing shots straight out of Victorian paintings. The lush clothes, furniture, landscapes and light all delightfully intertwine into what is believably accurate and painfully shallow. For this, Coppola was able to successfully replicate the period better than other grayer, more formal period films. She patiently shot inordinately long scenes that allowed the audience to empathize with the awkward quiet and idleness of the time.Coppola's storytelling is disconcertingly quieter; reliant on the atmosphere, not on conversations. The creative choice of juxtaposing moody new wave music from the 1980s (supplied by Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Cure, etc.) surprisingly fit the illustrative sequences. Even the acting took a back seat to fit the tableau, effectively showing that Marie Antoinette is not the central character after all, but a mere cog of French society. For this, Marie Antoinette, according to Coppola's candy flick, cannot be faulted, having only desperately and dutifully played her part.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant,"Marie Antionette (Coppola 2006) Painting the Habsburg Marie Antoinette in a sympathetic light is a daunting task. For that matter a favorable portrait of any pre-WW1 Monarch, discounting Elizabeth I or perhaps her father, generally draws criticism. This is especially true when said piece is shown in that Monarch's home realm.It should be no surprise the early controversy of Coppola's Marie-Antoinette would be met with strong reaction in France, given Coppola's presentation (though I know it has equally been met with praise.) History has largely taken the stance Marie-Antoinette was a shallow creature who brought on her own destruction, though noting her actions once arrested were dignified.Rather than compare Coppola's work to another film, I would instead compare it to Velazquez's masterpiece The Infanta Maria-Theresa (another Habsburg joined in Royal marriage to the Bourbons.)Velzaquez was the court painter for the Spanish Habsburg's and this work was commissioned to present to potential suitors, namely the French Dauphin the future Louis XIV of France. One can see the how Velazquez highlights poor Maria-Theresa's (few) attributes, yet cleverly retains her homely features. However it is in her eyes we see the sadness, perhaps the young Infanta understands her position in life - to breed a royal heir in some foreign court.I liken Coppola's Antoinette to this portrait. As I have called Velazquez's work a masterpiece, it may very well be after further reflection I call Anoinette a masterpiece.Kirsten Dunst is well cast as Antoinette and carries the film throughout. It is not a baity role, rather complexly subtle (and IMHO difficult to carry off.) Coppola does not turn this into a political piece, instead certain matters which help discourage the Queen of France's popularity are ""mentioned."" The unpopular alliance with Austria, the length of time for an heir, the beginning of the Austro-Prussian-Russian partion of Poland, spending, gossip (etc.) These matters as well as the sumptuous sets and props are mainly background. Coppola's focus is on Antoinette's coming of age.The supporting players are backdrops as well, still several are given an opportunity to shine. Marianne Faithful is wonderful as the Austrian Empress Maria-Theresa, Steve Coogan is excellent as Ambassador Mercy, and Asia Argento shines as the Madame du Barry. Jason Schwartzman, Judy Davis, Mary Nighy, Rip Torn, and Danny Huston also deliver.My opinion is Coppola had a clear vision of what she wanted to present and nails it. :rock on: Easily one of my favorite works of recent years.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Antoinette as seen through Axel Fersen's eyes maybe?,"Everyone either loves it or hates it, and I for one, love it! I believe that Kirsten Dunst is pure magic! This is a movie seen through the eyes of someone who really loves Marie Antoinette, not a detractor. And it should be seen and viewed as such. Since it is narrated by her mother, it may be that she is seen as her mother wished her to be seen.For sure, it is not about a historical event, but rather is a character study. It is like eating cotton candy at the fair! It is all sweetness and light. Nothing of the starving masses...who knows of them anyway as they are just something to do for charity as has been taught so long by the nuns and priests of the church, but in reality, out of sight, out of mind.I love this movie for that reason. It is a study in the Château Du Versailles and its occupants who bring it to life. Sofia did a great job in giving a glimpse of Antoinette as she appears to those who love and cherish her.I recommend it highly...it is fun, charming, sweet, and magical! Beautifully photographed and made my day!",7.0,Anonymous,History
Surprisingly boring,This movie is astonishingly boring.A succession of Music videos depicting the queen eating maccarons and walking from one mindless scene to another.Marie Antoinette´s life was very rich and it's hard to believe it could be botched like that.,1.0,Anonymous,History
Sofia Coppola gets the quiet moments right...,"This isn't your mother's period-piece...I fell head over heels for this playful film within the first fifteen minutes. ""Marie-Antoinette"" follows in the tradition of Coppola's earlier efforts, delicately balancing femininity and loneliness in a world that feels awkward and shallow. If you adored the sensibilities of the 2003 masterpiece, ""Lost in Translation"", this film will strike many familiar notes.There are certain scenes in certain films that make you aware you are in the presence of greatness. I had that feeling when ""Amelie"" skipped stones on the canal. I had that feeling when Lucius and Ivy spoke quietly on the porch in ""The Village"". I had that feeling when Elizabeth Bennett spun on her swing in ""Pride & Prejudice"". I had that feeling when Bill Murray told us that, ""For relaxing times... Make it Suntory time!""In this film, I knew I was watching something special when Antoine is making her way from Austria to France to meet her fiancé, the Dauphin -- heir to the French throne. In any typical period piece, the journey would have been brief, showing us her departure, a scenic middle shot to pass the time, and her arrival. However, in ""Marie-Antoinette"", we are transported into her world. We are invited to share her quiet times. This journey reveals her youth and the boredom, nervousness and excitement that comes along with it.She arrives at the border to complete the transfer, as if she were a legal document. She is asked to strip and to bid adieu to her family, friends and pets. She is inspected and remade into the Dauphine of France, wholly unprepared for what lays ahead.Director, Sofia Coppola, is so attune to the complexities of young womanhood. Every film she has done explores the subject with such depth and care. I am not sure there has ever been a director, an overwhelmingly male occupation over the years, who has been able to capture those feelings on film with such clarity and wistfulness.Kirsten Dunst has never been one of my favorites. I have found her to be a charming and capable actress up to this point, but she has never blown me away. That is no longer true. Her portrayal is simultaneously exuberant and restrained, spontaneous and thoughtful, grateful and disappointed, blissful and tinged with regret.She plays the role with the freedom of a child -- and let's face it, Marie-Antoinette is exactly that. That she partakes in extravagant parties, shopping sprees, gambling entertainment & decadent feasts is only to be expected. She is a teenager trying to have fun in a stuffy world of structure and tradition, which she clearly describes as ""ridiculous"". ""But that, my dear"", replies one of her assistants, ""is Versailles.""She is also pressured with trying to provide France an heir to the throne -- a task she finds difficult with such an aloof Dauphin (Schwartzman), who is more interested in hunting and key-making than in her porcelain assets.Everything about this film focuses on her insulated world, which stifles her natural energy, and her attempts to make it bearable -- perhaps even, dare she say it, a little fun.What Coppola does so masterfully here is to style this story in such a way, with lavish visuals and a mélange of music, that it feels like a ""young"" film. She blends music of the time with contemporary tunes. She is unencumbered by the formal nature usually assigned to period pieces, shifting from the formality of Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" to the patience of Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" to the free-flowing movement of Robert Altman's and Paul Thomas Anderson's steadicam. She doesn't demand uniformity with dialogue or accents. She allows the film to take on a life of its own, making it one of the most original efforts in recent memory.Coppola uses melancholic bands like New Order, films as varied as ""Amadeus"" and ""Badlands"", and designers like Vivienne Westwood to influence every single frame of this movie. It truly is a unique vision. This extremely talented director has already established her own look and feel. I am sure I would recognize one of her movies without knowing in advance -- and there only a handful of directors who can evoke that compliment.Throughout this film, there is a haunting thread of inevitability. We all know Marie-Antoinette's fate and the film glides to a delicate final act which avoids the predictable and gratuitous ending that some other filmmakers would have provided. Instead, we solemnly watch the final few days, as the angry civilian mob descends upon Versailles to revolt against the monarchy. We observe the farewells to friends. We are handed one final elegant meal, with a sympathetic touch of the hand... and a sorrowful goodbye from a carriage heading to the gallows.I am so grateful to have found another film like this. I am equally grateful to have another director whose films I will eagerly anticipate above all others. ""Marie-Antoinette"" is assured a place near the top of my 2006 list. It is another quiet masterpiece for those of us who don't need our ""cake"" handed to us on a plate.© Written by TC Candler IndependentCritics.com",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great costumes and some style but little else.,"Won the Oscar for best costumes and quite rightly.Also has great soundtrack, however, the idea to have new music in period films was started by the far superior 'Knights Tale'.Sofia Coppola directs with great style and panache and gets great performances from the cast especially Kirsten Dunst.The main shortfall of the movie is the writing. Clearly such dramatic times should have a little more 'weight' added to the script. Coppola, however, has chosen to concentrate on the costumes and, forsome reason, cakes.Historically accurate it may not be but light, fanciful and frivolous it certainly is.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Off with her head!,"What was on my mind was finally getting to see ""Marie Antoinette"", before it disappeared all together! Now I'm usually a real sucker for costume epics, especially with some good historical background. This film directed by Sophie Coppolla, couldn't choose a more colorful subject matter than the ill-fated queen of the feckless Louis XVI! My cat could have made a better movie. Half the film establishes Marie as a party girl, overwhelmed yet fascinated with her exalted and obscenely wealthy station. The second half reinforces the first. Nothing happens.Vacuous dialog, with action focused around overdressed fops scurrying along palace halls, rolling in elysian fields, flirting at a masked ball, or trotting along in huge pumpkin like carriages. With none but the briefest mention of some apparently disgruntled peasants, the palace is suddenly seized by the unwashed rabble, the king and queen are quickly thrown into yet another galloping carriage, and............ roll credits. By now you're quite ready for a smashing guillotine scene, but you're denied even this satisfaction! I want 2 hours of my life back!",2.0,Anonymous,History
good lord,"A film about out of touch European monarchy, although perhaps the most clueless person here is the director, Sophia Coppola. The movie looks gorgeous all the way through, and the first half hour is actually very good, promising to be a sort of impressionistic Dangerous Liaisons riff, and the biggest surprise is how effectively the soundtrack of modern underground rock contributes to the atmospherics. But once France's future queen settles into Versailles, the film goes completely off the rails. What little drama that can be found centers entirely around whether Marie will ever have kids, other than that it's interminable costume changes and masquerade balls and adoring close ups of French pastries. Coppola's celebration of-not to mention obvious identification with--the teenage princess' world of privilege and excess is a bit mind-boggling, and rather squarely lines up the film's sympathies opposite the French Revolution. Kirsten Dunst's inadequate performance brings this folly into sharp relief-while the rest of the cast manage to affect accents derived from some European nationality or another, every time Dunst opens her mouth a bland, dimwitted suburban American drawl issues forth, so distracting as to take the viewer right out of the picture. Starving, rioting Frenchmen-barely mentioned until the film's last ten minutes, although students of history will know they were lurking about outside the palace gates-eventually arrive, big meanies who ruin Marie's tea party and drag her off to prison, leaving Marie sad about having to leave her pretty little palace. The events surrounding Marie's subsequent incarceration and execution are left to the viewer's imagination, an excellent opportunity for an interesting dramatic turn lostthe movie avoids such gravity at all costs. Even if Coppola was trying to make the case for Marie being an innocent caught up in the tide of history, those endless Hallmark card shots of angelic golden locked children playing with fuzzy baby goats and yummy French soldiers who show up for no reason other than a dreamy romance novel moment never add up to anything more than royalty porn for chicks, and in the end it all manages to be embarrassingly vapid, as well as historically myopic.",,Anonymous,History
artistic,"Just saw this movie in theaters. I like Sofia Coppola's style, but after seeing The Virgin Suicides, Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette, I have to conclude that in fact, I just really love Lost in Translation. In comparison to that, I gave this movie a 7. But still! It's worth seeing if you like one of the following things: visually impressive, colorful, artistic movies (like Russian Ark, full of costumes of the times and such); a social, emotionally oriented view of the famous French Queen; subtle humor; a creative rendition of that particular historical time. Those are all characteristics of the film. Unfortunately, those items also make it a fairly slow movie. Now I know Lost in Translation is far from an action movie, and I have no objection to that. But Marie Antoinette is a bit too slow, especially for one who cares more about the characters and plot than about decorum, Versailles and social life at the palace. Though I see the artistic value of this film, and I don't feel I wasted my 10$, I also do not feel that it struck a chord in me. So 7/10 is pretty justified.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Good,"First let me say this movie has one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard and because of that a few scenes were really not great. I feel like the director was going for a teen coming of age story which is not what this should of been. The eating candy montage was especially corny and annoying.Besides those follies the movie was fun, light hearted and Kirsten Dunst did a great job. I'm not sure how close to history it was but the story was entertaining to watch. Also the costume and set people did an amazing job. Better then average. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Brave and creative undertaking by Coppola,"So this movie showed up in my Netflix, and without expecting much I turned it on just to pass the time; however, after just a few minutes, I was completely sucked in. Firstly, this film is a visual feast: the costumes, the palaces; and the gardens are artworks in themselves. Honestly, you could watch this movie just for the luscious imagery and have an enjoyable experience.As much as I loved the imagery, it was the story which really captivated me. I will add that I am a massive history nerd, and perhaps this was one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much. Yes, the film isn't 100% historically accurate; however, it is reasonably so. The bizarre rituals of the French court shown are mostly true. The depiction of Du Barry and how she interacts with Marie is also true. The depiction of Louis the 16th later in the marriage is a bit unfair, and admittedly I feel showing him as more competent(which he was) would have contributed better to the film. Despite the exact historical of events not being the goal or intention of the director, the film is actually reasonably historically accurate.People complain about politics and the American war of independence not being involved enough because those were key contributors to the outbreak of the French revolution. For me though, this view is unfair, normally I'd be happy to pick up a book or watch a documentary on the causes of the French revolution, but this is not about the French revolution, it is about a girl in the springtime of her life being forced to live far away from home, to man she does not know, surrounded by people judging and criticizing her every move and on top of that having the weighty pressure of conceiving an heir just to maintain her position.Marie isn't necessarily a likable person, but there are few among us who would have behaved differently in her shoes, and the fact we are shown that is the reason I loved this film. It takes the woman we know frozen from time in her portraits and pumps warm blood and emotion into a person who is reduced to a caricature in popular culture.The choice of music goes along with this perfectly. Personally, I think it was one a very brave creative decision to include rock music, but one that really pays off. The critics will say it is an anachronism, yet I think they miss the point. The music is modern and is high-tempo, yet Marie is an historical figure from days gone by. By playing the modern-day music, the director reminds the audience this was a real person whose hay days of youth were just as vivid as ours. It took guts from the director to make that call, and she did take flak for it, but I feel it is undeserved.Including the music is a creative decision that gives this movie flair and real feeling. If you want an exact historical duplicate, try a portrait gallery, and don't get me wrong I enjoy portrait galleries, but what this film is, is a well-made artistic impression of Marie Antoinette and her time in Versailles. It challenges our assumptions, builds empathy and is visually beautiful. If that doesn't constitute art, I don't know what does.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Beautifully presented, hard to follow for first timer's.","Sofia Coppola shows us a sympathetic view of the ill fated Queen of France in this contemporary and youthful retelling of her young extravagant life. From her early marriage to Louis XVI at 14 to her reign as Queen at 18 and the beginning of the French Revolution and ultimately the fall of Versailles.Those of you who are not familiar with the story of Marie Antoinette or ultimately the French Revolution may find it hard to follow or rather pointless to watch as there is hardly any dialogue or explanation of the reason or cause. Or, to be fair, what she even had to do with it. Unmentioned in the film are her later incarceration, trial and execution.I was pleasantly surprised at Kirsten Dunst's performance as Marie Antoinette as I wasn't expecting much from her at all. She does a fine job of portraying a youthful and fun spirited Marie in her years of decadence and luxury.Beautiful and fun insight into the early life of Marie Antoinette as a young Queen, Mother, Party Girl and Socialite! A personal favourite.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Flows like a nostalgic memory in your subconscious,"I admit, going into the theater I was already a Sofia-fanatic, and I had built up the hype of this film so much, everyone that I knew told me I was doomed for disappointment. I wasn't - I loved this film; and, I'm aware that even though this is true, many people won't like it (it's amazing the indifference Ms. Coppola brings). I'm also aware that in the confines of this small review, I cannot persuade people to love this movie more than they already do, or more than they might hate it, just as I will not be influenced by a seminar on the immensity ""Armageddon"" had on the action genre.As the director's third film, ""Marie Antoinette"" is Coppola's most opulent and lavish film, with the 40 million dollar budget to prove. The cinematography, sets, and costumes shine in the film's afternoon, lazy-daisy atmospheric sunlight. Coppola's ode to nature is apparent from the start to finish. The quaint sounds of the wind and chirping birds give the film an airy, and somewhat angelic, feel (the juxtaposition of these natural sounds versus the painfully structured court and etiquette give light to Coppola's mindset that this is not natural life). ""If we assume man has been corrupted by an artificial civilization, what is the natural state? The state of nature from which he has been removed? Imagine, walking up and down the forest without industry, without speech, and without home."" Rousseau's quote is pitch-perfect in identifying this balance, and is fit beautifully into the film.New York, London, Munich, Paris, everybody talk about Pop Muzik. Yes, I do think M's ""Pop Muzik"" would have worked wonderfully into some of the movie's candy-filled and excessive decorum-fiend montages. I also feel like buying Coppola a copy of a Cocteau Twins album and demanding a director's cut (one that didn't include a Bow Wow Wow version of ""Fools Rush In""). Anyway, the pop music worked. Not only did it put Antoinette's age in perspective, but also allowed a fresh twist on a dulling genre. Although, I do think the original ""Age of Consent"" by New Order would have worked lyrically well over ""Ceremony"" or even the gang of Four track. The classical pieces were wonderful as well (Dustin O'Halloran's piano solos are magnificent in displaying the melancholy of her later life, as well as the echoing sounds of boredom that filled the Versailles halls).""Marie Antoinette"" is an intimate experience. Let the celestial bliss that is the blue-sky aura of the film soak into your senses.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Even during the playful scenes, KD gives a measured performance - MA doesn't come across more drugged than silly. The movie is 15 years old and since then has gained in popularity- explained as a metaphor for modern consumption with no thought to the consequences of the future - mayhaps but I just saw your basic tiptoe of a bio - I don't expect historical accuracy from Hollywood - go read a book, even wikipedia - but there's nothing particularly outstanding and the times they do give MA ""depth"" it's all about having a baby. Despite it all, in the end MA

Beyond judgment.,"Marie Antoinette is probably the first film about this subject to START with the Revolution, as we see a voyeuristic shot of Kirsten Dunst bathing to Gang of Four's ""Natural is Not In It,"" a song with some very pointed lyrics: ""The problem of leisure / What to do for pleasure / I do love a new purchase / A market of the senses."" It's as if we are in the mind of a peasant who, his fantasies inflamed by the gutter press, the rumors of wantonness and high living at Versailles, looks at his own life and, boiling over with sexual and economic jealousy, picks up an electric guitar and invents punk just to show his hatred for the rich bi--h who ruined his life. How did Coppola resist using ""God Save The Queen?""That burst of staged anger having passed, the rest of Marie Antoinette devotes itself to showing how the lower classes' hostility was or was not warranted. In a film full of Kubrick references, Marie herself is perhaps most like the corpulent recruit with the aristocratic name of ""Leonard Lawrence"" in Full Metal Jacket, chewing a jelly donut mechanistically while his fellow soldiers do push-ups. ""They're paying for it it -- YOU eat it!"" screams the drill sergeant. Marie Antoinette is a two-hour slo-mo of that jelly donut scene. She ""enjoys"" herself because that's what a queen is expected to do; and then she pays with her life for fulfilling those expectations, just for playing her part. The point: Enjoyment, la jouissance, doesn't exist.Marie Antoinette seems like a poor little rich girl story. But that wouldn't explain the most touching scene in the film, when Rip Torn's Louis XV calls for his mistress on his deathbed, and we see his face crumple into pure grief when reminded that he'd already sent her away. Coppola's sign of maturity is that she extends her sympathy to everyone else in the story -- everyone except the peasants, that is, whose appearance in the final minutes is demonic enough to make you wonder how anyone could have ever thought a murderous mob was a triumphant expression of human liberty. Besides, Coppola tacitly suggests, if they had imagination, they could have wormed their way inside Versailles too ( Coppola's court is stocked with pop-culture royalty, after all, people who, like Asia Argento, may have been born into famous families but still had to prove their mettle. )Jason Schwartzman as King Louis XVI and Marie have a strange relationship. They never fall in love, but there is something exhilarating about the way, in each others' presence, they can let the masks drop and be the kids they are. Schwartzman subtly gains confidence and there are some moments towards the end, calling on Marie at Le Petit Trianon, where you get a brief glimpse of something special, something truly royal, waiting to emerge. Heartbreakingly, it never does; the mob arrives. But when at the end they go to prison, you flash back to the cardinals and priests at their wedding and think, maybe there is something to all this ""ridiculous"" ceremony; maybe it was a heavenly and not an earthly marriage that was being arranged. And then you flash to the other scene where Marie and her friends are playing a guessing game with papers attached to their heads, each paper bearing a name -- one of the ladies-in-waiting has the name ""Jesus Christ"" on her head and asks, ""Am I at this table?"" and someone replies, ""You're always with us."" And then you realize just how many dimensions this film is working on.If this review seems scattershot and impressionistic, well, so is the film. I could probably write a little experimental essay for each individual scene. I'll spare you that, but Sophia ( and Roman, her brother, who I feel had a large hand in this production ) has proved that she has a soul after all. With soul, you can raise other souls from the dead, restore them to their original truth, to their innermost dreams and longings... And that's exactly what she's done here. Despite my utter hatred for Sophia's two previous films, I'll admit I think this is the best period piece ever, and that includes Barry Lyndon. Marie Antoinette is literally to die for, a glorious, melancholy poem about unborn angels on the edge of an endless dawn.",,Anonymous,History
Interesting cinematic style,"The story of Marie Antoinette as told through quick snippets spanning her first introduction to France to her final night in Versailles. The movie certainly has an interesting / unique cinematography style. In that rarely are scenes longer than a few minutes and whole story lines aren't really played out. Instead it's glimpses into moments of Marie Antoinette's life as a French princess then later queen. The dialogue is very sparse, almost all the story telling is visual. All the music and language are modern, which makes it read as a revival (like that Romeo and Juliet with Leo).",7.0,Anonymous,History
Sofia Coppola Makes Marie Antoinette of Flesh and Spirit.,"Sofia Coppola works her magic here with Kirsten Dunst embodying the Austrian princess Marie, who was fourteen years old when her empress mother sent her off to France to marry Louis XVI. In what could have become another epic, costume-drama, Coppola creates an alternate chick-flick with gossip, bitchery, parties and shopping - and the sugar-rush flows as the movie keeps a loose time-frame. The dazzling on-location filming is greatly combined with the slang and rock music that crushes all the barriers this movie's already boxed in by. And although the last run seems a bit halting (as Marie Antoinette is attacked by the angry mobs), I think it was never Coppola's intention to make something to big out of this project - but the cinematic bravado of the first half is truly astonishing and finds Coppola in her truly right place, and creates a gorgeous movie with wit, intelligence and passion.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Piece of Candy,"Those who want to learn the history of Marie Antoinette will not find it in Sofia Coppola's film.This movie raised more questions than it answered for me. I didn't know much of anything about this famous French monarch, other than that she was eventually beheaded (which is not shown in the film) and that Norma Shearer starred in a 1938 version of her story. I did a little bit of reading about Marie Antoinette after seeing Coppola's movie and decided that Coppola took much too frivolous an approach to the material. Many of the details about Marie Antoinette's life as first wife of the dauphin and then queen are present, but if you don't know her story before watching the film, they may slide right past you without notice, even some quite significant ones. Coppola doesn't provide an historical context in which to place the film's action; therefore, we understand that certain things are important without understanding why. Why, for example, do the French end up hating her and Louis XVI so much? What mistakes do they make as leaders that drives their country to such a desperate point? The film ends with the king and queen fleeing the palace of Versailles -- there's a heck of a lot of story left to tell after that event, but it's not recorded here. I suspect Coppola was trying to put us in the queen's place -- she was a young, immature girl who was thrust into a position for which she was not emotionally ready. In the film, politics bore her, and she would much rather buy clothes and gossip. The job of running a country remains a vague nuisance pushed into the background. But this point of view approach backfires. We don't learn enough about what's at stake to ever feel especially concerned about Marie Antoinette or what happens to her, and the character itself isn't vivid.So why am I ultimately recommending the film? Because it's lively, colorful and extremely well directed. It reminded me of Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"": there's no substance to the movie, but it's so meticulously detailed in its production design, and it so faithfully recreates the rituals of 18th Century France, that it's absolutely fascinating on those terms alone. I enjoyed the anachronisms Coppola brings to the film: Kirsten Dunst, playing the title role, and Jason Schwartzman, as Louis XVI, speak in a slangy American dialect that doesn't even attempt to convince us that either of them is European; in one scene, during a flashy montage showing Antoinette and her female cohorts enjoying the frivolity and excess for which she was so notorious, we get a glimpse of Converse sneakers discarded in the background; and most notably, most of the soundtrack consists of contemporary pop tunes that comment on the action, and if they frequently take the burden of telling the story away from Coppola and her actors, they're also a lot of fun.Ultimately, ""Marie Antoinette"" resembles one of the many gooey, decadent candies that the queen consumes throughout the film -- completely lacking in substance, but lovely to look at and perfectly suited to satisfy a craving for something sweet.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,History
Eye of the Beholden,"This movie is hauntingly good. Sophia Coppola might become (or is) one of our finest film directors.The viewer must accept that the movie is viewed exclusively, STRICTLY, through the eyes and mind of Antoinette. Some reviewers seem disappointed, cheated, etc., because the movie did not cover the broader scope of France, the Revolution, or even the debauchery and treachery of the Versaille society. Rather, it takes a young woman of some intelligence and moral character, places her in extraordinary circumstances and then watches her react. That the results are not sordid, surprising or particularly dramatic is not the fault of the main character but rather the product of her integrity and strength.So instead of a woman who becomes a catty society bitch we have a woman who actively serves the society she joins, enjoying if not overtly recognizing the indulgence the role requires. Instead of becoming a scheming, devious wife she works at and develops a warm, if not entirely faithful, relationship with her arranged and incompetent spouse. Instead of becoming alienated from her upbringing she retains and exercises her maternal and familial roles. Marie can be forgiven if she is neither extraordinary nor controversial, despite being placed in a situation where both such attributes could be (and were) assigned by default.The strength of the film relies on how Marie's point of view is presented. The first forty minutes of the movie has extremely limited dialogue, none of which does very much at all to explain or move a plot line. Rather, we see opulence and splendor. If you find yourself, as I did, overwhelmed and then drawn into the decadence by this mere visual display then, well, that's exactly what happened to Miss Antoinette. Less is more. Hardly a half hour and maybe a dozen lines, we start to feel for Marie, or at least appreciate the boundaries into which she is boxed. The viewer starts to pull for her.But its a fixed game. We know the bottom line and want to tell our heroine but cannot. I had hoped before I saw this movie that we'd get a depiction of the rabble in Paris as well as some period shots of the city; i.e., to match the excellent costume of Versaille. We do not. We do not because Marie never saw such either. Our eyes are not opened because hers are never opened. But in no respect does the film milk the poor little rich girl sentiment. Conversely, a viewer leaves this movie with remorse of what may have been a more full and complete life.",9.0,Anonymous,History

If you want to enjoy Sofia Coppola's telling of a legendary life that has become almost mythical, check out this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Unique vision of Versailles by Sofia: a bubblegum dream,"I liked the movie, it's a not masterpiece, but it is definitely memorable.First, the photography is beautiful, there really are some beautiful shots. The soundtrack somehow fits perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is amazing in the part and the actor that does Louis Auguste is really good too. Though many people felt the plot was empty, I kinda liked that. It's true, nothing major happens and changes M.A's whole life, except at the beginning when she is forced to become the future queen of France and abandon Austria and her family. Sofia dared to write a script which escapes from the obvious ones, where everything that happens is calculated , so that the average audience is satisfied and doesn't complain about seeing something that 's different. In this film, you really feel the boredom of her life, and how she felt trapped in this little world outside reality that was versailles. I liked the fact that the picture only focuses on Versailles, and nothing else. It's not a historical, political movie. It's a bubblegum vision of the palace. Also, I really enjoyed the pop touch added to the life in Versailles, with the champaign, the candy, the card games, that did not affect the spectator's belief in the truthfulness of it all, something that ''A Knight's Tale'' couldn't possibly achieve. I give it a 7 because, for me, an 8 is already a very good movie, But it's simply a GOOD movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Historical???,"After seeing this movie i just have to log in and leave my comment. I am no movie critic and don't understand much about the fine points of movie making, i may not notice bad acting or lousy work of the director. One thing i know is history. It happens to be that historical movies is my favorite genre and this movie can not be called historical. No matter what they think in Hollywood wearing a costume and riding horses still doesn't make the the movie historical.Marie Antoinette is presented almost as some kind of a village girl that is amazed by the french royal court and the etiquette at the beginning of the movie.The rest of the movie seems to me like a modern teenage party in which all the participants r wearing 18th century clothes.

The Go Gos go to Versailles,"Like many of the other people writing in their comments, this film followed a long day and the need for some solid entertainment. My expectations were really low for this movie and given that Kirsten Dunst was the lead, I knew that the film would potentially misfire. While I have enjoyed her performances in the past, most notably Crazy Beautiful, like many contemporary actresses she just doesn't have the range, yet...Period pieces must above all give you a sense of the moment. In films like Pride and Prejudice (Colin Firth version), The Horseman on the Roof, Elizabeth, etc..., you are pulled into that world, that time period. With this movie, it was like watching a rock opera filmed at a fashion house, with some really wicked catering being provided.I have to admit, I gave up on this move at about 1.5 hours. While I felt guilty leaving my wife to finish this movie (she picked it to begin with), I just didn't feel like giving up precious sleep to watch an ending that I really couldn't care less about seeing.",,Anonymous,History
Bad music,"I don't know if the Golden Raspberry Awards awarded the worst soundtrack to this movie? I cannot accept the use of musical instruments and composition techniques that have not yet been invented in history to interpret history. The costumes, props, and makeup are all top-notch, and the actors are also perfect, but it's a pity that they are all ruined by the music. Is it possible to re-edit the soundtrack? In that case, a movie can become a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Agree & Disagree,"I am basing my comments on those of hafsol.Although I find hafsol's review to the extreme negative, I must say quite a lot of it is true and agreeable. Marie Antoinette was a very extravagant and ostentatious queen, yes, but Coppola's view of Antoinette as being a young princess thrust into a totally different court from the one she was born into is a very good part of the movie. True, maybe Coppola did make Antoinette a very gentle and innocent woman, but then again what was a queen to do surrounded by fortune with a husband barely noticing her? Women need love and affection! The scenery was ultra-superb and the costumes and accessories marvelous...but the songs...hmmmm...could have kept with the era I'm afraid!! I'm not saying Coppola shouldn't have any right to make the historic biopic as she saw Marie Antoinette, but she could have stuck more to the age. But hey, those costumes and wigs were extremely beautiful (altough other wigs could have been included which do not look like white dye applied to the real hair with a lot of hairspray!!) Many keep saying Kirsten Dunst doesn't have a thing good in portraying the Queen. Personally, I like her! Not because I'm some kind of fan of Spiderman or anything, I just liked her. In my point of view Sofia did actually manage to make Kirsten look from a young 14-year-old to a woman. I liked Kirsten in the role. But Asia Argento...Madame du Barry was blonde! Personally I would have actually preferred Angelina Jolie...she has a more seductive and mistressy look and stamina...but anyway. And Jason in the role of Louis XVI...NO WAY HOSE!!! If one sees 'Affair of the Necklace' by Charles Shyer one would see how great a resemblance Louis XVI is in that movie to the real dauphin. As for Jolie Richardson, another triumph in look-alike! I was, in agreement to hafsol's comments, very disappointed with the ending! No guillotine, no Jeanne de la Motte Valois, no Cardinal de Rohan, no necklace...too much interesting material left out! Should Sofia have made a similar ending to her movie as that of 'Affair of the Necklace' would have been grand!!",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Ambitious and provocative, Sofia privileges a ""feminist"" vision merging two eras with some very different criteria. The result is visually beautiful but controversial","The first act of the feature is somewhat sacral, given its later evolution. Always full of reverence and the protagonist's estrangement from the new world she would have to face, few would be able to ridicule Versailles and Coppola, in addition to doing so, it takes away all the beauty and enchantment of the palace as a whole. It seems that in there only the furniture is useful and the people are mere gossip passers-by. The entire process of accepting Marie Antoinette into her new life and the difficulties experienced at the age of fourteen, where the demands were greater than a naive girl could bear, are perfectly recorded and humanize the queen. It is noteworthy that at no time does Coppola intend to defend the controversial figure of Antoinette, but makes a psychological and behavioral study of what it is like for a teenager to be forced to take the world in her hands and not know how to manage. That's where the whole context of the feature is found. For many, the pride and life that Antoinette decides to live in order not to go crazy in a mediocre environment, may even paint her as the villain of French history. Fact or myth, Coppola's Marie Antoinette is just a demonstration of the unpreparedness of young people in their worldview. In reality, the queen didn't know what context she was living in, much less did she know the possible worldwide repercussions of her less than pleasant acts.Right away we can see Sofia Coppola's greater commitment to the aesthetics of her work than to historical fidelity itself. The opening credits, to the sound of a song far ahead of the time portrayed, transmit an air of strangeness, which is only increased by the hot pink lyrics that pop on the screen, interrupted by a brief shot of the queen on a couch. This initial strangeness, however, soon gives way to a certain familiarity, with Coppola masking this period drama with contemporary brushstrokes, which allow us to relate with extreme ease with the protagonist. It does not come as a big surprise, therefore, the immediate identification with the main character, clearly out of place in the first third of the feature film. Antonieta's discomfort is evident and the director and screenwriter makes fun of all the customs of the French court through some agile montage sequences, accompanied by classical music in more cheerful tones, not to mention, of course, the expressions of the central character, so evidently sarcastic and tired of it all. The curious thing is to see how this identification dissolves as the protagonist transforms throughout the narrative - that girl out of her place becomes the symbol of lust, with absurd expenses while the French people starve.Coppola is a master of expressing delicacy and sensitivity. Her films are mostly made up of female protagonists in moments of fragility and change (and even the two of them together), and Marie Antoinette is the best example of this. Ever since she arrived in Versailles, Marie Antoinette has been treated with disdain because of her nationality, even being called L'Autre-chienne, a pun on the words autrichienne, meaning ""Austrian woman"" and autre-chienne, ""another bit**""."". In addition to feeling out of place in the palace, Marie Antoinette's mother pressured her to get pregnant, which would consolidate the Austrian-French rapprochement once and for all. The expectation on top of the still-teenage queen of France yielded several bouts of crying, melancholy, and as we are talking about this character, shopping. The concept of ""emptiness of excess"" shows that material goods only bring momentary happiness and the false impression of fulfilling desires, while inciting the consumer to buy more and more, and we can say with complete certainty that Marie Antoinette has no scruples whatsoever. When spending.When Marie Antoinette finally becomes pregnant and sometime later, she gives birth to the couple's first daughter, there is a behavioral and visual change in the monarch. She trades in the grandiose colorful and pompous dresses for simple white cotton dresses and an idyllic life in her Petit Trianon, a private palace (yeah, she didn't get that humble). However, this did not lessen the dislike of the people and the court for her, which even grew more and more; this tension was shown in several moments, from small scenes in a theater, where she starts to applaud at the end of the presentation and no one follows her (unlike the first time, where everyone joined in the ovation) until the invasion in Versailles, when the rebels were looking for her to kill her and the entire Bourbon family. And the ending, well, we all know.Coppola said at the time of its release that the negative reviews it received probably came mostly from the French, as the plot does not exactly follow the historical background. However, this anachronism becomes one of the film's greatest charms. From the costumes, which were represented in a much lighter and more colorful way, without losing the striking silhouettes of 18th century dresses despite the use of some unthinkable fabrics at the time; to the music used in the soundtrack which, instead of the classical music always used in period films, mixes and represents Marie Antoinette's youth through sounds derived from punk, such as new wave and post-punk. Examples include the iconic shopping scene set to Bow Wow Wow's I Want Candy and the infamous appearance of lilac All-Star sneakers.The focus of the film is indeed the Queen's life; however, it would be inevitable not to address political issues, even if in the background. The major focus is on the presentation of the social conventions of the nobility of France, especially in Versailles, which with so much formalism reached the point of comicality. The film also does historical justice by disproving the famous quote attributed to the queen about bread and brioches, which she never uttered. The important thing is to observe how Coppola, little by little, points out information about the current situation in the country, saving the obviousness of the crisis for the climax, thus saving, in this way, the greatest impact for the right moment. During this whole process, we do not see any villainization of the characters, Antoinette or Louis XVI are not cruel or crazy (the king is just eccentric), they are simply people who are clearly unfit for the position they occupy, as is very well said by the monarch himself while he assumes his duty: ""Lord, guide and protect us. We are too young to reign."" In this way, the director does not make the coronation something glorious, transforming the crown into a real burden to be carried.This question, of course, is already carefully worked on throughout the first half of the projection, which focuses practically on the responsibilities to be fulfilled and observed by Antonieta. Coppola's script, of course, could cut short all the drama involving Louis's unwillingness to have sex, however much such a question sums up everything that is expected of both the future queen and the king - of course especially the woman, given that the responsibility is placed on her to generate sexual interest in her husband. Kirsten Dunst, naturally, steals any scene and softens such a slip of the text, but cannot erase it completely. While making the whole projection more extended than it should, but not to the point of catastrophically breaking our immersion, it highlights the narrative structure built by Coppola, since the second half of his work shows exactly the opposite of the first: the complete abandonment of the responsibilities. The settings, formerly portrayed with only the protagonist in the frame, with perfect symmetry, in order to explain her feeling of solitude, are now filled with characters and other extravagances, including, of course, the queen's dresses and hairstyles.Sofia Coppola manages to set the scene and atmosphere very well, giving touches of authorship to the queen's biography, but ""Marie Antoinette"" is not a flawless film. Sofia, ironically, ends up hostage to her most precious tool: the ellipses, that resource that produces narrative leaps to suppress passages that then become implicit. At the beginning of the film the ellipses fit well, as they reproduce the obvious routine of the palace during the queen's adolescence. From the middle, however, when the plot begins to include two decades of scattered events (deaths, births, adulteries, reforms), the ellipses lose connection. Jumping from moment to moment, the film ends without unity.Cinematographically, we have a fascinating and involving result, proof of the formal competence of the filmmaker. Historically, it has been nothing more than a salad, more than questionable in its biased choice of ingredients. Ideologically, what remains is, to say the least, ambiguous: the protagonists are almost ""nice"", at the same time that the ""system"" of alienation is perverse, feeds on itself and turns out to be self-devouring - which may have been fate of the film and its author. Perhaps Sofia Coppola, in her ambitious and provocative intention to shock and surprise by proposing a new image that is somewhat different from the current and popular view of such historical characters, ended up imprisoning herself in the same bubble of luxury where she did not belong. He did not see the people at all, privileging (perhaps) an inadequate ""feminist"" vision because it merged two eras with some very different criteria and behavioral postulates, such as in the mix he made of music of the time with contemporary music sounds in the soundtrack. The result is visually beautiful and appealing, but confusing and beyond controversial. If it's not for booing, it's understandable why it came to be booed: what you see on the screen is a hybrid portrait of ""Sofia Antoinette"".",7.0,Anonymous,History
Let them eat Coppola cake.,"Marie Antoinette is one of those historical figures that has been mostly misunderstood and in which her ""legend"" has preceded the facts. What is interesting, is that which she is most remembered for (the ""let them eat cake"" statement) cannot be historically linked to anything she had uttered. What is even more interesting is her response to what was attributed to her. In summary, she simply stated that the people of France help to maintain the royal family's well being despite the population's misfortunes and that she would work harder to make their lives happier as well. After Sophia's Lost in Translation, I was expecting a lot. This movie has some moments, yet falls quite short of expectations. The fault lies partly in the movie and partly in the subject matter.Marie Antoinette was born an Austrian Archduchess. At the age of 15 she was married to the overweight and virginal-soon-to-become Louis XVI of France. Marie was an outsider at the court of Versailles and was treated this way throughout most of her life. The rampant gossiping, along with the rumors of a ""cold bedroom"" and no heir lead to even more gossiping (lets also not forget the Affair of the Necklace). Madame du Barry (Louis XV's common-born mistress - Asia Argento) did not make life any easier for Marie, in light of Marie's dislike for associating with someone she felt was beneath her. In her youth, she spent and acted frivolously as she apparently did not know or understand the concept of money. After the birth of her children, Marie became much less extravagant and completely devoted to her children. It is in the latter years that Marie Antoinette showed her truer character.The movie tries very hard to convey Marie's childhood innocence and sheltered lifestyle. She is shown as a bit ordinary and unschooled in the ways of Versailles and France. This is partially successful. As the movie stands, the first hour and half are a tribute to Bacchus and the hedonistic lifestyle. The production value of the movie is really high. The costumes, jewelry, wigs and locations are amazing. Are we being shown this as a contrast? Even the choice of music is appropriate to this. The 80's music reminds me of the yuppie lifestyle and mirrors much of Marie's youth. This depiction of the young Marie is the foremost cause of failure of the the primary goal : To depict Marie Antoinette in a more favorable light. This is of course, unless we are given an unabashed look at her. It is hard not to judge, however. Youth and ignorance cannot be an excuse for every deed. She was born into having everything. It is hard to sympathizes with someone who has everything and squanders it callously. Some would say that she was only 15 years old. Unfortunately, a 15 year old in the 21th century cannot be compared with a 15 year old from 200+ years ago.The predominant focus of the movie and it's major flaw, is the reliance on showing Marie's youth. It is not in her youth that her saving grace can be found, but rather in her maturation as a mother and monarch. Unfortunately, only the last 20 minutes of the movie focuses on this and is so rushed as to seem unfinished. If this movie wanted to truly show the character of Marie, it should have focused on the 4 years from the fall of the Bastille to her execution. During this time, she showed her character in the face of an angry and blood-lusting mob. Instead we are left with a miss-paced, long, stylized, summer-like nostalgic romp though the 18th century. It's nice, but I wouldn't want to live there.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Acting is ho-hum - Set and Costume is AMAZING,"To be brief the story is good. The acting is OK, nothing too horrid or Oscar worthy. The Sets, props, and clothing are just beautiful. The way in which the film was shot is remarkable. It has a sort of modern look to it, but it doesn't go overboard. It is still a period piece. Kirsten Dunst doesn't speak with an accent of any kind. She speaks as if she were living in the time period but it just seems as if she is reading lines and not truly speaking them as Marie Antoinette. Jason Schwartzman is good as King Louis. He looks, walks, eats, speaks, and acts the role. He was a good choice as far as cast goes. It was OK to sit and watch to say I have seen it, it isn't something I will watch again just because I have some free time.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Terrible,"Sofia Coppola's ""Marie-Antoinette"" is one of the worst films I have seen in recent memory. She tries to make Marie-Antoinette out to be some innocent and light-hearted woman who was forced into becoming a queen. Coppola does not make the fact that she loved to spend millions on her material possessions (while the masses starved, no less) a bad thing at allit's what any 20-something year old spoiled monarch does, so it's probably easily justifiable, especially coming from the eyes of someone who grew up on her father's laurels. Only could someone like Sofia Coppola make such a self-indulgent film that tries to empathize with a queen so completely out of touch with her own subjects. I sympathize with Marie-Antoinette that yes, she was incredibly young when she became queen. I don't know how much of a monster she was or wasn't, but I know she was excessive in everything and did not do the best that she could have. An attempt to humanize her isn't an evil attempt, but to make her out to be a martyr is ridiculous. I know a lot of accounts describing her negatively are exaggerated, but this is no better..People have been praising the film for its aesthetic merits. Wouldn't it be arguable that it's all too easy to create a pretty movie when the film takes place in extravagant parties in 18th Century Versailles? I found all the soft pinks, greens, and blues to be a bit too much by the end of the film. Half the shots weren't even necessary..Being an American film, the actors were American. That's a given. But then parts of the French Court had English accents, others American, Marie-Antoinette's daughter spoke English and perfect French, but Marie-Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst, that is) herself couldn't pronounce a French word if her life depended on it. Regardless of accents, the limited dialogue and acting was generally bad. Not to mention that there were whole conversations that went unheard because of overpowering music.Is anyone else tired of hip directors basing the soundtracks of their movies off their Top 25 songs on iTunes?Kirstin Dunst is a mediocre actress, I've always thought that. Jason Schwartzman (another son of, surprise?), not who I'd imagine as Louis XVI. Molly Shannon?The movie isn't about politics, it's about Marie-Antoinette. However, when the film did decide to discuss politics, it always talked about funding the American Revolution. Why not spend those few minutes discussing something more pertinent to the film and subject at handmaybe the fact that the Estates General was going to meet for the first time in 175 years? That was one of the biggest events that led to the French Revolution...With the amount of money spent on rights obtained to film throughout Versailles and all the lavish costumes, you'd think they could spend some money to make Kirstin Dunst look like she actually ages.If Coppola wanted to create a portrait of a courageous Marie-Antoinette, maybe she should have followed her to the Conciergerie until her execution in 1793. Coppola crafted a film that loosely follows 19 years of partying, she might as well show the last (and most important) 4 years of her protagonist's life. The ending Coppola provided is just a cop-out.There were just too many bad things and inaccuracies in this movie to list. l'Opéra Garnier wasn't built until the 1860s under Napoleon III's Second Empire. Converses?The movie was also incredibly slow and tedious. The narrative structure was all over the place. To have 3/4 of the movie be a gigantic party and then nonchalantly throw in the fact that the masses were angry and calling for change is just bad story telling.Lame.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A superb historical biopic showing the boredom of life in the 18th century French Court,"I thoroughly enjoyed this excellent film. It was a sumptuous feast for the eyes; the costumes and settings were superb which was not surprising as the director was afforded the rare privilege of using the actual location of Versailles. If the costume designer doesn't get an Oscar nomination there is no justice! Also the food stylist was amazing, I have never seen such beautiful cakes.At first I found the American accents of most of the cast rather anachronistic but I soon forgot them as I was swept along by this meringue of a film. Although there was little plot that only helped emphasis the boredom and constraints of the French court and one only had sympathy for the teenage Queen when she broke free and lived life to the full accompanied by New Romantic music which helped emphasis her youth.However it was very historically accurate and I take my hat off to Sofia Coppola for that, I can't wait for the DVD to hear her comments over the film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Stylish and extravagant like the protagonist, but it barely holds the ground with such little substance","Sofia Coppola endured brickbats and razzies with her debut stint in 'The Godfather III' only to come out stronger as a director with a unique aesthetic. Apart from her trademark visuals and over the top soundtracks, she has a knack and penchant for presenting loneliness and people in out of place situations that hasn't been bettered before, especially my personal favorite 'Somewhere'.'Marie Antoinette' is an extravagant venture just as its protagonist, expectedly following a box-office and critical success - 'Lost in Translation'. With no compromises in the costumes, the background locales, the rich interiors or the talented cast, Coppola is armed to present her stylish vision to narrate the story of an equally if not more stylish Austrian-born French Queen Marie Antoinette, aptly casted and brilliantly portrayed by Kirsten Dunst.The story starts with Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) being shipped off to France for an engagement with Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman) who is a heir to the throne and eventually becomes Louis XVI. Being a stranger in a faraway land, Marie initially struggles to get accustomed to the traditions, pressure to conceive and being looked as an enemy/spy by some subjects due to on-going tensions between France and Austria. Once settled and with growing number of acquaintances, she embraces the fashion and party scene of Versailles and gets carried away with it. Her public display of extravagance and the diminishing coffers makes her a soft target by the hungry public during the midst of the French Revolution.Where Coppola succeeded in visual presentation of style and extravagance, she failed miserably in conveying the biography as it should have been. Intentionally or not, the major political events of Marie Antoinette has been conveniently replaced with more party scenes and display of elegant costumes which after a point gets repetitive in a biography especially. Since the story deals with the majority of Marie's lifespan and not just a segment in her life, it was important for Coppola to have included more of her protagonist's political choices into the narrative. Another interesting observation is that the movie never shows common public until the final revolution occurs, which is intelligent - as it makes the audience realize even harder by suddenly seeing soiled hungry people after repetitive partying and costumes and richness.Kirsten Dunst has fit the role like a glove exuding confidence, charisma and mischievousness necessary for the role and her presence is a major factor into making this movie watchable. Jason Schwartzman has a limited screen-time but does a decent job as the shy confused introvert. There are a number of other actors whose roles are partially developed like that of Duchesse de Polignac by Rose Byrne or Count Axel Fersen by Jamie Dornan and they seem to come and go without making any impact. Coppola is famous for her soundtracks and it was very bold even for her to come up with a contemporary soundtrack for an early modern period drama, but it does sound good with its slick editing and presentation. There are many movies with style over substance, Coppola (after Tarantino) seems to have made it her own with necessary skill-set and creativity to execute it to perfectness.Stylish and extravagant like the protagonist, but it barely holds the ground with such little substance.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"A Little Cake, But it Needs More","This light and fun 'modern' retelling of Marie Antionette is mildly amusing and entertaining, but it could have been so much better. It felt like it didn't quite know what it wanted to be - funny, dramatic, satiric, anachronistic, historical, so it was all of those things, but not really committed completely to any of them. As such it felt a little flat. Still, it did look wonderful, Dunst is likeable and gives a solid performance, and the soundtrack was good as well.",7.0,Anonymous,History
lacking in plot,"This movie was not as good as I was hopping. I wanted some character development and a racy plot, but what I got was a lavish tour or Versailles with a whisper of a story. I thought the acting seemed extremely casual, and there was hardly a plot at all. I would have liked to see more intimate conversations. I did enjoy the costumes and the scenery. It was kind of worth watching just for that. I thought all the dogs were really cute, and the cakes and candies look awesome. It made me hungry. I don't think it gave a very good historical portrayal, and it was very strange how everything seemed to be formal yet casual at the same time. The whole idea of the film was a bit muddled. I think it needed a much better story if it was meant to keep my attention for longer than half an hour.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Visually beautiful.,"When I first saw the advertisement for this film, I thought it looked very promising and it really appealed to me from a visual point of view. Upon watching it, I realized a few things, although they might not be so true.Sofia Copolla appears to like the directing styles of Baz Luhrman, in a way. Her use of modern music molding in with music that would fit into that time period. It was slightly confusing. However, it was slightly refreshing to be able to sit down and watch a period film and relate to it because of the types of music chosen. The only thing that makes it sloppy is the mixture of the two types.Visually, I was stunned by this movie and I don't think Kirsten Dunst has looked better in any other film she has been in. The lighting and the clothing colour choices were flattering on each of the characters and I didn't feel melancholic just watching it. Aside from the strange music, I think this is the kind of movie where the actors can get away with performances that are just ""OK."" This let it down somewhat and I wish that they had put a little bit more effort into it. In saying this, the acting wasn't bad at it was convincing enough for me to watch.I liked this film, but it just needed a little something more.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Enjoyable if you can get past the inaccuracies,"So this film got absolutely slammed by the critics, and although i enjoyed the film i can see why it got slammed.It seemed very odd that most of the cast at least adopted the accents of the country they were living in, even of they weren't speaking the language. Marie Antionette and Lois were speaking in out and out American accents! It just seemed a bit odd, either have everybody adopting accents or nobody adopting accents, but to mix it up just seems a bit odd.saying that it was still an entertaining film in my opinion, the costumes were nothing short of breathtaking and despite the foolishness of Marie Antionettes actions, you do end up feeling sorry for her toward the end.You'll enjoy this film providing you don't take it to seriously",6.0,Anonymous,History
Being Marie Antoinette,"Upon reading all the terrible comments about this movie, even though I am an admirer of Sofia Coppola's work, I had a strong fear that I would get disappointed with it. But, I was wrong! It was beautiful, everything was so pure and realistic. A great art work combined with great directing! I entered through a door and landed in Marie Antoinette's head, where I was able to see the world through her eyes. After 123 minutes, instead of being dropped into a ditch beside the New Jersey Turnpike, I was sitting in a movie theater with 100 other people who were fascinated with what they just had experienced.The story is about a little girl who is traded by her family as a merchandise to the French and has to spent the rest of her life living imprisoned in Versailles. She is forced to give up almost every right of choice and live by third party instructions. She has some never fulfilled slots in her heart, such as joy, sex and love. As a young woman she will seek ways in the boring every day life to forget about her pain, loneliness and seek proof of her existence.This is an intelligently depicted story, which will reflect Marie Antoinette's world in your current being. The point is definitely not, if she was good or bad, shallow or deep, if you are still discussing about that, then for sure you didn't get anything about the movie. Maybe you should stop watching Sofia Coppola movies. Only thing that matters here is what she had to live through and how these affected her feelings. If you are expecting to see a historical movie then don't watch it, but if you want to watch the story, of an innocent girl in the cruel world, with punk rock vibes, pink cakes, manolas and champagne, this is the right address, enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""This Is Ridiculous!"" - ""This, Madam, Is Versailles!""","I want to say, first, that I'm impressed that this movie is based on a book by Antonia Fraser. Antonia Fraser is a royal historian of great note, so if - and I realize that, as with any movie, that's a very big ""IF"" - the movie really follows Fraser's work (which I unfortunately haven't read) then we're probably getting a fairly reasonable depiction of Marie Antoinette, and my impression is that, indeed, this is a reasonable taste of her life, up to the point at which Marie and King Louis are removed from Versailles and taken to Paris. The movie ends with their departure from Versailles; there's nothing of Louis' attempt to hold on to the throne by agreeing to become a constitutional monarch, the royal attempt at escape, or their trial and execution.I rather liked the take on Marie Antoinette that was offered. Kirsten Dunst did very well with the role - she even looks a bit like Marie Antoinette. I really liked her in the role, and I thought she captured Marie's basic identity. I've always thought of Marie Antoinette as a bit of a tragic figure - not callous and uncaring as she's often portrayed (largely because of the belief that, when confronted by the fact that the people were starving because they had no bread, she replied ""Qu'ils mangent de la brioche"" - ""let them eat cake"" - which there's no solid evidence of her ever having done) but rather simply oblivious to what was happening outside court simply as a result of her pampered upbringing, which wasn't her fault - it was just the reality of her birth and her life. Yes, she was spoiled and pampered and largely cut off from reality by living at court, but I don't think that made her uncaring about what the people were going through - I think it made her oblivious to it because it was so far out of her reality. The movie and Dunst captured that.The sets and costuming in this were quite well done, and in general the cast was solid. I admit that I was a bit taken aback when I saw that Rip Torn was in this (he plays King Louis XV, Marie's father in law.) Maybe - as Marie was oblivious to the plight of her people - I've been oblivious to what's happening with Rip, because I didn't even know he was still around. But - like everyone else - he was fine. Sophia Coppola directed this and did well with it for the most part. It's certainly not the fastest paced movie you'll ever see, but Coppola managed to keep me interested and she made a brilliant decision by contrasting two scenes at the Paris Opera House that portrayed the rising opposition to Marie among the French people. In the first, she attends the opera and begins to applaud when it's over, which the French royals weren't supposed to do. Taken aback at first, the audience eventually joins in with her applause enthusiastically. Later in the movie, the same scene happens - Marie in the Opera House applauding at the end of the opera - except that this time no one joins her. Instead, people stare at her with disapproval, perhaps even barely disguised contempt. Those two scenes captures the flow of the movie well.For all that I liked, the one thing that I didn't like - indeed, it irritated me throughout - was the decision to try to give this a modern feel by interspersing various modern elements (especially the repeated use of rock music as a musical score.) It didn't fit and it was little more than distracting for the most part. The movie (for me at least) made the sorry decision to open that way, which put me off right from the start. There's also a pair of high top converse shoes that appears briefly. Supposedly, Coppola used these devices to remind us of the youth of the main character. I just found it unnecessary and out of place. I did - unlike some - like the ending of the movie. It simply depicts Louis and Marie being driven away from Versailles. I didn't need the rest of the history that I mentioned above. The movie was already long enough, and in any event it was about why Marie was so out of touch with the reality of life in 18th century France. It succeeded in that, even if it was a bit slow moving at times, and even with that irritating and out of place music. (6/10)",6.0,Anonymous,History
The Luxurious Though Troubled Life Of A Queen,"The plushy extravagant life of a French Queen is perfectly depicted here with a perfect historical depiction of how life was at the Palace of Versailles back in the 18th Century. It all looked lavish, but uncomfortable at the same time. I mean, there was no room for privacy when Marie woke up every morning and had a line of servants waiting to serve , wash and get her dressed in those humungous gowns she was required to wear.Her ""arranged marriage"" to King Louis XV was a troubled one indeed and one that lacked love and intimacy. It was more of a ""formal union"" based on the protocols of the monarchist system of the day. It was all about ""duty"" and nothing more which obviously left this troubled Queen pining for the care and compassion she was clearly without.This is a lavish depiction of Marie Antoinette, but should have strongly focused instead on her ordeal during the French Revolution. There was a lot of potent drama there during that time and I'm disappointed that it was only vaguely addressed in this version.All we see here is her palace life of privileges and woes and not what she endured as a prisoner during the revolution. She was clearly a misunderstood historical figure who had her reputation tarnished by the revolutionaries who falsely accused her of telling the starving peasants of France to ""eat cake"" instead of their cries for bread, among other things.She was a misunderstood woman who met a tragic demise under a brutal system that used the guillotine as a solution to everything. She had been caught in a marriage she didn't enjoy and also had to deal with the vengeful fury of the ""mob"" once the monarchy lost power and anyone in the nobility was sentence to death.It was a tragic and interesting life that this last Queen of France had. I just wish this film version had addressed more about what she endured instead of the pomp and riches she lived as a French King's wife. There was more potential here, but this film missed that.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Like eating too much candy,"I understand wanting to connect to modern viewers, but for me Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette erred too much on the side of trying to do that, and it came at the expense of giving me a deeper understanding of this historical figure or the period she lived in. There's not enough context, the portrayal is too sympathetic, and it's also too simplistic, things that I think could have been improved without the film becoming a dry history lesson. Maybe one of the issues is that it suffers by comparison to the AppleTV series Franklin which I've been making my way through, which gets the tone and history right, beyond the beautiful costuming and location footage that Coppola gives us here. I was engaged throughout and kept hoping this would shift into another gear, to make the repeated scenes of opulence build up to something, but it never happened. Along the way, the modern soundtrack had its moments, but I Want Candy by Bow Wow Wow to a montage of a shopping spree with an overload of confections was not one of them. I can't say I actively disliked it and I can see why others would be more captivated, but it left me feeling disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Falls short in many ways,"This was a colorful, opulent depiction of the court of Louis XV and Louis XVI and helps to answer the question ""Who was Marie Antionette?"" However, it falls short in revealing much about the woman beyond the superficial, which may have in fact been the essence of her personality. The film also fails to depict any indication of the unrest that led to the Revolution, so if one was totally ignorant of historical facts it might seem like the plot had a lot of holes and left many questions unanswered. The use of modern music instead of 18th century music did nothing to enhance the quality of the story.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"""Eating cake"" until it is too late","The film Marie Antoinette (2006) written and directed by Sofia Coppola is set in an eventful historical context and the protagonist is a perfect, conventional biopic subject, but it seems much more like an anachronistic coming-of-age movie. The historical references are generally quite vague, even though the life of a monarch in 18th-century France provides many opportunities to incorporate them into the story. The focus lies elsewhere.In the film, the young age and naivety of Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst), and also Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman) is emphasised repeatedly. This is intentional, and sometimes made apparent in an almost comical way, for example by Louis literally declaring: ""We are too young to reign"". Marie Antoinette has an advantage compared to her husband, as she does not even have to ""reign"" strictly speaking and is shown to continue living in her own isolated, luxurious world.This film only focuses on specific culturally and historically relevant events when it is inevitable. The exaggerations and omissions appear to be quite strategic. The significant events of Marie Antoinette's life in the film are very personal: she has to leave her home and accustom to the life in Versailles, she marries the dauphin and has to produce an heir. There is nothing ""extraordinary"" aside from her status in her story until the very end of it.The most powerful aspect of the film is without doubt the mis-en-scene. It is easy to become visually overwhelmed by the décor and the costumes. The abundance, luxury and the lavish Versailles lifestyle almost seem to be a separate ""character"" in constant ""interaction"" with the protagonist (visually: close-ups of shoes and cakes). The crowded feeling is emphasized in many instances and reinforced by the fact that Marie Antoinette is almost constantly being ""looked at"" by the members of the court. All this is heavily contrasted with her moments of solitude, conveying emptiness and melancholy.As for the cinematography, zooming in and out, long and extreme long shots also establish a certain distance and signal alienation or even the ""smallness"" of the characters compared to the monumentality of Versailles.The movie has a quite anachronistic soundtrack, including classical pieces as well as modern punk-rock songs. It brings the viewer closer to the characters by making them see the characters and their emotions in their present, rather than looking at it in terms of the historical setting.The majority of the film is rightfully deemed vague and superficial. The scene with the aristocrats licking their fingers, rubbing them around the rim of their glasses and then being amazed by the sound of it is a perfect metaphor of their life presented in the movie. Marie Antoinette quotes Rousseau in the garden of Petit-Trianon, but this is the closest she gets to the actual world.However, there is a significant change towards the ending and this is where it begins to show ""substance"". Coppola still chooses to contemplate these occasions from a distance. We only see allusions and references to the downfall and the tragedies of the royal couple. This inevitable interference of the historical context gives the ending a certain ""weight"". This is also signalled by the darker colours, lighting and cinematography. Intentional or not - this contrast of the last 15 minutes and the rest is what really completes the picture.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Marie Antoinette (2006),"Sofia Coppola is probably my favorite female director going today. Thematically her films are an excellent depiction of loneliness, isolation, and a longing to be. I'm super excited for The Beguiled and thought it would be nice to revisit some of her earlier work. I re-watched Somewhere and Lost in Translation recently and thought both were excellent. This is one I watched a while back and needed a fresh opinion on and honestly seemed like her most daring work so I was looking forward to seeing it once again.The film is about young Marie Antoinette archduchess of Austria, her marriage into French nobility and her time and demise as Queen of France. I've always been a fan of Kirsten Dunst, I think she's quite underrated as an actress (see Melancholia and S2 of Fargo). Her pairing with Sofia Coppola works really well; Coppola gets the best out of her regardless of whether this is an authentic representation of how Marie Antoinette was. Its wonderful to see the pressure that is put on Antoinette by others and how this leads to an untimely end for her reign.We get another Coppola film showing a very lonely female character. Marie has to keep up to the prim and proper standards of 1700 France and be ladylike despite just wanting to live and have fun. She seeks a relationship and connection with a partner, one of which does not come easily. She has no meaningful compatibility with her husband Louis XVI of France which really impinges on her happiness. Along with that the tiring task of the day to day expectation of being queen.I think Sofia Coppola really did well taking liberties on a historical drama. There is a presence of a humorous take and satirical approach to depicting the often ridiculous customs of the time. The set and costume design is superb proving that Coppola can handle a period piece even while putting an anachronistic spin on it (with the modern soundtrack). The modern soundtrack actually helped put an atmospheric touch on the film. Overall, its probably not the best of her work but its still a really strong effort and goes to show why we really shouldn't care about negative critical response.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
A wonderful lesson in anachronism,"""That wasn't realistic"" an older man spat to his company as soon as the credits of the film began rolling. His friends all agreed, if only to humour him. He went on to say that the love affair between Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) and Count Fersen (Jamie Dornan) ""had never happened"", and that the ending was ridiculous, amongst other things. My friend and I just looked at each other and shook our heads. Perhaps Coppola's latest is not a film for everyone  but it should at least serve as a wonderful diversion from bitter realism.Although it claims no historical biography tag, the film does document significant parts of the Austrian-princess-turned-Queen-of-France's life, such as leaving her family and beloved dog (the cutest creature I have ever seen, bar none) at home, stripped bare of all things Austrian and thrust into the cold court at Versailles to ""cement the alliance"". It even includes the notorious phrase ""Let them eat cake"" some years later and concludes with Marie and Louis siting stiffly at their grand dinner table, fingering pastries and sipping champagne, while the people revolt with pitchforks outside of the castle. Altogether, Marie Antoinette spans some ten or fifteen years of its titular protagonist's life  but mostly zooms in on the fun stuff.When Marie finds the court cold and uptight and her husband unresponsive, she indulges in lavish shopping, gambling, pastries and parties in which smoking a pipe is the same as smoking pot. There is an endless charade of shoes, wigs, cakes, opera, flowers, stylists, affairs, coy smiles and gossiping to pop music  a chick-flick plugged right into the infamous court of Versailles and wrapped in fancy costume, creating the perfect juxtaposition. The decadent décor channels Gatsby, if anything, and the sheer golden scope of the spectacle sends shivers down your spine. Coppola offers us an invite to soak up the atmosphere, and we take it unflinchingly. There is so much windowdressing to the core of the film that it becomes its core. Soon Marie Antoinette loses itself in its own luxurious world, which is no misstep on Coppola's part, but an apt analogy as it is exactly what the protagonist does. Sweet materialism...Kirsten Dunst is lovely as the Queen of France, handling the demanding role superbly with appropriate dramatic weight. Marie is only a teenager when she first arrives, after all, and Dunst effortlessly portrays that demographic. With her rosy cheeks, warm smile and childlike idealism she starts hugging the stiff pansies in wigs who recoil awkwardly, which gives us a taste of her innocent likability in the film. Luckily, she retains this bubbly attitude throughout. When Louis (Jason Schwartzman) finally warms up to and approaches her in bed, I felt an almost unreasonable happiness for Mariefor the both them in fact. If you scour the Versailles scene I'm sure more fine performances will present themselves but mostly it is quite barren and the only one who truly jumps out and grabs you at first glance in the film is Rose Byrne as Marie's wild friend and countess, providing for the comic delight.Aside from setting, Marie Antoinette's goldmine is perhaps its music score. From calm acoustic, rock, pop, classical to techno, I enjoyed the brave scoring to each scene immensely and when Coppola blasted The Strokes to Kirsten Dunst running in the lonely halls of the court, she completely won me over. I am in fact pressed to find something tangibly wrong with the film, aside from the strangelty abrupt ending. If anything else, it occasionally drags and individual scenes are not always in-tune  but these are minor shortcomings and do not really detract from the overall experience  especially not when I kept smiling throughout.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Superficial treatment of a major figure in history.,"Kirsten Dunst looks wonderful as Marie Antoinette. However, the same adjective cannot be applied to the movie. The movie provides a sympathetic portrayal of the queen, but the attempt comes off as superficial and contrived. Although as a person Marie was essentially innocuous, it was the office into which she was placed that proved her undoing. The movie fails to drive home how she was perceived as a symbol of oppression and decadence. She was not loved. In fact, she was loathed and the target of unending gossip. Whether she deserved such shoddy treatment is debatable. But the movie gives cause to feel amazement at how such a shallow person could generate so much popular ill-will. She was neither brilliant, nor clever, nor had any special talents that set her apart. Yet, she became the center of a political storm, which guaranteed her place in history. This, however, the movie fails to develop as a central theme. That is, the movie fails to portray Marie in a broader historical context. Hence, the movie is flat, lacking in drama, and even becomes trite, which, given the momentous events that were happening in France, is really amazing. The movie provides few clues as to why the people are so angry at their queen, which is the critical factor in how Marie's life ended. The movie effectively depicts Marie's lack of preparation for the role to which she had been assigned, but then basically glosses over the ensuing years of her life. Marie became a symbol of scorn. This point the movie skirts. The movie also fails to convey the sense of tragedy associated with Marie's life. It could be argued that she was fated, a victim of circumstances. The movie does not explore that theme. Instead, what the movie offers is a glib and superficial dramatization of one of the major figures in European history, whose presence helped trigger a revolution that changed France and the world.",7.0,Anonymous,History
VERY GOOD MOVIE,"I have seen this movie for second time on tv and again couldn't find anything wrong with it. I consider myself a cinefil, regarding number of movies of different kinds I've seen in my life so far. Someone here wrote, this movie will get more appreciated in the future. I agree.Don't understand negative reviews about historical inaccuracies if French education association awarded the movie. Also, you often have documentaries on the subject on tv, if you want. There I found out, that king demanded all of the aristocracy to move to Versailles after it was built, to surround the king and entertain him. Maybe this also contributed to revolution, if this remained the case 100 years later, because the ""upper management"" was removed from different parts of France and maybe this also showed in economy? Just my thought..From first time I have seen this movie, I remembered especially the excellent dinner scene at the end, when royals were dinning in mortal silence, still following court protocol, while the angry mob on the other side of windows was shouting for their heads. It makes you relate to that moment in history, how the disliked couple must have felt..The modern soundtrack is very innovative approach and probably also brought more youth to the cinemas to see historic drama. The birthday party scene stands out.Kirsten Dunst is lovely and witty with her facial expressions in this role. She should have received some awards for it. She's shown also in Fargo she's an interesting actress..Pitty Sophia Coppola doesn't make more movies, I very much liked Lost With Translation as well.",10.0,Anonymous,History

poor rich girl,"I have just watched this movie on DVD because it has not opened in my native Greece. The most astounding thing was that the DVD did not contain French even as a subtitle language!-it was not a pirated version, it was a very respectable legal commercial version. That a movie could be made about the French Queen without the French language- except very few words spoken by the servants- is remarkable and surely the sign of a cultural change of major proportions. As for the movie it is based on Antonia Frazer's biography and therefore is a sympathetic version to the Queen. It overstretches her innocence and lack of knowledge of French court protocol, as if the Hapsburg court was a place that people acted as spontaneously as in a discotheque. The stress on her gambling proclivity is historically attested as well as the libellous accussations that the gutter press invented against her and her entourage. The motherly figure of Marie-Therese is well presented while Louis 15 is presented as lecherous, who he was, while the portrayal of his mistress Madame Du Barry stresses too much her vulgarity and presents her as a prostitute while she was from solid bourgeois background as the former and more famous mistress of the same king, Madame Pompadour.The clichés abound, as the queen as Sheperdess. I found the scenes while she walks alone in the stairs of the gardens of Versailles very impressive visually. The politics of the movie stresses court diplomacy and ignores popular movement. The people are non-existent in this movie except in very minor and negative portrayals. I think this is in line with the book where the leading personalities are stretched and the historical role of the Parisian people is downplayed. It is a very conservative film truly. Nevertheless I generally liked it because of the very fine evocation of the costumes and scenery of the world of the super-privileged of the 18th century. I wonder if todays privileged will find role-models in this movie. I even had a moment of empathy when the Queen and her entourage where playing this game when one has a name of a person, animal etc on his forehead and through questions to the rest tries to discover it- I have played this game with friends of mine in the past- therefore I have something in common with the late French Queen! I am not deeply aware of the criticism the movie received in general although I am aware it was not very well received. It is not bad and surely it is more accurate as history compared to the 300 for example.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A Very Good, Oft-Misunderstood Act of Sympathy for Perhaps the 1st Victim of Antagonizing Celebrity Misrepresentation","Like Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation, this follow-up highlights the isolation of being a woman and bounded by a world that understands how to exploit you but not how to appreciate and understand you. It demonstrates Coppola once more capable of extracting interpretation from actresses who are hardly ever compelled to express it. Kristen Dunst uses an innocent passivity as the title character, as a 14-year-old Austrian princess who is basically bought and traded to the French court to connect with the naive and oblivious Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) to manufacture an heir. She has self-possession, composure and cheerfulness, and they are limited to a world that provides her no manner in which to gainfully convey them. So she clowns around and spoils herself, contained by a bubble of harsh and unyielding royalty's code of behavior. Greed and isolation can breed arrogance, ignorance and lack of empathy.I know what many who have yet to see it probably think, and this movie is not instructive and comprehensive regarding the real government of the era. That is for the reason that we are exclusively inside Marie's world. And it is enclosed within Versailles, which excludes all peripheral certainty. It is an independent structural land mass that shuts out affairs of state, realism, destitution and the general public.Schwartzman portrays a sexually unreceptive pout who would more willingly offer condolences than assume an operating position. Danny Huston is amusing as Marie's older brother, introduced from Austria to gently infer to young Louis one or two essential hints on the subject of a little thing called sex. Horndog Louis XV played aptly by Rip Torn in a hilarious casting choice, would without a doubt need no encouragement to have sex with anybody, as his mistress, a madame played by Asia Argento (another daughter of a famous director) instantly discerns.Coppola does something I like very much, which is making use of setting to characterize the existence and personality of the characters. Permitted undivided admission into Versailles, she illustrates a civilization neurotically committed to the pampering of Marie Antoinette. Coppola's film has been passed judgment upon by some for her application of a modern pop top-lathering, mainly the emo pop rock soundtrack, but also inconsistent dialogue, jarring infringement of characteristics of the modern world superimposed upon 17th century France. But no one in the movie lives in 17th century France. Several people in historical movies appear in some way conscious that they are living in the times of yore. Marie gives the impression of a modern-day liberal-minded teenage girl, which sure enough she is, and the up to date pop allusions tempt the audience to share her what-the-hell attitude with ours, or should I say let-them-eat-cake. Shakespeare mixed eras, too.All criticism I have gathered of this film's respectable enough but quickly faded reception could easily alter its breakable sparkle and relegate its dreamy and heartbreaking affection for the real Marie Antoinette to the rank of an informative depiction by misunderstanding its unconventionality. However, its falling off can be mostly attributed to the common marketing stupidity in that few theaters in fact showed the movie on the publicized release date. In the face of the fact that the trailer presented a release date that was inevitably assumed to be nationwide since it said nothing of limited release or select cities, the movie only went to big cities on its opening weekend and in select theaters at that. It abstracted almost a month for it to trickle down to the majority of local cinemas and by then too much time had gone by for an adequate turnout.Everyone knows Marie Antoinette was guillotined and we expect her gruesome death with an unpleasant interest. Coppola skillfully circumvents a decapitation, and stays away from overstuffed riotous mob scenes by using light, sound and a balcony to manage Marie's execution as a curtain call. As she was made by the aristocracy, for all intents and purposes, to take the part of a princess, she is naively loyal to her imposed function.It is not needed to know anything about Marie Antoinette to get pleasure from this movie. Some of what we think we know is mistaken, as she was perhaps the first victim of antagonizing celebrity misrepresentation and today's interpretation of history has a lot of its residue. As maintained by Coppola's rendering, she never said, ""Let them eat cake."" ""I would never say that,"" she defends angrily. What she says is not ""cake"" but ""custard."" But, in spite of what you would think, the more you know about her, the more you might realize, as Coppola's sideways approach alters the poise away from practicality and into an undertaking of compassion for a sensitive, free-spirited person imposed upon by things and people that deserts her natural need for individual freedom outside her high-society surroundings. Prior to being a queen, prior to being a hostage to fortune, Marie was a young girl coerced from her home, stripped naked, and scrutinized like a commodity. It is beyond belief with what lack of interest or concern for her feelings the court lords and ladies exploit her for its gratification and decadence, and from our reaction to this film and the inevitable thought of her death, we then perceive with a strong sense of injustice that in exterminating her they disposed of what little guilt of which they were capable.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Lavish Movie, Little Substance","Let them eat cake: No, the Queen of France never actually uttered those words, but it was such scandal and speculation that ultimately aided in her death and the fall of the French monarchy in the 18th Century.Sofia Coppola's adaptation of the story aims to update the historical tale with punk music, a royal heiress with a cheerleader accent, and (questionably) Converse sneakers- perhaps an allusion to her transformation from a simple Austrian princess to an extravagant, over-indulgent European Queen. The success of Marie Antionette lies in the lavish spreads of opulence, detailed shots of fine costume, food, sexual encounters, and the extremes of an oblivious aristocratic society. All well and good, but after the first hour, one had to wonder how long this description would continue. What the movie lacked was the growing sense of urgency that the Queen, upon maturing in her royal status, began to display to the people and her court. The film also failed to show Marie Antionette's growing participation in the political direction of the French monarchy. Missing is her highly noted (and disdained) influence on Louis XVI's decision-making.Instead, all we see is a frivolous teenager, who spends most of her days shopping, eating, gossiping, and partying. Only towards the end of the movie, do we see the Queen's loyalty to her king, vowing to stay at Versailles until the bitter end. But even then, her role is limited, playing more the part of loyal wife that influential political force. Because of this, the Queen never grows up, and in a sense remains a child; and thus the movie does the same, displaying the beginnings of something great, but never quite flourishing to it's truly monumental state.http://www.lavishmag.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,History

An allegory of adolescence,"Fair warning: This film is not historically accurate. It doesn't go into French history, politics or the revolution. Although anyone can enjoy this movie, it was mainly intended for teenage girls and young women.Marie Antoinette was born into extreme wealth and is most famously known as the last queen of France. She was also just a girl. When she married Louis XVI, she was only 14.This is a story about Marie Antoinette the girl, not the queen.It's a beautiful film that tells its story a little differently. Not by appealing to our intellect, but our emotions. It won't make you think so much as FEEL everything that's happening on screen. Coppola achieves this with a bittersweet soundtrack and dreamy visuals, shot with so much care and attention to detail, it almost felt like I was there.Dark undertones throughout remind us that all is not as it seems. Underneath the onslaught of pretty things, towers of macarons and free-flowing champagne, virtue goes to die.None of this is said aloud or dwelled on by the characters. The story progresses at a rapid pace with quick cuts from scene to scene taking you on a rollercoaster ride of emotion reminiscent of adolescence.This film is not for everyone.

you cannot stay indifferent to this Marie Antoinette,"For those who come to see this movie with the expectation of seeing some historical drama or biography, this is a very different and special experience. Sofia Coppola in 'Marie Antoinette' takes the pretext of the life of the famous and infamous last queen of France and makes out of it a drama about the solitude of a young girl in a strange environment. Acted superbly by Kirsten Dunst Coppola's Marie Antoinette looks at some instances like a teenager today with modern haircut, closer to Scarlett Johansson's character in 'Lost in Translation' than to the historical character. Is the experiment successful on all plans? Certainly not, as the film gets too much into the details of the life at the court, of the garments and chocolates and interior decoration, at the expense of the differentiation of the characters that surround Marie Antoinette. So much is the movie centered around her that it is hard to distinguish the other characters around. The usage of punk music has a strong effect at the start, plays well in the ball scene, but starts to fit well later and becomes too repetitive. What we get overall is an interesting and different movie, but not a perfect one.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Sadly the central conceit, presenting Antoinette as a simple, fun-loving teenager with no real concept of her duties to state or humanity, doesn't really work and the script is extremely weak, engendering no empathy for its empty characters.

You will have sex tonight or it's back to the streets with your cards and puppies, you peasant.Seeing a young Marie Antoinette bristle and almost mock the ordain nature of being a royal was at the very least engaging. A frankly honest teen thrust into the stuffy artifice of living in the fanciest, grandest, and coldest walls. Then she stops questioning any of it and becomes part of the parlour show. Also coincidentally, that's the exact moment this film loses its promising momentum and becomes a heavy slog the way you'd think a period piece so committed to style would manage to avoid.I also think it has other contenders for this type of story that outweigh it heavily in strengths and general messaging. There are several historical films depicting this time period that do a greater deal of getting you to care for these snots, so this just feels like a lesser rip of them, a first draft that I don't much care for.It's hard to not watch Marie Antoinette and wish I was watching The Favourite, which has a very similarly plotted narrative, only its supremely better from a craft standpoint without needing to use needle drops from the Strokes or having converses in the foreground.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Eye candy yes, but perhaps deeper meaning?","The sets and costumes are outrageously sensual, on the vibrancy of the color alone the movie is worth watching. Probably a bit too clever in its attempts at camera angles, art direction, but certainly vivid and compelling to look at.Although the film does not dwell on it, the point of the rising debt of the country is made occasionally. Could the film not also be looked at as an allegory of contemporary America? Blissfully ignorant of reality in the form of bills that need to be paid? Foreign wars causing huge deficits, yet spending on whatever frivolities demanded, and neglecting the consequences? I am not sure Sofia Coppola's intent was this, but I sure see some correlation here, between Marie and the court and the majority of Americans who cannot find Iraq on a map, yet are urged even yet today by our leaders to continue shopping.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Sofia and Lance Acord make something beautiful together,"This movie might upset people who dig in to this movie of historical intentions but that is not what you should look for when you watch this beautifully shot movie. Lance Acord who has worked with Coppola on her debut short ""Lick the star"" (1998) and her Oscar winning ""Lost in translation"" (2004) make a beautiful movie together. The costumes, the scenery, the light, the photography - wonderful, mesmerizing. This film is more like visionary poetry than historical. When you watch a Sofia Coppola movie you should now her thin dialogue because she wants the pictures to tell you a story than words.I can't praise this movie enough it's so wonderful and I like how she had silent scenes where you her the sound of nature instead of music and I also like how she used modern music instead of classical music of Antoniettes time which gave the movie a very nice, atmospheric edge to it.Visual poetry is what this movie is all about!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Still life,"What a beautiful woman Kirsten Dunst has become. In this movie, which is little more than a series of beautiful pictures digesting a world long swept away, she is in her element. In fact, she IS the centerpiece element.But pretty pictures do not a memorable movie make. I've never seen cinema so lifeless, so utterly devoid of any kind of drama - and yet so watchable. Somehow, I stayed with it, even though superficial knowledge of history precludes all suspense as to how it will end. We follow the last French royal family languidly gliding through their lives of endless amusement and idle chatter, getting drunk and high at garden picnics in dreamy twilight, cavorting in bonnets, picking flowers and looking like they'd just stepped out of a Gainsborough painting.Maybe that's Coppolla's intention: To show the utter vacuousness of the French court and European aristocracy in general. This is to what rule by God's imprimatur had devolved. The era of strong monarchs like Henry, Elizabeth and Philip of Spain was over. Europe's kingdoms had become... successful. Rich. They'd bumped off all competition. The Mongol threat was ancient fable, Islam was now second-rate, and the age of worldwide empire had begun. But in its prosperity, Europe had become complicated, its economic and political underpinnings wildly sophisticated and enmeshed. Power passed to ministers who specialized in these difficult affairs; royalty was pushed to the background, to estates and sloth.Coppolla's handling of these superfluous dandies is revolutionary in one respect: She doesn't portray them as selfish monsters, or greedy imbeciles, as our tiresome, Lefty/progressive catechism would have them. They're sympathetically handled as clueless and near-infantile. The coming conflagration, and the Terror, they can neither foresee nor understand.The cast is superb, with the exception of Jason Schwartzmann as Louis. Why does this colorless and apparently talentless air-burner have a career? (He is a Coppolla relative.) The inclusion of rock-music interludes is merely jarring and obvious, but in some selections, the sour decadence of '80s pop is a perfect fit. Coppolla's sense of stunning imagery must be genetic; throwaway scenes turn gripping, as when a rider gallops down a pathway, his dress boots tied backwards to his saddle.Perversely, this ""Marie"" made me appreciate Norma Shearer's over-the-top version even more. As emotional and melodramatic as it is, it's historically accurate (there really was a Swedish diplomat lover, although whether he looked like Tyrone Power is unclear). It's a vibrant counterpoint to this beautiful, but detached ""Marie"".",7.0,Anonymous,History
Dunst checks in as the Queen,"I think Sofia Coppola aimed to make a brash fun historical drama such as Amadeus. She lacks the skills of writer Peter Shaffer who wrote Amadeus first as a stage play. She also lacks the audacity of Baz Luhrmann who bought a different visual spin to his modern interpretation of Romeo & Juliet.Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) is a young woman from the powerful Austrian Hapsburg dynasty who through marriage formed alliances with its European neighbours. She married the Dauphin of France, the future Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) and they live in the extravagant Palace of Versailles.Marie is first inexperienced with the ways of the world and the marriage is not consummated for a long time. The reasons because her husband does not engage in having sex with her. Marie is under pressure to produce a heir.Over time, her husband becomes King of France, she does have children and becomes known for grand parties and lavish spending on clothes.When revolutionary fever hits France, the royal family are at risk.The film is gorgeously photographed, has wonderful costumes and exquisite art direction. You can see the money spent on the screen.It has a modern take, such as contemporary music and it does feel like those high school rom coms transplanted to historical France. It is self indulgent with a thin frothy story that goes on for too long because Coppola wants to film sunrises and parties.Dunst is fine but she is not well served by the script but as Marie matures she dolls up her hair, wears lavish clothes and has a collection of shoes. She even takes in a lover. Coppola follows in her father's footsteps with a little bit of nepotism in the casting. Jason Schwartzman is her cousin and he is weak here, maybe because the script has given him little to do.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Visually fantastic but lacking in story or character,"This is a misfire by Sofia Coppola not because it is a bad film but because considering the subject it could have been so much more than what we have got. MarieAntoinette is mostly about the Dauphine's adjustments to the customs of the French court and her attempts to conceive. The more interesting material, including a possible affair and the growing unrest of the common people, is left to the film's final 40 minutes. By then, a portion of the audience will have fallen asleep. The movie looks great, with impeccable period detail and glorious visuals, but the plot is stagnant. The lack of character development results in an uninteresting story. Plus, there's no villain to provide conflict. For a while, it appears that Madame du Barry might fill the role, but she is removed about half-way through the film, leaving a void. This is a disappointing film.",,Anonymous,History
This film is what it is....,"I just happened to catch this version of ""Marie Antointette,"" made in 2006, on the Sundance Channel one evening. Being a fan of Sofia Coppola (""Virgin Suicides"" ""Lost in Translation"") I got engrossed in it. Kirsten Dunst plays the ill-fated queen, and she seems to look the part both in age and femininity. The period costumes are great, and Dunst wears them well, along with the occasional outrageous hairstyles. That is about as far as it goes: Dunst's performance is completely lacking in any substance, and I did not believe I was viewing a queen from another century, just a modern-day actress playing make believe. Everyone knows the basic story: teen-ager Marie marries Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman, an odd casting choice). Louis seems to have little interest in Marie sexually -- today we would likely say he is gay, but probably at that time he was just considered socially awkward, although he does seem to cavort with a lot of pretty male friends. Anyway, they do eventually manage to have kids. Marie seems to find an outlet from her somewhat cold and distant husband in an odd assortment of friends, all as materialistic as she. She also has an affair, etc. In looking at this film, the obvious comparison to the 1938 version of ""Marie Antoinette"" with Norma Shearer and Robert Morley has to be made. While certainly the older film is superior in many ways -- although one has to consider its historical accuracy not 100%, but better than this one. And while Shearer was certainly a superior actress to Dunst, she was also way too old for the part. The original film also dragged out the imprisonment and death of Marie Antointette way too long; this one just shows Marie -- who sticks by her husband all the way through the overthrow -- riding off to face certain death. Mercifully, we are spared the gory details. This film is what it is: a showpiece for great costumes, breath-taking scenery, and a soundtrack that is clearly aimed at the under-30 crowd. I liked it, but I didn't take it seriously.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Surprisingly different,"When I first heard Marie Antionette was coming out, I thought "" Another history movie"". I am still young but I have always loved the French Revolution. I think the movie was a brave choice is how it was done. I agree that the factual points in the movie aren't very accurate which can cause disappointment. I feel as though this movie went deeper into more than what we can read in a textbook. It shows more of her struggles as being queen and just being young and having a forced marriage. I think it's a movie that younger people can relate too. It's not like watching a ""history movie"". This movie caused me to go and look up more on Marie Antionette. If you are going to watch the movie looking for a bunch of facts and historical items then you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a movie that will tell a different story about Marie Antionette then I suggest you give it a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"so sweet, so nice, but not a history lesson","This film is not for diabetics, as it is overly sweet & nice.just like all the sugary desserts & confections on display.Miss Coppola made a pretty to look at film about a royal teen aged King & Queen.There is no action scenes in the film except for a mob scene at the palace at the end of film,before the family is arrested.If you do not know the actual events of this unfortunate pair, & what eventually happens, you will be lost.Even though there is some historical truth told, DO not use this as a history lesson unless you are in the third grade (7-8 years old).Its a pleasant film nicely acted, ( no award nominations though). No one performance stands out for mention.The sets, costumes etc. are nice to look at & do seem real. The main jarring note is the modern song score, it dilutes the value of the film, Hearing a modern type song by todays performers does not fit the 1780's period.If you want something light & frothy see this,its likable & at times humorous.This is the kind of film we used to say were----5 minute films----5 minutes after seeing it, you forget why you liked it..rating: *** (out of 4)-- 82 points (out of 100)__ IMDb 7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,History
Right on the money at the expense of the audience,"My first reaction after watching Marie Antoinette ... shallow, empty, and annoying. There is little plot or character development. Scenes are meshed together like an extended music video. The music is redundant and inappropriate (we will come back to it later). Obviously intended for the MTV audience, Marie-Atoinette really tried my patience.However, I can argue that Sofia Coppola was right on the money with that. Marie-Antoinette is most likely to be a 18th century rich party-girl, with all the fixings and cake. Her life was likely to revolve around gossips, shopping, and keeping the royal bloodline. Her life prior to the Revolution was likely to be shielded from the rest of France. On those points, I think the film hits the spot.On top of that, Kirsten Dunst was suited for the role. The lack of dialogue (again, probably true in those days, not much dialogue aside from gossip and the superficial) was made up for with her expressions. The character may appear shallow, Dunst captured every emotional nuance without uttering a word.But in the mean time, Coppola somehow didn't think that the audience would catch that. So she made the most annoying decision. She used ""modern"" music to express M-A's inner thoughts. The film was already very fine without music at all. The introduction of the music made it simply unbearable to watch. This approach was somewhat successful in Knight's Tale (remember the medieval ""We will Rock You""?) because the Ledger/Battney duo were never meant to be taken seriously. Marie-Antoinette was branded as serious drama, and was treated so. The idea just backfired.Finally, after watching Godfather III, I had a feeling that Sofia Coppola was playing herself. Afterall, she accepted the role in very short notice. Without committing libel, I believe this film about Marie Antoinette is a reflection of her personality. I just hope that Sofia didn't have the Strokes playing in her head when she was with Spike Jonze.",7.0,Anonymous,History
i kinda loved it!,"i just got from the movie and i got to say that ""Marie Antoinette"" is somewhat.. unexpected!! it's like champagne with grenadine syrup... just UNEXPECTED.. but good!! i am french and i have heard about Marie Antoinette for as far as i can remember! we all know here that she did some scandalous things and she wasn't as nice as she is depicted in the movie, for example, when she bowed on the balcony at the end without a single word, she actually said ""i don't want to say anything to those people"" and she just bowed.. i think it's quite important to show that she wasn't concerned at all about normal people, she despised them. another bad point, is that the movie stops when she leaves Versailles to go to Metz, I wanted to watch the story till the end.. when she is stopped in a tavern, the king recognized thanks to his head printed on a coin, sent back to Paris in the Bastille ( the jail ), how the queen got depressed while staying there ( it is said that she got old at once, her hair turned white )and her death. To me, this movie lacks profoundness, too shallow... but the way it was filmed, the idea to mix pop rock music and the acting of the actors was definitely soooo great!

"Across the board, an abject, dismal failure. Stinker.","I read some remarks by Sofia Copola, regarding Marie Antoinette and her impetus for wanting to make this film. Finally got around to seeing it. Oy, what a stinker.""My biggest fear was making a 'Masterpiece Theatre' kind of movie. I didn't want to make a dry, historical period movie with the distant, cold tableau of shots. It was very important to me to tell the story in my own way. In the same way as I wanted LOST IN TRANSLATION to feel like you had just spent a couple of hours in Tokyo, I wanted this film to let the audience feel what it might be like to be in Versailles during that time and to really get lost in that world."" In this one stated goal of Ms. Copola's, I never had a ghost of a chance to feel like was anywhere near that world, the world of Versailles at that time. I was prevented from any possibility of entering that deliciously inviting world by a production that missed the mark in just about every possible way.The gawd-awful contemporary popular rock music really makes it hard to feel anything relating to the 18c period. The songs were all VERY recognizable songs that commanded my attention, relegating the visual component of the film into a music video. Composers of film scores throughout the ages, and up to the present, use the very powerful tool of music to guide the audience's feelings and emotional response to the images on film. Ms. Copola has subjugated her role as director to making servile accompaniments to workmanlike rock music.The costumes and hair were looking awfully shoddy. I mean to say that they looked nice, but they came nowhere near what is depicted of Marie Antoinette and other ladies of the court of Versailles in paintings and even other films. The high water mark for costumes, certainly for 18c French Royalty will have to remain with the 1938 version of Marie Antoinette, directed by Woody Van Dyke.The casting was disappointing. If this film is supposed to ape the populist appeal of The Knight's Tale, then, it should be a lite enough effort with a young enough cast and a cursory and superficial gesture at costuming and settings to satisfy the 12 - 18 year old demographic whom will flock to this picture. Kirsten Dunst just does not look like anything other than a vivacious teenager. Marie Antoinette became queen at age nineteen, but she continued to sit as queen until her untimely death, just before her thirty-eighth birthday. Jason Schwartzman as a French noble who would be king? That's a stretch that is too hard to fathom.The script was the final insult with dialogue written as though it were excerpted from any garden variety contemporary sit-com, with bad grammar, extremely casual and dumbed-down lexicon and sarcastic wisecracking. There was no hope for my being able to suspend disbelief even for a moment and buying into Sofia Copola's jejune effort at making a historical biopic with that kind of bad writing.This film is a complete failure, but if it piques the imagination of young people enough to inspire them to learn a little more about the history of this time period and some of the principal characters in the story (which is FASCINATING! it's well worth the time and energy!!), then, it's not a completely wasted effort. But, as a film to be judged upon its own merits, this lame outing clearly demonstrates why contemporary American cinema is to be largely dismissed as garbage.See the 1938 version of Marie Antoinette starring Norma Shearer, it too is flawed, but it will at least give you a more realistic depiction of life then and there.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Why is the film getting such bad reviews??,"This film is completely on par, if not more solid than much of her other work. I admit Lost In Translation was better, but Marie Antoinette is still a wonderfully unique experience. Beautiful direction and photography, as well as strong performances from Schwartzman and Dunst make this, in my opinion, the second best film of the year, the first being Babel. The music choices, though risky, proved extremely effective in creating the atmosphere of the film. Compared with her other films, Antoinette may be superior stylistically and second to Lost in Translation in depth of the story.A must see for those who can tolerate directors who dare to make films that are different.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty to look at not so fun to watch,"As a history fanatic I found this movie right on target with what really happened in the life of Marie Antoinette. As much as I loved Sofia Coppola's previous movies this one was lacking something. The actors and actress were great as well as the setting (at real locations, no less) and the costumes but still something irritated me about this movie. Oh yes, the music! Maybe Sofia was trying to convey some message about how young they were and portrayed their youthfulness through the soundtrack, who knows but it was out of place in such a beautifully filmed movie.Kirsten Dunst was stunning, as usual in this film. She oddly looked like Diana Scarwid in her Mommie Dearest role in a few scenes. The chemistry between her and Jason Schwartzman was minimal, which since in real life the King and Queen were not too thrilled with one another at the beginning of their relationship, this was fitting. But toward the end, there seemed a tenderness toward one another that I thought they played on very well with gestures and looks.I loved Jason Schwartzman's portrayal of King Louis XVI. From accounts the King was quiet, shy, said little to most and loved to hunt. Jason pulled this off perfectly and left you feeling sorry for him toward the end of this movie.Character development was little. Toward the end of the movie I really didn't care what happened to them and the ending might have been fitting so not to dwell on their depressing fate but I still felt cheated in the end and all I was thinking of was how pretty this movie was too look at. And it made me want to go eat oodles of fancy cakes. Some of the actors spoke with an accent while most did not but it did not bother me as much as I thought it would with a period film.Overall I gave this movie a 6 because of the fact that it was such a darn pretty movie! It had much more potential if it had more character development and a not the music-video-gone-wrong soundtrack.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A shallow film about shallow people,"There are deep films about shallow people like La Dolce Vita, there are films that probe beneath the rituals of the court like The Rise of Louis XIV, there are films that are rather sympathetic to Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI but have a political and historical dimension like La Marseillaise, but Coppola's film is a shallow film about shallow people, it reveals only the surface rituals of the court, and is a bubble-head's view of history and politics. The revolution is just 'noises off' in the last ten minutes. However, the film is easy on the eye, less easy on the ear and very easy on the brain.

This strange mix between the grandeur of Versailles and an emotional portrait of a girl (by accident the Queen of France) works amazingly well for most part of the movie.

The music is generic and has nothing to do with the scenes, Coppola needs a lesson from Baz Luhrman. The camera work and lighting are mediocre at best, especially with what they had to work with. The dialogue was written for someone in grade school. I just really can't believe people got together, spent tons of money and made this movie.

Really the worse directing I've seen in a good while and a thoughtless editing to match it. What a waste of money and resources this director has committed, not unlike the actions of the heroine it tried and failed to portray. The characters were not at all developed. The dialogue was at the level of a bad high school play. The storytelling is so blah that you wonder what's all the talk about this Marie Antoinette character about! She is so totally misrepresented and made to be so uninteresting that you really want her to be really bad to at least be there. There is too much weakness in the movie to recount without reliving the pain suffered watching it. Unfortunately I sat through the whole thing hoping that it would finally go somewhere, come to something. But that was a mistake, because watching more of the same repeated shots and scenes just makes them more painful and boring. Take my word, don't waste your time.

Sex  (less?) on a Huge Bed.,"I just now saw this 6 years old film. It still looks very nice. Gorgeous paintings of that famous (infamous?) Versailles period in every frame, just before the French Revoution terminated all that in a blood bath (Guillotine for everyone, including later for most of the revolutionaries that dethroned Marie Antoinette's King husband, herself, family and friends).I read some of the reviews and many of them are such a scream that I couldn't stop laughing. For example, they say that this movie was an experiment by Sofia Coppola where she compares contemporary adolescent Angst with an adolescent Queen from Versailles and that the contemporary music clarifies that concept making the union between Marie Antoinette's eighteen century and our present next door troubled teenager perfectly clear for any informed person... (shame on you if you didn't get this previous information).That's nice.Pity that Coppola didn't incorporate her thesis in a less cryptic message, since her movie is a perfectly conventional period piece (contemporary music alone won't make ANY connexion as a Time Machine subterfuge).Another thing: The clothes were absolutely breathtaking (each scene Marie Antoinette is seen with another outfit, and what an outfit!!!) ""This thing? --she will say-- I just found this thing in the closet""... (no, I'm kidding, she has never said that).The food shots run into the thousands and the Home Economist/s that prepare them must have had a ball, because their resources were obviously tremendous.And watching these darlings stuffing their faces with all that food piling up or toppling down from silver/gold trays placed all over, and apparently eating non stop from morning to next morning (they seemed to live entirely for pleasure and never slept) one wonders how could they hold all that volume of food in their incredible 18 inches waistlines... (I know, they were corseted to death, but corsets can go only that far..., the rest has to burst out in some other unexpected places...).And then we have the issue of authenticity: It's notorious the lack of personal hygiene as close to us as the beginning of the XXth Century, same with laundering (then done by hand by laborious washer women) so, how come they wore (in the film) those fabulous SPOTLESS garments, many of the gorgeous fabrics machine embroidered (?) wrinkle free (?), hems impeccable (they didn't walk only on polished multicolored marble floors, because again, we know through historical research that these aristocrats would squat down on the marble stairs and do all their bodily needs there (neither toilet paper nor bidets were available then as incredible as it seems now to anybody living in a civilized country) so they would get up and continue walking and talking as if nothing happened and obviously without ever looking back (the train of their dresses took care of that).According to very serious historians, the smells in Palace where nothing comparable to Chanel #5... and that, next to unwashed armpits (not mentioning more alarming body creases...), terrible dental conditions --diseased gums and teeth-- will make us say, as W.C. Fields stated on his tombstone: ""I Rather Be in Philadelphia"".Should a period movie disregard these facts as too crude for our contemporary sense of prudery and give us just colorful Fashion Plates to delight our senses or should they instruct us in the true facts of life as it was lived then?British designers for period wardrobe --and hairstyles, make up, etc.-- in the movies, are the best for period authenticity right now, they make a great deal of research to produce the most authentic garments and general ambiance.I think this ""Authentic versus Bogus period thing"" is a question opened for debate.""Marie Antoinette"" is a visually glorious movie and quite entertaining if you only want a Reader's Digest Summary of that particular French period in their history, and very-very pretty shots.",8.0,Anonymous,History
What the hell was she thinking?,"Being a complete fan of Sofia Coppola's, it pains me to say this, but I found this movie to be deplorable. I don't care whether she was as sexually emancipated as this version of her life story would make her out to be or whether she was as prim and proper as a Victorian spinster. It's the entire film that doesn't gel for me. I've seen other people rag on The Virgin Suicides or on Lost in Translation, but both of them so far exceed Marie Antoinette that it is hard for me to even type their titles in the same sentence. From the music choices to some of the costume to quite a bit of the casting and to the lack of character development, the whole thing just really does not work.As was mentioned by at least one other user, Sofia does have a tendency to let silence and a certain type of vagary work in her favor in relaying the story she's telling. Obviously, this worked beautifully in Lost In Translation, but she also had Bill Murray there (who is a master of mere facial expression) and the sheer madness and foreignness of Tokyo to boost her style of storytelling while also making it seem subtle yet defined. In The Virgin Suicides, this once again worked in her favor because the story relies on the mystery of these sisters and an enigmatic and ethereal quality through which the boys witnessing and relaying the story to us have toward these girls. To know the precise hows and whys of their lives and demise would be to tell a completely story than the one that is the Virgin Suicides.All that being said, when you get into historical figures, you just cannot wander into esoteric land and expect it to carry a film through. I, personally, want the meat and bones of the person even though I'm clued in enough to realize that after awhile every historical figure gets skewed one way or another. I do not believe that this movie can be defended on the grounds of poetic license. If you want to see poetic license work in a film, I would much more recommend Romeo + Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio and Clare Danes. The director made bold choices, made it clear to the audience that he was reinterpreting a very famous work. Granted, the characters are fictitious, but given that Shakespeare wrote them and they've been reenacted for 500 years, they're as close as you can get to historical without having been living breathing human beings.All in all, really a flop in my opinion.

Unfair reviews,"I honestly don't get the hate that I see on here for this movie. I can't be the only one that sees that the way Coppola has captured Marie Antoinette is as a sad lonely young woman who is at first unsure of her hold of her place in the society she's been thrust into and so throws herself into her vices and like many teenagers is unaware of the damage her actions are causing and therefore ends up too deep and too selfish to completely give it all up.
I saw one person complain that the film completely ignores the revolution... This person has clearly missed the point of the film being an insular look at a young woman thought by many to be a villian of history and NOT a study of this particular French revolution.
Yes the film ends without a trial or a hint of the family's execution and somebody here thought that was dumb in case the audience didn't know the real truth but honestly, who doesn't go into a film like this without at least some idea of the history or at least the ability to Google it!My only real complaint is that they didn't specify/explain the 'condition' that meant she stayed at her country estate for so long. It seemed like years.",8.0,Anonymous,History
What a waste.... Only eye candy (and limited at that),"Such a waste. The whole of the Château of Versailles as a backdrop for this film. Great period costumes. And then...........slow, boring, inappropriate music trying to place MA in the 21st century. It starts off well showing the difficulties of 18th Century life in the court of Versailles, but then tries to Americanize the experience of the young MA as though living in Hollywood in the Paris Hilton age. Total disgust. The plot slows down to show the ennui of the palace life and probably distorts it as well. The few accurate historic lines (recorded and repeated often in French history classes) just barely rectify the situation.

waste of money,"""Clueless meets Barry Lyndon"" with neither the wit of Alicia Silverstone nor the cinematography of Stanley Kubric.Marie Antoinette is an unsuccessful mix of contemporary music, plain language, amateurish cinematic directing, and very poor editing. While well photographed and properly acted, the combination of painfully long shots and banal dialogue made for a two hour movie that seemed to run four hours. Some scenes such as the carriage ride to France, shots of Versailles, and many of Kristin reminded me of watching paint dry. Other shots looked like home movies with pans that went nowhere and added nothing to the narrative. If this had been an Indy film, it may have been excusable as a good first effort. However, this was a major release with minor efforts in many key areas  a waste of money both in the studio and at the box office.Lastly, the movie kept all the visceral aspects of the French Revolution far from the audience just at the French government kept it from the royal couple. Unfortunately, it did not translate into viewer empathy for either Ms. Dunst, who was hardly convincing as a 14-year old, or Mr. Schwartzman, a clear candidate for the role of Nero in a G-rated remake of Caligula.Sofia needs to take some more lessons from her dad in the art of making a major release.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Critics are too harsh,"I read reviews only AFTER i see movies because I hate critics. This time what I saw was no different, I loved this film. The more I think about it the more I liked it.The only reviewer that I would even consider reading before a go to a movie would be the Onion's AV club. The only reason is, is that I'm used to what they say and I can sift through all the crap. Although I did not read the AV club before-hand, they do make light of the really notable things about the movie, such as Sofia Coppola's directing skills, but they weren't thrilled about the movie as a whole, being too much like a normal period piece that has to check off every major point in the history of Marie Antoinette. But this wasn't what concerned me, All over I have been hearing the complaints about the rock, punk, and new-wave soundtrack laying on top of the film. It frustrates me, because this only means that Sofia Coppola took a creative way to express pretty much a child queen. And I didn't think that it was in any way too distracting from the movie.Another reason why critics lower this movie is because of Kirsten Dunst's role. I did see how they could have thought that her ""flat line-readings"" took away from it, but it felt as if that feeling went away after at least 10 minutes into the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"One drawn out shot after another...it looks good, but just drags on and on.","Marie Antoinette has never been a sympathetic character in the history books, and it's always been said that she deserves what came to her for spending too much money and being arrogant. In this reinvisioning (or perhaps it's partially how it actually happened) Antoinette just becomes a relateable and somewhat likable character. Sofia Coppola decided to make this feel more modern by adding contemporary music, and this might make the queen more relateable. But instead, it just drags the movie out with long scenes of music and no dialogue. For a film that is in essence a character piece (as nothing else happens but mild character development), there just isn't enough dialogue to develop much at all.For the plot of this film, it's pretty much just the story of Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) and the story of her life. Her failed sex life with King Louis XVI and her shaking up of the role of the queen. It's a new take on the history lesson, but like an overly long history lecture, this grows very tiring.This film completely relies on aesthetic pleasures. The sights and cinematography are very pleasing to the eyes, and there are some beautiful shots. The music is overly plentiful and featured in every scene, but often times the music, though contemporary, is fitting. The problem is every scene uses this music. Five lines will be said and then the film breaks into music for several minutes. Some of these scenes can be chalked up to character development by pondering and looking at the world. They can be considered reflective scenes, but it's just an excuse to show their nice sets and play some music and write no dialogue.The performances are fine, though purposefully inaccurate. Dunst uses an American accent, as does Jason Schwartzman, and nobody seems to use a French accent at all. Not a mistake, just part of the reinvisioning.Overall, this movie is too long, and there's too much music, and despite some nice scenes, and great looks, this film literally has nothing else going for it.My rating: ** out of ****. 120 mins. PG-13 for sexuality.",5.0,Anonymous,History
understated historical drama,"Perhaps unfairly, the name Marie Antoinette has become virtually synonymous with the upper class' indifference to the sufferings of the poor. Even all these centuries later, many people still believe that the much-maligned French queen actually uttered the words, ""Let them eat cake,"" when confronted with the news that her subjects were starving (the phrase actually comes from a play popular at the time). Writer/director Sofia Coppola's new film, ""Marie Antoinette,"" based on the book ""Marie Antoinette: The Journey"" by Antonia Fraser, seems determined to clear her name and change that perception.In this film, Marie Antoinette is seen as a sheltered, somewhat frivolous young girl unprepared for the role history was about to thrust upon her. The movie begins at the moment when the Archduchess of Austria, aged 14, has been promised in wedlock to France's Prince Louis XVI as part of a treaty between the two countries. She is quickly whisked away to her new nation and new role, becoming a virtual prisoner to the proscribed rites and regulations of court life at Versailles in the late 18th Century.In a wise move artistically (if not commercially), Coppola has seen fit to bleed the film of most of its potential hyperbole and melodrama, choosing instead to concentrate on the gossipy pettiness and mind-numbing rituals of royal life at that time. We see Marie completely stripped of any sense of personal privacy, as she endures the indignities of a virtual cast of thousands having a hand in her dressing herself in the morning and being constantly under the watchful eye of moral advisers on the lookout for any breach of etiquette or protocol deemed unbecoming of a queen. Coppola immerses us in all the finery and opulence of the glittery setting, while the drama ever so subtly plays itself out. Even though Marie clearly resents the restricted life she is forced to endure, she rarely whines or wallows in self-pity, choosing instead to accept her role with an uncomplaining, almost fatalistic, good grace. Even when her husband refuses for years to consummate their marriage, she remains generally sympathetic to him and understanding of his ""problem."" There are those who will find this movie slow-moving, stultifying, and boring because it doesn't go over-the-top by focusing on major moments of crisis or by overplaying the queen's famed cruelty or self-indulgence. She is, instead, seen as a woman neither actively engaged in the outside world nor entirely dismissive of it. Some have objected to the fact that the filmmakers have stacked the deck in her favor by showing us so little of what life was like for the suffering populace of the nation. But it is just that insularity that helps us to see how a woman with such an apparently good heart could have been so badly misunderstood by those in her own time and by generations that followed. At the end, when she and her family are being carted off to certain doom by a mob thirsting for rectification and vengeance, she seems genuinely bewildered, yet also strangely heroic in her stoicism and grace. Much of this is due to the tour de force performance by Kirsten Dunst, who never overstates the obvious but allows us to see the complex woman trapped beneath all the jewel-encrusted trappings of pampered French royalty. Marie may not display an interest in world affairs or the arcane machinations involved in running a nation, but she is shrewd enough to know how to maneuver her way through the often absurdly arbitrary power politics of court life.The movie has garnered perhaps its greatest notoriety for employing an anachronistic rock music soundtrack (a la ""A Knight's Tale""). For me, this worked fairly well (though I don't think it is indispensable to the film by any stretch), mainly because it brings a more contemporary sensibility to a film that might otherwise feel weighted down by period piece stuffiness. History-obsessed purists may object to the choice, but even they may find compensation in the relatively understated and historically accurate approach the screenplay has taken towards her life as a whole.""Marie Antoinette"" is, more than anything else, a study of repression, of what happens when human beings are locked into figurative gilded cages and then are expected to go about their daily lives as if anything really mattered. Seen in that light, this is a very sad, very poignant - though often quite funny - movie indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Maybe he was entranced by the C-name, too.What a misbegotten mess this is! Here was a chance for a truly talented screenwriter to create an exciting, funny, dramatic script about one of the most tragic eras in history. Instead, we get Coppola's Cliff-notes version of French history, accompanied by an anachronistic soundtrack that keeps reminding the viewer that an immature hack is behind this ""entertainment.""

The costumes. As long as it's a movie about clothes, they might as well be great-looking, and they are. The large crowd scenes are visually overwhelming.2. The sense of court protocol. We do get a glimpse of how fanatical the courtiers were about rank, etiquette, and procedure. Scenes in the queen's bedroom or the dinner table are excruciatingly rule-bound, which does give us a glimpse into Marie's attitude.3. The locations. Interiors and exteriors are breathtaking.

"""An excellent way of giving life to the story of the last queen of France, Marie Antoinette""","I really liked how Sofia Coppola, the director, has communicated with this movie the incredible and exiting story of the last queen of France. This movie is based on a book and she, the director, perfectly gave it life in this brilliant movie. I personally think that the soundtrack and the clothing of this movie were really well chosen and that the point of view of the story was really open minded. They did this movie in the real palace of Versailles, which makes it a lot more real.The cast was also really well chosen, Kristen Dust was perfect as the character of Marie Antoinette, a 14-year-old Austrian Princess that has to go marry the future king of France (Louis XVI) to close the alliance between France and Austria, with her stunning expression and amazing way of acting.When you watch ""Marie Antoinette"" you feel like it is a really romantic and exiting story with all the beautiful dresses, the incredible food, the amazing castle of Versailles, the diamonds, the Champaign, the breath-taking parties  but at the same time, when all the sparkle ends, that it is also a really dramatic movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Overlong, boring and inaccurate","Watching this movie, I was repeatedly reminded of the fifties ""Sisi"" trilogy starring Romy Schneider. Only, that had a plot. Here, all you get are the endless sweet-colored pictures, the occasional pomp&circumstance scenes, and the idealized, soft-focus versions of the real characters. And then all of a sudden (yet, still at least half an hour too late) it's all over, exactly at the point where the action, i.e., the Revolution starts. Okay, so Sofia Coppola was not aiming for a historically correct depiction of Marie-Antoinettes life. She must have realized that historical accuracy was not an option in a film that has Louis XVI's Parisians dancing in the foyer of an opera house that wasn't built for another 100 years. The question is, what WAS she aiming for? I must confess that I have no idea. Unless she was trying to convey to the viewer the boredom of the Queen's life. That worked - I was magnificently bored. The repetitive scenes of M-A's gambling, drinking and dressing are very colorful, but you fill up on them pretty quickly. The attempts at sketching a historical context are so perfunctory that I can't think why they bothered at all. And the much discussed use of pop music in the score is utterly random, a mere gimmick without any deeper meaning. There are no characters to identify with. Most of the cast never rises above caricature, with the gay hairdresser as the absolute nadir. Unbelievable that somebody still has the guts... Louis XV is not far behind, the acting verging on the amateurish. Dunst, too, has hardly more to offer than vague smiles, dimpled cheeks and perambulations in dazzling rooms; it is not like there is a script full of brilliant dialog that offers major acting opportunities. Instead, there's another box of shoes, another glass of champagne, another party. It's the cinematic variant of muzak. Anything positive? Well, one thing that is spot-on is the way the film shows how the lives of M-A and Louis were lived in public, and the often ridiculous and/or embarrassing consequences of this. Also, Coppola at least had the decency to grant M-A that she never actually said ""let them eat cake"". But it would have been so much nicer to see such accuracy embedded in a film that takes its subject seriously overall, and not merely uses it as an excuse to indulge visual sweet-tooths.",3.0,Anonymous,History
More than a Trifle...,"From its beguiling star Kirsten Dunst to the maddeningly beautiful locales to the visual sumptuousness and ""taste"" (you almost feel as if you could eat some of the scenery and clothes) of the costumes and art design, Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" is an entrancing and lavish period piece of the highest order.Many of the early scenes of the Austrian and French woodlands and the palatial splendor of Versailles are cloaked in an almost ""otherworldly"" austerity, evoking the spirit of Stanley Kubrick's ultimate costume-drama, ""Barry Lyndon."" Later, when our heroine finds some inner piece at the countryside estate she is given as a gift after the birth of her first child, Coppola immerses the viewer in the transcendent splendor of natural sounds and beautiful images that channels the fluid mise-en-scene composition of the best work of Terrence Malick. All of this is tied together by Coppola's now signature dreamily listless camera play that makes her unlike any other director working today.In the lead role, Kristen Dunst is mesmerizing. She's always been a better actress than she's been given credit for. She's only previously been allowed to really stretch her acting muscle when she took on the role of Marion Davies in the excellent ""Cat's Meow"" and as the emotionally unstable teen in the misguided ""Crazy/Beautiful."" Here, without much dialouge, and present in just about every scene, she speaks volumes with her eyes and body language. Coppola only briefly channeled into Dunst's innate talents in ""The Virgin Suicides"" and wonderfully fulfills the promise of a fruitful director/actor collaboration that those with a keen eye could divine from their first experiment together.Of course, those who measure a biopic by its historical accuracies will cry blasphemy at some of the treatment here, most notably the use of new-wave pop music in equal measure with a classical score. Also, the drama of the French Revolution is glossed over spare for the final ten minutes, almost as it it were a side-note in history. The vapidness and decadence of the French Court is Coppola's focus, as is the alienation of a people from their government, family members from each other, and most importantly a young woman from herself. Though this classic theme of alienation (which permeates many of the great films from Coppola's father's contemporaries) seems to be treated here with a softer touch that on the surface paints it as a trifle...the haunting closing scenes of Dunst leaving Versailles behind forever are not without their emotional resonance.If Coppola delivers us a big hit with her next project, or not too far thereafter...then I suspect in about ten or fifteen years, ""Marie Antoinette"" will be looked upon far more fondly than it has been thus far. Rightfully its costume design took home an Oscar. If the movie gods smile down upon us, Coppola will have a long fruitful career, and this film will surely be more than just a foot note of her early days.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Stick to what you know....,"My response to this film falls with all those who are observing what a fundamentally weak piece of work it is. Obviously some enjoy it for their various reasons, but I have to agree with many others that this film is poorly done in many ways and on many levels: pacing and narrative are incredibly weak, the music and visuals are annoying (to me), and the historical angle is woefully bad. Poor Kirsten Dunst, to have soldiered through her role in such a disaster! It seems to be me that the film demonstrates that filmmakers only really make films about what they know (not an original conclusion, but this film seems a good demonstration of the general principle). After succeeding with Lost in Translation, clearly Ms. Coppola has a good grasp on subject matter involving rich yuppies living in privileged circumstances in the Reagan-Bush era. Here, I think, she has tried to project this kind of subject matter back onto the late eighteenth century, but, alas, she knows nothing about the late eighteenth century, or the French Revolution, etc. She should have picked subject matter she could get a better grasp on.I hope she's able to recover from this one and follow it with something successful.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Coppola can do better.,"""Ennui""For a French-based film by a most promising writer/director, I can think of only the word for BORING. How is it possible to spend millions of dollars on one of the most sumptuous-looking films in years and yet create a story so devoid of character and drama as to make Dangerous Liaisons seem an energetic masterpiece? Based on Antonia Fraser's book about the archduchess of Austria and later queen of France, Marie Antoinette is about a 14 year old girl imported for breeding purposes to be Louis XVI's wife. That the French revolutionaries see her as the symbol of French decadence is as well known as her lovely neck.Surely Sofia Coppola can do better with the story of Marie Antoinette, one of the most fascinating characters out of history, whose famous line, ""Let them eat cake,"" probably wasn't even hers. The subject cries out for an informed, vital discovery of her real place in the French Revolution. What we get is distance and dreariness as almost an entire film is dedicated to sumptuous costuming and slacker inaction in the bed of a future king and queen.As overly long as the many interminable long shots, but beautiful in composition and lighting (How can you really go wrong with Versailles?), the lack of drama is surprising for a director whose strength is understatement and sub-textual significance. Her Oscar winning Lost in Translation is a triumph of underplaying-- two people (Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson) drawn to each other in a culture, Japan, which accentuated their loneliness, longing, and civility. And all of this subtlety is conveyed with a minimum of dialogue but a maximum of feeling from two consummate actors, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.Now Kirsten Dunst is unquestionably lovely as Marie, but when she talks her voice has a teenage tone that makes me wonder if the director had her sound as immature as Marie actually was or that Dunst is just not the actress Johansson is. In any case, no one in the film is given lines to be proud of, and no one gives a performance that could be characterized as nuanced or imaginative.Visit Versailles if you want to understand why the poor and hungry of 18th century France eventually had her head. This film will only confirm the prevailing notion that Marie was misunderstood; that she was profligate as a teenager makes for an unsatisfying 2 hour drama.",,Anonymous,History
What the...,This is really quite a good film. While Coppola's Lost In Translation was the most overrated event of it's year it seems Antoinette is going to be the most underrated film of this year.

"unfortunately, a big disappointment","I went into this movie with high expectations/hopes, despite the fact that the film wasn't well received at its Cannes premier (I loved Sophia's first two movies, and my husband and I figured that the snobs at Cannes were touché with a Hollywood take on French history; my husband is French, btw). The film was bad, and poorly made (let me stress poorly). I could see the microphone in almost every scene. My husband noticed the microphone first (because he always notices little details/mistakes), but I started noticing it as well (which means it had to be bad because I never notice anything like that). There is even one scene where you can see a man holding the microphone reflected in a mirror. It was so bad, it was ridiculous; we almost thought it was a joke. The only reasoning we could come up with to explain this sloppy editing is that they didn't have the budget to shoot take after take at Versailles.The acting was horrid; the story was a bore (or lack of story). The only thing going for it was the scenery/costumes. Plus, I liked the realism. (I hate gloried/romanticized epic historical biopics, and thankfully, this wasn't one of them). The soundtrack was modern (with some baroque music thrown in for kicks), and this didn't work at all (although it was kind of cool to hear the Cure during their coronation ceremony); the music sounded forced, like it was stuck in there just to make the film seem 'original'.

Marie Antoinette was beyond and above one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen, coming just behind GWTW. The music made the film so much fun and yet it was still very touching, uncomfortable and vulnerable. Dunst is absolutely perfect for this role and Schwartzman was surprisingly fantastic as Louis. As a history major, the film was not as historically accurate as i would have hoped for BUT the portrayal of the characters was perfect; Dunst was naive and heart-breakingly vulnerable, and Schwartzman was adorably uncomfortable and yet painfully pathetic. As far as the other characters go, Rip Torn and Asia A. were fantastic as Louis and Madame Du Barry and Molly Shannon could have been left out and replaced easily.

A bore.,"I think this film completely misfired. An interesting film could have been made with Marie-Anotinette & the decadence of the French monarchy as subject matter, but instead you are subjected to a couple of hours of mindless vogue-stylishness that looks more like an extended perfume ad than the feature film it occasionally tries to be. Kirsten Dunst looks amazing every time she is on screen, but because of a sparse script, the character of Marie- Antoinette is never one we can grow to care about enough. The soundtrack is ambitious but at times is very lazy in it's execution. The most obvious example of this was with the burst of The Strokes ""Whatever Happened?"". The song was too familiar, and too strong for the scene it was placed in and was ultimately more powerful than any of the scenes that preceded or followed it.

Sensuous and offbeat character study,"Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (2006) has had a mixed reception since its release almost a decade ago. Those expecting your typical, 100 percent historically accurate period drama/biopic will no doubt harbor a distaste for this movie. To be honest, MA is more of a character study than a biopic detailing the rise and fall of a queen.Coppola presents Marie Antoinette as she was when she came to the French court as a teenage bride-to-be: a culturally-alienated, flighty girl who finds solace in shopping and partying. It is a fascinating portrait of the woman and her world, a portrait that both criticizes and delights in the excess of the French elite. The whole picture is an exercise in sensual detail, reveling in silk dresses and decadent pastries and all the intricacies of 18th century European architecture, all done in candy colors and pastels.The 1980s soundtrack usually comes under fire for being anachronistic, but I thought it was inspired to link the excess of the 1980s with the indulgent French court. Kirsten Dunst's performance is also a little more 21st century than 18th at times, but it all comes down to humanizing the character, making the audience realize that Marie Antoinette was a real human being, not just some dusty, distant entity relegated to historical texts and sumptuous paintings.An underrated film and one of Coppola's finest.

In my view, a major flaw of the film is that there is no storyline taking place outside the Palace of Versailles, so we don't really get to find out much about why the people are rebelling, other than vague mentions about the cost of the war in America and the unpopularity of the Queen's extravagant lifestyle. The French Revolution was one of the great cataclysmic periods of world history, and a film set during that period has no excuse for being so deathly dull.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Freaking epic alert!!!!!!,"This movie was so freaking cool brooo. I wish we still dressed like they did in this movie. And Marie is so epic I love her omg she's so me tbh like idk she's iconic :3. Wish she was still alive tbh she was taken too sooooon broo. Like honestly she was so aesthetic too and she was so cute like ""just tell me about the war :3"" while she's trying on clothes like QUEEN MOMENTTTTT!!!! And that Swedish guy was so hot too like I get her. OMG AND THE BEST SOUNDTRACK!!!! Like when the radio dept started playing I was like damnnnn what is that sawngggggg.

Is there a message ?,"I don't want to enter into the historical debate. This film is not a historical movie. By the way it is quite funny to see the new attitude of Sofia Coppola not insisting too much now on her ""certain vision of Marie Antoinette real life"". Anyway, my comment is not there but on the movie in itself.What was the message ? Where is the scenario ? Why using the real Castle of Versailles if at the end Sofia did not make any effort on the quality of her technique : nothing on the colours (outside the poor scene on the ""sunrise close to the lake""), nothing on the image (I don't ask for a genius work on each scene but at least where is the novelty created in Virgin and Lost in Traslation). Where is the Sofia's touch ?????? In the flows of champagne, the excess of pink and the amount of cakes ?Boring, a long and boring suite of Vogue and Variety articles.Actors are so ridiculous because too much somes caricatures that you cannot believe in the story, get inside, share a certain idea of a teenager life... Nothing ... empty... from the beginning to the end.At least thank you Sofia for all the money spent for our Castle of Versailles museum... it will be used better. Americans are the biggest private contributors to our dear monument (and thousand thanks for that)but in general they prefer to organize dinners not stupid movies :=))))).One lesson from that movie ? Yes ! Real life (and real history) is much more interesting that this huge artistic error !!",1.0,Anonymous,History
Wonderful,"This is a wonderful movie. Sophia Coppola delivers another beautiful introspective film. If you appreciated the understated under-dialogued 'lost in translation' you will love this film. The history buffs may scream bloody murder but let them. The historical setting is a minor annoyance used to give the film structure while the real film is about illuminating Kirsten Dunst as Marie in every aspect of her pampered world. Sophia uses the setting of 18th century France and the character of Marie Antoinette to film an ethereal beauty of great character existing in a world of dream like lavishness and manicured perfection. Sophia clearly chose the project because, like 'L I T' you are left with a feeling of both wanting more and angst, as you really did just miss a wonderful time up on the screen. The raw rock n roll music is a mostly spot on, but occasionally seems a little forced onto some of the more serious scenes. All in all a true delight and a breath of fresh air in the formulaic world of 21st century film making.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Don't watch this if you want a history lesson,"I've read ""positive"" reviews of this bubble-headed film that claim that its very superficiality is the ""point."" We are supposed to ""infer: the film's version of Marie Antoinette's indifference to life beyond the walls of Versailles, yet the film doesn't really ask us to do that because we never see it. We can't really make a judgement on the reality of the Prince Prospero existence the nobility live in and the misery without. This is just fun and games with a little court intrigue thrown in until, suddenly, Marie and company have to leave Versailles because of some angry people on the way. Why are they angry? Who knows? What happens after that? Nothing. The movie just ends. The most interesting parts of the story are completely ignored.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful!,"I have to say that I feel sorry for the fact that many people are criticising this film. I saw it last night, and I thought it was such a beautiful film. It jumps to the point that Marie was just bored, bored of life. It shows how she was discovering new ways, and how these after a while became boring. So every day would be almost the same as the one before. Its beautiful, it shows the feelings, it is amazingly artistic as well. the ending is just perfect, it leaves more for the imagination its beautiful. Plus it is not meant to be a historical film. Also the scenery and camera work was really good as well, very beautiful. I loved this film, its a must buy. and whoever cant see that this film could be said to be a masterpiece, its missing out in the beauty of it. Although I have to admit the movie is very long, its not the type where you get bored but just sit there taking in all the detail. And i think you will only like it if you like slow moving artistic films. The blend of modern music with the past was amazing, it really did fit with the film.",,Anonymous,History
a wonderfully bright and fine movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have only positive things to say about this little ""chef-d'oeuvre"". I want to greet the actors' performance who render with panache all the emotion necessary to understand how the historical characters changed and developed until their final accomplishment. Thanks for them having succeed in inspiring what still miss today to Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette in the eyes of (too)many french people : their human side.It brilliantly shows an American perspective of French Royalty upon that turbulent period that took place a couple of years after Marie-Antoinette marrying the French Dauphin. Although splendid, I admit that this film is not really right as far as the political crisis at that time is concerned. And yet, this cliché about french revolution being particularly violent is and will unfortunately remain even in many french people's mind. However, i advice you not to see it especially for the historical perspective but rather for its sumptuous ""decors"" as the marvellous ""château de Versailles"".This film is the perfect entertainment and you will be interested in french history after seeing it, i promise you! If you want to read something interesting, try to get Marie-Antoinette correspondence, especially the letters to her mother, it is really comic and interesting! Try also to find out a almost positive biography of Louis XVI as Jean-Christian Petitfils's Louis XVI and you'll be surprised by what you'll read.

I could not believe how bad a movie could be.,"I know this film is a little old, but everything from the atrocious storyline, poor quality of acting, even the dire music is so bad ..... How this ever made it onto the screen is a mystery. Leave it unwatched!",1.0,Anonymous,History
Very well done except...,"Almost all aspects of Marie were pitch perfect. Directing, acting, political backdrop, costumes, sets designs and photography were spot on. The only problem, which to me is a major problem is the choice of the pervasive cheesy 80's pop music. I think the choice was made, because the music itself is viewed as superficial and plastic, which for a 14 year old queen would be a fairly representation. As for me, I do not appreciate the aspects of this music so it was completely annoying and out of place to me. Perhaps, a better technique would have been to play the popular cheesy 80's pop music in the instruments of the time period. That would have made the artful statement much more arty and effective, not to mention much less repulsive. The only other drawback is that the story stop right when historically Marie Antoinette got a stronger backbone. That would have made for a very interesting character transformation. Good as is, but could have been much more enjoyable. I should also state that Kirsten Dunst is one of my favorites, so I am a little biased since I enjoy seeing her on screen.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The only thing good about this movie are the costumes and sets,"Horrible horrible horrible movie! A disgustingly tasteless retelling.

Excellent except for ONE BIG MISTAKE,"I loved most things about this film.BUT...In the ""Making Of"" short on the DVD, we here the director praising music videos by Adam Ant, because of the stylization. Throughout this film, after endless expenditures of time and effort put in to make authenticity, we are subjected to wholly anachronistic rock music.Rock music is the music of rebellion. We love it because our parents hate it. There is nothing particularly rebellious about Marie Antoinette. Moving from the main palace into the Petit Trianon doesn't really count. She is generally dutiful and obedient, right up to her decapitation.If there are points of contact between her and today's audience, the music does not convince, it merely disrupts.Music videos are not an advance on feature films. They are incoherent, opportunistic fragments designed to sell CDs. Directors use them as audition pieces to move up to features. Music videos use the images of history as neat bits of art direction, nothing more. Why would this director choose to go backwards in finding her inspiration? Fortunately, the folks at American Zoetrope are prone to revisiting their films and re-editing them. Perhaps in a few years, Ms. Coppola will come back to this film and re-score it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Hungry for More,"I loved this film, Sofia really worked her magic with this film and left myself and the audience of 25 hungry for more fashion, cake and pale pink dresses. I thought the use of Rock music was such a smart technique and it worked so well in collaboration with the Opera music. The costumes were beautiful, the script was minimal- the expressions on the actors faces and the costumes spoke more than words ever could. I found the movie beautiful and quite sad, the movie had this slight sadness from start to finish. Kirsten Dunst is beautiful and enchanting as Marie Antoinette and I can't imagine someone better suited to the role of someone who essentially would've been an indie fashionista in our time. Jason Schwartzman was really good as well- I thought he played his role well and seemed lost as well which really elevated his character and made it more believable. I think the film is beautiful, evidentally- its not everybody's cup of tea. I think thats its a very modern adaptation of what you'd expect from your normal period piece, this film has attitude and is something worth seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Girl Next Door as Queen,"A word which has been much used, at least in the British press, to describe this film, is ""revisionist"", but that seems inappropriate. A revisionist version of history is one which seeks to challenge or overturn accepted viewpoints, but today the general view among historians is that Louis XVI was conscientious and well-meaning, although shy and awkward and not endowed with any great force of intellect or personality, and that Marie Antoinette, although frivolous and extravagant, was far from being the monster of popular legend. Indeed, it is generally agreed that she had some positive qualities- she was, for example, a loyal friend and a devoted mother to her children. That is precisely the picture of the Royal couple which the film portrays. Today, a truly ""revisionist"" film would be one which attempted to restore the old propagandist picture of Louis as a bloodthirsty tyrant and of Antoinette as a debauched bisexual nymphomaniac who heartlessly advised her starving subjects to eat cake.The film starts with the marriage of the fourteen year old princess to the French Dauphin as part of a diplomatic initiative to cement the alliance between France and her native Austria. It then follows her life at Versailles- her frustration with Court protocol, her quarrels with Louis XV's mistress Madame du Barry, the accession of her husband as King upon the death of his grandfather, her struggle to produce an heir and the eventual birth of her children. The film ends with the outbreak of the French Revolution, but does not depict the events leading up to Antoinette's death on the guillotine. (When the Royal couple drive off in a coach at the end of the film they are not, as some reviewers have assumed, going to their deaths- they are being taken to Paris where it is hoped they will reign as constitutional monarchs). The one controversial element is the assertion- not supported by all historians- that she had an adulterous affair with the Swedish Count Fersen.It seemed to me that the film missed a great opportunity. Had the Revolution never happened, the French would today doubtless regard Marie Antoinette in much the same way as the British regard her contemporary Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz - that is to say for most of the time they would not think of her at all, and when they did it would be as a name from a half-remembered history lesson, the consort of one of their country's duller kings. The only interest of Marie Antoinette for a modern audience is as the Queen who lost her life at the hands of the revolutionaries, and any biography of her, filmed or otherwise, is incomplete if it does not attempt to analyse why the Revolution broke out or why a section of the French population had come to detest their Royal family to such an extent that they were prepared to acquiesce in their execution. There are occasional references to food shortages, or to people's discontent at Royal extravagance and at involvement in the War of American Independence (highly unpopular in France), but these are never fully integrated into the story. The only time we see the ordinary people it is as an angry mob outside the gates of Versailles.Indeed, it sometimes seems as though Sofia Coppola pays lip-service to the Revolution in the interests of strict historical accuracy but otherwise treats it as an unwelcome interruption to the story she really wants to tell, which is the story of Marie Antoinette as the Princess Diana of the eighteenth century. Like Diana, Coppola's Antoinette is a young girl trapped in a loveless marriage to a man who cares more for his private interests- hunting and making locks- than for her. Like Diana, she is bored and frustrated by the routine and rigidity of life at Court. (The Bourbons seem to have been particularly stuffy even by the standards of eighteenth-century royalty). Like Diana, she is more spontaneous and outgoing than her emotionally reserved husband and the courtiers surrounding him. (She bursts into applause, something normally forbidden by protocol, at the opera). And, like Diana, she finds consolation in an affair with a handsome soldier, Fersen standing in for James Hewitt. The one thing lacking is a Camilla-figure, but Louis XVI was so notoriously sexless (it took him several years to consummate his marriage) that a royal mistress would not have rung true. Kirsten Dunst does not seem particularly regal, but that does not really matter as her cute charm fits in perfectly with Coppola's vision of the Queen of France as girl-next-door. (Diana, although an aristocrat by birth, was seen as the People's Princess, the girl-next-door as future Queen of Britain). Dunst's slimline figure also seems wrong for the famously voluptuous Antoinette, who was more Diana Dors than Diana Spencer.The best thing about the film was its visual recreation, in the best ""heritage cinema"" style, of the period; much was actually shot on location at Versailles. (The use of modern pop music on the soundtrack, however, was jarring).The 1760s and 1770s were a period of such riotous extravagance in interior decoration, in clothing and even in hair styles that any film set among the fashionable classes of this period cannot help but be visually sumptuous. (By the 1780s fashions had calmed down somewhat- the dresses Antoinette wears in the latter part of the film are considerably simpler and more elegant than those seen earlier). Good looks, however, are not enough to make a good film. ""Marie Antoinette"" is somewhat better than Sofia Coppola's previous effort, the overrated ""Lost in Translation, but it is a dull, slow-moving film, lacking either dramatic tension or insight into this of this period of French history. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
Absolutely fantastic!,"I finally got to see Marie Antoinette last week in Paris. My expectations were very high and I must say that I was not a bit disappointed. Everything is perfect. The acting... the costumes... the sets in Versailles. I especially loved Judy Davis' performance. Absolutely fantastic, one of the best supporting performances I have seen in a good while. Kirsten Dunst was very good, I cannot really see another actress in this role anymore. Marianne Faithful gave a good performance as Maria Theresa and Asia Argento was also great as the slutty Madame DuBarry. I could go on for hours about how much I loved this movie. Shame it's not going to be on in the UK until next year. Hopefully the DVD will come out in France later this year. Well done, Sofia!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Such sad bonbons,"Audacious, delicious, exaggerated and preposterous, Sofie Coppola's third film, Marie Antoinette, plunges into the life of the Austrian princess who became queen of France and was beheaded in the Revolution, following Antonia Fraser's recent biography in describing her as a frustrated, lonely, brave teenager who never ceased to be a child and achieved maturity just in time to die. The film is a grandiose, sometimes touching, sometimes indigestible mixture. Starting with Kirsten Dunst, a splendid actress, very touching in her openness (but does she know what it's like to become a queen?) and the sleek, stolid Jason Schwartzman, a slacker-seeker now turned teenage king. Shot largely at Versailles, it's lavish and authentic visually (or authentic-feeling; furniture and clothing had to be invented), but the film's French characters speak in English and American accents and the musical background is full of Eighties pop. Fruit of a girlish fantasy, it's a symphony of eye candy and real candy, bonbons and pinks and bright colors, a glorious superficial panorama that seeks to be a deep personal portrait of a tormented life. Perhaps 7.5/10 for screenplay, but the dazzle-factor counts for a lot.Ms. Coppola would have none of the sepia tones of historical ""Masterpiece Theater"" productions; but this isn't such a boldly original step as the film's promoters imply and the director herself acknowledges a debt to Kubrick's Barry Lynden (and used the latter's costume designer). Frears's brilliant 1988 Dangerous Liaisons comes to mind, similarly light and bright. It's also true that Marie's somewhat crude dialogue suffers by comparison with Christopher Hampton's sharp adaptation of Choderlos de Laclos. The talk in Marie is factual, or telegraphs information. The new film doesn't evoke the wit and sophistication of the eighteenth century. The story, so detailed at first, seems rushed more and more as it goes on. But still it leaves you with something. And that something may be Louis and Marie going to bed  and nothing happening, night after night. They didn't produce a child and maybe didn't even have real completed sex for the first seven years. One comes to feel sorry for Louis too: there's something helpless and sweet about Schwartzman that makes the seemingly odd casting eventually pay off.Coppola negotiates a narrow line between spectacle and intimate story. Some of the moments are bombastic, as when the father Louis XV (Rip Torn) or some chief of protocol stamps a staff on the floor, reams of Manohlo Blahnik shoes or pretty pastries flow by our eyes, we get a vast panorama of Versailles or a huge elephant in our face, or a blast of organ music knocks us out of our seats. There are many royal eating scenes, the couple facing forward with vast symmetrical arrangements of food in front of them with the courses loudly announced, as in Rossellini's La Prise du Pouvoir par Louis XIV. Unlike Rossellini, Coppola doesn't strive for an alienation effect but wants us to identify with the fourteen-year-old Austrian girl from the moment she has everything taken away from her, even her dog, and is dressed in French clothes to meet the Dauphin.We're not very aware of the passage of time  Coppola's movie tries too hard to avoid historical-film convention for that  but our heroine goes through some heavy changes. She drinks and takes drugs (what's in that pipe the women pass we don't know), she stays up all night, sneaks to Paris in disguise for a masked ball, squanders millions on landscaping (which merely embellished Le Nôtre's designs) and clothes and gambles and wolfs down so many sweets you wonder how he could get into those tight bodices. She gets heavily into the Pastoral shepherdess scene and then has an affair with a sexy Swedish count, Axel von Ferson, played by Jamie Dornan, a former Calvin Klein model with long limbs and dreamy eyes, right out of a soap opera, or the cover of a pulp romance. The way the movie shows it, this indiscretion was soon over; weren't there plenty more? Somehow there isn't time to show, with all the costumes and bonbons. This is where the movie most falls short: on a sense of events unfolding outside, or even inside; it's high on the emotions and the visuals, which never cease to be fun. Even when king and queen are driving away to be beheaded, Marie is looking out the window to admire the gardens. We get some court intrigue, notably conflict with Louis XV (Rip Torn)'s mistress Madame du Barry, played by Asia Argento as a vampire of a vamp. Ever present as a mean schoolmistress is the chief of etiquette, Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis), forever frowning and stretching her long thin neck. And Marie's female play pals are lovely and cool.Ultimately if all this elaborate stuff stands or falls with Kirsten Dunst, then it's at least okay, because Ms. Dunst has innocence and freshness and aloneness about her, and she's got the freshTeutonic looks Marie's Austrian background requires, and young as she is, she's got the energy and presence of an experienced actress. This isn't a great movie but it's a fabulous one. I dare costume-historical queens to stay away.The screenplay really only rates a 6 or a 7, but the dazzle-factor of the mise-en-scene is so great I'll be nice and award the film an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Yet another example as to why Sofia should never direct again.,"In preparation for the Academy Awards, I made a list of all the nominated films I had not yet seen in order of importance and availability. As Marie-Antoinette was only nominated in one category, for Best Costume Design, it was low on the list, but, unfortunately, I had time to get it.122 minutes of my life I will never get back again.This has got to be one of the most useless films I have seen in a very long time. I mean, it has no historical value, no educative value, the acting is terrible, the dialogue was absolutely horrifying How Coppola even got this film made is beyond me, as the film company and producers should be completely embarrassed this actually made it onto celluloid.Kirsten Dunst, generally a pretty good actress, plays the title character with such blandness and without showing even a glimpse of her acting ability. Paris Hilton could have played the part. At least it might have been funny. I mean, the woman was Austrian and played by Dunst with no accent? Coppola did this on purpose, but that trick worked brilliantly in a grandiose film like Amadeus. Here, it just came across as ridiculous. Jason Schwartzman rendered the character of Louis XIV insignificant. There is not a trace of why this film was made to be found. What was the purpose of showing scene after scene of Marie dressing and undressing and not getting her husband to have sex with her for ages? The film doesn't even get to the infamous beheading of the French queen. In short, it taught me nothing beyond what a bad filmmaker Coppola is.Granted, the music in the film is exceptional and the costumes were absolutely extraordinary.it did go on to win the Oscar it was nominated for. However, the fact this film is now related to the Academy Awards in any respect is a complete joke. Coppola should go back to just being her father's daughter and avoid ever making anyone go through such an excruciating experience as watching this completely useless mess was.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Let's get real, it's about a French Chick: nothing makes me want to vomit more than anything French, be it mimes, Dijon, Escargo, whatever. All things French should end up in a bloody mess jammed down the garbage disposal.I guarantee seeing A Knight's tale in combination with a visit to wikipedia will more than make up for seeing this piece of junk.",,Anonymous,History
Coppola's greatest talents shine in Marie Antoinette,"Having had read the biography by Antonio Fraser that this book is based on, I must say that it is a very close representation of Fraser's work but with the visionary ideals of Sofia Coppola. Coppola is known for being a visionary director, she is a queen of understatement, saying much without saying much. Coppola is also an extreme connoisseur of imagery and therefore it is not a surprise that this movie is a plate of visual decadence. However, it would be unfair to say that eye candy is all it is because it is much more than that. Coppola tells a tale of a young woman whose personality, desires, and weaknesses are all very much like ours. In truth, Coppola delivers the message that the much hated Queen of France was in fact, very very human. Antoinette was a victim of fate and destiny, slave to an arranged marriage to France by her domineering and powerful mother (Marie Theresa) and subjugated to be stripped of her homeland and relegated to live in France within the gilded cage that is Versailles. There is the message that despite history's harsh recollections, Marie Antoinette was simply just a girl in a world that was changing, a world that had no place for people like her and she was simply swept away by the tides of destiny. Sitting through the movie I couldn't help but think that there is not really that much dialogue throughout the movie, but that is because one of Coppola's greatest talents is her ability to show emotion through action. Watching this lonely girl surrounded by lovely things in a huge palace makes one reminiscent of a lonely doll forced by fate to be bigger than she was ever meant to be. As for Kirsten Dunst, her performance here far out-rivals anything she has done before. Her innocence literally permeates from the screen to the viewer, it is really that strong. And that is probably exactly why Coppola chose Dunst, because despite the fact that Dunst is not the strongest actress, she brings a sense of lively innocence and haunting tragedy that literally blankets her from the top of her feather coiffed hair down to her Manolo Blahnik shoes. Dunst plays the role exactly as Coppola imagined it to be, and she gives Marie Antoinette a very human like quality. Overall, there will be many who do not like this film, especially those that think Marie Antoinette does not deserve a sympathetic view (like the French). However, it is an extremely good portrayal of a prominent misunderstood figure in history. Dunst gives her strongest performance to date and for the first time, we begin to see Marie Antoinette as simply and very realistically, a human being.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Utterly Useless,"Words fail me in how to describe the sheer charabanc banality of this movie.For the historically minded, Marie Antoinette played a pivotal role in stirring up anti-monarchical sentiment in France mainly because of her frivolity, arrogance, disregard for court etiquette and protocol. Her inability to produce an heir was caused by the non-consummation of the marriage for the first seven years of her wedded life. These points are brought out in the film, in such an anodyne way, that the viewer is not aware of their importance other than that of Marie Antoinette's failure to produce a baby turned the French people against her.Coppola obviously views Marie Antoinette as a feminist icon and wants to make the statement that women should not be regarded as baby producing machines.The real life Marie Antoinette sought solace and comfort from her unconsummated and loveless marriage by taking both male and female lovers. There is not a hint of her sexual frustration in the film. These scenes should have been shot and included in the film so as not to titillate the audience but to illustrate how Marie Antoinette's crass behaviour succeeded in scandalising and alienating, not just the French Court, but also the French people. All that is shown in the film is just one adulterous affair with a Swedish nobleman. Coppola misses the opportunity to show that Marie Antoinette grew to love her husband during the course of their marriage and that she matured considerably, as a woman, after she became a mother.Coppola entirely neglects to show the emotional and psychological development of Marie Antoinette. In the film, Coppola's Marie Antoinette is as much a teen brat at the end of the film as she was at the beginning though Coppola does give Marie Antoinette, at the end of the film, the pathos to predict that she is saying goodbye to her home and the sad, foreboding realisation that she will never return.Coppola has whitewashed the life of Marie Antoinette to suit her own prejudices. Nothing is allowed to detract from the image of Marie Antoinette as the troubled teen set upon by an unsympathetic Court. The more one watches the film, the more one realises that Coppola had projected the character of Princess Diana into the script when she set about writing her character of Marie Antoinette. No one should ever be surprised if Coppola does, indeed, make a film on the life of Princess Diana, in the future.What is not brought out is the historical context, Marie Antoinette playing at being a shepherdess with scented sheep while French peasants toiled and endured under the worst droughts of the 18th Century. There is no scene to show that the luxury of French Court life was paid for by millions of poverty stricken French peasants.This film could best be entitled - ""Scenes from a Life of Indolence"" since what is shown, is so inconsequential and trite, such as Marie Antoinette in the bath, in bed with her clock loving husband, enduring the embarrassment of court gossip at not being pregnant.Yet Marie Antoinette, played by the punkish Kirsten Dunst, remains a remote, cold figure. The viewer does not warm to her. She is simply not likable. The viewer simply does have anything to care enough about her. Sofia Coppola, the writer and director of this execrable piece, lists as her credits, or rather, to her shame, that she wrote the script. Kirsten Dunst scarcely, says sentences of more than a dozen words. The film is notable for its lack of conversation, instead, the viewer is supposed to be satisfied with scene after scene of pretty settings.Coppola has committed the cardinal Hollywood sin of believing that special effects will make up for plot, or indeed, dialogue. Coppola, being a Hollywood princess, undoubtedly, felt an affinity for the doomed French Queen and sought to make her ""relevant"" to a modern teen audience. She attempts to do this by playing modern American pop songs in 18th Century French settings. Never mind the lapses in historical veracity, viewers find, for instance, that Marie Antoinette spoke with an American accent, or even good taste,the aim is to show Marie Antoinette as a misunderstood teen who rebelled against the constrictions of court life.The film is structurally weak, being episodic, in character, of scenes from the life of Marie Antoinette with no connection to contemporary French events. There is no attempt to explore why the French people hated her so much. How on Earth did Coppola ever think that she could make a film about Marie Antoinette and ignore critical events such as the Affair of the Necklace ? - an event that destroyed Marie Antoinette's credibility with the French people - and yet, Coppola achieves it. It is like making a film about President Nixon and not mentioning Watergate.Having filled the film with pap, Coppola suddenly finds that she has no time left to show the crucial events of Marie Antoinette's life - the Revolution, the flight to Varennes, the deposition of the monarchy, the execution of her husband and her own trial and execution.The film is utterly useless to anyone who wishes to learn anything about Marie Antoinette's life.No wonder Coppola fled when the audience at the Cannes Film Festival booed at the premiere of the film.This film is a disgrace.The viewer is urged to watch instead Van Dyke's superb 1938 production of ""Marie Antoinette"", starring the incomparable Norma Shearer, for a thrilling account of Marie Antoinette's life and Shyer's 2001 production of ""The Affair of the Necklace"", starring Hilary Swank, for a dramatic account of the event that was to lead to the downfall of Marie Antoinette, as well as Scola's 1982 production of ""La Nuit de Varennes"", starring Harvey Keitel, for an absorbing account of the flight to Varennes.Avoid Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" like the plague.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Perfect,"I saw this movie in France on the Champs Elysee, and it has become one of my favorite movies. I cannot wait until it comes out in the US. Kirsten Dunst portrays Marie Antoinette beautifully, perfect in every aspect. And Louis XVI is also portrayed perfectly. Scenery in the movie, along with all the visuals is absolutely gorgeous. I think it ended at the perfect time in Marie Antoinette's life, also. The movie didn't drag itself out to show the trials and prison life she had to suffer. The music is also very good, with the prim, proper music playing in the right scenes and the fun music playing out in the happy scenes. I have no complaint with this movie, except that it should have come out in the United States on May 26 like it did it France. Lovely, lovely film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
My God! Add some Drama! UGH! (No Spoilers),"There are no spoilers in this review. Spoilers would mean that there was something to spoil. The trailer shows Marie living the life of royalty. Lather, rinse, repeat. Everyday is the same. They eat. They play. They Gossip. They suck! OK. I get it after 15-20 minutes of that. But like a little pink bunny, it keeps going on and on and on. I kept expecting Marie to shake things up. At one point she kind of does by clapping at an opera when you are not supposed to. Everyone does to. OK Change. I kept waiting and waiting. Yet nothing more happens. I'm sure it was realistic, but come on. You don't make movies about boring people! Don't make a movie about me unless you plan to dramatize the hell out of it. Then when you've sat and watched and watched and watched these rich snooty people go on and on you think ""OK the payoff is the revolution. We get to see these heads roll"". Sorry Charilie. That might have saved the movie. Instead we get to only see the boring parts of her life. Then it ends. UGH!",3.0,Anonymous,History
A break from the Norm,"It seems that there was a vast difference between what people expected to see in this film and the actual end product. After reading various books on Marie Antionette, I myself did wonder how Coppola would portray her. I am an avid watcher of Historical dramas and have to say that the originality of this one was incredibly refreshing. Believe me, the film is so much better if you have read the history, as in most cases some situations are more factual than others but the idea behind the film which was to portray Marie Antionette's journey from her betrothal to the King of France to the start of the revolution is achieved very well. Im not a huge fan of Kirsten Dunst but was pleasantly surprised at how she made the part her own, Coppola's films will never be mainstream, despite what happened to Lost in Translation. The costumes were fantastic and the soundtrack (which I, at first was slightly worried about) is excellent and quite strangely fits well into the film. I can see why the French might not have liked it but it was about time that a more real look of Marie Antionettes character and influences was portrayed on film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
best movie,"I saw this movie in Paris, France on the Champs Elysees in July. It was perfect. We went to see Versailles the day before. I have since read biographies and done other research on MA and the French Revolution. I am obsessed and this movie is so fun. The music is perfect. It is pretty accurate too. Enjoy it for what it is. The actors/actresses were great and it is a feast for the senses. The costuming is superb. I think that it gives a somewhat fair look of the views about the queen. She was inexperienced and young and was ignorant about the condition of the people of France. She never her whole life saw the ocean. As for the rest of the story there is so much more to tell. After leaving Versialles there were years of imprisonment and depressing events. I like that Sophia decided to end the movie when she did. The movie would have to be MUCH longer in order to tell the whole story. Overall I think this movie is a must see and can't wait to see it again. I'm also looking forward to bonus features on the DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Truly Awful,"This movie was truly the most awful movie I ever saw. When I first the trailer I thought this would be a great biography on the life of Marie Antoinette, I was terribly wrong. Watching this was like watching a documentary on Paris Hilton. It shows no important events in Marie Antoinette's life, not even the affire of the necklace, all it shows is a spoiled brat wasting her life in a palace. The music is also quiet out of place, for instead of the usual period piece music it uses rock. . . yes rock.So if you value your time (and money), DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES watch this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,History
An original film,"Clearly, Sofia has inherited Francis's talent. Like her father, she is very good at making us identify even in a period film and character study. But I'm not here to compare Sofia with Francis. I saw it in Nantes before it came out in the US and I think that for a French audience it must be very annoying to have a French figure told in a very American way. It is more about an American girl than an Austrian girl: The way Marie simply lives in her rich world and parties with friends without wondering one second if the outside world is as lucky as she is. Clearly, Sofia Coppola identifies with Marie: Like her, she is the daughter of a king, she has always had everything she wanted, etc. What I love about this film is tat it is the ultimate biography: The film may take place in the 18th century instead of the 20th and 21th, she may be Austrian instead of American, she may be the daughter of the king of Austria instead of the king of American cinema, her name may be Marie instead of Sofia, but it is very much a collision between the two. Sofia Coppola even deforms history a little to make it more clear that it is Sofia's story and not Marie's. She even goes as far as to make us listen to her own favorite music which Marie could never possibly have heard. In a way, Sofia has the same basic talents as her father- elegance, character study, character identification, a floating story- but where her father is very Italian and manly, she is very American and girly.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"What a tasteless, meaningless sequence of pics!","Rarely saw such a pointless movie! Well, that is, if we can talk about a movie in this case. After seeing it, I became rather convinced that the order in which the images follow each other, could be put in any, arbitrary order to obtain almost the same effect (boring!!) as the original 'movie'. The character, as presented in the movie, of Marie-Antoinette, is utterly uninteresting. Hard to imagine why anyone would like to make a movie with as main focus this person. Arriving at Versailles, she very soon gets bored and equally soon gives away to costly forms of escapism: opera (the least costly, I suppose), expensive costumes, hairdressing, parties ... But, what is worse, we as an audience get even more bored than she does. Not one character is strong, pronounced or interesting. Of course, she gets criticism for her egocentric, egoistic behavior that costs a fortune, even considering the wealth of the royal family and entourage at that time at Versailles. And the common people, heating up for the French Revolution - that by the way, is not portrayed in any depth in this movie neither - and suffering more and more from hunger, of course also expresses its criticism on M-A. The thing more than half the time of this far too long movie is spent to however, is on the procreation of the royal dynasty, or rather, on the danger of non-procreation of it, since the consummation of the marriage isn't taking place. For this big problem, M-A is constantly receiving warnings and strongly recommended to put an end to this drama. Perhaps Sofia Coppola tried to make some sexual portrait of this epoque, I am not sure, but it is a fact (well, if we are to believe the movie with respect to this sexual related matter) that precisely concerning this point, M-A is the least to blame, the reason simply being an very inhibited and very clumsy husband (the future king Louis XVI). But, in all cases, the woman, - or in this case the future queen - seems to have been held responsible for the non consummation of the marriage. Well, in the end, the problem is solved, and M-A will give birth to two children, the second being a boy (the dauphin) who will of course be held responsible for the continuation of the glorious dynasty of the Louis, at least, if the French Revolution will not prevent that from happening, which it will. OK, lots more could be said on this movie, but I'll stop here. The pity is not only that this movie obviously painfully failed, but moreover that it failed with a very promising cast. I wouldn't say that Kirsten Dunst is a great actress, but with a total lack of any good or consistent script, she simply didn't get a fair chance. The other actors are even worse off: Sofia Coppola simply doesn't focus at all on anyone else than M-A, so an excellent actor like Jason Schwartzman doesn't even get a chance at all to save something from the total loss. A shame! I hope Sofia Coppola won't make another movie for a very long time now (or not at all), or if she does, that a good script writer will have been there to support her and hopefully a dozen of very good advisors of all kinds.",2.0,Anonymous,History
A Political Foray. LA Press Screening.,"It can be said that it is more a film regarding epitomes of music, fashion and other style trends, all notable and great for the teen demographic and tasteful indulgences, however, I saw strong undercurrents of direct political prevalence, (esp. in regards to our state of current affairs in this country). Which makes this little film a great cocktail for the young and fashionable in America.I would sum it up as a portent composure, a delectable bon-bon, in which we see the suddenness with which the peoples' ridicule of the excessively wealthy can abruptly actualize itself upon them as an effective death-wish.The phrase 'Let then eat cake.' may, or may never have been uttered by Marie Antionette, but it is no less prevalent than her innocence (or ignorance. your choice phrasing in dialect), affirmed when she was quoted as saying on the scaffold after accidentally stepping on her executioners foot, ""Pardon me sir, I did not mean to do it."" Tragic indeed, was her mindless excess in the face of her starving compatriots, a quality that was so fostered by the position she was born into that she wasn't even aware of it, but all the more so...shouldn't some one have tapped her on the shoulder at some point in her life of excessive binges?Prior to the tug of the guillotines release, one would think even her executioner, looking down upon Maries powdered neck, and especially after hearing those epic last words, would question what it was all for. After all, that same neck was at that turning point, a bicameral region to be symbolically dissolved, and where, a thin line was to be drawn upon to affirm the rights and reasoning of the impending eminent, democratic decision makers of the following era. It's destruction commanded, her delicate neck was no less a symbolic icon, in the motion and gesticulation of it's speech, than it was when it held the delicate mind of a 38 year old child queen. On the scaffold it was still a prop in a show for the people.A story to be paralleled as a heed our own as Americans, as we are so consumed with petty grievances of our upper-class, that we neglect the more eminent discussions which should be held in direct regard to our own frivolous behaviors and habits consuming valuable limited resources, ... lest we be discarded as a lesson to a more promising, more prevalent, and less compromised global youth.",,Anonymous,History
Truly Decadent,"A perfect portrait of the ill fated queen using a punk soundtrack and beautiful photography in Coppolas almost high school teen movie style translation to capture the spirit of this truly iconic figure who was just a girl who just wanted to have fun. Instantly became my favourite film. I am already a big fan of Sofia Coppola, this film takes her already prevalent themes of fun loving young girls repressed by the systems around her, be it commitment or parents, isolation in their position, rebellion all put across by a punk/indie soundtrack (chosen by Brian Reitzell) and beautiful photography (by Lance Acord). She seems to sum up what it is to be young so very perfectly, to be able to break away from the systems that hold you down and let loose. I see her as one of the filmmakers around at the moment who is carrying on the 'new Hollywood' movement that her dad was a part of during the 70's with the very style that she has. An extremely underrated film, seen as self indulgent and having a very slim plot. They are reading it wrong, it owes more to art cinema in containing the huge plot in the coding, style, photography and mise en scene. The critics will come back to look at this one. More significant than its been received.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Boring! horrendous!,"After a long and tiring day my wife (25) and I (30) decided to relax and see this movie she thought would be interesting. What a grave mistake! It turned out to be the most boring movie we saw since... ever! A complete waste of 2 hours. The worst part - the feeling of guilt for the lost time. Going home and sleeping would be a more interesting endeavor. The movie seemed to have no point, no plot, or purpose. The brilliance of actors made this a little more bearable, but not enough to get any enjoyment. Oh, and I must mention the music was probably the worst part. The music and songs seemed to have no relationship to the scenes. They did not fit the genre, the rhythm, the time or the meaning. For the first time in my life I actually walked out before the movie ended and went to play the arcades while my wife would finish watching it. BTW , she said the ending sucked too.

You just have to see it in the right light,"I've just seen this movie, and really liked it. I understand that it is not a historical movie in its essence, so people should not watch it looking for a biography of Marie Antoinette. I think the movie really allows us to see (I'm risking the cliché) a queen as a real person, and to connect her actions to ours today. After all she was a very young queen in a cotton candy world. The costumes and scenarios have an amazing twist to it, adding to the idea that this is a metaphorical movie, and I think it accomplishes its function - to entertain and to give people images of dream and joy and candy and shoes and pastel colors and...rock and roll! So if you don't take it too serious and you just watch it lightly not thinking too much about the history, you can really see and enjoy the person inside a young queen. In all, a very bold and intelligent option made by Sofia Coppola, that has to be understood for just what it is.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Left me tepid,"Marie Antoinette has long been portrayed as one of history's most vacuous twits. Sadly, for me, Coppola not only failed to bring any depth to Marie's character, but actually left me viewing her in a worse light than I had before. She came across as every bit the spoiled, delusional airhead that we have come to expect. There was nothing, in what passed for her personality, that endeared me to her at all. In fact when the revolting peasants turned up at the front gates, I found myself shouting 'Thank God for that!' at the TV screen. Quite frankly this film bored me rigid. The cast is actually fantastic and they certainly all did the best with it that they could. But it just had no depth and really very little story line. The whole thing felt like a squandered opportunity.",3.0,Anonymous,History

She seems to liven up the French royal court and to enjoy life. Yet at the same time while she was enjoying life and being excessive the common people of France were hurting, and with media twists Marie was the one pointed with the blame. Overall a great film for a feel of the late 18th century in France and the culture of the royal family!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Long modern pop music video with XVIII century imagery,"Biographical drama written and directed by Sofia Coppola. Unfortunately this film teaches nothing and what we have here is nothing more than a farce and an insult to Marie Antoinette. With all the social circumstances of the time that shaped the world, we see none of that nor the public consequences of the queen's behavior, just a teenager always living in whoopee boredom and luxury of Versailles, accomplished in such a way that nothing happens, although admittedly the colorful extravagant scenarios and costumes are the only redeeming factor in this long modern pop music video with images of the XVIII century.

Well, damn the critics, I was blown away by the magnificent costumes, sets and dramatic approach to this period of French history. Yes, hearing American accents in certain scenes I found to be rather obnoxious, but over all, I thought MARIE ANTIONETTE was a delight to the eye, and to the ear, with music which added to the drama of the story. So, Sofia, ""you go girl!""The cast was very good, but in Kristen Dunst, she was just amazing in how she grew from a shy,timid Austrian Princess, into a mother of such beautiful children. What MARIE ANTIONETTE accomplishes is to show on such a lavish screen a portrait of Royalty that brought to the surface the shallowness and vapidness of their existence.

"Good movie, better than I expected. From a MA loyal admirer","Marie Antoinette (MA) is one of my favorite characters in world history. I have read practically all the biographies and have watched the very few movies made about this tragic Queen. I had not many expectations when I purchased this DVD since I thought it was going to be full of historical errors (like the 1938 movie) and silly clichés as always happens in most US-made movies. But to my surprise, I became engaged with it right from the very beginning. I think Kirsten did a nice and decent job although I wasn't too impressed by the role played by Jason as Louis XVI. I loved the music, the visuals and the auditory elements. Sophie showed us just a small part of MA's life and character, but I liked what I saw. Of course I would have loved to see this movie covering MA during the French revolution; for instance, covering events such as the flight to Varennes, her imprisonment in the Temple Tower and later, in the Consiergerie, and her famous trial and tragic end in the scaffold. Her role in those events was what made MA a legend and immortal, not the frivolous life the movie portrayed. But the movie was good I must say and I would see it again. I gave it a 8.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Not As Expected,"The soundtrack is the only star of this film. It is clear no one thinks Kirsten can act, as she barely speaks for the entire film. In fact, the dialogue is so insignificant and the music so overwhelming that the entire film feels like an extended music video. Visually, the film is stunning and does a nice job capturing the opulence and decadence of the era. Yet the script and cast do not exude the same.

I will easily download this soundtrack to my iPod, but you could not pay me to watch this extended music video again without adding a happy gruesome ending.",4.0,Anonymous,History
My new favorite teen queen!,"I went into this movie not quite knowing what to expect. While I liked Lost In Translation, I thought The Virgin Suicides was a bore. Sofia Coppola also seems to have the critics split down the middle here, leaving half of them praising the film for it's lyrical beauty and the other half screeching ""off with its head"".The movie starts off as Antoinette(Kirsten Dunst) is summoned from Austria as a 14-year-old to be the bride of the future Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). As she crosses the border, she is instructed to leave everything behind. Stripped of her clothes, her friends and even her beloved pug, Mops, she is whisked away to Paris where scrutiny, alienation and ridiculous amount of protocol awaits her.Once in Paris, she is stuck with her mumbling and bumbling husband, who shows far more interest in hunting and locks than he does in her, and the marriage stays unconsummated for several years. The lack of attention from her husband, as well as that of an heir, adds to the pressure of Antoinette, and to cope with the structure and boredom she begins to shop, gamble and hold lavish parties to pass her time.This is where Coppola excels for me. Marie Antoinette is shows as a teenager, one of my favorite scenes being where they sneak off to attend a masquerade-ball. Coppola has made brilliant use of contemporary music, bringing the film into the present, and making it much easier to relate. (the soundtrack is superb btw) The film has been critiqued for not focusing enough on the politics of Versailles, but that was not the focus-point of this film. Antoinette is. Her world, her feelings, her loneliness. The only thing I missed, was during her pregnancies. Many things must have changed for Antoinette during that time, and I wish Coppola could have explored that some more.Now, I won't forget to mention the cinematography, which I loved. Somehow, all the luxury that surrounds Antoinette in this film only makes her isolation stand out all the clearer, and being a woman, I can't help but drool over the opulent gowns that are paraded about the screen. Coppola was also allowed to film inside Versailles. Reason enough alone for many to see this film.Anyways, I loved it.

She was only 15 years of age when she ruled France and she did what most teen girls would do with a large fortune, spend it on clothes and food.

Classic case of a Missed opportunity!,"I waited for over a year to see this much anticipated movie! Marie Antoinette was suppose to be the last remainning gem needed to crown Sofia as one of the best current Hollywood directors , instead it may have turned out to be her ""Heaven's Gate"". The movie is just a dumbfest! Sofia tells a story about absolutely nothing! She opted to disregard any historical or cultural reference of the time that may actually be relevant to our current lives! The movie is all about mood, and costums, It doesn't try to achieve anything,and it doesn't really try to entertain either! I read somewhere that before the movie started principal photography, Francis Ford actually told Sofia to go out there and make the movie she wanted to make!It became so tedious and painful to watch that after awhile I started to look forward to the beaheading of the young queen and maybe with a little luck the French too would get the head of Sofia Coppola and the producers of this travesty!

Kirstin Dunst is terrific as the tittle character in spite of Sofia Coppola's shortcomings. The movie is a great music video at best!Thats probably what she should stick with!

Not Perfect -- But So Much Better Than I Expected!,"I never thought this movie would move me the way it did. I'm against all forms of class privilege and aristocratic behavior, in any society at any time. I never liked Marie Antoinette or her world. This movie disturbed me because I thought it would be shallow and silly, but after an hour or so I really found myself liking and sympathizing with Marie Antoinette. I think the negativity that surrounds this movie comes from just that fact: people are forced to find Marie Antoinette inside themselves, and many lack the honesty to face the truth. This movie, which seems shallow and silly, is actually incredibly daring and demands a great deal from the viewer. It demands you live Marie Antoinette's life with her, and that you see her on her own terms.Of course, Kirsten Dunst is an astonishingly gifted actress. Her self confidence and naturalness are so compelling, no matter how unreal the moment she finds the true core of the emotions. What's striking is the way Sofia Coppola seems to know exactly what a genius Kirsten is, and seems to almost relish giving her the leeway to do things her way. It's almost like the movie is the director's love letter to her star, in that there are countless flattering shots of Kirsten Dunst at her most radiant. Yet the flattery is also aimed at her talent. Sofia pays Kirsten the supreme compliment of total trust. This Marie has not a trace of any accent, French or Austrian. Cate Blanchett wouldn't have done it this way. But Kirsten is different. It's like she won't waste your time with showing off her little gimmicks, because she's too eager to start feeling and reacting in her own way.When you watch the movie, you don't really hear Marie Antoinette say things, like ""I'm lonely"" or ""where do I belong?"" But somehow the stunning images of flowers, clothes, shoes, and the longing on Kirsten Dunst's face all come together in a pattern that draws you in deeper and deeper. By the time Marie is building her secret world in the country, with farm animals and flowers and intimate dinner parties with friends, you totally understand her. Far from being a coward who ran away from the real world, Marie Antoinette was a brave soul who did her best to find something real to care about.But it's not just Kirsten's movie. Jason Schwartzmann gives the most restrained, disciplined performance I have ever seen as the sad, timid, excruciatingly polite Louis XVI. Jason makes you ache for this poor young man, and yet as an actor he absolutely refuses to make any of the ""easy"" choices. He never shows easy lust, easy longing, easy likability. You are really forced to feel the terrible wall he has built around himself, and see how hard Marie had to work to get to know him. And you start to see how an ordinary, not very bright young man is forced to cope with the public role of king. You don't blame him for his behavior even when you see how it hurts Marie. He's doing the best he can, and by the end they really love each other, even if they have none of the usual ""star chemistry"" we expect to see in movies. What we get instead is almost anti-chemistry -- two people with no physical bond who make the best of things and grow as a result.One final comment: nearly all the negative reviews of this movie focus on the idea that Sofia Coppola doesn't show the peasant's point of view, that she doesn't feel their pain or acknowledge their anger. One admiring review here on IMDb even said that she has compassion for everyone except the peasants. But I would put it another way. I think the final sense you get is that she doesn't judge anyone, not even the peasants. They do what they have to do to survive. Just like Marie. And the viewer can feel deeply about both, or neither.For myself, when the film ended, and Marie said, ""I'm saying good-bye"" I felt like I had really learned something about compassion and loss, without forgetting what I knew when I came into the theater.Time will tell, but I think MARIE ANTOINETTE will be much more appreciated in the years to come than it was at the time of its initial release.",8.0,Anonymous,History

If you want to see this movie, do yourself a favor take the money you were about to buy the ticket with and either flush it down the toilet, or go to a bookstore and buy a paperback novel that interests you. I, like I am sure many other people was expecting witty dialogue and another take historically on the life of Marie Antoinette, but what we got was a boring half-ass effort, which would make Francis Ford Coppola want to change his last name.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Phenomenal,"Marie Antoinette was just 14 when she arrived at Versailles and married Louis XVI. She reached infamy for bankrupting France and became the most famous victim of the French Revolution, beheaded at the age of 37. Marie Antoinette led a most notorious and lavish life, forever in the spotlight; criticized for her spending on extravagant dresses and hair-pieces, not consummating her marriage to Louis for seven years and consequently not producing a male heir until the age of 24. Versailles was always ablaze with rumors ranging from talk about Antoinette's male conquests to the idea that she was an Austrian spy  and then there were the malicious tall-tales produced by the revolutionaries outside of Versailles, 'let them eat cake'. Marie Antoinette is one of the most fabulously interesting historic characters to have ever walked on this earth  so it is no wonder that her story transcends time and should be told by one of America's newest young writing and directing talents, Sofia Coppola.First and foremost it should be understood that Coppola has not made an historically accurate film. She never had any intention of doing so. The accents are haphazard  Kirsten Dunst's American accent for Marie, Judy Davis's faux French for Comtesse de Noailles, Steve Coogan's Manchester twang as Ambassador Mercy.... furthermore certain parts of Marie's life are omitted, such as the affair of the necklace or the death of her two youngest children not long before the revolution forced her out of Versailles. And there are many more discrepancies both major and minor that critics and historians were up in arms about when this film was released in 2006. Sofia Coppola did not make a biopic of Marie Antoinette, she merely tried to relate a modern audience to a French queen living a lavish and fantastic though fleeting life in the 17th century, and surprisingly, Coppola achieves this.Marie Antoinette lived a life that today is incomprehensible. It was a life of debauchery and duty, of ritual and mindlessness, tradition and revolution. Sofia Coppola's 'Marie Antoinette' does not relish telling the story of the French revolution; there is a scene in which Louis (Jason Schwartzman) agrees to send funds to America upon the advice of his ministers, and Marie makes a comment to her friends about the nonsense the papers are printing, in particular reference to a comment she supposedly made of 'let them eat cake'. At the end of the film we do see the angry mob that marched on Versailles and forced Marie and Louis to leave for Paris, but otherwise the politics are left out.The film is about Marie  the complete overhaul of her life from Austria to France, her trying to fit into a foreign court and having to become accustomed to the standing customs and protocols of Versailles. A scene in which Marie has to get dressed by the ladies of her court according to which woman has the most prestigious title is fantastic, as is the monotony of dining with the king and so forth. It is this mundaneness that Sofia captures so well  translating for a modern audience what this 17th century queen's life would have been like, not the grandiose aspects, but rather the day-to-day routines. And then there is the interesting story of the pressure put upon Marie by her mother and the French people to consummate her marriage and produce an heir  a queen's duty translated to a modern audience in very simple terms, that Marie is not living up to her duties as a wife.By far the best thing about Coppola's movie is the costumes and set. Special permission was given to film at Versailles (even in the hall of mirrors which is under construction until late 2007!) and Milena Canonero won the Oscar for best costume design. The dresses are a visual delight, and the shoes designed by Manolo Blahnik are to die for! If for no other reason, watch Marie Antoinette to take in the visual splendor of it all. The 80's-inspired soundtrack is also surprisingly charming, it flows throughout the film and is oddly befitting of the lavish lifestyle portrayed.Perhaps the weak link of the film is Kirsten Dunst. She had to play Marie from her arrival in Versailles at the age of 14 until her departure from Versailles at the age of 34. It was a hard task, which Dunst does not really succeed in representing on film. Though I am only choosing Dunst as the weak-link at a stretch, for the sake of criticism.To be honest I loved everything about this film  and I really cant understand why the critics hated it so much. I love the off-beat style in which Coppola decided to tell this period drama, with bright costumes, an 80's soundtrack and a focus on the mundane and routine in Marie-Antoinette's life. From the reviews that I read, most critics wanted more of a political context about one of the French Revolution's most fascinating players, but I like the route Coppola took in communicating a story about a teenager who become a queen at the worst possible time of upheaval.

A disappointment,"Marie Antoinette holds such a strong story with a lot of laughter, drama and sorrow. Not once during the movie got I sucked into the story and believed what was going on. Not one laugh, not one tear. Every time the rock music played I got drawn out of the illusion that was build up since last time the rock music was played. It was a weird time-span of events, 3/4 of the film was spent on the dresses, cakes and Antoinettes troubles to seduce the husband. The last quarter of the time, spent on giving birth to three children, loosing a child, having a lover, and the beginning of the French Revolution. Emotionless effort! The setting and the costumes were of course great, that's why I gave this move a two... Another thing is how badly this movie is made technically. Even two-three times the microphone is dangling down in the picture... ohh, horrible! Just a big disappointment of what could have been such a great movie of such a dramatic character! Wish I was the daughter of a director and had funds, I would make the story that is really worth telling. Would also show how the ending is for Antoinette...",2.0,Anonymous,History

"surface beauty, but that's it","Sofia Coppola certainly has style and an eye for sensual beauty. Kirsten Dunst is an ideal prop for Coppola's images. However, don't go looking to this film for anything deeper than a classy MTV video in corsets and hip padding. Like her supremely better Lost in Translation, Coppola employs deep silences, sparse conversation, and long close ups--unfortunately here it falls flat. Where Lost in Translation was a touching portrayal of love and loneliness, Maria Antoinette is every girl's daydream of being a princess. Jason Schwartzman seemed an odd choice, however he turns in a fantastic portrayal of Louis--quirky and a tad homely, his struggles are very sympathetic.",4.0,Anonymous,History
beautiful,"One of films seductive more for details, rooms, clothes, location than for story itself. and, knowing the historical events or discovering them , the film has the virtue to be a decent and charming sketch of a period, proposing a perspective, superficial at first sigh, in same measure nice, story of the transformation of a girl in young woman, using the humour as significant ingredient and giving the right end as bridge to the tragedy of the Revolution. an easy film, for teenagers, who remains impressive for the insides , for the art to use the fragments of history, for Kirsten Dunst performance, for the flavours of the life of a princess in different universe and her decisions, so familiar for young women. so,, a beautiful film. the use of different music styles is one of precious arguments.",,Anonymous,History
New Generations of Film,"There is only two words to sum up this amazing film... cinematic poetry Sophia did it again. It's been so long since I've sat in a theater and felt the riveting emotional range I felt tonight. This film was absolutely stunning and sophisticated. Rather than producing another biopic (which we all know are popularly contrived ""gems"" of the film industry for odd some reason), Marie Antoinette takes a fresh turn in a completely different direction. Rather than following a historical Plot line,Antoinette tells a much more personal story of a girl becoming a woman,in a cold world (Versailles). The story was laced with such subtle touching moments and great character portrayals of the young king and queen of France...

Good but Flawed,Marie Antoinette (2006)*** (out of 4)Sofia Coppola's highly impressive look at the life of the title character played here by Kirsten Dunst. I wasn't overly familiar with the subject matter but I found Coppola's screenplay and direction to be highly interesting. I haven't seen any of the director's previous films but from the interviews I've seen she seems to be a very strong woman and that certainly shines through with the way she tells the story of Antoinette. From the very start of the film it seems as if Coppola is rolling her eyes at the way the future Queen had to change her life in order to fit certain rules. Antoinette is one of the most hated women in history so I found it interesting that Coppola was able to show something else with keeping the reasons why she was hated at the time. I think she shows the Queen as a very strong woman who just got thrown into something bigger than what she could undertake. I'm not a huge fan of Dunst but she does a very good job here. I think a better actress could have done more with the role but I don't think that was needed in this film. Jason Schwartzman is only mildly interesting but Judy Davis and Asia Argento are very good in their roles. I think the second half of the film is a major drop from the first half but this is still a very interesting and beautiful looking film.,,Anonymous,History
Beautiful,"This film was a beautiful and fantastically accurate portrayal of the ill-fated queen, in a new turn on the story. She is revealed in a light of understanding, rather than dislike. I find it hard to believe that this film has been snubbed by virtually every film awards ceremony, when it is truly the best film of 2006. It was so delightful, I could have eaten it like the supposed cakes which this queen delighted in. Kirsten Dunst, who is universally regarded as a poor actress, actually shines quite well in this role; in fact, Ms. Dunst is often so very natural in most of her roles, that people fail to notice her acting ability, which is excellent, despite rumors of her being talentless. It is an unbearable shame that this movie will be a forgotten treasure in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Awful Movie,"I have studied about that time period quite a bit and I will say that I liked the idea of humanizing her. The movie itself wasn't really bad, but the music ruined the entire thing.

I also had a group of friends that went to it in the theater and they all had basically the same comments.I understand the desire to draw a ""younger"" audience than usually watches a movie of this type. However, I think that by pursuing the lowest common denominator they seemed to not only driving away people that normally like this type of movie, but they are doing it so poorly that they are also killing any desire for people that watching this style of movie for the first time to watch another.

Great Film,"This was a really good film. I wasn't sure as I was watching it whether I liked it or not and I had to think about the aesthetic presentation a bit to decide, but after much contemplation I've decided it's a wonderful movie. The reason I had to think about it is that the artistic interpretation is unusual.Visually, of course, it was stunning. The movie was filmed on location at Versailles and the costumes were magnificent; and, Kirsten Dunst is her usual lovely self so everything was easy on the eyes. From a historical standpoint the film seems accurate (from the bit I've read on the subject) although its a bit thin on facts.The controversy at Cannes, (and what I had to think about) turns, I think, on the contemporary language and score, interspersed with period costumes, music, and production design. It is that strange mix of flavors, however, that ultimately makes the film special and allows it to convey the spirit of Marie Antoinette and the world in which she lived. It communicates her fundamentally frivolous nature and helps us to understand the way that she was viewed in her own time, by introducing some elements of what we might have seen had she lived today.Good movie, definitely worth the money and sure to win some Academy nods for cinematography and costume design, at least.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Boring.,"After the Sofia Coppola's excellent ""Lost in Translation"", her latest movie, ""Marie Antoinette"" is a major disappointment. Aside from the wonderful Versailles background and the lavish costumes, there is absolutely nothing interesting about this movie. The dialog is insipid, the shots repetitive and overly long, and the acting - particularly that of Kirsten Dunst and Molly Shannon - was so uninspired as to be considered bad. Nothing in the movie seemed authentically French, as the court of Versailles seemed simply to be composed of a group of gossipy Americans with bad table manners and too much idle time. There was so little historical context that the gravity of the situation (Marie Antoinette not producing an heir) was not apparent and the lack of conjugal relations between Louis and his wife, instead, seemed laughable. In short, the French would not act this way, eat this way, talk this way and it is easy to see why this movie was so poorly received in France and at the Cannes film festival.",4.0,Anonymous,History

"Deliscious eye candy, but lacking in substance","I really wanted to like this film, as it did have a lot going for it. However, it is lacking in a few too many things, such as substance. The film does look truly exquisite- the cinematography, costumes, sets, scenery, locations, interiors, wigs and makeup are truly sumptuous and a real feast for the eyes. The story did intrigue me too, while in terms of acting Kirsten Dunst is suitably naive and coquettish and Jason Schawartzman is a dashing yet shy Dauphin. While Rip Torn is surprisingly subtle. However, Marie Antoinette does suffer from being too long and I think too slow too. And the film is further disadvantaged by one too many anachronisms, particularly the music which is too contemporary for my liking and there is too much of it(ie. the masked rave to Siouxsie), and historically the film never feels authentic. Sophia Coppola's direction is unfocused too, too much is spent on the not-so-important moments and the more significant moments feel skimmed over in contrast, while the script is rather weak as it goes overboard with the sugar and froth. To conclude, not terrible but it is not great really. Worth seeing for the period detail, but little beyond that. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,History
History at,"There are several examples of the undeserved critical response to MARIE ANTOINETTE that concern Sofia Coppola's use of contemporary music and the film's historical obligations to OUR expectations. The 80's soundtrack captures quite well the spirit of teenage oblivion as so genuinely portrayed by Kirsten Dunst. That reviewers expect the character of Marie Antoinette to understand its place in history exposes a larger form of historical misunderstanding.When Ms. Coppola's film doesn't satisfy a modern understanding, based on misperception, is it the fault of the filmmaker or the reviewer? It's as if characters are to act like adults when in fact they are not. It may also be likely that Coppola has given the viewer a more complex vision of a famous historical period. It is the story of the seduction of opulence, the oblivion to the realities outside Versailles and the vitiated wealth of kings that form the core of this film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A wasted opportunity to make a great and beautiful film,"This film has both strengths and weaknesses. The strength being the extravagant costumes and beautiful sets as well as the original and clever choice of music. Pop music accompanying a period drama has the potential of bringing the viewer more closely into the minds of the characters, shortening the distance between teenagers in 18th century France and contemporary teenagers. Although this approach did to some extent work, it also had the opposite effect in that Marie-Antoinettes seemingly easy acceptance to her new role as a French royal became difficult to understand. Some dialogue would certainly have helped. And it is the lack of dialogue that really hurts this film. With all the time, money and effort going into designing the sets, it all seems rather wasteful when the script is so weak. A great opportunity to tell a great story is completely missed! It was really like watching ""lost in translation"" all over again.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful..,"This is such a wonderful artistic film. Sofia Coppola nails it down and succeeds. This is a great film that shows you Marie Antoinette from her own view.

Marie-Antoinette is shown as a bubble-head who spends her time thinking about where she will go out, when in reality she was politically-aware, supporting conservatism and divine royalty, which was all she had ever known.

Those nights, you could hear it -- the crickets, the rain, the quiet instrumental music, the loud chatter -- organic. It is difficult to express just how life, art, fashion, and pleasure can be more intriguing than politics and governance, where one is the impetuousness of nature, and the other is the stodginess of man. In those moments, at the pinnacle of delight and pleasure, she cares about her own loves, and not the care taking of others. Ahhh, it reminds me of the 80's when we had no cell phone and no distractions from human desire and living with others in connection.

"Unconventional and not to everyone's taste, but I really enjoyed it.","On a surface level, this is a hard film to recommend since it makes a handful of questionable choices which most other historical dramas would get dismissed for, whether you're referring to the severe lack of historical context towards the state of France throughout Antoinette's reign or the mix of a contemporary and classical soundtrack. Heck, I was considering dismissing the film myself partway into it, but the further I got, the clearer it became that these directorial choices fit the film very well. Coppola displays Antoinette as living in a bubble from the outside world. Thrown into a position which demands a high responsibility at such a young age, given little guidance on what to do, and ignoring the advice of those around her, she ultimately chooses to isolate herself from politics and is insular of her duties. Therefore, just as Antoinette exists in a bubble as to what's occurring around her, we do as well. Whatever historical insight we're given is brushed aside in service of numerous lavish parties and personal drama. Of course, this tone is disrupted in the final 20 minutes once reality begins to intrude more significantly (in all fairness, I don't think there was any way around that), but one gets the impression that Antoinette wasn't mature and experienced enough to fully understand the consequences of her behavior and what led her to her fate by the ending. As for the contemporary soundtrack, it took me longer to gel with it. I generally find that does more harm than good to period dramas and breaks the illusion of the film taking place in the past. In the case of this film, however, while its undoubtedly malapropos for the 16th century setting and while I initially scoffed at it, its awkward contrast added to Antoinette's desire to exist out of time and the aforementioned bubble she separated herself from the outside world with. Though sure, it might've been better to either stick with contemporary or classical soundtracks all the way through instead of dabbling in both territories. Still, while I imagine this film won't be to everyone's tastes, I enjoyed it quite a bit and felt its unconventional choices worked quite well.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The fact that i had to give this film a mark out of ten is unfair on my part. 1 is still too much. i feel infuriated and robbed of 2 hours of my life. f*ck you Sofia Coppola.here's why you suck: i don't know which story got shunned out of the way for you to masturbate on film for two hours, but i feel robbed of a possible genius who could have made something of substance and worth. you are not your father. get over it. f*ck even now, your father isn't your father.Coppola masquerades herself as an artist. but there isn't an artist of any kind in her. it's amazing how people who gave a good review to this film have been hoodwinked. suckered. stolen from. the one recurring theme in ALL of her films is that nothing happens and people just walk around for a while.the film has no story. the soundtrack is quite frankly ridiculous and i think that everyone is getting a little bored of American ignorance. but it's OK for US directors to change history to make money. to ignore important periods and events that formed the society in which we now live. isn't it?the American ability to forget is incredible, just as it is incredible that they can't let anything go. really, how many films about African slavery have there been? how many films about the slaughter of native Americans have there been? without a comedic twist might i add.i think that the reason Coppola focuses on such a bland time in Marie's life is because she really doesn't like her. I don't think she understands the character, and i also doubt her simple life experiences. for a film about a woman who probably got more wasted than Keith Richards, the sequences in which these activities are undertaken is devoid of any realism. i don't know how many times little miss Sofia got sh*t-faced and woke up with her head in a public urinal, but if she did it seriously doesn't show here.so, in a nutshell, rubbish, fart, balls and nonsense. excuse the profanity, but there aren't any nice words to describe this film. i suppose thats why we have swears.i don't think I'm alone in stating that the world wouldn't really be bothered if Sofia Coppola literally disappeared. the film going community are simply not waiting for another one of her tedious, repetitive and nauseating wastes of time.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Beautiful, decadent, and disappointing","The soundtrack was good, and was used cleverly, but it wasn't enough to save the story which given the Sophia Coppola ""let's just show our protagonist looking around and being isolated, and in pretty dresses"", just kind of washes out, and just leaves you wanting, but not in a begging ""Lost In Translation"" way. There's not much historical context and important information like the age of the characters, Antionette is fourteen when she is first married, is left out, as is the more dramatic political later years and execution which might have redeemed the rest of the film's earlier fluff. Minimizing history and doggedly rejecting psychology, Marie Antionette, becomes the story of a teenage girl who buys lots of stuff, and engages in the sensual decadence of the world around her. Attempting to engage modern teenage girls with a historical character is an intriguing idea, especially via pop music, however the ideas all but end here, and were just left to wander through the beautiful french palaces and estates, with no more idea of why or what we are doing here than Antoinette herself, which I again understand and appreciate, however just because we cant engage the environment and context, doesn't mean we should be shut off from the subject as well, instead we should be delving deeper into the characters. This does not happen and so we are left looking at a clever advertisement for an idea, rather than the idea itself.",,Anonymous,History
if you don't like this movie,"there is something wrong with you. Like Marie Antoinette herself, it seems like frivolous fluff considering the events that take place. But it's done so well. And French Revolution be damned, it's about a girl. It kicks ass. Sofia Coppola shows a lot of style, elegance, and intelligence in a work like this, not to mention humanity and tenderness, and knowing something about what it means to be a young woman. Obviously other movies of hers then come to mind, I think I'll watch them again soon.And Kirsten Dunst kicks butt. I was touched by the work she did anyway, all-around, but especially with that Swedish dude, and when she bids farewell to her good friends.

I selected this movie and had to make it up to my husband by agreeing to go see a war movie with him. A movie need to be more than visually appealing. And even that wasn't a given.

"""Off with their cakes! Let them eat--""","Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" is an entertaining exercise in anachronism and incongruity. There, that's it. Maybe I should stop now.How else to treat the subject of incongruity pertaining to a teen-age Austrian princess thrust into the French court at Versailles but to go all the way: The dialog goes from period to contemporary idioms, the music switches from Rameau to rock, the young queen and her ladies act like catty, giggly high school seniors uncomfortably costumed for a prom where they do ballroom dancing to rock music. Although the costumes and production design are sumptuously executed, you could almost expect a cellphone's ring tone to interrupt a scene at any moment. And it wouldn't be out of place either.The intricacies and contretemps of court protocol are executed with obvious relish and self consciousness, the acting even more so. So why not show the whole enterprise as nothing more than a bunch of people playing pretend at royalty? The stylized incongruities certainly suit these cynical times. And yes, for good measure, the much-rumored Converse high tops (at least I agree that's what they look like) make their fleeting appearance among the young queen's exquisite footwear.The movie takes on a semi-serious, idyllic turn in the scenes where the young queen indulges her fantasy of a peasant's life in the artificial village around the Petit Trianon, milking cows and gathering eggs, all soft focusy and dream like--a brief, happy period before she awakes to the realities of the impending revolution. It may only be fitting that we are spared the gruesome details following her departure from Versailles. Better to remember the grand times rather than a severed head.And who knows, ""the little Austrian"" might have found this biopic amusing.",,Anonymous,History
My DH and I were Mesmerized by the good quality,"I felt so much like a young girl myself, how my younger life came rushing back to me with the portrayal of Ms.Kurnst as the Archduchess, the Princess, the Dauphine and the Queen. Kirstin was perfect, her face so radiantly beautiful, and no guile there. I am surprised that the royal family got her to do tedium things at all...So, the more bravo to MA.I thought I died and went to heaven, to the costuming of the 18th century, Rococo heaven. I wanted to touch, to look at the stitches and embroidery and the undersupport of each and every costume. I wanted to feel the silk, since I knew it was silk, the way the gowns floated, were coloured and broke on the creases. I was mesmerized by the folds and the ruffles, the incredible sheer amount of work, professional and authentic recreation that went into every scene. I particularly enjoyed the blue shoes in the closet....Her little black pugs'name was ""Eggplant"", ""Aubergine"" in French! She looked just like a little fat dog, a little fat eggplant.DH already asked me if I want this film on DVD and you betcha! What I would like to find is a book of sets and costumes and their descriptions from the wardrober. Maybe I will write and ask for them.The filming was first rate. Some of the scenes seemed a bit underlit, even though they were shot outside. Others were bright. I found the beauty of the place was overwhelming. I was in total shock at the immensity of Versaille, and the immensity of the château de Versailles. This is the first time France has ever allowed free rein to shoot there, and boy does it have that POW factor. That is not paintings on the walls, people, that is actual woven silver and gold and blue fabric made for her, with her cipher woven in all over the castle, on chairs, cement swirls, windowsills, everything.I don't think I will ever be able to view Versaille in person, so this was the closest that I can, and it was so different from seeing it in photos and books. I really got a sense of perspective, and depth. I saw for the first time the 100 foot high hedges, and the Neptune fountains. I liked the quietness of Versaille, and it was so secluded from the outside world.I don't think MA was spoiled, she was just lonely and wanting to fit in with the crowd, and having fun. So she gambled away her jewelry, clothing and money. She had to make it up in the long run, and she did. She reformed the household, but it was a little too late for the French people. Poor Louis was such a stumbler, all these ""ifs"" and the royals would still be in like Flynn yet. (possibly).Where did her little son go? I thought I had studied that he was sent to live with a bourgesoise family and made to live a paupers life, but he was still known as Louis XVII, who did have heirs, but where are they? Not in Burks Peerage.I vote this film for Oscars for screenplay, sheer delight and movie ability to transport the viewer to within its realm, Many Oscars for costuming and wardrobe and scenery, set direction, props....Bravo Bravo Bravo.I loved this movie a lot.

Pretty vacant. The worst movie I've ever seen...,"I can't believe that I actually gritted my teeth and hung on all the way through the painful anachronistic soundtrack, empty-headed dialog, non-existent plot, and vacuous acting, hoping against hope that surely no-one could mangle the intrinsic drama of Marie's infamous trial and execution. Sadly, this was a far from worthwhile sacrifice.Apparently Sony Pictures put a $40M budget into this turkey, and on the surface, it looks like they grossed a positive 50% return on their investment. What that says about current audience tastes is nothing less than horrifying.Anything good to say? Costume design was very good; the scenery was of course magnificent, since it was shot largely on location.But whatever portion of the budget was earmarked for a script and a screenplay must instead have been snorted up the principals' noses, or blown on fireworks, or something, because it was lost completely without trace. The dialog is so excruciatingly bad and appallingly delivered, it's actually a minor relief that there's so little of it.No background is established; no social or political context is established; characters are parachuted into the ""story"" without a word of introduction or a moment of communicative interaction. It's hard to tell whether Coppola either intentionally takes giant liberties with the biographical facts of Marie's life, or simply has no clue about the egregious mistakes her film makes. The film overall is so awful, the latter seems likeliest.Along with failed ""kitsch"" effects, the film's excellent visuals are utterly polluted by a crap contemporary soundtrack that completely jars against the scenery.I'm left with a cliché I thought I'd never descend to: Sofia Coppola just took 123 minutes of my life from me, and I want it back!",1.0,Anonymous,History
Very porlly conceived and executed.,"""Marie Antoinette"" is the name of a film made in 1938 by the great W.S. Van Dyke (Director), the wonderful Norma Shearer (Marie Antoinette), the brilliant Robert Morley (Louis XVI), the talented Tyrone Power, the inimitable John Barrymore, the imposing Joseph Schildkraut, and others whose names will be forever enshrined in film history for this and other grand achievements.""Marie Antoinette"" is also the name of a film made in 2006 by the uncoordinated Sofia Coppola (Director), the ditzy Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette), the ineffectual Jason Schwarzman (Louis XVI), the unfortunate Rip Torn (who must nave been duped, bribed, or blackmailed), and others who will spend much of their later careers trying to live down the fiasco.This review is of course about the latter. I can understand why some reviewers actually like the thing. It's a pretty puff piece, a big fluffball of empty calories – cinematic junk food. In this case, it's not super-salty potato chips, but packing peanuts soaked the dregs of a deep-fat fryer. It's hard to resist this sort of toothsome slop – else most of the fast-food traps would be out of business.The story of Marie Antoinette is a sad one, and in the end she suffered the fate that most members of her class richly deserved. This story needs to be told with empathy and dignity. In this film there is some feeble attempt at the former, but absolutely none of the latter.The banality of the script is almost iconic, leaping like a starved carnivore from cliché to cliché. Amazingly, the script touches effectively on the point that ""Let them eat cake"" (literally, ""brioche"") may not have said by Marie Antoinette at all. In fact the script does a fair job of avoiding historical howlers.We can at least say that the script gets the acting it deserves – as Dorothy Parker once said of Katharine Hepburn, no less – running ""the gamut of emotions from A to B"". The most important problem with the script is where it stops.The connection of Marie Antoinette with the great French Revolution is fundamental. In this film, the Revolution takes place with scarcely any intimation that it's brewing. But the Revolution begins on schedule anyway, but is barely under way when the film ends. Marie Antoinette's life in the first years of the Revolution, and her execution particularly, may as well not have happened so far as this film is concerned. This is even more lame than (for instance) ending the story of Cinderella at the point when she arrives home after running away from the ball. (Of course, I'll bet you that most of any modern audience will sit there gaping, saying to themselves, ""I wonder what happened to her after that"". Such is the state of modern education.) Indubitably, the lamest part of this ""Marie Antoinette"" is the musical (if you can call it that) score. It's not merely lame, it's tawdry and terminally stupid. When it's not insipid musak, it's rock. Now, rock music is incapable of any real emotional content whatsoever. It's OK for car chases, fist fights, shoot-outs, tractor pulls, monster trucks, unbridled raunchiness, and other events of more than usual empty mindlessness. It's totally unsuitable for any film that aspires to some degree of quality. The quantity of this stuff is a good indicator of the depths to which the film sinks.There is a little decent music in the film, every note of it composed during the period of Marie Antoinette's life or before. Even there, the film's penchant for cheap shots shines (if that's the word) through. Recall the several little episodes when Marie Antoinette is awakened and dressed in the morning. The music is Vivaldi's Concerto for Diverse Instruments. Where have we heard that before? Remember ""All That Jazz""? This is the music that plays during Roy Scheider's wake-up ritual. ""Marie Antoinette"" uses some good music to good purpose and even then it's just a cheap rip-off of another film.I suppose it can be said that ""Marie Antoinette"" has its good points. The sets and costumes are very bright, cheery, and not inaccurate. On the other hand, the genuine tawdriness of late 18th-Century French fashion serves admirably to set off the equally genuine tawdriness of the film. The same may be said for the complete absence of Voltaire as a character. After all, why bring out philosophy when you can trot out titillating assertions that Marie Antoinette was a slut.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Do NOT watch!,"If I could have selected 0/10, I'd have done it. The very opening titles should have warned me of what was coming. Currently, I'm considering suing the film makers for completely wasting thirty minutes of my life. This is the story of a legendary French queen retold by an American teenager whose relationship with history before the WW2 is ... lukewarm, at best. Costumes are fine. The acting is far from outstanding, but quite plausible in considered frame. However, it's the music, that fits the theme as a fist fits the eye socket, and that all is topped? Buried? by the logical and historical faults. If you want to see an entertaining, yet more historical movie about the period of 18th century, see Barry Lyndon.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Luxurious, carefree life in the Palace of Versailles before the storm (the French Revolution)","RELEASED IN 2006 and written & directed by Sofia Coppola, ""Marie Antoinette "" chronicles France's iconic but doomed queen, Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst), from just prior to her betrothal & marriage to Louis XVI at 15 in 1770 to her reign as queen at 19, her eventual decline, and the close of her reign with the fall of the Palace of Versailles, located a few miles West of Paris.This is an opulent and beautifully stylized interpretation of the historical events combining period tunes with anachronistic modern music (new wave, post-punk and electronica), which successfully humanizes the historical figures and their world for a contemporary audience. The first two acts effectively show what life in Versailles was like for royalty & nobles in the 18th century; but the last act subtly conveys the looming upheaval of the brutal French Revolution, which was the consequence of foolish spending and blithe, luxuriant living without concern for the common people.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours 3 minutes and was shot in France with studio work done at Pinewood Studios, England. WRITER: Sofia based her script on Antonia Fraser's book Marie Antoinette: The Journey. BOX OFFICE: With a budget of $40 million, the film took in a little over $60 million worldwide.GRADE: B+/A-",8.0,Anonymous,History
Vapid Versailles,"This was, without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Boring would be a compliment. And the ""music"" if you want to call it that, really distracted from what little thought there was behind this stinker. Having music of the 20th/21st century blaring at us part of the time was jarring. Why not Buicks pulling up to cart the royals away... TV in the bathroom... Disneyland on the grounds. Utterly stupid. When a sound track is effective, I can really be entranced by it. When it's this bad, I just want to scream. The acting was for stick people. The dialogue idiotic. The fountain pools had more depth. Nice costumes and they should be. That's where there was the only sign of life. It cost $40M to make and grossed 16M... lucky to get it. Truly dreadful!",1.0,Anonymous,History
Intoxicating,"This film seems to have earned a rather bad reputation, for reasons that I cannot really understand.True, it takes some liberties with history (and usually I am a stickler for accuracy!) but in this case it does not compromise the overall message or purpose of the film, instead helping to show Marie Antoinette, the doomed Queen of France, as a young woman caught up in events that are completely out of her control, rather than the almost fairy-tale villain she has become over the years, seen to not care for the starving French peasants and being said to have flippantly proclaimed ""Let them eat cake!""The actors are far better than you may have been led to believe; all of them humanise historical figures who seem to have faded to caricatures of themselves in the centuries since their deaths. They embody the characters and conjure real feelings of pathos: Kirsten Dunst in particular is superb as Marie Antoinette, making the audience really feel her loneliness and sorrow throughout her life as well as the heady delights and pleasures of being Queen of France and having her every whim catered to. The actors use their natural accents, leaving a mix of English, American, Scottish and more, but this does not distract from the film – indeed it is far less distracting than everyone merely assuming the standard costume-drama English accent would have been!This film is a visual masterpiece, with the scenery, costumes, hair and set dressing all contributing to make an intoxicating feast for the eyes that paints a vivid picture of life at the French court, and I feel that Coppola's vision truly captures the almost ignorant decadence and opulence of the French court at Versailles at this time. The film looks like a wonderful fairy-tale, dreamlike, beautiful, elegant and perfect and the music, whilst some criticise the use of modern new wave and pop music, seems somehow to fit in with the scenes used. In particular, I loved the use of Siouxsie and the Banshees' ""Hong Kong Gardens"" during a masked ball and New Order's ""Ceremony"" during Marie's birthday party.Overall, I love this film and whilst it is not the most accurate of films, it captures the spirit of the time and gives a taste of what life at Versailles may have been like. Most importantly, it shows Marie Antoinette as a real person, showing you her life from leaving home to marry a stranger, seeking acceptance in her new country and all the difficulties her marriage and then her husband's ascension to the throne brings and always leaving you feeling terribly empathetic and sympathetic for the poor, naïve Queen of France, who seems to have meant well but been terribly out of her depth.",10.0,Anonymous,History
dull dull dull dull dull dull,"Apart from the lovely costumes and settings, there is very little to recommend this film. I think Sofia Coppola must be a closet fashion designer or interior decorator - one thing for sure - she can't tell a story with moving pictures and has no depth of understanding to communicate.We must live in a sad culture if this sort of thing passes for good movie-making: jumping from one mind-numbingly boring scene to another with no sense of continuity, no exploration of character, no attempt to build a cohesive whole.Kirsten Dunst looks lovely throughout the movie, but fits in to the background of late 18th century Versailles about as much as a Valley girl at Buckingham Palace.Clothes, shoes and dressing up seem to occupy most of the first half of the movie - and the second half plods boringly along to the inevitable end - although the story reins up before the Royal family actually visits Madame La Guillotine. No insight into the power struggles of Europe, Royal life, Marie Antoinette's character, the French people or the French revolution.Just in case anyone might criticise the movie for being vacuous - why not throw in some Rousseau? Bucolic scenes of Spiderman's girl - I mean Marie Antoinette - reading Rousseau and getting close to nature. So deep, man, I was blown away.Louis XVI is played by Jason Schwartzman. Well! Was he badly-cast or badly-directed - or was he given absolutely nothing (i.e. from the script) to work with? At any rate, here was a man who ruled France, went to the aid of the American revolution, and became Louis le Dernier (Louis the Last)... surely not such a boob as portrayed in this movie. Through Louis, absolute monarchy came head to head with popular democracy - and the man had a chance during the Revolutionary constitutional reign, (17891792) to come to some form of compromise. He sank into depression, left many decisions to Marie Antoinette and ultimately failed. He was abandoned by almost all of the reigning monarchs of Europe, and was left to his fate at the hands of the Revolutionary council. There, maybe, is some meat for a film... but not in this version... Dresses and shoes and food delights...To add insult to injury, along with her choppy, non-sequential presentation (I can't call it story-telling), Sofia Coppola has to show us just how ""edgy"" she is - and backs up some truly aesthetic cinematography with ""hip"" music tracks. How jarring! Not cool. Okay, so endless Mozart might have been predictable - but it would have been beautiful - and even then, there are other composers besides Mozart.The S.Coppola formula: get Daddy's help, round up all your friends, go have a big party at Versailles, play dressing up, shoot some cool static scenes in costume, then go home. Afterwards - see if you can cobble together the ""cool"" scenes to make some sort of movie - add some ""edgy"" music - et voilà!It's quite clear you don't need any talent to make it in Hollywood - just be an uber-cool Hollywood princess and indulge your fantasies about an Austrian princess. Oh, and having Frank for your pop can't hurt either. Did she even read Antonia Fraser's book?So that was 123 minutes of precious life mostly wasted. I would like to get the time back. I liked the costumes, the shoes, the shots of Versailles but that in no way compensates for the tedium of the movie, and my annoyance that someone as evidently untalented as S. Coppola gets more than a dime to make a movie - something she really is not competent to do.",1.0,Anonymous,History
The essence of Rococo,"This movie, I think, is widely mistaken for some kind of High-school teen movie integrated into a historical setting. It is not.The movie shows the experience of Marie Antoinette; her naivety, boredom and disregard for the stiff rituals of Versailles. The film is not historically accurate (especially the music), nor is it very politically engaged or does it have an amazing story-line and plot. What it does have though, is an amazing amount of overwhelming atmosphere, throughout which you get to experience the late-baroque decadence very effectively, like no other movie (perhaps along with Amadeus)has captured it. The melancholy is what makes this movie shine, bordering on boring, this movie captures the almost painful, dreamy, romanticist sentiment of Rococo. The story-line is as vague and dreamy as Marie Antoinette herself. It is a follow-up of different atmosphere's, almost like the movie is as desperate for some excitement as Marie Antoinette is. Everything in this movie is perfectly dosed to match this dreary melancholy - Tools like silence, music and the aesthetic cinematography are directed at this one goal: to capture the essence of Rococo- decadence as the unsustainable ending to court-culture in France, all this throughout the life of Marie Antionette, as the personification of this phenomenon. Certain details refer to the philosophy of Rousseau, and ""the sublime"", all slowly working towards a sense of renewed aesthetic principles, leading towards Romanticism in the decades after. This shift in philosophy is highly sensible throughout this movie.Another extremely interesting feature to this movie is the music. The decision to leave the Rococo music out of it is in my opinion absolutely genius. Not only because choosing music purely because it's from that particular time is in a way very degenerating; disregarding it's expression and seeing it purely as representing a date or theme, ignoring the fact that the music of that time does not have the same impact now, as it would have had back then. The music chosen for this movie generates exactly the right atmosphere for the scenes it is attached to. I especially loved Aphex twin's 'April 14th' in this movie, it has this dreary melancholy that the movie is all about. Like I said, this movie is not trying to be historically accurate, but rather atmospherically, and aesthetically accurate.To most people the ending seemed rather sudden. To me it's the most perfect ending imaginable for this movie. Not only does it resemble the end of the totalitarian reign throughout Versailles, but it's also as mysterious, romantic and aesthetic as the entire movie is, creating the perfect dreamy ending to a dreamy movie, leaving you behind contemplating on the beautiful, but also awkward and sometimes painful melancholy of this movie. Yes it is somewhat dreary, but that's the entire point this movie it trying to make. It's a movie that focuses primarily on an atmospheric experience, which is in my opinion superior to script, story, history etc. Are all these concepts not mostly ""guidelines"" of movies, to generate feelings and emotions among it's audience?This movie is fantastic for the more introvert, dreamy types, like myself, who enjoy a slow-paced movie to contemplate on. This movie may just overwhelm you with it's aesthetic beauty.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Beautifully Terrible,"For whatever reason, I am giving in to my urge to articulate my dislike for this film. I went to watch the film holding plenty of doubts, but I tried to give it a fair chance to see what it had to say. Luckily, I saw it for free.I will start with the things I enjoyed about this film, the most obvious is it's superficial reasons. The costume design, set design, cinematography, and editing were superb. Everything in this film is so succulent and pleasing to the eye, that I am very close to forgiving the film for it's problems. But just like a beautiful commercial trying to sell you a piece of junk, I am not easily persuaded.My main problem with the film is it's implications, politically and philosophically.First of all, I am bothered that this film is very clearly trying to make a large viewing audience sympathize with a selfish, materialistic, negligent person holding a lot of power. The film does this by using beautiful imagery as it's means of attack. It is an obvious contrivance, and it was just too far of a stretch for me. That is the film's biggest failure. This film may have succeeded if it went more in the direction of criticizing the character, but it glamorizes her actions and interests to imply her as a heroine. It does so not through words or story, but by making a visual connection with the character to beauty, therefore implying that she (as a person) is beautiful.Second, I am not interested in the fact that this film implies that people have little control of their actions. The film implies that Marie has little control of her life and is being led along through the story rather than making real choices, important choices. The most important choice she seems to make in the whole film is to cheat on her husband with a war hero. This is NOT a character driven script. I can almost forgive her for her actions, because she is a teenage girl. But rather than considering her as a character with impulses to give up control, I view the script as being contrived to communicate this message.The film seems to be propaganda for rich people. Sympathize with negligent rich people who hold a lot of power and abuse it for their own excess. Why? I because they have no control of their actions, they just do what people advise them to do. They have no accountability they are born into it. What else could they do?I also hate that the angry mob outside her palace are not characterized at all. They might as well be the ""evil"" Indians in old cowboy movies. Or demons. There is no characterization of one impoverished French citizen. You can barely even make out a face in the crowd, just pitchforks, torches, and grunting chants. This is incredibly terrible, and sends a negative message to society. As if people who protest and revolt are terrifying demonic people rather than logical human beings.I also thought the soundtrack failed. And I am a huge, HUGE fan of Siouxsie and The Banshees, Gang of Four, The Cure, New Order, etc. At best, the soundtrack was an interesting juxtaposition. Maybe because I was familiar with all those songs, I got incredibly distracted and taken out of the film every time a song came on. The songs are great by themselves, but put into this context it didn't work.Bash me and spell check me all you want, but this is my point of view.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Lost it,"When this movie was in the theaters I did not see it. The reviews I read were too bad to spend several dollars on it. And that was a difficult decision for me because I like historical films and I liked ""Lost in Translation"" very much. Recently I fished the movie out of a bargain bin for one dollar and watched it at home. Well, I tried to watch it. After the second levee I switched to the special features and watched Father Coppola tell us that he advised his daughter to treat this film like a big Marie Antoinette party where everybody is invited to show up in costumes. That may explain some of it. But I do not like to watch parties. Especially one where everybody but me is high on marijuana and is completely self-absorbed and I am left out. I suffered through some parties in Hollywood which were exactly like this.Obviously Sophia Coppola, the costume designer and the pastry chef went gaga and spent most of the forty million production costs on costumes and cakes. So there was no money left for script, acting, actors, music or anything which usually makes a movie. And as the one who watches the movie they did not let me eat cake nor wear costumes.I also read that this movie was planned before ""Lost in Translation"" was made and only because Sophia had difficulties figuring it out, she wrote and made Lost in Translation first. I really hope that Lost in Translation was not a one hit wonder. It seems nearly unconceivable that this director can turn out such a sensitive movie like Lost in Translation and then directs a complete and utterly piece of fluff like this one.Only because of all her connections in Hollywood she got an Oscar for costumes, because otherwise there is no justification for it, there must be a movie attached to the costumes, there wasn't. And what about that Jewish Dauphin?, only reading through the comments here I learned that she is related to him. If I would not have seen Lost in Translation I would have dismissed the whole thing as daddy bought his daughter a forty million toy. Now I wait and see what she will do next.",1.0,Anonymous,History
lacking in real substance but only if viewed from a narrow minded perspective,"Sofia Coppola's previous films have been groundbreaking and recognised as some of the most incredibly shot pictures in history. Marie Antoinette is not lacking in the visual sense at all but it does tend to lack some substance.On watching the commentary and reading what Coppola had to say about the film has changed my mind as to how effective it was.If viewed as a 'period drama' it loses it's quality and becomes boring without enough background or script. But when it's viewed as the perspective of a young woman coping with such changes and such an extraordinary life it becomes clear what Copolla wants us to see in this film.Possible one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen with a breathtaking soundtrack and an eclectic array or sets, costumes, makeup and props it certainly looks the part of that era.Kirsten Dunst has a childlike quality about her acting making her perfect for the role, she captures the character well and as the only medium the audience has to the films plot she copes well.Don't view this film as another 'The Madness of King George', view it as a diary entry made by Marie Antoinette at that time in her life (do your research). In saying that, this may not appeal to all audiences and certainly won't appeal to those who have a short attention span but to those who will like it, will love it.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Converse goes in one scene - goof or on purpose?,"In the scene where Marie Antoinette is going through her shoes while preparing for a big party you see a pair of Converse All Star 1923 Chuck Taylor basketball shoes for about one and a half seconds. The shoes is seen together with lots of shoes from the time era. Its an anachronism. But the question is...Did Coppola put the Converse shoes there on purpose (which I think she did) or is it a goof?Does anyone know?By the way, the film is really really good! Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as Marie Antoinette. And the cool music from the 80s brings life to the film. I think the soundtrack will be fantastic.",8.0,Anonymous,History
I wasted 2 hours watching this,"All right, the costumes, setting, hairdos and filming are beautiful. But what would be enough for a photograph misses the mark entirely in a film.
A film needs a scenario. It seems Coppola thought using a Wikipedia page would suffice: it does not.
A film needs dialogs. There isn't a shred of that. Coppola thought perhaps that insipid sentences would convey the vacuity of the life in Versailles: it merely conveyed the vacuity of the film.
And the choice of the music was atrocious. Don't get me wrong: I don't mind the clash between a XVIII century setting with XX century music. But why choose bands whose singer can't hold a tune?

Overwhelming decadence,"Starring Kirsten Dunst, the mildly talented Jason Swartzman, nearly unrecognizable Molly Shannon and Judy Davis, and I challenge you to spot Marianne Faithful. Let's get the problem out of the way first: the film uses recent music, including Gang of Four. Not a good idea. Yes, I understand not only attempts to ""sell"" a movie to a younger audience, and to give a ""flavor"" of youth to the new monarchy, but this was NOT the way to do it. If anything, using more contemporary sounds  perhaps with traditional instruments  or some other exploration might have worked, but Sophia Coppola's directing fell down here. Okay, on to the rest of the film: It is SO much better than I expected! The sets, costuming, camera work, lighting, dialog, and acting were wonderful. The decadence was overwhelming, and though you NEVER see the impoverished, starving French peasants (because you're viewing the world through Marie), YOU KNOW they are out there, YOU know this is incredibly decadent, and you KNOW from your history what is coming. Marie's social and psychic transition from Austria to France is a surreal leap into the looking glass. Any excesses Marie found or created were to divert her attention from the crushing rituals and pettiness of the French courts. Had it not been for the score of ""Marie Antoinette"", I would have NO hesitations about this film. None.",,Anonymous,History
Sofia Coppala's Best Film by Far,"After a betrothement, Marie heads off to France, stripped (almost literally) of all Austrian background. Her marriage is awkward, and after the two soon find themselves ruling.It is possible this is the best picture of the year. It was the most beautifully written, most expertly modernized, and the most fantastically directed film I have seen in recent times. Antoinette was like a rockstar, uncaring of the peoples' view of her and almost tragically uncareful. It was stunning. After seeing it, there is nothing but fireworks, large hair, beautiful costumes, and absolutely sensational set design. It was stylized to a point where it was no longer a film about Marie Antoinette. It was a film about the royal lifestyle, a satire on how royalty was a modern day kind of celebrity.I was moved by this film. I have never been so stunned by Kirsten Dunst (except perhaps in Interview with the Vampire). She held her role almost swimmingly. It was one of my favorite performances of the year. Equally fabulous acting was contributed by Jason Schwartzmen.The directing was perfection. It was definitely part of the stylization. The last film that opened my eyes to a way of stunning directing was the marvel American Beauty. Indefinitely, this was the most finely directed film of the year.The writing is phenomenal. Sofia Coppala has always had a way with words, and it shines through in Marie Antoinette. She surpassed Lost in Translation by about seven billion points. It is, again, the most expertly written film of the year.My one complaint has been the way the main character is portrayed. You get a feel of her emotions, thanks to Ms. Dunst, but you don't feel like you know her and how she feels about the people around her properly by the end. Its probably some tragic editing mishap, but there is just something missing from the character.It is hardly noticed though. The film is a tour de force. Its fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Disappointment,"This movie is visually stunning but that's about all there is to recommend it. The soundtrack works really well in some parts but totally misses the mark in others. It is entirely self indulgent and BORING, much like the way Marie Antoinette comes across as portrayed by the ever-snaggletoothed Kirsten Dunst. It simply drags on and on and totally trivializes the historical events it portrays. A rare miss from the talented Sofia Coppola. I would have liked to leave it at that but IMDb has some ridiculous policy that reviews have to be 10 lines long. No wonder the other reviews I read prattled on so much. The bottom line is that this movie is boring. That's really all you need to know. Enough lines yet, IMDb?",3.0,Anonymous,History
"""Marie"" dazzles","Here's a movie that's going to anger more than a few audiences. Some will find it boring, uneventful, vapid. (These were the same complaints leveled against director's ""Lost in Translation."") Others will be angered at the anachronistic use of 80's new wave and modern garage rock. Still others, like the French at Cannes where the film premiered, will be angered that the film doesn't take an overtly critical view of Marie Antoinette's hedonism, funded by the taxpayers, and apparent callousness to the plight of her starving subjects.I think these critics are missing the point. Director Sofia Coppola who is a master of mood and malaise presents us with a clueless Versailles court and defunct monarchy. Vapidity is their birthright. Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) is pretty clueless concerning the walls outside of Versailles. She is tended to, doted upon, constantly gossiped about, and given no higher charge than to produce a male heir with her disinterested, simple spouse Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzmann). She is insulated and given little to do. But she is young, vivacious, and needs an outlet for her energy. Coppola expertly captures Marie's boredom through long stretches of dreamy wandering--see ""Lost in Translation""--and by depicting the grind of her courtly responsibilities.When Marie lets loose in the film's second act she does so to the tune of Siouxsie and the Banshees. To those who bristle at the score, I should remind them that the Dion-influenced score of ""Titanic"" wasn't exactly authentic to the period, either. The music works well as an emotional cue. To a contemporary audience, ""Hong Kong Garden"" simply evokes a certain response not captured by chamber music.The film benefits immensely from being filmed at Versailles. When the camera looks out across the grounds, Versailles appears completely isolated from the outside world. You have no sense of the angry, volatile nearby city. The costuming of the film is also fantastic. The clash of modern rock with 18th century custom and costume is bracing and inspired. (If you look closely during the shoe fitting montage, you'll see a Converse All-Star on the floor.) The opening sequence where Dunst shoots the audience a come hither look is immediately followed by the punk rock inspired credit sequence to the tune of Gang of Four's ""Natural's Not in It."" These moments get the movie off to a rousing start and will probably either fill you with dread or with anticipatory glee.The cast is eclectic and accomplished. Danny Huston, Judy Davis, Rip Torn, Asia Argento, and Steve Coogan all deliver fine performances. SNL fans will be happy to see Molly Shannon as a gossipy courtier. Schwartzmann continues to show a growing range as the ineffectual Louis. The film belongs to Dunst, though, who both elicits sympathy and anger as we observe the obtuseness that leads to her demise.A fantastic film that will divide audiences. Go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
What a waste!,"What a waste of beautiful costumes and set design!
Visually it's stunning but that's about it.
Kirsten Dunst is not a very good actress - when she cries it looks like she's laughing. Maybe she was laughing at the absurdity of the plot. The weird modern soundtrack is so out of place.

real flesh and blood,"The singular accomplishment of Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette is the rendering of a two dimensional historical figure and time into real flesh and blood. Kirsten Dunst's performance is powerful but it is Coppola's direction and Lance Acord's cinematography that brings the teenage queen off the tired page that's been her home for the past century and a half and into our experience. Coppola wastes no time in throwing us into the madness that was pre-revolutionary France. She wants us on Marie's side as she reacts to the absurd structure and strictures of the French court at Versailles. This is ridiculous, she complains early on and we couldn't agree more. The pressure to consummate the arranged marriage to Louis Auguste (the only miscue was Jason Schwartzman as Louis) is almost too much to bear for the sixteen year old Marie and we become fans immediately. Coppola spares us yet another version of the French Revolution as we see only a grumbling mob near the end. Marie silences the mob with a balcony bow. Her reaction to their sudden silence tells us everything we need to know. She can't believe what she sees. We can, though, and therein lies the brilliance of Coppola's work.",,Anonymous,History
"MARIE ANTOINETTE (Sofia Coppola, 2006) **","Sofia Coppola, while evidently in possession of some directorial talent she inherited from her seemingly washed-out father Francis, has managed the unenviable feat of making progressively less interesting movies. Her latest venture was, in hindsight, unsurprisingly booed at its Cannes opening as, despite all the visual sumptuousness a lavish budget can afford – including Oscar-winning costume design and great locations – her film is a tedious misfire by the end of it. An eclectic, rather bizarre cast – including Rip Torn (as a lecherous Louis XV), Asia Argento (as his concubine, Madame Dubarry), Judy Davis (as a doting Countess), Danny Huston (as Marie Antoinette’s brother) and even Marianne Faithful (as her mother) – cannot fail to provide moments of interest but the young leads (Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman) are vacuous bores; I have watched the all-star 1938 Hollywood version only once but I don’t recall Marie Antoinette being the brainless pleasure-seeker pining for an heir she is depicted here. For what it’s worth, the utilization of a contemporary rock soundtrack took me by surprise at first but, when one gets used to it, works surprisingly well.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Marie Antoinette brought to life,"Instead of being merely a conveyor of historical chat like a character in a BBC docudrama, Kirsten Dunst's Marie Antoinette comes to life in Sophia Coppola's wonderful film.Thankfully, this is not another schoolmarmish retelling of a story so well known. Coppola manages remarkably well to stick to historical reality considering the condensation and editing necessary to make a movie, but this is a film that wisely takes for granted that we already know the basic tale.The focus early in the film is on the natural reactions of a teenager who was sent to France as a last-hour substitute after two older sisters died, thrust into a hostile, demanding situation for which she was pitifully unprepared. It continues with her efforts at coping, touches on the maturity brought on by motherhood, and shows her fortitude as it begins to develop within the drama we have seen and read a thousand times.It is sumptuous! Complaining about it being sweet and tasty is like biting into a cream puff and whinging that it should have been fish.My only criticisms: An intermission and another hour would have been swell. I guess I'll just have to see it twice to get my fill.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Let's party like it's 1769!,"Sofia Coppola keeps giving us supremely original and daring films, created from her own uncompromised point of view and aesthetic. She did it with The Virgin Suicides and Lost In Translation, and she continues that tradition with Marie Antoinette, which is as personal as a costume-heavy period piece could possibly be.Here, she teams up once again with her Virgin Suicides leading lady, Kirsten Dunst, to create a sumptuous feast for the eyes. Even more impressive: between the magnificently-detailed sets, stunning costumes and its ravishingly beautiful star, Marie Antoinette manages to avoid all the clichés inherent in this kind of movie, by taking a very personal approach. The film focuses on the teenage title character and how she copes with her nearly unimaginable situation while managing to stay true to herself, in the purest ways, throughout.Coppola's Marie Antoinette is portrayed as a decent, loving individual who conducts herself with astounding restraint, considering her age and the events thrust upon her. It makes you imagine what her life must have been like, from the inside, and it's done in a subtle way, without ever being heavy-handed or overly dramatic.The only problem I had with the film is that the ending seemed unnecessarily abrupt. While I appreciate that Coppola chose not to ""age"" the character to 38, when she was subjected to the guillotine, I still felt the ending could have been done in a far more satisfying manner.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Sadly Didn't Live Up to My Expectations,"Although I enjoyed the film, and the music (I liked the modern music twist especially Adam Ant mixed in with a costume drama) I wasn't wild about it & felt distracted throughout the film, ninety five percent of the time, due the English & American accents, of all the French characters. If you are paid handsomely for a leading role, I think you should endeavor, to at least learn the accent, of the nationality, that you are playing. Especially, if you do not have the added stress, of having to speak the foreign language. A French Queen with an American accent,is just not credible, in my humble opinion.

Let them eat cake!,"I am absolutely obsessed with this film. Sofia Coppola brilliantly captures Marie Antoinette's true spirit: not as an evil queen, but as a naive and young ruler that doesn't fully know the circumstance her people are in outside the walls of Versailles.Critics seem to have either loved or hated the film, but before you listen to those snubbing the biopic because it ""didn't capture the dark reality of the French Revolution"" or ""Kirsten Dunst was too nice when playing Antoinette"", keep in mind that these are people that really need to study up on their history.First of all, Marie Antoinette never actually said ""let them eat cake"". In Rousseau's book, Confessions, he writes: ""Finally I recalled the stopgap solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread, and who responded: 'Let them eat brioche.'"" But this was written years before Antoinette even arrived in France. I think that Kirsten Dunst really captured Antoinette's sweet, care-free, bohemian spirit, and she was perfectly cast in the role.Second, this film is NOT about the French Revolution. It's about the life of Marie Antoinette. Was the revolution dark, bloody, and horrific? Absolutely. But Antoinette was never exposed to the harsh world of the rebellion until the very end of her life.This is essentially the entire point of the film-to show that Antoinette was not evil, just misunderstood. She wasn't really aware of the poverty in France and when critics say that the film was too fluffy and not dark enough, they should know that that's exactly what her life was like.With that said, this film was also amazing not just because of the great script but for several other reasons:1) The acting was perfect. As an actress, I found the honesty in each actor's performance to be real and thoughtful, and Dunst truly ""ruled"" as the title role. Other favorites of mine include Rose Byrne, who played the Duchesse de Polignac, the silly, outgoing, and often tipsy friend of Antoinette. She was funny and charming. I also enjoyed the performance of Jamie Dornan as Count Axel Fersen, Marie Antoinette's love interest. Overall, the casting was great.2) DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THOSE COSTUMES. One word=gorgeous. Go to Google Images and you'll know what I mean.3) The music was flawless. I loved that Coppola chose to include not only Baroque pieces but also songs from post-punk, New Wave bands from the 80's, as well as some indie thrown in for good measure. My favorite songs in the movie include ""Natural's Not In It"" by Gang of Four, ""What Ever Happened?"" by The Strokes, and ""Kings of the Wild Frontier"" by Adam and the Ants.The only critique I have for the film is that the romance between Marie Antoinette and Count Fersen should have had a bigger part in the film than it did. I would have loved to see more of them together. In addition, the pregnancy conflict (I don't want to write any spoilers so I won't go in depth about this) shouldn't be as long as it was.Other than that, this movie is a must-see. I've seen it at least 10 times and I'll probably be seeing it more.Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,History

Eye Candy,"And like candy neither nutritious nor particularly satisfying. I bought this film at Walmart from the $5 bin, and feel as if I were overcharged (I'm only glad I didn't pay even more to see it in a theater). How a movie with this kind of talent wound up such an unholy mess is baffling.I suppose the point was that Marie-Antoinette was just an unlucky teenager, but she comes off as vapid as those fashionably dressed adolescents wandering the mall with iPod buds jammed in their ears. You can make a decent teen comedy out that kind of material: it doesn't work so well for creating a tragic heroine. Likewise, deliberate anachronisms can make for successful comedy, but they're downright off-putting in a historical drama.

The Good and the Bad,"It is visually a beautiful movie in every aspect (even down to the food), and the casting was well done. The movie stays true to history with a current modern appeal. However, the director wastes a lot of time getting to the real interest of the story (or even getting to the story). For example, we see many repetitive shots of the process Marie goes through to get dressed each day, and many scenes of Marie and Louis going to bed at night and not consummating the marriage (we get it - didn't need to see it over and over). There was no value added to the constant repetition in this movie. Why not illustrate more of Marie Antoinette's life? There was so much more. As in ""Lost In Translation"" and ""Marie Antoinette,"" the director's immaturity is quite clear. There is not much story, no flow or consistency of how we got from point A to point B, and hmmm, what's editing? There is too much concentration devoted to the speculation of the main character's personality and not enough to the story. It's like watching something that is directed by a teenager utilizing truly gifted professionals for the rest - a diamond in the rough with the ""rough"" being the direction. Everything else is done with excellent clarity and detail. I give costume, set and cinematography an A - the idea of how the director wanted to portray Marie Antoinette was creative (mixing the 1700s w/ modern flair,) but the actual application of how it was put together was very weak. I stayed with it simply for the costumes and the set direction (and I was waiting for the historic ending but it never came - disappointing).",4.0,Anonymous,History
Loved it! But don't look for a lot of depth...,"I love French history. I've been to Versailles, and I have tried to imagine what it must have been like to be Marie Antoinette, living in her Petit Trianon and her little hamlet....what kind of person would need to create such a world for herself? What could she have been thinking? I didn't admire her, but I have always been curious as to how she could be so obtuse, and, along with her husband, so blind and politically inept.What I have always come up with kind of meshes with the portrayal in this movie: she married young and naive, then, isolated in her luxurious bubble, progressively lost touch with her people and responsibilities. Not everyone cares about those type of questions, but clearly some of us do. I found it a fascinating character study.Also, I really appreciated the fact that this was a woman's movie. It shows perfectly the loneliness and feelings of defeat Marie Antoinette must have felt in a new country, unable to fulfill her husband's family's expectations by producing an heir. It shows her completely devastated by her first real sexual passion, and enraptured by motherhood. Her friendship with the King seemed true to life, born out of their shared isolation and the shared burden of royal responsibilities. She seemed vulnerable and real, despite the her extraordinary circumstances, and I thought Kirsten Dunst did a fine job (though she was far to pretty and too skinny to be Marie Antoinette--but I forgive them that!).Don't get me wrong. I don't think this is a true to life portrayal. The best part of the movie was the visuals. The parties, food, the beautiful people....I loved the the way becoming a Queen (and gaining some autonomy) allowed her to grow to be a new person. She became a decadent libertine, falling in love, indulging in food and drink and dress. Anyone who has ever visited France and seen those gilded interiors has wondered what it was like to properly enjoy them. Watch this movie--see these parties--now you know!I watched this movie with two other women/girls (we are in our late 20's), and it was the perfect girly fix. It made us all want to get all be-ribboned, curl and tease our hair, and giggle about how cute Count von Fersen was while eating bon bons. If that is what you are hoping to get out of this movie, you will not be disappointed--like us!",9.0,Anonymous,History
'Marie Antoinette' a Pleasant Surprise,"Part chick flick, period piece, and historical drama, Sofia Coppola's latest film, 'Marie Antoinette', avoids easy labeling. Although flawed, the film succeeds as an engrossing account of the rise and fall of one of history's most derided and iconic figures. With a strong cast, lavish production values, and an unusual soundtrack, 'Marie Antoinette' is completely one of a kind.Marie Antoinette, who became queen of pre-revolutionary France at the young age of 19, gained notoriety for her outrageous spending habits, eccentric behavior, and wild partying. This life of decadence occurred amidst a national crisis in which the people of France lived in poverty and on the brink of starvation. Marie Antoinette's famous ""let them eat cake"" comment, more or less summed up the general attitude of the upper class: proclaim ignorance in the face of injustice.It's important to note that the film avoids going into much detail concerning the French Revolution of 1789. Those looking for an accurate and all-encompassing historical account of that event had better look elsewhere. That's not what this film is about. Instead, director Sofia Coppola decides to center the film around Marie Antoinette's personal life. The film is told primarily from her perspective and tries to see things through her eyes.Kirsten Dunst stars as the ill-fated queen, whom we meet at the beginning of the film at the age of 15. Marie Antoinette is on her way to the Palace of Versailles where she is to spend the rest of her life married to a man she hardly knows. Audience sympathy is built around Marie Antoinette's unfair situation. Not only does she have no say in her marriage (pre-arranged, of course), but also the only responsibility she is expected to live up to is to get pregnant and, thereby, produce an heir to the throne. The situation is complicated when her husband, the future King Louis XVI, seems unwilling to consummate the marriage. Louis, played by Jason Schwartzman, is portrayed as being completely passive to the point of absurdity. He's so soft-spoken and dim-witted that we can't help but feel sorry for Marie Antoinette.One of things that I liked about the film is that it's high on the charm factor. Director Sofia Coppola, for instance, infuses the film's soundtrack with modern rock music that ordinarily would seem out of place in a historical film. Somehow, it works and doesn't distract from the story. Also, the film's personality matches that of Marie Antoinette, herself: lighthearted, over-the-top, and eccentric. This helps in creating an intimate atmosphere, in which a long dead historical figure feels a little bit more relatable and accessible to a modern-day audience.The film has received mixed reviews and got a combination of boos and applause when it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. It's certainly not a movie for everyone. One of the film's problems is that it's lacking in any real substance. By the end of the film, it was unclear to me what the director was intending to say. The movie is obviously taking a sympathetic approach to Marie Antoinette and tries to portray her as a victim of snobby high society. But beyond this, the film offers very little analysis. Also, by avoiding the events surrounding the French Revolution, the film comes across as rather shallow. After all, no one would really remember or care about Marie Antoinette if it weren't for the Revolution.The film is also noteworthy for being the first movie production allowed access to the Palace of Versailles. By shooting on location, 'Marie Antoinette' feels completely convincing and authentic. With beautiful sets and great cinematography, the film is almost worth seeing just for the production values alone.Sofia Coppola, director of the critically acclaimed 'Lost in Translation', has succeeded in creating a compelling interpretation of a historical figure. 'Marie Antoinette' is a pleasant surprise in an otherwise dull year for movies.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An amateur attempt at art,"I suppose drawing parallels between the modern teen and the life of a pampered, young 18th century aristocrat is valid, but it was clumsily slapped together in this film.Make no mistake, one feels the full gravity of the young queen's ennui. I was just as bored and annoyed watching the endless series of attempts to amuse herself. If that was the point, then it was achieved within 30 minutes. The rest of the film had me wanting someone to lob off Marie Antoinette's head, just so that the end credits would roll.The choice of music was all part of the jarring effect of the film that perhaps was intended to bring home the idea that these rulers were just kids, but it was distracting. The sound quality was tinny and made the music even more alarmingly out of place. In fact the scene transitions, the story telling methods, and even the accents of the actors were so uneven that almost no part of the film seemed like it belonged together. Rather it looked and sounded like a high school audio visual class experiment. (Now we're going to show time passing through music video montages and now we're going to show time passing by changing paintings and now for something completely different.)Even the acting was spotty. There were some brilliant flashes among the muck. Jason Schwartzman and Rip Torn were wonderfully subtle. Kirsten Dunst was surprisingly inconsistent. She is a gifted actor, but seemed to be punching her time card for some of the scenes. Many of her most important lines were delivered completely flat. When one is forsaking one's only companions and pledging to stay beside one's husband during a revolution, it is unlikely that it would be done with the same inflection and facial expression as if one were reading a prospectus aloud.As if being as bored as the characters in this film weren't bad enough, it was sad to be so disappointed by Ms. Dunst's flat performance. I wish I had missed this one.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Unique vision, beautifully rendered","Some people seem to get upset at this film's rejection of true historical detail. Others think that it is superficial 'candy'. I believe that Coppola ought to be commended for composing a fresh and personal pastiche of a young woman's experience in an extraordinary time and place. The value of the film lies in its impressionistic qualities. It is superbly cut with images of lasting aesthetic beauty and a cohesive tone and colour palate which holds it together as something far greater than its detractor's seem to be willing to admit. The performances were stripped of the stiffness usually associated with period representations. The film is exceptional in its ability to render the historical figure of Marie Antoinette with immediacy, personality and empathy. It brings to life Sofia Coppola's own 'pastel' vision of a famous story and thereby invests the story with stunning visual beauty which is at times uniquely coupled with a delightfully effervescent tone.

Coppola tries too hard to be poignant.,"Last night I went with my mother, my younger sister, and my sister's friend to see Sofia Coppola's latest production, ""Marie Antoinette."" I had seen trailers and thought it would be interesting, especially since I had heard the soundtrack and knew it consisted of mostly modern rock. Two and a half hours later, as the screen finally darkened and the credits started to roll, Mom and I looked at each other with identical expressions of incredulity. We were both thinking the same thing: That's IT?!As we drove home, huffing and puffing, several things crossed my mind:1. Maybe Coppola's budget got cut when they were halfway through production, so they cut the screenplay short (as in, they stopped telling the story halfway through). The extravagant costumes surely must have usurped the budget normally reserved for screenwriters.2. This is not the first Coppola film I have been disappointed with. ""Antoinette"" surpasses her 2003 release of ""Lost in Translation"" only in lag time. I was interested in seeing Coppola's ""The Virgin Suicides,"" but after the disappointment of the other two, I could venture a guess that the reasons the virgins were driven to such an act was due to desperation at being trapped in yet another boring flick.3. During the scene in which Kirsten Dunst is stripped of all Austrian belongings, including her clothing, my mother leaned over and whispered, ""Kirsten Dunst has a weird backside."" I myself didn't notice; I must have been preoccupied with searching for a plot.4. Marie Antoinette did not, as the movie suggests, have an illicit love affair. This was a gaping example of Coppola's inserting falsehoods while skimming through the more interesting facts of Antoinette's life. Lady Antonia Fraser (the author of the biography on which Coppola based her production) would be horrified. In his review of the film, Roger Ebert offered an explanation for the lack of historical details: ""That is because we are entirely within Marie's world. And it is contained within Versailles, which shuts out all external reality. It is a self-governing architectural island, like Kane's Xanadu, that shuts out politics, reality, poverty, society."" But this does not explain Coppola's decision to include the affair, or her decision to gloss over the fact that Louis XVI had a slight (but reversible) medical problem which prevented him from performing in bed. The film was already rated PG-13, wouldn't this have been allowed?5. At two and one-half hours in length, one would suppose the director had ample time to develop her characters. After all, the film covers at least ten years of her life. Instead we see montage after montage of shoes and champagne glasses and little cakes (what WERE those, anyway?). Most of the screen time is used depicting the couple's first few years of marriage. When, ten minutes before the end, we finally are offered something of substance, it is presented stoically. We learn (with no words uttered, of course) that she has lost her baby, but we only see a painting of Antoinette with her three children, then it is replaced by a painting with only two. Any chance of arousing the audience's sympathy with this tragedy is lost. Apparently Coppola thought the shoes were more important.6. I am not impartial to the actors in this movie; I admire the previous work of Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman, as well as many of the supporting cast members. I have seen them in other films and I know what they can do. The fact that I found the two stars completely dull in this film (by the time it was over I felt like bringing out the guillotine for them myself) is not their fault; it is the script. More interesting things happened to Marie than getting dressed in the morning, and we see this at least three times.7. How much dialogue was in this movie? Most of it was dominated by Kirsten Dunst walking through the palace, Kirsten Dunst looking out a window, Kirsten Dunst looking longingly at oblivious Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI. Were they paying the actors by words uttered?8. That Marie Antoinette's life was boring is a given. There was little to do, few people to talk to (fewer still who didn't gossip about you when your back was turned), and high expectations for propriety. But a modern audience doesn't need to see Kirsten Dunst walk past gossiping courtiers fifteen times to realize that they are talking about her. Coppola seems to have few points to drive home, but she drives them home with a sledgehammer. It is only a matter of time before the audience loses interest.9. The budget for this film must have been huge. The locations are grand (the French government allowed the crew special permission to film in Versailles), the costumes are amazing. Why more of this budget could not have been spent on adequate screenplay, I don't know.10. Maybe someone convinced Sofia Coppola to include modern music in order to keep the audiences awake.Roger Ebert's rating: A My rating: C-",3.0,Anonymous,History
"its about the feeling, not understanding","I loved Marie Antoinette, and I can understand why this movie has so many haters. Marie Antoinette is a very feminine, light movie, that Im sure logical, looking-for-facts male population of the world would never enjoy watching. Firstly, the absence of the plot, makes the movie one room for feeling.It is the feeling of the place and the atmosphere which is a goal of the movie, not the actions themselves, that led to certain consequences. Commenting on one of the previous reviews I read, I can say, I don't think Marie Antoinette even needed this explanations, and portraying the Louie XV particularly right. It was not about him, the movie was about the age of reigning teenagers in chic and glamour of hidden rooms, It was about this age of beautiful dresses of the high society, overspent in lush. I love how Coppola shows this thru the visual beauty. We see a teenager, brought up to be married away, coming to a foreign country, prepared to be something, she doesn't really know what. So, she vanishes in the fun life of gambling, dresses, friends, gossip. And, she lives in this bubble of a world, where she doesn't really know what real France is, she doesn't really see what ordinary people live like. This underlines very well, how kings and queens of the time were distant from their people. About music: I loved the touches of the contemporary music to the XVIII- century France. We all understand it didn't look that way, and events weren't that simple and light.But the music, it just gives this feeling of taking the events out of the past and putting them on for now.Different accents, different styles of music, make up, and all that mixture in one big beautiful mess just makes this movie pleasantly bizarre. Its just as simple as that. Its not about the understanding,its about feeling it. I don't believe this movie could be better than it is. Enjoy",9.0,Anonymous,History
waste of money to watch at a theater,"we went to watch this, really expecting some decent entertainment and fun. the music is chosen well but the story gets really boring as the movie lurks on and on and even if you have developed feelings of sympathy towards the main character, in the last 20 minutes of the movie you really just want to see the credits and get it over with.i have failed to make out a climax in this movie and i personally thought putting a pair of baby blue chuck Taylor's in the scene showing her shoe closet ( i don't really know why i would need an obvious connection to our wasteful lives in the year 2006) was a bit uncalled for.i'm sure there was a lot of great intentions involved in the making of this movie. and i can see that it's quite a task for a director... but whatever she was trying to do, Coppola failed miserably at entertaining me. as most of us know the story of Marie Antoinette makes for a great story, unfortunately the movie doesn't.",4.0,Anonymous,History
so cool; you get it or you stick to documentaries.,"This is a ground-breaking and modern film. Coppola has created a film that is original and clever, removing baroque music and the French language to humanise Marie Antoinette and bring the whole scene out of the documentary world. The clothes are fantastic, the music extremely original; it is all just a vision of a world of wealth and fun. So many people have said that ""oh, I don't like the different accents"", but why should they all have French accents or posh British accents (mind you, there's no Cockney)? Kirsten Dunst's accent has been used to humanise Marie Antoinette from a woman of history into a girl of our modern age; it subconsciously clicks in one's head that this Versailles is not a history book, this Versailles is a dream world. Everything is an eclectic mix of the past and of contemporary life. It is SO COOL, that you either are conservative and stick to the BBC pride and Prejudice documentary style, or you dare to break the rules and indulge in Coppola's avant-garde invention. You either get it, or you don't. THE MOST ORIGINAL FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Incompetent and Xenophobic Travesty of a Movie,"Coppola's signature style  minimalist character development, superficial musings on life without any plot or drama  is here revealed for what it truly is; the clumsy attempts of a scion of Hollywood royalty to disguise her obvious lack of any discernible talent. 'Virgin Suicides', the impossibly over-rated 'Lost in Translation', and now 'Marie Antoinette', provide audiences with a damning trilogy of the very worst of film industry nepotism. Can any of us truly believe for a moment longer than this fiasco of a movie would ever have been made were it not for father Francis' power, or that his presence as Executive Producer, alongside her brother Roman's as Second Unit Director, and cousin Schwartzman's non-performance as Louis XVI, doesn't mark it out as the nepotistic family affair that it truly is?'Marie Antoinette' is a monumentally bad movie. There is no real plot, no narrative worthy of the term, no story beyond a few events casually strung together. There is no drama, no tension, no motivation given to any character. The entire movie consists of vacuous individuals wandering around beautiful and uninhabited locations doing absolutely nothing. Just as 'Lost in Translation' was little more than a tedious montage of Coppola's Tokyo vacation videos, so 'Marie Antoinette' amounts to little more than footage of friends playing dress up in old buildings. And to make matters worse, they play dress up in inaccurate clothing in buildings that would not be built for another 100 years!Devoid of any historical or political content, we see none of the political machinations of Antoinette and the various aristocratic power players in court. We see nothing of Louis's agonized indecision over the steady forward march of democratic reform. We see nothing of the chaotic bustling city that was the Palace of Versailles, the troop maneuvers or constant petitioning that foreshadowed the march of the Parisian fishwives. We see, and feel, nothing of the woman Marie Antoinette or her plight. Just as Coppola invites us in 'Lost in Translation' to laugh at the Japanese and Japanese culture, at the funny accent and oh-so-amusing cultural idiosyncrasies, here she invites us (repeatedly) to laugh at the hilarious sight of men wearing make-up and wigs. Her complete disregard of history goes way beyond a filmmakers desire to update a compelling story and reveals a deep-seated contempt for history, tradition, and foreign cultures.But such contempt can hardly come as a surprise when Coppola's movies are invariably auto-biographical. They tell the stories of bored little rich girls who desperately want to be taken seriously while ordering room service and buying new shoes. I sincerely hope that every critic that has heaped praise on this talentless fraud of a writer/director, and everyone who voted for her Oscar win, is suitably ashamed, for this Empress has finally been revealed to truly have no clothes.",2.0,Anonymous,History
An excellent parallel between THEN and NOW.,"'Marie Antoinette' is an amazing accomplishment. It combines visual splendour with a surprisingly economic screenplay. It is CINEMATIC, in the sense that it is not dialogue driven. The images say it all from the wide canvas of grandeur to intimate moments. The film commences with a clear statement via the modern music track. This is not another conventional period piece film about THEN. This is about NOW. This is about a girl with a well meaning character and a fondness for gentle tactile things (like her pet) caught up in a non-tactile cynical world of politics, like a lamb to the slaughter. The rest is history. My point is that the film depicts any one of us living in a time of wealth and self-indulgence and designer labels, while three-quarters of the world are 'have-nots'. It is a surprisingly stylish and non-sensational film (by American standards), focusing on the cocoon life style of any privileged person who postpones the realities awaiting us, coming at our door from the 'have-nots', through no fault of our own, except through our denial of the reality outside our cocoon. Congrats to all involved, especially Kirsten Dunst who held the picture, and the uncompromising quality from the Production Design and Wardrobe departments. I ignored the awkward mix of accents, and applaud the casting of minor characters and extras who conveyed jaded vipers a la francaise.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Absolute Crap with capital C,"My poor fellow American friends! I would have loved to see a great movie about this captivating part of french history, unfortunately, the taste of the director, who I suspect, succeeded in the career thanks to her last name, is absolutely grotesque, ludicrous and so far from the historical truth. It is one thing to try to make art movies with random subjects of modern life, but it becomes extremely more hazardous with historical movies. In that case, the director must seek counsel from a major historian (and no need for a french one, I'm sure Harvard, Princeton or Yale are full of amazing teachers more than willing to help!). So, this could be fun if it was a parody, or a teenage movie, or even a cinema version of Saved By The Bell, but we are legitimately waiting for something more convincing or more accurate considering the topic. We are very far from the taste of, let's say, Kubrick in Barry Lyndon, and I see no genius in her direction, so what is the point to waste time watching this?Last of all, the rock soundtrack on 18th century french history is less than a poor choice, it is idiotic. Please, if you still really want to see it, don't watch this movie in order to learn more about Louis XVIth and Marie-Antoinette, you have unfortunately no other choice than to read a good book about it as no movie has treated the subject really convincingly.",1.0,Anonymous,History
History brought alive,"A brilliant way to explain the history of this era to those who would not normally pick up a history book. Coppola may not have gone for absolute historical accuracy, but who really knows exactly what it was like back then? Coppola creates a character that we can relate to. Whether that is accurate or not is not the point. Once we sympathise with Marie-Antoinette then we can enter her world and start to imagine what it might have been like in Versailles in the 1700s. Yes it would have been good to have seen what life was like for the peasants in France then, but that would be a different story.

A soundtrack in search of a movie,"There is no reason to see this movie other than to be able to say you saw it before panning it as the self-indulgent, pretentious claptrap that it it is. I have never seen anyone go from 60 to zero the way this director does from ""Lost in Translation"" to this bomb. Loving attention is given to set and costumes, for sure, but so what? As a movie, as an exercise in visual story-telling, with characters and a plot that matters, it is an abject failure. You end up rather promptly not caring about any of the characters and wishing the movie would end, soon. Even if you step back and try to understand what the director/writer was trying to accomplish, it is hard to believe this hit the mark. The movie is pointlessness and witlessness and visual lard, punctuated by some cool songs that are clearly intended to overcome the pointlessness and witlessness and visual lard. What a shame. I do think I will download some of the songs from the soundtrack. Don't waste your time or money seeing the movie, however.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Great form of public history,"As a history major working on their masters, I have am well versed in European history and the French Revolution. Though this film does take historical liberties and express primarily one side of this story, I think that it is an excellent example of public history. It is beautifully made, and portrays the glamorous side of royalty as well as the awkward formal rituals of life. Though scholars will certainly disagree with many elements of the film, it does serve a great purpose for the study. This film will open many people's eyes to early 18th century European history, and make them went to go and learn more on the subject. Take a class, read a book and just genuinely be excited. In a time when many feel that History is a lost cause, I think that is a great thing. For those that are going to see the film and expecting a great historical and factual drama, then you will possibly be disappointed. However, if you go in there with an open mind, and appreciate the director's portrayal of these historical figures as real people then you will not be disappointed.

I went to this movie expecting a chick flick with a few things that make it a decent movie. What I got should not have ever been made at all.

supreme Kirsten Dunst,"This is the latest movie by Sophia Coppola and the first I saw, instilling in me the will to see the two previous ones. Needless to say, the protagonists in all three movies, are women, young women, living in an always definite environment, a hostile environment, being it the royal Palace of Versailles or a metropolis of today (Lost in translation), or a common American suburb in the 70's (The virgin suicides). The young girls are always alone, feel entrapped, oppressed and not understood by the nearest ones. This is evident also in Marie Antoinette, where we are not asked to take historical facts into account, the movie scores on history and politics, they do not matter, we are asked to enter the world of an adolescent, to feel empathy with a girl who was purchased at the age of 14 to become a queen, to be a wife, to bear an heir, never allowing her to be a teenager. And we are able to do this in such a natural way: in an exterior world made of feasts, banquets, cakes, colourful dresses, we can perceive, besides Marie's fun and lust, her deep solitude and suffering. Kirsten Dunst is simply perfect: her naturally attractive and powerful mixture of innocence and yearning for experience, of joy and sadness, emerging from a single glimpse of her eye, make her interpretation supreme.Much negative criticism had been spread around this bio-pic: use of punk-rock music as inappropriate, anachronistic dresses since dyed in colours that could not be achieved at those times, a general boring tone which too brashly disregards history. I totally disagree: that kind of music helps underline the modernity and actuality of feelings which always affect being an adolescent, the overcoloured and over elaborated dresses (wonderful, to say the least), represent a very effective means to contrast the exterior pomp with the inner suffering of the heroine, and the overall tone, disregarding politics and historical facts, is obviously searched for, in order to focus attention on the real protagonist: Marie as a young French girl.",9.0,Anonymous,History

In fact, it is no story at all, but rather a series of boring, repetitious, poorly realized vignettes. The contemporary music that opens the film, and is used later during the body of the work, makes no sense, a jarring note. Beautiful to look at? Yes. Compelling, moving, worth two hours?

A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Marie Antoinette (2006),"Sofia Coppola takes on a historical character in Marie Antoinette, providing her own vision of the doomed Queen of France and the French Monarchy under the reign of Louis XVI, based upon the biography written by Antonia Fraser.Kirsten Dunst, whom we ever so often remember with red hair for her Mary Jane Watson roles in the Spider-Man series, plays the titular role, bringing forth girly innocence, frustration and strength as her character develops through the course of the movie. Sofia Coppola clearly made this movie focused on events from her point of view, covering major incidents and happenings in her life.I thought the first half of the movie was excellent, where Marie gets married to the Dauphin of France Louis XVI, a marriage of strategic importance to seal the Austrian and French alliance, but one which seems to be stuck in the ruts because of incompatibility. She likes theatre, he's into hunting. She's into fashion, and he's into locks and keys. Consummating their marriage is a problem, and remains a major obstacle and puts constant strain on Marie Antoinette, because without producing an heir to the throne, her position in the court is always precarious, not to mention, without influence to further advance Austrian interest.But don't forget, she's but a teenager, and Sofia Coppola never fails to remind us of that - the difficulty of a young one living within the constricting protocols of a monarchy. And not to mention under public scrutiny all the time. Although a period movie, Coppola managed to bring forth the issues faced into current time, since the themes and events explored are quite similar to the contemporary era. The bitching, the rumour mongering, and the superficial small talk of people of perceived importance are nothing new in this day and age, and Marie more often than not is the favourite subject for the tabloids.It's not all sympathetic to the character though, as her vices like gambling, drinking and rumoured dalliances with Count Fersen in her holiday home of Petit Trianon are played out, together with her rather callous attitude toward what was happening to the commonfolk. While politics is rarely touched upon, the portrayal of the King's handling of foreign policy for face rather than taking care of his subjects is probably one of the fundamental contributing factor to its downfall, and France is shown to be slowly bankrupted while sending aid to American for the revolutionaries to fight against the British, unaware of growing resentment in home soil.The second half felt more of a rush job, with Marie's spiral into unpopularity with her perceived extravagant decadence. It's a reminder of how someone's image can be greatly tainted by uncorrected, vicious rumours, and when the power of the people is at full force, you can't help but submit when all is lost. Some have questioned why the movie didn't pursue all the way until the final demise of Marie Antoinette, but frankly, looking at the film's treatment of the character, there's actually no need to, and all in all, quite a balanced presentation on how an historical character is brought to life on screen.With beautiful costumes, rich colours, and sets based within the actual Palace of the Versailles, it's a pity that this movie did not make it to our local screens, and I believe watching it on the big screen will make all the difference. For those who want to take a look at the much talked about easter egg in the movie, the Converse shoes are shown at the 55:48 mark.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Delicious Piece of Cake,"""Marie-Antoinette"", the ambitious project Sofia Coppola intended to adapt to the screens after her successful feature debut, ""The Virgin Suicides"", was made after Francis Ford's talented daughter took a break from all the historical research about the Austrian queen and decided to write another story in order to distract herself - it went on to become ""Lost in Translation"", her masterpiece.""Marie Antoinette"" was released 3 years after ""LiT"", and displeased most critics - after all, nothing can be shallower than a period drama with modern pop/rock soundtrack, right? Well, Sofia's soundtracks are always a delight (I must admit I have all of them, and I bought Marie Antoinette's double album without even seeing the movie and wasn't disappointed at all!), and she used rock to the likes of New Order, The Cure and The Strokes and classical opuses in right doses, making it a cool experience way better than, say, the incongruous ""A Knight's Tale"" (2001), with Heath Ledger. The cinematography (by Lance Acord), the Oscar-winning costumes (by Milena Canonero, ""Barry Lyndon"" and ""Chariots of Fire"") and the art direction are stunning. Of course a wonderful production doesn't make a great movie, and Marie Antoinette is Sofia's least interesting film so far - it lacks the depth and passion that we saw in ""Virgins"" and, especially, ""Lost in Translation"". Antoinette may be style over substance, but it isn't a bad movie by any means - and for those who say it's shallow because all we see is Marie being promiscuous and partying with her friends, well, that's the point: the absurdity of a 15 year-old having to marry, have kids and everything that royalty was demanded back then. She was a girl who couldn't realize she was ruining her country. Kirsten Dunst is quite convincing in the title role, and the secondary cast has some remarkable names (Judy Davis, Rip Torn, Jason Schwartzman, Steve Coogan, Marianne Faithful). Far from being a masterpiece, yet much better than what the haters are painting it, ""Marie Antoinette"" is, without doubt, a delicious piece of cake. 8/10.",,Anonymous,History
About a girl.,"Perosnally, I loved it. Very much my sort of film. The decadence, the old world charm, with the modern edge. Sofia's done it again. It will most definitely be an addition to my DVD collection. Its had its fair share of critics, but some people took from it what they did, and didn't understand what Sofia was presenting us. I loved the transitions in Marie's character. From confused young Dauphine.. to accepting her world in the way she did, which was of course, spending lavish amounts of money on frivolous things. But a lot of girls can relate to that. I mean, obviously, we don't have the resources a queen would have. But this modern world is all about comforting yourself with consumer goods, as we have more disposable income. It all seems so empty and selfish. But in Marie's case, her life was pretty empty. Behind all that decadence.. she has a gawky, austere husband, who did love her, but in his own uncomfortable way. Other characters could have been developed more. Such as the relationship between Marie and Count Fersen. And of course, the queen's favourites. But I suppose they had to behave in such a manner becoming to a typical young woman's circle of friends, read: giggly, gossips and a penchant for shoes. This film was not about French History, Europe, the Revolution.. it was about a girl. The girl that lends her title to the film. Yes, it was superficial, it was about gossip. There are plenty of other films out there about the revolution, and if thats what you wanted to see here, well then, you were disappointed. It is about a girl trying to adapt into a world quite different from her own, yes it reeks of americana.. but aren't most modern teenage girls/young women's like that today? It is a beautiful film, every frame stuffed with elegance, luxury, decadence. The Dauphine was surrounded by it. If it was a film about French History, Europe, the Revolution, the ancien regime how popular would it have been? This is Sofia Coppala we are talking about here. Sofia is taking liberties here, transporting the superficiality of today's world into the world of Antoinette. Ans it IS the world of Antoinette, it is the world around her, it is the people around her. It is her day to day life. It is not the story of France's revolution. It is portraying Antoinette as your average (well, not so average) young woman, with a love for shoes of course. This was a story about a girl.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Sorry Sofia,"Sorry, I was extremely disappointed in this film. I enjoyed the costuming - although the shoes were over the top - somewhat too modern Manolo... The makeup was pretty good except the aging of Kirsten Dunst was ridiculous. But plot? Helooooooo. I mean this is a period drama. It's built in. But there was just all this wandering around. Nothing to describe - who was who. If you don't have a history degree you are just watching pretty people. I have read some interesting comments here and there about this film and while I don't disagree with every rave reviewer... I really worry about this ""genre"". I don't think every historical fiction would be turned to a farce or played out like Masterpiece Theatre. I think you have to play to a current audience tho. The pace was so slow I could have snoozed thru entire sections and not missed a thing. To me one of the marks of a great film is that you get wrapped up in it forgetting the actors and you learn something - it just didn't happen for me in this picture. I used to live in France. I have been to these places - Many Times. They are glorious. The photography was flat. Was everything filmed at sunrise or sunset? And the birthday sunrise? Puhleez. Where was the sun or did they just float an orange light over the water. Ugh. There was relatively little explanation of where they were. I didn't at all get the size of the place from the photography. The palace is huge they had these carriages leaving off the back side and only once showed you the grand front courtyard. It was a miscarriage of the beauty of this amazing palace. With the French Government allowing you in to do this work it is sad that it wasn't better represented. There are just too many things I took issue with. Vignettes strung together with historical verbiage do not a ""movie"" make. Better luck next time Sofia.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Let Them Eat Cake!,"As far as I am concern, Sofia Coppola is a genius when it comes to this movie. She took a completely dead genre and made it modern and fun.

And it is this realism that is a true art. This realism perfectly represents what life must have been like to the young queen. I just thought it was genius. For those who say it's a shallow movie clearly didn't understand the piece. The acting was also superb. Like the film itself, they just felt so real. Kirsten Dunst was wonderful as the queen, especially in the beginning when she first entered Versailles. Jason Schwartzman was hilarious in his own shy and quirky way.

Fair to Middling if That,"I really had no desire to see this, but a friend wanted to so I went. I should have trusted my instincts. The theater was almost empty--what does that say. The first clue that this was a rotten drag was when we first see Marie (Dunst) as a girl supposed to be 15--and 15, she does not look. So ridiculous was her entrance with highlights in her blond hair---mind you, highlights...now did they have highlights back then. I was not too keen on the casting and what was most incredibly and so extremely disturbing was the rock music--rock music in a seemingly period piece. You, the viewer, the audience, get only a fraction of the character that was Marie Antoinette. We do witness some maturity and growth, but then, slam, slap--the movie ends. I was stunned as were the few, very few, sitting with me in the rather empty theater. At least, the director could have put some words on the screen to tell the viewer what happened, but I guess she figured we all know the ending---bad. See it on television.

A Very Modern Adaptation of Marie Antoinette,"Marie Antoinette is a historical film based upon the novel and life of the Austrian Queen of France, Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst), wife of King Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). The young Austrian leaves her home, her family, all her belongings and even her little pug dog. Her mother, the Austrian Duchess Maria Theresa (Marianne Faithful), tells the young Marie Antoinette, ""you may have all the French dogs you want."" Arriving in Paris, Marie Antoinette is escorted to Versailles where she is married and a new life begins. ""Nothing happened,"" King Louis XV (Rip Torn), is informed after their wedding night. After what seemed like a long time, nothing ever happens between the young couple. They are finally attended by a French Doctor. The young Louis has no desire for his beautiful bride. He is impotent. ""He has spent too much time with the stable hand."" It was said. King Louis XV, lies on his death bed and cries. ""I know what I must do."" After much coaxing from the Austrian mother, ""your life in Versailles is not secure until an heir is produced."" The marriage is consummated and three babies are born. I found the film to be disturbing--the guillotine is enough to disturb anyone. Marie Antoinette is blamed for the opulent lifestyle and waste of the French Royalty. At the end, Marie Antoinette sends away all of her mistresses as the revolution has begun. With a bang upon her bedroom door, the officer enters and states to the maids remaining, ""tell the Queen Mother, we can not secure her."" The Queen and King Louis XVI, leave in their carriage.

Horrible storytelling,"I must say that I was expecting a whole lot more out of this movie - and frankly, a whole lot more could indeed have been put into this movie. Maybe I don't know Mrs. Coppola's ""style""... So it's a little more ""independent/Europpean-oriented"", fine... I can also deal with the fact that you're hearing 70's-like rock music being played in ballroom dancing scenes and that it is used throughout the movie. That's OK, I accept (and respect) that. However, what I have zero respect for is a story poorly told and ultimately, that's what it should be about: the story, and how it moves you back and forth, through the highs and lows.In that respect, the movie does not succeed at all. It does a horrible job at it. Where there could be room to further understand the background of the characters, to understand why Marie Antoinette even goes to France (not all of us have History majors) and to actually see the implications and consequences of her behavior outside of her kingdom of dreams, we are ""treated"" with long, boring, exceedingly visually-descriptive scenes of her day-to-day life, where things happen from one shot to another with apparently little to no connection.Around me, in the theater, people kept moving in their seats back and forth, tapping feet, sighing heavily, almost as out of prayer that SOMETHING would happen and that you could get actually hear Kirsten Dunst talk for more than two minutes at a time which would be followed by five minutes of silence, when frankly, there is so much to be told.So great, we know as much of Mrs. Antoinette's life as we know P Diddy's after an episode of MTV Cribs... But WHO is Marie Antoinette? WHERE does she come from? WHY is she there? And in the midst of her reign, HOW EXACTLY does the public react? And why are we shown a fraction of what we could really see? And more importantly, HOW does she end up in the guillotine?To sum it up: I was expecting a whole lot more depth, and intensity (yes, there is room for that) out of this movie, with a lot more perspectives. A very good and interesting story could be told, and this movie could indeed get a ten star rating. But after what I've seen, a) I'm never again going to see a Sofia Coppola movie and b) I think I'll have to settle for when the History channel does a documentary on the subject. I really think it will be ten times more interesting and compelling than a pseudo-artsy movie like this.Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Marie Antoinette review,"Personally I loved it Sofia Coppola is criticized by many for not having much dialog which can, in theory, be a hard task to keep the movie flowing with out it (which i think i experienced a bit of in Lost In Translation) however the visuals in this movie did a gorgeous job of this along with quick editing in a fresh 'jump cut' manner. I so enjoyed the lack of self indulgent monologues or drawn out professions of love or despair, instead you are allowed to insert the emotions you feel so deeply through the editing, the visuals, and expressions of the actor, Also with the little dialog it is almost as if you are invited to be a spectator, like a close friend to the movie's subjects and analyze them as you might guests at a party. Kirsten Dunst was much better than i had hopes for, subtle and believable and i particularly enjoyed Jason Schwartzman's Louis XVI. Over all loved it, Gorgeous visually and just an over all beautiful movie",8.0,Anonymous,History
"All style, no substance","It's beautifully done. The costumes, the wigs, the sets, a total visual feast! Yet, ultimately just all style but no substance.I like the novel approach of adding 80s music but it could've worked better if they picked a lane: either kept the dialogue accurate to the period (which would've made a great foil against the modern soundtrack) or just made the dialogue all modern. The inconsistency didn't really work for me.I'm no expert in history but it's clearly inaccurate and missing the full picture. There were only hints of what was happening, historically, in France that led to the revolution until the end when people were at their doorstep.There's no real arc to the movie. This is what made it a bit dull overall for me. The most exciting thing was her finally having a baby and this really rather anticlimactic and dull. The rest of the movie just continues with her indulgence in the over the top opulence of a royal lifestyle.No matter how much I enjoy period films for their artistry and settings, its charms eventually got tiring. This really could've had more potential in a more skilled writer.",5.0,Anonymous,History
History with a touch of contemporary pop,"Sofia Coppola is a highly underestimated director, in my opinion. She directs this film, like Lost in Translation, with incredible finesse. I'd say she's a better director than her father, but I guess it's an apples and oranges comparison: dad is pretty heavy handed, while S.C. directs with apparent tremendous delicacy. She seems to get the best from her actors, and the creativity of her shot and music selections (tossing some almost incidental contemporaneous references into this period piece) demonstrate an intuition unsurpassed by other current directors in her age group. To this day, Lost in Translation brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it. GO SOPHIA.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Marie-Antoinette, the Paris Hilton of the 1700's","In high school in my history class, we had a little segment where we learned about Marie-Antoinette and what her life was like and why she was murdered. It's plain and simple in four little words ""Bored Little Rich Girl"", but I think deep down she wasn't a bad person, money probably changed her. I had no interest though in seeing Marie-Antoinette because I still have a very strong grudge against Sophia Coppola for ""Virgin Suicides"", but my mom rented the movie and said that it was really good and to give it a chance. While it was better than what I expected, it still didn't thrill me, I'll explain in moment.Based on Marie-Antoinette's life and how she came into extreme wealth and soon to become the queen of France, we learn the different side of what she was and how she was forced to leave Austria to marry a very hesitate prince who seems very scared about creating a baby with her. After people pressuring her to have a baby and saying her marriage has failed, they finally have a baby girl, but the king dies making her husband king and her queen of France and Marie definitely takes advantage of all the riches of a wealthy life. That is until the peasants are upset since they are starving and Marie simply responds ""Let them eat cake"".While it was a lot better than what I expected, I still had a few problems with the movie, first off, I think Sophia didn't have total respect for the story, because she could have made it more unique and enjoyable to watch. The music was very awkward and out of place, I know there are some movies that want to make it an up to date feel, but this time it just felt very strange for where it was supposed to take place. But still I have to say this is something that wasn't bad, just could have been better.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
Marie Antoinette is Awesome!,"I thought the movie was quite good. The only thing that I have to say I was disappointed in was the ending. Though they left her (and him) with their dignity. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it. The images, plots, details were awesome! I thought, unlike some, that the music was very fitting. The converse tennis shoes were a nice touch! Though there were some things in there that I have found weren't historically accurate. Such as her wanting to stay at the palace with her husband, etc. The reason that I am writing is because I am going to a costume ball, as Marie, and I am having no luck at finding a hoop pannier, like the one she first put on, with the blue dress.

Delectable movie!,"Rarely am I delighted enough about a movie to write a review. However, ""Marie Antoinette"" is such a delectable movie that I have to weigh in on it to the chagrin of professional critics everywhere who can't appreciate it for what it is. There are several distinct individual elements that taken as a whole equals a rare and breathtaking VISUAL cinematic masterpiece.If you are a movie snob that concerns yourself too much with dialogue, character development, historical accuracy and plot, well beware, this movie is NOT for you. However, if you want to enjoy two hours of mesmerizing eye candy, a killer soundtrack and a ""close enough"" representation of history, you are in for a real treat.The dresses. This is the single most glorious thing about this movie. I kid you not, Kirsten Dunst trots out at least 40 sumptuous concoctions that look as as delicious as the endless stream of desserts. It doesn't end there. Even extras in the movie were afforded costumes that I would kill to have in my wardrobe. The majority of the budget for this movie was spent on costume design and construction. Whoever is the primary designer deserves an Oscar. It is absolutely breathtaking. There hasn't been a movie this lush and over the top since Gone with the Wind.The desserts. I left the theater feeling like I had eaten a pound of buttercream icing. Diabetics beware...this movie will send you into a sugar coma. I know this isn't an Oscar category, but by God, the baker in this movie deserves some sort of recognition. I don't know how Marie manged to keep her figure....she literally gorges on sweets all day! The soundtrack. The Cure, the Stokes, New Order....come ON, what else do you want?! This music, juxtaposed with her freewheeling, blissfully naive lifestyle was a brilliant combination that made history fresh, exciting and attainable to younger audiences.The history. OK, it wasn't completely accurate, but SO WHAT? It was close enough. Again, I say, the primary goal of this movie was NOT to tell the story of the French monarchy leading up to the Revolution. It was simply to convey the excesses of a young and flaky queen in her beautiful make believe world. And judged solely on those merits, I say Sophia Koppola went above and beyond. I also say thank you. For making a movie so fun and beautiful and sweet and delicious. It is exactly what I expected and exactly what I got. YUMMY!!!",9.0,Anonymous,History

Marie Antoinette,"Marie Antoinette is a unique telling of the story of the legendary French ruler. In the film Marie an Austrian girl is set to marry King Louis XVI in France after it is arranged by the parents. Marie is only 14 when they get married and still as a young woman she has a lot to get used to living in the palace and dealing with scandal, politics and what other people are expecting of her. The film is told in Marie's perspective and deals with her many years being a ruler and her marriage and the problems that later became of her and France. Marie Antoinette has good direction, a good screenplay, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration, good costume design and good hair and makeup. This movie is one of the most gorgeous looking films I have ever seen. Everything from the sets, makeup, costumes and more all look great and very much like the 1800's. It is a visually stunning looking film. The film also has good performances, direction and a very original and unique script that approaches the story in a very interesting screen. Behind the scenes of this movie the film is virtually perfect with everything down to the last detail looking perfect on screen and playing out very well. The film's writer/director Sofia Coppola makes the film interesting by adding some humour to it, giving it a good pace and even putting in some modern day music set to some of the scenes as well as classical music and it all works very well. I could see how a lot of directors would try and make this movie and it would end up a dry and boring period piece, but this film is anything but that. I also liked how the story was told in Marie's perspective and the film showed her as being a normal human being and showing her just like anyone else. Because of her age I think the film did her justice by showing that she was a little immature at times and did some things purely because of her age and that she wasn't really mature or ready enough to be in this sort of situation. I liked how the film portrayed her and didn't try to make her look perfect and wasn't afraid to showcase her difficulties and true self during this movie. Because the film looks great, is entertaining, original in the style it brings the story and because it is a well paced and well made film in every way I really enjoyed this film. That being said some of the things I liked about this film will not appeal to everyone and I'm sure historians will find enough that isn't truly accurate of the real Marie Antoinette and that may ruin the film for them. Still, I enjoyed it a lot and I think people like myself who didn't know a lot about the real Marie Antoinette in the first place may find enough to like in this film and appreciate it as I did. It definitely won't appeal to everyone, but for a more artistic crowd this movie will probably play for them pretty well. I would also like to note that I wasn't really big on Sofia Coppola's first two films The Virgin Suicides and Lost In Translation not because they were bad films, but because they just did little for me. This film did a lot for me and I see a lot of greatness in Sofia's direction which makes me almost want to re-watch the previous two films and makes me eager to see what else she will put out in the next couple of years.",8.0,Anonymous,History
This movie was a disappointment for me and I was so hoping for it not to be.,"As a young girl at the age of 13, I read my first book about Marie Antoinette and fell in love with her. The book was a historical fiction made into a diary about Marie Antoinette and from then on I was always reading about Queens, and above all Marie Antoinette. Before the movie Marie Antoinette came out I had read Anton Frashers book and was glad the director was using this book for the bases for her movie. Before the trailers came out for this movie I was trying to see what the movie would look like. When I saw the trailers I began to get worried for this was nothing like the book Anton Frasher had written or any other book I had read about Marie Antoinette. What ultimately killed this movie for me was the inaccuracy of the fashion; the ridiculous use of color in the costumes and the sound track aka film score. I'm a history person and in this movie Marie Antoinette's life was depicted as a gum ball masquerade only out for the cake. To me this movie was a sell out to little teenage girls with no idea of history or any inclination of who Marie Antoinette was. Marie Antoinette's life had so much sparkle, mystery, suspense and yes color that it didn't need any extra fluff. I just hoped for a movie that would take this persons life seriously but instead it was a mockery and waste of time and money.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Let them watch frosting: Sophia Coppola's flashy tea party.,"This embalmed piece of empty storytelling makes for one beautiful corpse with its Versailles locale, opulent set design and costuming and in the incapable hands of Sofia Coppola rigor mortis sets in fast.This latest re-telling of the fall of French Monarchy and the woman who helped bring it down is filled with sumptuous scenes of glorious costumes, colorfully lush decor and gluttonous excess by France's 18th century beautiful people. Coppola remains at a loss however to bring any substance to character or story. What she does she advances clumsily and with nothing much to say the striking imagery simply evaporates into fashion show and a caravan of pastry carts.Kirsten Dunst as teeny bopper Marie conveys beauty and little else. Dunst is not much of an actress and she is just as clueless here as she was in Coppola's other travesty, The Virgin Suicides. Jason Schwartzman is nearly invisible as Louis XVI. He is a cloying amalgam of a 10 year old and Hoffman's Ben Braddock. As a lady in waiting Judy Davis takes her repressed acting style to a new level. Rip Torn as Louis V gives the only acting performance the film offers, while the rest of the cast is required to do little else but display expressions of disdain and condescension and eat with their mouths open.In addition to her directionless direction Coppola employs a music score featuring Bow Wow Wow (ranting I Want Candy) and other au courants to personalize her vision with some ironic hipness. It comes across forced and uneven.Marie Antoinette is like a display wedding cake in a bakery shop window. It has an impressive frosted surface of color and design but underneath it remains hollow.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Reasons why i believe this film was great,"Iknow many people see this movie as mainly sets and costume design with not much actual content, but I disagree. Sophia Coppola(spelling?)told the story of Marie Antoinette in a very original way. She let the audience have their own opinions about what was happening and whether to perceive Marie Antoinette as an inconsiderate, greedy person or someone who was just confused and unsure of what to do. Many say that the film's dialog was inconsistent with the age but thats whats so great about this film. It takes the black and white textbook image of Marie Antoinette and gives it life, gives it spirit. It wasn't just a documentary, it was imperfect and real which makes it so incredibly entertaining. Also, the director uses a lot of silent acting which as i mentioned before lets the audience draw their own conclusions. When their mad they don't have a long drawn out argument, you see it in Kirsten dunst's face. YOu feel it without having to see it which makes the film less redundant then the over-acting in many films where you see the feeling and also feeling. Not saying that that kind of acting is bad its just the acting in this film makes it modern and ingenious and brings the tale into this generation. It connects the conflicts of the french revolution to the conflicts of this day and age.",,Anonymous,History
"A visually stunning, artful masterpiece.","This movie was absolutely jaw-dropping to watch. The cinematography is just incredible; not just the camera-work, but the fact that every single shot felt like it was a moving Michaelangelo painting. I literally was so overwhelmed by the sheer perfection of some scenes that I felt almost guilty for not being able to look at the shot longer. The visual stimulation is really just incredible.Kirsten Dunst does perfectly as Marie Antoinette. She carried the entire film on her back and did so with nonchalant, graceful ease. It also goes without saying that the costumes and hair are surprisingly unique and fresh, especially for period movies.One thing the movie has garnered some attention for, and rightfully so, is the soundtrack. The use 80's-retro and modern music like The Strokes worked seamlessly with the aloof, carefree style Marie Antoinette conveys.There is no denying that a story with some degree of actual depth was lacking. The significance of what was happening to France at the time, the French Revolution, went pretty much unnoticed. However, if you read Coppola's interviews and get an idea of what she was trying to accomplish with Marie Antoinette, you'll know that this wasn't meant to be a historical retelling of the Revolution. The movie was about her as a person. Not necessarily her life, either - just her. Period.One specific scene that I thought helped to redeem the movie in the way of actual depth (probably taking it from an 8 to a 9, for me at least) was the balcony scene, when Marie Antoinette spreads her arms along the railing and bows her head to mob below her, as they go silent.If you appreciate style, beauty, and anything at all visual and artistic, I highly recommend watching this movie. However, make sure you do so with an open mind. The film's style is somewhat unconventional - don't expect a deep storyline, and pay close attention to detail, and you should be very pleased.",9.0,Anonymous,History

It wasn't the typical dark period film with horrible acting; on the contrary, it was aesthetically amazing, and portrayed how I somewhat think life in Versaille really was- obviously there were modern clichés thrown in, and the directors own interpretation, and I don't mean to say it was historically accurate (I neither know nor care if it was), but it shows the gilt surroundings and the leisure time very well. It is perhaps a bit drawn out, but you're so distracted by the prettiness of all the scenes that it doesn't seem to bother most people. If you don't have an interest in history, you may not like it as much. Likewise, if you have are a stickler for accurate films you may not like it.There was amazing acting. The script maybe left a little more to be desired vocally, but Dunst managed to portray every feeling in a glance- the last scene in particular. The ending itself.. was a surprise.

A visually dazzling as it subtle and serious. This is an excellent movie.,"Marie Antoinette is more subtle than the reviews and board commentary would have you believe. This is less of a teleplay than people are used to where themes and characterization are hammered home with a sledge. In fact, this is one movie where costumes have a thematic value. The constraint of corsets and elaborate dress parallel Marie's personal restrictedness. When she becomes queen, she has simpler, more comfortable clothes made for her which she wears in a place where she and her friends can be free of regulations of life at court, where she is as stifled in some ways as a convict in prison stripes.

a lot of missed opportunities,"Overall i felt this was a great first draft...it has the seed of something wonderful and with enough twiddling of the script (and cast?), maybe if she were to go back, re-shoot the entire thing, it might actually be a pretty darn good film.

The New Wave music didn't work at all in my opinion, I don't know if that is the editor's fault or hers, but where someone like Baz Luhrmann can dazzle with this technique, every musical sequence here just left me baffled, and wanting to remove a lot of those songs from my playlists (I'm afraid I just won't be able to listen to Plainsong by The Cure ever again after her use of it, ugh...same for Souxsie and Bow Wow Wow). I also wanted her to make more bridges between what was happening then and what is happening now, in relation to celebrity, politics, The People, but she never quite went there other than giving these people our butchered language.

Costume Pic!,"Really great cinematography; beautifully shot. The acting was superb... conveying emotions with expressions and gestures; there weren't that many lines in the movie, but the story and character development was still very easy to follow.My only complaint was that the spoken parts was very hard to hear at times, but I do love the realistic dialog and the ""fly on the wall in Versailles"" perspective that the audience gets.Kirsten Dunst really shines in this historical piece. When outlandish fashions and extremely formal customs of 1700s France bewilder and annoy Marie Antoinette upon her arrival to the French court, the audience can totally sympathize with her isolation and alienation. We feel happy when she finally begins to fit in, and sorry for her when she runs into challenges with her marriage.The blend of modern music with Renaissance was very refreshing. Not quite as jolting as the soundtrack in _A Knights Tale_, but more easily to identify with then a completely harpsichord and opera-laden period piece.",9.0,Anonymous,History
This is the first female directed movie I truly admire,"I'd heard that there had been complaints about the music! What a travesty! The music is INGENIOUSLY chosen, and it more than just enhances the drama, it elevates and energizes it. It's up there with the cinematography, and the costumes, and the screenplay, for that matter, as sure signs of Sofia Coppola's undeniable skill and artistry. And both the leads, Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman respond superbly to her direction. Kirsten has made Marie a sympathetic figure in a way only she could have. There can be no doubt, she stimulates attention and understanding more effectively than any other actress of her caliber, I think. She displays physical weakness while wielding an almost inexplicable but irresistible power. And Jason, in what I would think was an undesirable role, gives a memorable and affecting performance, despite the king's historic limitations.As a guy who likes Quentin Tarantino's movies, I still find women directors interesting. But ever since Jane Campion's ""The Piano"" and ""Sweetie"", I had to conclude that women were just not as skillful as the great male directors. This movie is not a visualization and exploration of the historical facts, but it is a truly excellent example of art that took a level of character and maturity to produce that I was beginning to think I'd never see in a woman director.

I thought it started out very promising and the story was moving along fine. But then after the couple was married I found it very hard to tell how much time has passed. I thought a week had passed and next thing I know his brother his married and Marie mentions they would look like fools if his brother becomes pregnant before they do. Next scene she is laying around and trying to get the future king to have sex...no go. Then the brother is having a baby. It seemed to be like this throughout. Music montages would go on or a song would play and sometimes it would be just to pass the time of the traveling carriage. Other times a short 10 seconds would pass and three years had passed. then a 20 minute segment on her birthday of nothing but gambling and drinking(which i understand why) but the pacing was simply off and became very boring. Then there were other parts that you think should be stressed like the baby dying...but all that was shown was a mere minute if that. But they kept showing all these random shots of her walking or laying around which did nothing for the story. Then the villagers become restless hold up the king and wife in the castle and a guard walks in covered in blood and says - ""They've come to kill the queen."" Then we watch them sitting eating, nodding, eating, crying. she goes out and bows to the crowd. They yell back. Then they let her go right out the front door and then it ends. Simply just of waste of time, the music didn't seem to fit half the time...just not good. Well except for the first 20 minutes.One thing I did like that actually showed some sort of character development and some plot progression is when she applauded to a play at the beginning everyone applauded with her...at the end no one did. Loved that scene, but that was it.I bought this used for $5 for my wife and I feel like I was ripped off. Not so much the money but the two hours I spent watching it.",2.0,Anonymous,History

Great scenery and costumes... but a mediocre concept for a movie.,"This film seeks to present the life of Queen Marie Antoinette of France from a sweet perspective, since the moment she arrives at the French court until the beginning of the Revolution. With direction and screenplay of Sofia Coppola, this movie features Kirsten Dunst as the French queen.When I saw this movie for the first time I loved it because of the scenarios (the Palace of Versailles is, definitely, one of the most beautiful and iconic in the world) and the historical accuracy of the costumes (this film won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and certainly deserved it). But even during this initial view, I don't like the way, very light and almost adolescent, as the film tells the story of this French queen, whose life was much less happy than was shown. In fact, when I was watching it a second time, and after the initial amazement, I understand that this film strips all drama of Marie Antoinette's, turning her in the baroque equivalent of a frivolous and spoiled teenager of our time. This was a total mistake and doesn't help to see her from a more human perspective (if that was Coppola's intention). The film focuses on the clothes, the gold, the luxury and the court flirtations, having the dramatic depth of a glass of champagne.Sofia Coppola ignored the history of the queen who wanted to present, ignored the reality of France at that time, ignored how to make a good movie... well, she ignored everything that should have never ignored. I will not even going to comment on the mediocrity of the soundtrack or that unfortunate scene of the All-Star shoes. Not worth talking about it. What this movie is good is the scenery and costumes. Just that, and that isn't enough to make it a good movie.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Good movie,"OK first off...If you take this movie seriously you must have something wrong with you. Secondly this retelling was meant to be light hearted for Generation Y. I supposed that if you do not fall into the generation Y category you wouldn't appreciate this film. Thirdly this film was I think, portrayed as a teen movie. You know like ""can't hardly wait"", ""10 things I hate about you"", list can go on. I quite enjoyed this movie it was very stylish and fun. I think key word ""fun"". If you want a serious retelling of the story please do not watch this movie. You will be disappointed then you'll make an annoying response. I am sorry to those who may think I'm harsh, but I am very tired of people reading into movies too much. I think people need to try and have fun with movies again. Movies are suppose to take you on a journey to escape from your current reality and that just what this movie did. I don't care if this is a poor retelling, thats not why I watched it. Again please don't watch this movie for historical accuracy watch it to have fun and be entertained. If you want historical accuracy watch a F*****G documentary. Oh yeah Kirsten Dunst was wicked hot in this movie. Nothing like 1700's fashion.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Horribly dull, and anti-climactic","I was so excited about seeing this movie. I am pf French descent so I have always had a fascination with the story of the young queen. I saw this movie last night and the movie was only partially accurate, but they left out A lot. I was very disappointed because it seemed to drag on the parts when she (Marie Antoinette: Kirsten Dunst) wasn't partying. Iwas mostly disappointed because the movie ended with a riot and people running the royal family out of the palace. Now who honestly wanted to see Kirsten Dunst get her head cut off? ME! Maybe because that is how her ( Marie Antoinette) life actually ended, not by riding off in the sunrise. Ther was so much that was left out. It reminded me of legends and 'Once Upon a Time..."" type stories that Disney has butchered and switched the story around. Although Disney's films are entertaining, save yourself a few dollars, because this one really isn't.",3.0,Anonymous,History
What were you hoping to see?,"I wonder if the low rating on this movie has to do with peoples' expectations. If you were hoping for an accurate, crystal clear historical drama, then you ought to look somewhere else. If you were looking for a well done piece of cinema, then come on in. I'll break my review down into a few different categories.Cinematography: 10/10 this film was beautifully shot. Ms. Coppola was very skillful in her use of colors, angles, clarity, and whatever other magic she invoked to make this movie so visually pleasing.Script: 6/10 The film came off as fairly taciturn. There's nothing wrong with that, but when characters did venture to speak, they didn't say anything particularly profound.Realism: 6/10 I gave it more than a five because I think that the point of this film's seeming disconnect from reality was deliberate and employed for the purpose of expressing the queen's own selfishness and obliviousness. I was bothered by the fact that the film showed little of the struggle that the lower class citizens of France faced -- until I realized that was partially the purpose of the film.Acting: 7/10 I think all the supporting characters did very well. Kirsten Dunst was a good Marie Antoinette, although some of her speaking scenes were less convincing :| I think I'll come out and say it, I don't think she's very good at speaking parts. She is lovely and uses facial expressions to tell her story, but as far as verbal execution, there is much to be desired. Sorry! Jason Schwartzman did an excellent job. I loved his and Dunst's scenes together. This film had many familiar faces and I really enjoyed their performances.Music: 8/10 I haven't checked other reviews, but i imagine that there were some boo-hooers that disliked the director's choice to include rock music. I liked it because for the modern day viewer, rock signifies rebellion, fun, youth and carelessness. WHICH PERSONIFIES MARIE ANTOINETTE. Also, there's a violin piece that's comically used several times which I appreciated.Summary: I think this film is excellent for anyone like myself who enjoys beauty. I would have liked a little more introspection by Marie Antoinette, but I think that the director/writers were trying to keep the film somewhat unbiased by not imposing too much of their own interpretations on the viewer. While not a perfect film, it is a lovely one.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty Boring in Pink or Lost in Versailles,"Sophia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" (2006) is an embarrassing disaster - glamorous, colorful, shot inside and outside of French Versailles in its most lavish but disaster nevertheless. I don't know for whom the movie was made - perhaps, for Ms. Coppolla herself to add another chapter to her dreamy quiet slow moving films about bored and confused young girls. Her previous work, ""Lost in Translation"" was quite good even if not a timeless masterpiece as some critics and viewers tend to believe. Her latest film about a girl who happened to be born in 1755, a daughter and sister to the Austrian Emperors, the future wife and mother to French Kings, simply does not work. The film starts when Marie is 15 and she leaves her beloved Vienna to marry the future Luis XVI. She arrives to the most fashionable, glamorous, and corrupted European court where she would remain ""the foreigner"", ""The Austrian"". The film depicts Marie's life up until 1789 when the Great French Revolution starts with the storming of Bastille, the infamous Paris prison on July 14, 1789, and the King and Queen leave Versailles forever to meet their destiny. The film completely omits the final chapter of Marie Antoinette's life and never mentions the circumstances of her last five years. These five years were filled with the purest tragedy: death of her husband who was tried for treason, found guilty and executed on the guillotine, separation from her son who was taken from her and died in captivity when he was 12 years old. She herself was brought to trial where she was accused among the other things in sexual abuse of her son. To this horrible accusation, the former queen, ""the Widow Capet"" or simply ""Antoinette Capet"" replied with the genuine royal dignity, ""If I have not replied it is because Nature itself refuses to respond to such a charge laid against a mother...""When I visited Paris several years ago, I went to see The Conciergerie Prison where Marie Antoinette was kept before her death and from where she was taken on the morning of October 16, 1793, ""forced into a tumbrel and paraded through the streets of Paris for over an hour before reaching the Place de la Révolution where the guillotine stood."" Spending short time in the Antoinette's prison cell let me learn about her tragic final days that Sofia Coppola chose not to include in her movie. I respect her decision to tell the story of the ill-fated last Queen of France as a bored and frustrated teenage girl with a sweet smile and charming dimples, whose equally young, shy and totally inexperienced husband was more interested in the history of locks and keys than in making love and children to her but by making Marie-Antoinette the central figure of the film and never taking her camera outside the palace, Coppolla limited her movie to the typical ""chick flick"" that happened to take place in Versailles.Marie-Antoinette as played by Kurstin Dunst is not very interesting person; she leads a boring life within the strict etiquette's rules of the Royal Palace, and all she wants - to have some fun. It is OK to make a movie about boring life of boring and bored insignificant people but it is not OK to never mention what actually was going on outside the palace where the real life was happening and the revolution was brewing way before Coppola chose to mention the shortage of bread for the commoners and storming of Bastille. The second half of the 18th Century was enormously interesting and eventful time in the history of France, Europe, and the World. It was the time when Mozart wrote his music, Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais had finished his three Figaro plays, and the most brilliant one, ""The Marriage of Figaro"" was banned by the King for its irreverent attitude towards the aristocracy from being performed. Outside the Palace's walls, very intelligent, free thinking angry young men from ""Third Estate"" (the ""Commons""), grew up, received good education, and became lawyers, physicians, journalists, and scientists. Influenced by philosophical and political ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the principles of Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité that they embraced in The Jacobin Club in Paris, they later would become leaders of the French Revolution that would destroy the old regime of the absolute monarchy but eventually turn into the Reign of Terror in which the passionate revolutionaries would perish along with the aristocrats. Among them, Mirabeau - a great orator and able statesman; Danton, a figure larger than life; Robespierre, known as ""incorruptible"", Jean Paul Marat, scientist and revolutionary. None of them have been ever mentioned in the movie. Even the notorious Affair of the diamond necklace that was historically significant as one of the events that led to the French populace's bitter disappointment with the monarchy and contributed to the growing hatred toward the Queen who had been nicknamed, ""Madam Deficit"", did not deserve a single remark in the movie about Marie Antoinette. Ironically, Sophia Coppola chose to finish her movie once Marie Antoinette grew up and became more interesting and mature. She stopped to be a bored and boring spoiled little girl, and the director lost the interest in her.I've read some articles that defend the film by saying that it is not a historic movie but ""the story of the silly teenager who embodied a corrupt, absolutist state in its terminal decadence"". These articles keep pointing to the visual beauty, production design, Oscar winning costumes, and nice cinematography. They are indeed lovely and the movie is an eye candy but Marie Antoinette as she was presented in the Sophia Coppola's movie can't herself hold this viewer's interest no matter how many pretty dresses with the elegant matching shoes she has changed and how many tiny delightful pastries she has eaten, and I am a huge fan of low cut dresses and those delicious pastries, believe me.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"A historical drama film that portrays Antoinette's poverty with sympathy and joy,","A historical drama film that portrays Antoinette's poverty with sympathy and joy, but also a bit of futility, as well as the king, who has no personality, little interest in women and is oblivious to almost everything, in addition to being spendthrifts, which must have been quite realistic.However, Sofia Coppola's great production with lots of wealth and luxury, perfection defines the film well. Highlight the perfect performance by the gorgeous Kirsten Dunst, but they should have used a 14-year-old actress to be realistic.Based on Antonia Fraser's book about the unfortunate Archduchess of Austria and later Queen of France, 'Marie Antoinette' tells the story of the most misunderstood and abused woman in history, from her birth in Imperial Austria to her later life in France.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Interesting, sumptuous mistake tries to distract with large budget","At turns refreshingly innovative and pretentiously shallow, Marie Antoinette is a difficult film to gauge due to the unique angle Sofia Coppola employs for the period piece. While strangely hypnotic at times in it's blissful capturing of pleasure, the film often feels unfocused as well, dangerously teetering between artsy production and vanity project, rarely becoming anything more meaningful. Giving the notorious queen an updated relevance may bode well in creating some sort of historical context for an oblivious demographic of MTV teenage girls, but anyone mature enough to realize the difference between style and exploitation will find that many of the scenes feel repetitive, with the ravishing set design playing front and center to the stubbornly plotted events that relay (through some sort of obscure fact-based mythology) France's public enemy number one before, during and throughout her troubled reign.One must give Coppola some credit for at least attempting something quite unique though. In the film's greatest moments, where the fickle, care-free parties of the decadent royal family are breezily edited amidst the contrasting modern day indie soundtrack, there is a certain guilty pleasure and an articulation of fun that really hasn't been explored in the context of a historical film. However, it becomes increasingly apparent that the director used this premise merely to indulge her fondness for the exquisite lifestyle the queen was involved in, shunning a majority of context and depth in favor of the effervescence that dominates the tone here. The much talked about modern musical selections playing to century old antics, scored as they are, do capture a few select moments of glaring, and daring beauty (think of the brief use of the cure when they are walking down the steps), but too often only feels right in fleeting moments of the scene and awkward during the rest.Plagued by a few technical blunders and the distinct lack of authenticity in the performances (Kirsten Dunst does have some amazing moments- but no one is even trying to sound believable, as personified in the modern day, off-key ridiculousness of Jason Schwartzman's Louis XVI), the monumental set design does not really compliment most of the content here, no matter what Coppolla's misdirected though promising artistic ambitions thought they were achieving. As such, the movie does have some amazing moments that will be magnified depending on the size of your viewing screen, but by and large it plays out immaturely and insults the viewer with it's unfocused approach.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Who ever didn't like this movie is an IDIOT!,"First of all, to all you anal retentive accuracy buffs, this movie was not intended to be an historical rendition of the language, accents, or exact events of Marie Antoinette. This was an artistic, creative and musical interpretation on the idea of her. If you are a dull, snooty dolt then of course you will be exasperated that Kirsten Dunst talks like an American teenager. THAT WAS THE POINT! You probably also don't get Picasso, but guess what, he knew that both eyes don't really belong on one side of the head. IT'S ART! It's also a statement, a social and political point of view. So many young Americans today are more concerned with their love life and their wardrobe than the tragedies of the 3rd world happening around them. And even those who are aware have no real power to do anything about it. Yet so many radical extremists would love to behead every Britney Spears loving, Converse wearing tween, as a symbol of this country's extreme wealth and failure to do any good with it. It's easy to hate the young and the rich. It's much harder to identify with them and even care about them, yet Coppola and Dunst accomplish this wonderfully. I was enchanted from the beginning. Also, this movie spoke to me as a woman. It illuminates the very essence of being a girl, of wanting a dream life away from the emotional turmoil of reality. Struggling to please her family, forced to sexually pursue an immature Peter Pan type, always having to look her best, constantly criticized by her public. It spotlights the spirit of innocence and kindness that is also naivety and stubbornness. It is not important whether or not this was truly the way the real Marie Antoinette was. It's just about life, a real internal personal daily life. The music goes so well with the filming of action, it is really more like an extended music video, and Coppola's images are breathtaking and magical. I thought the post punk sound with the baroque images was just awesome! Historically, it actually is more realistic than most history books, in highlighting that the true decision makers of French foreign policy at that time were the advisers, not the royalty themselves, who really had no clue what was going on outside Versailles and were just trying to live up to what their elders and the court expected of them. Marie Antoinette probably never even said, ""Let them eat cake"", which is what makes us all dislike her when we first read about her in high school. This was more likely what the tabloids of that time were saying about her, using her as a symbol of wealth in the face of so much poverty occurring in France. Leave it to the press to stir things up. That's what makes her eventual downfall so tragic. It was completely out of her control, she was absolutely oblivious. The mob psychology of the French masses being unleashed on the delicate royalty, the scene I was dreading, is, thank god, not actually shown in the movie. It does though, make me think how truly sad it must have been for her, at the end, for her children and herself to fall prey to such violence and bloodshed. Such a horrible shock after such a beautiful life. Coppola didn't need to show the beheading that occurred years later, after imprisonment and attempted escape. We can all imagine that, we've seen gore before. What you rarely see, that she so masterfully created, was beauty: a young girl living that dream life of champagne and pastry, giving us a taste of what it might have been like to be a teenage queen. And also a sweet message, in that in spite of all her wealth and power, all she really wanted was a simple country life, in her little village with her little farm and her children and her friends. And for so many of us, isn't that secretly all we want too?",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Gorgeous photography, lousy script","Marie Antoinette is a visually stunning, lushly photographed movie with gorgeous costumes, sets and natural scenes. The costumes alone must have cost about $20 million. Some of the scenes are so extraordinary they would make beautiful paintings to hang on the wall. For those virtues it would get 10 stars.Unfortunately, the pace is glacially slow, the acting wooden or worse, and the script, awful. I checked a biography of Marie Antoinette, and the story is true to her life in many regards. Too bad she was a pampered, spoiled brat whose life, and that of her court, was full of the stifling trivial activities we saw in the film: eating dainties, being fitted for new gowns and shoes, playing dice and cards, and gossiping with the girls. None of this makes for interesting drama.Kirsten Dunst plays her as a sweet girl, misjudged by others, but basically a simp. The life of Marie and Louis XVI was just not interesting enough to make a movie about them, except possibly their dramatic end game where they were imprisoned and beheaded, neither of which is included in this film. Dunst is a pretty young woman but an actress who delivers the petty lines of this script like an amateur.Jason Schwartzman, as her dauphin, is even worse. He sounds like a junior high school student in his first drama class.Comparison with the movie Elizabeth (1998), starring Cate Blanchett immediately comes to mind. Now that was a fine movie! Blanchett's top-notch acting brought Elizabeth I of England to life as a sweet young woman who survived mayhem to rapidly grow into a shrewd leader who could protect herself and use the men around her to her advantage.",5.0,Anonymous,History

A step backwards...,"In 2003, an enterprising filmmaker brought the world a human drama set in one of the most heavily-populated yet despairingly lonely places of the modern world. It was a success unexpected, giving its director a level of fame and interest that kept all eyes on her next effort. Of course, it did not hurt that this director just happened to be the daughter of one of Hollywood's most successful and well-regarded directors. So for her next project, Sofia decided to create a biopic of one of history's most controversial and maligned historical figures, Marie Antoinette, Queen of France and Navarre. French history is not a subject of interest to me, and my selection of this film was more a whim based on positive experience with Ms. Coppola's previous effort, Lost In Translation. So when I say that Marie Antionette circa 2006 is a real disappointment, I can only do so with a serious and heavy heart. I wanted to like this film, and there are even times when I do. But for a film that was ostensibly made with the goal of setting the record straight, it is disappointingly shallow.The film begins with the titular character being introduced to her husband-to-be, who just happens to be the Dauphin of France. As the Dauphin's consort, she is expected to produce a child with him with all haste, and much is made of the fact that this will strengthen the French-Austrian alliance. A problem arises when the Dauphin is unwilling or somehow unable to perform the required actions on his part to produce an heir. As Marie begins to receive the proportion of the blame that eighteenth century courts placed upon women that were not producing heirs, her influence with the court begins to weaken. I must admit, the device by which we are shown the two extremes of her popularity in France's court are quite novel. However, a problem arises as we notice increasingly during the running time that very little exists beneath the surface. We know so little about Antoinette during the opening reels, but we know almost nothing else by the time it ends. In effect, we are simply seeing people dance around in period costumes.Speaking of dancing around, numerous sequences are shown in which the cast and extras hunt, dance, or eat to the tune of post-punk songs that anyone who grew up during the 1980s will recognise at least a few of. Some of them are exceptionally well-chosen in light of the visuals that they accompany. Others, not so. Watching Marie descending stairs as The Cure's Plainsong plays in the background is a feast for the eyes and ears. The use of All Cats Are Grey over the ending credits, on the other hand, just seemed like a decision based on the need for a sound to fill the void. Not that it is a bad song, but considering the tone of the closing scene, there are a thousand songs from this era that would have done far more to build the appropriate mood. Antoinette's story is a sombre one, and an ostensibly painful transition in France's history. So It is unfortunate, but the music really does reduce the whole affair to the feeling of a music video. Sort of the opposite to what happened with Lost In Translation, in other words.The performances are also somewhat mixed. Kirsten Dunst is way out of her element as Marie Antoinette. She has portrayed individuals from the eighteenth century on previous occasions, and she has also demonstrated a talent uncommon among actors of her generation. So her performance in this mess probably is not her fault. I am also loathe to blame it upon Sofia's direction, as her prior two films were enthralling even if they took a couple of viewings to get into. However, Sofia's writing appears to have more of the fault than anything else. Some stories rely on sex scenes to keep the viewer interested. Some stories rely on violence to keep the viewer interested. Some stories rely on extremely peculiar characters to keep the viewer interested. I am still in a state of wonder as to exactly what the story is reliant upon, in fact. It seems to have no buildup or payoff. Perhaps Ms. Coppola wanted to write the ultimate 1980s music video, but that already exists in the form of a film called Repo Man.Another problem Marie Antoinette suffers from is that it drives in the stricter, lower limits of the Australian PG rating (honestly, the American system must be run by 100 year old men), and this severely impacts the story. One of the women seen farewelling Marie as she leaves in exile ended up with her head being paraded around for Marie's benefit, a fact that could have done much to put the story in its proper historical context. Much of the film is so perversely tame and restrained that one starts to wonder if anything is going to happen. It is just another example of how overly restrictive America's rating system really is. This is where the whole problem of the film derives. Ask any writer, director, or producer what the one unforgivable sin of telling a story is, especially where film-making is concerned, and they will always tell you the same thing. You can make a good film, you can make a bad film, you can even make an indifferent film. But heaven and the entire chorus of archangels will not help you if you make a boring film.Thus, I gave Marie Antoinette circa 2006 a four out of ten. Some of the music works, but that is about it.",4.0,Anonymous,History
One of the most beautiful movies I've seen,"I'll be honest. This is one of those movies that you'll either hate, or absolutely love. I don't know many people who are on the fence when it comes to their love/hate for this movie (however, I've never met anyone who didn't love it). From beginning to end it appealed to me, and being a person who doesn't tend to watch a movie more than once (with rare exception) I found myself watching this one over again as soon as the credits began rolling. There is so much eye candy to take in and subtle bits that you don't catch the first time around, that if you love it the first time through, it's worth watching again, and again. I can see why some people wouldn't appreciate this film, as it's a bit eccentric, but not so much as to separate the viewers from the history upon which this film was based. It's fun, quirky, filled with delightful acting and definitely for those who color outside of the lines (I quite appreciate the departure from forcing actors to strap on fake French accents for the sake of making it ""closer to reality"" because I'm often times extremely distracted by bad accents). I didn't much care for Lost in Translation, but this was a super hit for me and became an instant classic in my library. You must see this film for yourself!",10.0,Anonymous,History

I suppose that was considered ""cute"" or ""cutting edge"" by the director, but the result is a total sense of disbelief in the spectator.In general, boring and pretentious. The fact that it got one or two Oscars (not sure and could not be bothered to check) confirms how bad it is, Oscars being in general the kiss of death.Could be OK to watch with the sound turned off since, as I said at the beginning, it IS visually appealing.Am sure it'll do well in the drive-in circuit, if any drive-ins still exist.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Good for nothing but insomnia!,"From the first ten minutes of Marie Antoinette (lost talent Kirsten Dunst) traveling to her palace, the next wandering around her new palace once she arrives, the next getting married and the next of her coronation, I knew that this was going to be a slow and uninteresting ride. I can't say much about the plot because there is none and I can't say much for the acting because there isn't much that's impressive to me. What I find the most outrageous is the fact that it was made into a chick-flick when the French Revolution was actually a very dire time in history.I'll give the film an applaud (though not a very enthusiastic or loud one) for completely stunning artistry, but sadly just looking at something pretty is not enough. The film, to me seemed like an old horse: pretty, but goes nowhere. Needless to say, my money and time was wasted on this film due to the fact that it was not at all reliable to history and was too long for it's own good. As much as I love visionary films, they do have to have a plot to them and Marie Antoinette had none. At least it was good for one thing: a cure for insomnia.",2.0,Anonymous,History

But while it could be a good point, it becomes a repetitive series of clichés and the plot turns into a mix between soap opera and cheap romantic novel full of misunderstanding and dissatisfaction.Finally, from the artistic side, it tries to disguise the lack of budget with ""artistic shots"", while, if the intention was to create an artistic movie, budget should not be the problem.

A great intimate picture,"I loved this movie because it was such a great portrait of a person - every little thing in the film came together to help portray Marie's state of mind - a sort of disaffected daze which turns into a warm and content mood as she starts to reconnect with life. The soundtrack was a great way to help remind everyone how relevant the story is, I especially liked how the young royal women carried around little dogs - very Paris/Olsen/Britney-esquire. Kirsten Dunst gives her most nuanced performance of her career so far I think, and the always beautiful Rose Byrne has a heap of fun as the slightly vacuous friend in waiting. Overall a great film from a very assured director - can't wait to see what comes next.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A WOPPER OF A FILM... if you like the taste of a suddenly rich Sicilian peasant writ large,"The critic who called it ""Gidget goes to Versailles"" was on the right track.... if one wanted to immerse oneself in wretched excess... too many patterns, too many different textiles, too many shoes, too much food, the worst musical score since PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and connect it with a plot that just strung all the tableaux vivantes together in a train wreck... don't miss this.Add to it a very Jewy Louis XVI- Jason Schwartzman looked like he just stepped out of a Seinfeld episode, and could have been fine as a Jewish American Prince, but hardly a French king and Rip Torn playing Louis XV looked like one of her dad's mafia dons who showed up in the wrong film, and it was hilarious.It is true that Coppola did catch in Kirsten Dunst some of the Antonia Fraser she was aiming for... but Dunst's fine performance was like the lonely clam in the proverbial church social clam chowder, surrounded by 50 gallons of tasteless lukewarm swill.IF you want to see how inbred the film business is and how out of touch with their market, by all means see this. It is a lesson in media mafia gone mad.",1.0,Anonymous,History
My queen is Sofia Coppola,"Of course for the people who are obsessed with historical inaccuracies, Marie Antoinette is a so so movie. I seriously get bored of this, for every war movie almost and also historical movies, people say historically inaccurate! This is disturbing to me, because the thing they missed is the movie itself, cinema! Sofia Coppola made a movie that includes no cliché and besides unconventional a bit which most people don't like. It costs her, some critics and audiences criticize her movie very harshly, did not appreciate. As for me, Lost in Translation was a very good movie, but Marie Antoinette is her best work. After Lost in Translation, I thought that she was a very good director, but after Marie Antoniette, I think that even if she is not a master, she is a great director. The Other Boleyn Girl. The Duchess. Why such movies have been appreciated? Because they met the expectations of many people that I can call mass audience. Unfaithfulness, cheating, forbidden love, betrayal. All the clichés and material which get people's, especially women's interest. Every time the same story, love triangles, a heavy story telling, everyone falls in love with each other, a man loves a woman and another woman loves this man or a man loves a woman, but later she falls in love with another man, like a boring and vicious cycle. Returning to Marie Antoinette, Kirsten Dunst is the best choice for this role and I applaud her for her extemporary acting. This character is also an anti cliché figure. Marie Antoinette is not like the women in The Sex and The City, so she does not always think of sex or shopping, shopping or sex. She is not like typical college girls, she is not fickle, she is not giddy, she is different from the girls in Tarantino's Death Proof who send and take messages night and day and always prate about their doings and men. Therefore, I loved this character. Marie Antoinette looks like a girl who tries to benefit from the boons of the palace and enjoy. Another revolutionary point is the relationship between Antoinette and her husband. In the wedding night, we get that her husband is impotent, gay or does not love her at all, even hates her. He delays her almost every night (and this makes The Sex and The City fans angry) All these shows that besides a great director, she is a great script writer. As for direction, story telling and cinematography, since Barry Lyndon, there had not been such a mesmerizing and beautiful film. The scene which we see various candles, cakes and chocolates were elegant, the scene that Antoinette and her friends watch the rising of the sun, the opera scene, the phaeton scene which we hear a pop song and the scenes take place in the animal garden are my favorites, mesmerizing, but the other parts of the film are not different too. I know why its rating is extremely low, remember, ''historically inaccurate'' people.",8.0,Anonymous,History
eye candy without much plot,"I really liked all the costumes, scenery, and makeup; however, the movie as a whole wasn't that entertaining. Also, it is a little weird watching a movie about the French when they all talk like Americans. The movie is about Maie Antoinette as a teenager. We see her movie to France, marry soon to be king Louie, and what her life was like right after marriage. I don't know how factual this is, but the film depicts the 2 newlyweds as ""cold"" in the bedroom. Not really anything is happening there. And Marie needs to have an heir to solidify her standing in France. She is humiliated when Louie's younger brother has a child before they do. It shows her gambling, partying and during this time the masses of France are living in poverty and starving. The very ending shows the angry mobs outside the palace and the ending shows the royal family being taken away and it ends like that. I didn't like that ending either. It was too abrupt.I didn't think any of the actors had any memorable roles. It was simply a blah type of movie.FINAL VERDICT: I think it is aimed toward teens, but they would find it boring.

"a misunderstood and wonderful film, notable for far more than its gorgeous imagery","I think this movie has been sadly misunderstood by many. The story here is told through understatement and silences, much like lost in translation, and those who need the action to be explained through dialog will not enjoy this. Although it is simply a gorgeous movie, this is not the only reason to watch. Another criticism is historical inaccuracy. Although the film is an adaptation of a recent biography of M-A, offering a different take on her character, the real point is the way Coppola uses contemporary pop culture to produce a certain kind of subjective feel. When she shows a dance party she plays New Order which gives a contemporary audience the wild feeling of a dance party that no amount of cinematographic cleverness could convey if the music were accurate period. She uses American style speech to keep us within the characters and focusing on their human qualities. The movie does not focus on politics, nor on the realities outside the palace, and this is not its point. It is a portrait of a foreign teenage girl thrown into the center of one of the most powerful courts in the world, and it is told from her perspective, with all of the inaccuracies and misunderstandings that would naturally produce.Towards the end the pacing does seem to drag oddly, given the mastery of the first 1.5 hours...and there were some gaps in terms of other characters that could have been more developed (especially her friends in the court)...but overall this is a wonderful film, far better than how it was received. M-A is a real, complex, and sympathetic character, trapped in a world that she does not truly fit. Even her famous extravagances make sense here as her only outlet for expression.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Beautiful, but terribly made","I've never been a Sofia Coppola fan. I don't like indie movies that feel ad-libbed and captured by a college pal's camera. However, after seeing the beautiful costumes and professional-looking footage in the preview of Marie Antoinette, I decided to give her one more chance. I've learned my lesson, and it's been 20 years. The upside: Marie Antoinette is beautiful to watch. The costumes come out of every little girl's princess dreams, and our favorite teen heroine gets to prance around in them! Kirsten Dunst is inherently likable, and she looks more beautiful than ever in her updos and pale makeup palette.The downside: the script, acting, and music. Once again, Sofia managed to create a movie that felt ad-libbed. The actors seemed to have been told a basic concept of the scene (like, ""you're getting a bunch of new clothes"") and then without any character development or knowledge of the time period, they started talking. Money was tight, so the first take was kept. Sofia and her musical director must have forgotten that they were creating a movie set in the 1700s. Rock songs from the 1980s and 1990s were used to underscore scenes - what were they thinking? I'm relatively confident in betting my life that people in the Antoinette time period didn't say, ""Oh, wow!"" or ""Oo, cool!"" Those were just unforgivable ad-libs by the actors (unless they were unaware the camera was rolling - which was quite possible) and even more unforgivable of the director and editor to leave those words in the final cut.Unless you're a huge Sofia fan or you love mixing modern details into historical settings, don't bother with this movie. Stick with the 1938 masterpiece instead. It actually tells the story of Marie Antoinette, instead of filming a bunch of young ladies in fancy gowns as they act like high schoolers from 2006. This film was a gigantic waste of beautiful sets and costumes.",2.0,Anonymous,History

"Mind boggingly boring!  No historical epic, no action, and not worthy of 5 minutes","I love history, I love historical epics and I thought a new sharp update on the Marie Antoinette story would be terrific!! I couldn't have been more wrong. I'm blown away by the amount of people that could actually find anything even remotely interesting or entertaining about this movie but then I've been on the other side of that argument in various movies as well. To each their own but my own for this movie is that it was drop dead awful. I try to never turn a film off no matter how much I'm hating it and it was dreadfully brutal getting through this one and by the time it was half way through I was half watching it and half reading a book and I kept looking up from my book and thinking 'My God, is this still on?' The sheer fact that Sofia Coppola who directed and wrote this movie is Oscar nominated director and Oscar winning writer is sheer mind blowing. Although maybe it wasn't entirely her responsibility because there was simply one thing that made me not give this horrendous snooze fest a ZERO and that is the fact that its very, very pretty...but if this doesn't prove looks aren't everything than nothing does. The costumes are outstanding, enormous, larger than life and that is where it ends period.Now none of this blame will fall on its young star. Kirsten Dunst plays the lovely Marie Antoinette who comes from Austria to marry the French Dauphin. Dunst is very good, very spirited, cute, sexy even in some scenes and does carry the movie just fine considering it has no story, no action, no climax or anything else worthwhile. This was a disgrace to her talent. Jason Schwartzman barely has a pulse as the insatiably BORING Louis XVI. Rip Torn is a joke and barely noticeable as Louis XV and Judy Davis (an award worthy actress) is annoying and nagging as Dunst's mother. No one else is worth mentioning because everyone acts the same, there is different characters or stand out performances outside of Dunst's performance.When I originally saw trailers for this film I thought it was less historical or more of this hip retelling of the story complete with modern music which instead of being throughout the film is randomly thrown in there just to make things seem strange. They also would lead you to believe in the trailers that Antoinette is this wild child Queen who shakes everything up and she barely even shakes herself up. Everyone is simply dreadfully boring. Basically every idea you might have about this film from trailers is completely wrong. Other than the beautiful costume design and Dunst there is absolutely no reason to even look at this. You can see everything worth seeing in five minutes and save yourself the disaster of sitting through this. Dunst is sexualized in various costumes and situations to try and make it seem more interesting but it doesn't work. Oscar or no Oscar Coppola should be banned from movies for making this. 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,History
I Want Candy,"Energetic', 'Bright', and 'Lively' are adjectives which best describe Sofia Coppola's film, MARIE ANTOIENETTE. Many historical films are pedantic in that they seem to labor in an attempt to accentuate the difference between a certain historical period and how it contrasts the present. This film is very impressionistic in that Marie's perspective is almost that of a modern teenage girl. She is portrayed as a kind hearted soul who is thrust into an arranged marriage designed only to strengthen relations between two super-powers. Her personal feelings are not even addressed, and much to her dismay, the marriage is not consummated for over seven years. Her attempts to adapt are rebuffed, so she employs the flamboyant and eccentric court life of Versailles as a distraction. The political drama and intrigue of the French monarchy is infused with the whimsy of youth as Marie tries to find her place. The screen is drenched in pastels and scenes sprout inexplicably like an MTV video while the soundtrack blasts the songs of 1980's New Romantics. This music, although wildly out of historical context, embraces the spirit of a young girl who is trying to have the best possible time in troubling circumstances. Whether or not this is an historical accurate picture of the real Marie Antoinette (which is really beside the point), Sofia Coppola's characterization beautifully encapsulates the lightheartedness of a young female in a daunting situation.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Hypnotic, in a very bad way.","To begin with, I've never been impressed with Coppola. Lost in Transition bored the hell out of me. But this one was so bad I actually watched it to the stupefying end.I've just been reading several books about Marie Antoinette but couldn't find anything in the picture that comes close to Marie. She loved gambling, spending money, having a great time and flirting with Fersen, with whom she may or may not have been lovers with. She was apparently clueless as to what people may deduce about her closeness with her female friends. I doubt she was a lesbian but her relationship with Polignac certainly sent out alarms of the worst kind. No mention in the film of the scabrous and vile pamphlets printed about her and her friends.She did love her children; she did (in her own way) act concerned about the plight of the people (which didn't stop her from spending).She was devoted to her husband, even as he grew bigger and bigger in girth. There is a real story here of missed opportunities, anger growing by the poor over lack of bread and watching the elite have everything. The Revolution is completely lacking here. The Fall of the Bastille was a momentous event but you couldn't tell from here.Marie rose at the end when their lives as they knew it were over. She died with dignity, as did Louis.Read the biography by Antonia Fraser and other books about her. But skip this movie. Coppola should never be allowed to make a movie again. And I should never be weak enough to watch one of her movies should she be allowed to make one.And poor Gluck's music was left out. Whatever she was, Marie understood and loved great music and was a champion of Gluck, especially at the premiere of Iphigenie en Tauride which the audience didn't get and Marie stood up and applauded forcing the audience to do the same.",1.0,Anonymous,History
An delightful film.,"An young, beautiful lady (Kristen Dusnt) is about to marry an extremely shy Louis 16 (Jason Schwartzman) in the year of 1793 in France.

A pretty pawn in a wicked game,"This movie about Marie Antoinette's ""glory years"" is loosely based on Antonia Fraser's biography and doesn't dwell on the final, miserable period of the queen's life.The poster promoting the film gives hits of punk and post-punk atmospheres (that pink banner suggesting the Sex Pistols' God Save Queen single cover, etc....) but most of the audience seems to have missed the connection.The plot shows how the young queen was a pawn in a political marriage, thrown into a court that was a web of deception and corruption, and left to cope with her limited resources. It did not help her that her husband Louis, future XVI, was not much interested in sex and left her sleeping in a cold bed for seven years.Left to her own device and frustration, Marie ""overcompensated"" with the company of her friends, gambling and shopping. Not crimes ""per se"", but advertised as such to the peasants of France. Even her choice of spending time in the splendid Trianon's bucolic peace was criticized by the aristocrats, because she was neglecting the etiquette and by the peasants, as a sign of mocking extravagance. Whatever, Marie did, was wrong and it was easy as always to point out ""lasciviousness"" as her main wickedness. Like most women, sex was a cause for degrading libels, even if her one and only alleged lover was Count Fersen. When Marie gained some maturity thanks to maternity, it was already too late to save her reputation.The settings, costumes, and for me even the choice of music underline the decadent opulence of the last days of the Ancien Régime, making for a magnificent experience. A lushness for the senses, with a melancholic ending, sparing the audience the worst part.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The girl behind the myth,"Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" isn't necessarily an accurate biopic, nor is it historical drama. It's a tale about a woman entrapped in a marriage, in a palace and a golden cage, where her whole life is dictated to her. By her morher, her ladies in waiting, her husband. Everyone. It's a modern girl, living in the present, but she is also a queen, she has a duty to her people. At the end of the story, everyone is expecting from her, what she must offer because of her role, a role she has not chosen. Sofia Coppola puts Kirsten Dunst in lavish settings and gorgeous gowns, making her a perfectly fit image of what Marie Antoinette must have looked like, but she gives her a push making us see what she must have felt like. The French are proud of their revolutions, and it must be so, but this film is actually examining the girl behind the myth. Coppola shines in this movie, this works because of her.

"A brutal disaster of bad writing, bad directing, and bad editing, Marie fails to entertain or even keep one's interest from the first minute on","What happens when you mix a famous actress with a relatively unknown cast? What happens when you mix eighteenth century history with modern elements? What happens when a director screws up the entire film? You get Marie Antoinette. Directed quite dryly by Sopia Coppola, Marie is nothing more than eye candy; a slew of visuals but absolutely no content to back it up. The boredom associated with this two-hour snoozefest can be traced back to the writing which has no dialogue, the director which gives no direction, and well, that is about it. With little material to work with, Dunst and the others couldn't work their acting chops; that is, unless, it takes talent to stare at the camera and eat for several moments.Marie Antoinette is about the female-turned-queen whose antics were totally unfit for a woman of such high power, and also her wild life led to getting the blame when the country was short on money, and would eventually lead to her unexpected downfall. Along the way, she has trouble getting along with her destined husband, who unexpectedly becomes king. Both of them were expected to have a child right after marriage, but obvious conflicts in personality prevented this from happening for a very long time. From the very beginning, you see Marie getting ready to head to France to live a new life, and basically the film takes you through her entire life at the throne.Where this film goes wrong, does not happen with the acting or the casting. Kirsten Dunst is one of the main reasons why the Spider-Man movies easily have the best acting in any superhero movie franchise out there, by far. Her bubbly, cute, and charming appearance is then defaced by danger and conflict, revealing a confused, upset, bitter, and soft-shelled Mary Jane. In here, Dunst has absolutely nothing to work with. She has to talk a little (not even with an accent, director's decision), eat a lot, and look at the camera; that is it. With the content presented, Dunst does a good job, but she should have been given more, she should have had a chance to prove herself as an actress. But, Coppola didn't focus on acting at all. If that were the case, then the other people would actually sound French, then the other people would actually talk with emotion attached. The acting was not the problem here.Poorly written, poorly constructed, poorly edited, and poorly directed; all the major flaws of Marie Antoinette. It takes more than an hour for Marie and her husband, Louis XVI, to have any sort of romantic connection, but then it takes less than ten minutes for four years and three children to pass by. The pacing is practically awful, its too slow most of the time and then way too fast when it doesn't need to be. Repetitive shots of Marie waking up in the morning and repetitive shots of Marie and Louis eating in front of their servants doesn't exactly help the pacing either.Where is the dialogue? People can actually watch the first half hour with their ears covered and not actually have to miss important tidbits of conversation. More or less, it's because there is about one or two conversations in the entire first act! What seems to be the focus is the costumes, the scenery, the landscape surrounding the lifeless cast of characters with nothing to say. But, then we have modern music being blasted amongst the fancy and sophisticated cinematography.The reason for modern things being added to eighteenth century France? No idea. It's not proving a point, it doesn't enhance the experience, and it really doesn't help the movie in the least bit. With many things featured in the movie that at the time the film is taking place doesn't even exist yet (special fireworks, champagne bottles). With the direction being a mess, the viewer has absolutely no idea as to whether or not we are supposed to sympathize with Marie. On one hand, she looks like she's heartbroken; yet on several moments she is seen partying, having fun, and then cheating on her husband.On another moment, it looks as if she is being unfairly blamed for the economic troubles of France. Yet there is much more footage of her spending too much money and not enough footage of the French leaders discussing the American Revolution, the actual reason behind the demise in economic status in the grief-stricken country. Coopla can find a good shot of flowers, but for the life in her cannot figure out where to go with this motion picture. Then, like Marie's life, the movie ends abruptly, in a most awkward and frustrating manner.Bottom Line: This is a royal mess. With no dialogue, lack of direction, lack of decent editing, too much running time, and no willingness to make this movie even remotely resembling the time period, Marie Antoinette is bad enough to make historians throw up watching it, and it's bad enough to make even the most awake of viewers fall asleep. It must have been a lot more fun filming it than watching it. Dunst and the acting cast is not to blame, everyone else is. While classical/modern mixing is a tough genre (done well by ""A Knight's Tale"") Coppola had it wrong from the get go, to the very end.",2.0,Anonymous,History
you people are stupid,"For all of you stupid clowns that talk about how this film does not deal with the many intricacies of French history, I have this to say: THE FILM IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY. It is told from the very myopic point of view of Marie Antoinette, who knew very little of what was going on outside of Versailles.Also, some people complained about how anachronistic the use of 80s music was in the film. You people are also idiots. Picasso once said that art does not mimic nature. Art and the thing it represents are entirely separate entities. Similarly, this film cannot and should not attempt to capture the ""authentic"" feel of 18th century France. What Coppola does do, successfully, is capture certain timeless feelings and emotions. One way she does this is through the use of music that fits the culture of excess that surrounded the French aristocracy.I didn't love the movie, mainly because I found it difficult to connect to.

Q: Why was this film made? It's not obvious,"It's telling when you find you are forcing yourself to watch a film. This is my third sitting watching Sofia Coppola's Marie Antionette, and I have already ended this third stint to write this review. There is about half the film still to go and I shall finish watching it, promise, but not tonight.What, not watching it all before writing? Is that fair to Coppola? Well, I don't know and, frankly, I don't care either. Coppola's film is sumptuous, well-made, colourful and was actually filmed in the Palace of Versailles - the French government gave it special dispensation. It even won an Oscar (though for costume design). But what is it all about?What was Coppola trying to do when she wrote and directed this film? I really have no clue at all.I decided to watch it while reading Christopher Hibbert's account of the French Revolution and thought it might add a dimension to that work. Some hope. It is not a biopic, it is not historical, it is not even a drama - it is what it is whatever that is. It teeters on the edge of being dull but doesn't quite collapse into tedium. Is that an achievement? Is that any kind of recommendation: 'it's almost dull, but not quite'?Oddly enough one element of the film, using contemporary pop and rock songs in the soundtrack works. But it is not clear why Coppola took that route. But other elements simply hang about waiting to spark - or be sparked - into life but never get there. Or perhaps they: I promised to watch the rest of it (once I can summon the resolve) and I might be pleasantly surprised. Or I might not.It is obvious that a great deal of money was spent on this production, but I'm still wondering whether it was well-spent. The money men, the investors, the financiers who made Coppola's film a reality will have been interested in box office takings and how well-spent their money was will be decided by how much extra moolah it puts back in their pockets.We poor non-money men, non-investor, non-financier schmucks are looking for a different kind of return, and from what I've seen some of us - might feel a little short-changed. Others of course, will be delighted.Now I must get back to wondering what the whole point of it was and is.As 5/10 is 'average' that's what it's getting, but honestly it might even be just a 4/10.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Immerses you in Marie's world,"""Marie Antoinette"" takes you into two places the movies have never been before: the sumptuous halls of Versailles, and the thoughts and feelings of the notorious French queen. It treats its heroine with great sympathy, even her gambling parties and playacting at being a shepherdess. Marie's (Kirsten Dunst) shopping and trendsetting aren't sheer frivolities, but ways for her to distract herself from the strictures of court life and her despair that her husband, the none-too-majestic Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) shows no interest in her. The movie's centerpiece pastel-shoes-and-pastries montage, set to the song ""I Want Candy,"" comes right after she reaches her lowest depth of misery that other court ladies are having babies while she remains a virgin.There's a lot of talk about how Marie must produce children to cement a political alliance between France and Austria; other than that, the movie is quite apolitical. It doesn't concern itself with the causes of the French Revolution, and a few scenes of Louis debating whether to aid the American Revolution feel tacked-on. But interestingly, this apolitical quality makes the climactic scene of an angry peasant mob storming Versailles very effective. The shock you feel at seeing the mob is the same as Marie's shock, because the whole movie has been limited to Marie's perspective, the hermetically sealed world of the court.Some have criticized the against-type casting (e.g. Schwartzman, Rip Torn, and Molly Shannon as French royalty), but it points out the human side of these aristocratic figures, making them feel more contemporary and individualized. Every actor uses his or her natural accent, be it British, American, or French, which adds to the unpretentious feeling. Besides, the emphasis here is not on speech, but on mood and image. What little dialogue there is mostly consists of gossipy whispers, lectures to Marie about her royal duties, or casual, seemingly improvised conversations.Dunst is especially good in the early scenes, successfully playing a character much younger than her actual age. She really seems like a spontaneous, uncomplicated 15-year-old girl, which is important for the movie to be effective. This ""Marie Antoinette"" wants you to think about the natural versus the artificial: how the rigid Versailles etiquette stifles Marie's and Louis' natural instincts, how Marie's desire to immerse herself in artifice (shoes, clothes) is actually natural or understandable, why she is happiest on her faux farm, etc. Dunst's performance, which goes from sweet naiveté to stubborn frivolity to a growing maturity, matches the movie's rhythms.With its dainty pastel color scheme, rock soundtrack, female protagonist who seems like an ordinary young girl instead of a remote aristocrat, and focus on visuals and emotion rather than plot and dialogue, ""Marie Antoinette"" is not a typical historical bio-drama. Though not as affecting as the intimate ""Lost in Translation,"" it does cause you to sympathize with the young queen. Aesthetically pleasing and apolitical, it's the sort of movie that Marie Antoinette's favorite portraitist, Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, would have made if she were a filmmaker instead of a painter.",8.0,Anonymous,History
