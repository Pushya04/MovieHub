High quality (little action) and realistic depiction of the hunt for Bin Laden,"It's not an action flick, it's a thriller. About a tough CIA-chick who has a hunch about a guy who might eventually lead them to Osama Bin Laden. It takes her almost 10 years, a little waterboarding, a couple of dead colleagues and a lot of arguing with her superiors, but she manages to follow the lead all the way to the now famous raid in Abbottabad.It's a very captivating film (even with its 160 minutes runtime), and the big raid at the end is quite intense and realistic. That said, Bigelow's previous 'The Hurt Locker' was (even) better. But it's close!As for the controversy whether the film is 'pro-torture propaganda' or not: it shows what (likely) happened. A very unpleasant sight for Americans, sure, but that's no reason to leave it out. Whether or not 'OBL' would've been caught without the use of torture is speculation that has no place in this movie (it's a depiction of events, not a moral study).Some Americans might still find it hard to watch a movie that requires you to form your own opinion about the actions of your country/government/army, instead of getting one spoon fed by those very same institutions. But given the America's options in government- potential it seems a luxury Americans no longer have.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Fantastic piece of work,"I did not expect to enjoy this as much as I actually did. With its length, complicated nature and incredible detail Zero Dark Thirty was a fantastic piece of work. Jessica Chastain was brilliant in the convincing centre piece of the narrative. It was long, starting strong, losing credit towards the middle but the final hour was terrific. Right down to the raid which was full of suspense and drama. Like the raid itself, it was a precise and scintillating piece of cinema. In the end it felt worth it, I have little interest in the context of its accuracies of the actual events, nor its controversy. In the scheme of things I watched for entertainment, and it delivered. If you're in the mood for something dramatic with a serious tone, watch Zero Dark Thirty.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A companion piece for visiting UBL's compound,"I've lived in the Muslim world for years and in Pakistan for a few months. Now some friends came to stay and the one place they decided they HAD to see was the empty plot of land where once stood Osama Bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad. Three hours to go, three hours back, some pictures and a story to tell (the movie says the city is 45 minutes drive from Islamabad, but that was back in 2010 - not now!).Once we came back we were so involved with the story of the raid that we had to see Zero Dark Thirty (for the 2nd time for me, 1st for them). The killing of UBL is meticulously reconstructed, but only covers the last 30 minutes of the movie. Most of the story involves a CIA semi-fictional agent who by sheer determination and luck convinces the Agency that Bin Laden can be reached, and that they have a good idea of what men is the key to his whereabouts: Ibrahim Sayed, AKA Abu Ahmed Al-Kuwaiti. Information from detainees suggests Sayed is UBL's courier. Our hero figures that, wherever in Central Asia UBL is, the one thing he is sure to have is a courier. Track him, you get the big Kahuna.The Agency is initially unlucky to believe erroneous intelligence saying Sayed is dead. And then they are lucky to find out he is not dead. With a lot of push from our hero, they allot the resources to find him. It is no easy task. That's my favorite part of the movie. Surveillance technology can find out from where he is calling his family (busy districts in the Punjab), but it is a lot more tricky to follow him in the middle of the crowd to the place where he lives.After tracking Sayed to a VERY suspicious compound in a city the CIA never expected Bin Laden to be, it is time to decide if this is really UBL's residence. But the mysterious inhabitant never shows his face. I don't think he was hiding from CIA cameras, he just knows he is so recognizable. So the decision is left to the higher-ups, to bomb the place, raid it, or just keep waiting for more definitive intel.And that is the part where the Director has to make a dramatic decision. Does she show the President and his top aides deliberating? I think putting Obama, Clinton and Biden in the movie would suck all the air out of the room to the detriment of the focus on the field agents. Leon Panneta shows up, but he is not even named. The final act wrote itself, because it is a documentary-like recreation of the raid.Some reviewers pointed glaring mistakes: the Pakistanis seem to be speaking Arabic instead of Urdu. One part I had to laugh was when a mob stood outside the American Embassy in Islamabad. If you have been there, or anywhere in the diplomatic compound, you know it would never happen.It is hard to make suspenseful a story that unfolds throughout 10 years and involves meticulous collection of intelligence and a lot of false starts. So the movie may feel like a ""boring procedural"" for people who are expecting normal Hollywood fare. In order to add a personal touch to the main character, she has a fried killed in a highly implausible scene. Otherwise, Maya just remains a stock character you have to fill in the gaps: lonely woman married to her job, always having to prove herself, obsessed with a task her superiors don't want to give priority.Some people pointed out to a big lie of the movie: that torture gave crucial information. I'd point out that it is just a half-lie. Yes, nobody gave useful intel for the killing of UBL under torture. However, keeping terror suspects for years under dubious legal status (say with me - Guantanamo!) paid dividends.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Shocked how real the raid look,"Maya (Jessica Chastain) is a CIA analyst who won't rest from the hunt fro Bin Laden. Director Kathryn Bigelow has followed the hunt from 9-11 to the tension filled raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The movie is based on the true events. There is a relevant question of how true to the events is the movie. Unlike most movies, this is actually an important question.Most of us have no hope of knowing the true facts that actually happened. This movie is certainly a possible reality. Some of it is probably wrong. They've probably changed some of it to not reveal CIA trade craft. Others looks different than what's been reported on the news. However it is overall following the story already laid out for the public.The hunt for Bin Laden can meander and not follow a straight line. It doesn't really built like a normal movie. Bigelow is still able to maintain the tension throughout the movie. The last 40 minutes is where this movie truly excels. The raid in Abbottabad is incredibly tense. The Hollywood flashiness is mostly removed. It takes its time. It's done almost in real time. It has the intensity of realism. It's shocking how real the raid looked.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Technically Impressive but Surprisingly Hollow,"""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a grim, clinical depiction of the CIA search for Osama bin Laden. Its strongest feature is its dramatization of the Navy Seal Team 6 operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed bin Laden. That sequence is so professionally shot it could be actual documentary footage.""Zero"" has no real plot. Episodic scenes occur in a choppy manner, one after the other. Scenes consist of depictions of beating and water boarding of detainees in order to gather information, agents stalking a suspect in Pakistan's crowded, chaotic bazaars, terrorist bombings, assassinations and assassination attempts. There are also scenes in offices where characters stare intently at computer screens or interrogation videos, and characters yell at each other and use obscenities, as their frustrating hunt for Osama bin Laden wears them down.""Zero"" makes no attempt to draw the viewer in with any human sentiment. Characters are given no backstory and no character arch. CIA agent Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, is the closest the film has to a main character. She reveals no affect. Her face is blank. She isn't so much robotic as inert. We know nothing about her, except that she was recruited to the CIA while in high school – we are never told what would draw the CIA to a high school student. I didn't care about this character at all. All I kept thinking was, ""Jessica Chastain is being praised for *this* performance? Why?"" The dullness of her performance, and the underwritten character, made it almost impossible for me to lose myself in the story, such as it was.Jason Clarke is very strong and charismatic as Dan, a CIA interrogator. Dan humiliates, beats, and water boards suspects, and then feeds them delicious meals of hummus and olives when they deliver. His depiction of his work as just another job – he could be playing a bus driver with the same amount and degree of expressiveness – is provocative. I wish I had gone to see a film built around his character and his performance.Overall, I was disappointed in the film. Feature films are an art form. I want them to do to me what drama can do. I want to be made to identify with a character and I want, through that identification, to learn more about life, or I want to be entertained. ""Zero"" did neither for me. I wasn't entertained, and my understanding and worldview were not expanded. I think the same material could have been better treated in a documentary with selective re-enactments.""Zero Dark Thirty"" sidesteps key questions. Maya sacrificed years of her life to the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Dan risks his humanity by making his living beating and humiliating other men. Men, women and children throughout the Muslim world, and, as the film makes clear, in America's and Europe's cities, are eager to blow themselves up, as long as they can take some infidels with them. Why? The film doesn't even acknowledge that there are people out there asking the question, never mind attempting to suggest an answer.The film opens with audio from the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, suggesting that the war between Islam and the non-Muslim world dates from that attack. Not so. Islam increased its territory through jihad from its invention in the seventh century until September 11, 1683, at the Battle of Vienna. After that defeat, Islam stopped its spread. The significance of the date of September 11 goes back over four centuries.America's founding fathers had to deal with jihad; see Thomas Jefferson and the Barbary Pirates. Some argue terrorism, including the 9-11 attack, is caused by Western imperialism. The solution to these thinkers is for the Western world to be nicer to non-Western nations, to practice multiculturalism and to share the wealth. Others argue that jihad is inextricable from Islam, and that one necessary step is for the West to recognize and cherish its own unique virtues – to cherish that for which its spies, soldiers, and citizens fight, sacrifice, kill and die.""Zero Dark Thirty"" never so much as brushes up against these questions. At its key moment, the film is hollow. We all know how the hunt ends – we all know Osama bin Laden is dead. ""Zero"" might have addressed why Maya gave the time of her life to that hunt, why Dan risked his humanity, why Seal Team 6 trained for years and risked their lives. ""Zero"" never does consider why these, who might have been the film's heroes, did what they did, and I walked out of the theater oddly unmoved by all the high tension and graphic violence I'd just sat through.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Perfect Depiction of the UBL Saga,"I'm not claiming that this movie is 100% factual or even close to it but I think the filmmaker did a brilliant job of chronicling the UBL saga. IMO the theme of the movie in a nutshell is this: We got this guy (maybe?) but at what cost and were we justified? These are not easy questions to answer and they are left open ended for the most part.The three main criticisms I've come across in the reviews is that 1) The movie is propaganda 2) It glorifies torture and 3) It is factually inaccurate. The third is probably a legitimate criticism but the movie really makes no pretenses about being a documentary and there is a prominent disclaimer at the beginning that it is based primarily on eye-witness accounts (and it is common knowledge that those can be unreliable). Regarding the death of UBL - well the movie even leaves that open ended which is pretty consistent with the actual reported events. We only get brief blurred glimpses of the side of his face and the only definitive identification comes from the 'expert' protagonist who is clearly somewhat derailed and obsessed with the manhunt (and who also stated UBL was at that location with 100% certainty).That leads in to the first criticism. I fail to understand how this movie can be perceived as propaganda. How does portraying a 10 year ordeal culminating in an unglamorous methodical execution style raid (in which a helicopter crashes and SEALS kill possibly innocent bystanders with machine like precision) where the target's identity is not a even a certainty even remotely constitute a biased pro American agenda? Not to mention that the whole raid is brought about by a hunch and a fluke stroke of luck and not any actual key pieces of information obtained through interrogation (other than a name). If anything luck was the deciding factor in taking down UBL - not American awesomeness.Now the torture - How does showing torture equate to glorifying torture? Does Braveheart glorify torture too? Again - this had the opposite effect on me. The viewer is forced to confront the unpleasant reality that we tortured many detainees (probably pointlessly) in our desperation to capture UBL and bring him to justice. What was the primary motivation? Revenge? Safety? Do the ends justify the means? Essentially that's the exact question the filmmaker is posing to the viewer by exposing the torture to public scrutiny.Perhaps this movie just rubs people the wrong way because they find it too sympathetic to government officials. It's easy to criticize to the Government and trust me I am far from an optimist when it comes to American politicians so I do it often. Obviously our leaders were faced with some difficult decisions after 9/11. Did we handle things the best way? Certainly not, but for better or worse this thing played out the way it did and we have to deal with it and move forward.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Propaganda done properly,"Zero Dark Thirty is a procedural CIA-based thriller in the mould of TV's Homeland. This film, however, is based on real-life events, so it doesn't have the benefit of being able to withhold in the way Homeland's first series did with Twin Peaks-like delectation. What Zero Dark Thirty does have is a narrative based on first-hand accounts, and it makes no explicit judgement about the content of those accounts. We simply get to see what (apparently) happened during the manhunt for ""UBJ"".The film's lack of polemic is both a blessing a curse. It's a blessing because it's rare that a film dealing with such volatile subject matter is depicted procedurally. Usually when a narrative is made ostensibly apolitical it's as a result of an unconvincing moral rebalancing, where the filmmakers go to great lengths to present both sides fairly. But Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow's disinterest is also a curse because, in avoiding judgement, it surreptitiously falls firmly on the side of the CIA. It shows what it's allowed to show, but keeps their secrets (""undisclosed location"" and all that); and it portrays the operatives as the honourable front-liners getting their hands dirty (but not bloody), beyond moral reproach by virtue of hard graft. In Bigelow's world, it's the suits in Washington who have the blood in their hands - they're disconnected, as evidenced when torture-specialist Dan (Jason Clarke) returns to US headquarters from the field and loses his nerve, becoming a man of soft probabilities.Clarke is solid but lost amidst superior talent, as he was in John Hillcoat's recent Lawless. Jessica Chastain delivers a nuanced performance. Driven professionals in films often come across as stolid, but Chastain is an actor of subtlety - even if Bigelow can't help lensing her like a wind-swept movie star in the Middle Eastern magic light. Jennifer Ehle uses her moon-faced radiance to good effect, filling her eager operative Jessica with youthful energy. There's a fair amount of distracting spot-the-cameo going on, particularly toward the end, when Joel Edgerton, Mark Duplass and James Gandolfini turn up.Bigelow's directorial talent is never in doubt. The final sequence in particular is harrowingly tense, even though we know the outcome. And she generally gets the best out of actors. But make no mistake: this is a deeply patriotic film which is cheering for the home team, and it does so under the guise of objectivity, which makes it more manipulative than flag-waving fare like Last Ounce of Courage or Act of Valor, albeit much more skilfully made.",6.0,Anonymous,History
That was 157 minutes that flew by!,"I wasn't sure how I would feel about such a long film based on recent events, and thus a recent film. I tend to stick to older films. But this was a fantastic thriller. I think it tends to get mixed reviews because it doesn't take a position on torture of the detainees that it portrayed. But nothing would have put me to sleep faster than a bunch of moralizing about what went on. Instead, this captured my attention and didn't let go for the almost three hour running time, although I know how it turned out in the end. Everybody does.It has a semi-documentary feel and tracks the hunt for terrorist Bin Ladin over a ten year period through two very different administrations - Bush then Obama - and the changing politics and thus rules of engagement of the era. The protagonist - if there is one - CIA agent Maya doesn't want this assignment initially. She is asked how she likes Pakistan. She indicates she doesn't like the place. She seems somewhat queasy when she first witnesses a detainee being water boarded. But if she has a problem with any of this she never voices it past this scene.My impression was that the function of the torture is to illustrate a point that director Bigelow and the film is trying to make in regards to modern warfare and what a ""war on terror"" is in the 21st century. In many ways the film is like a companion piece to Fincher's Zodiac in its serialized examination of trying to catch a villain through information and mis-information. Both films aren't so much about the villains as much as they are meditations on information and obsession; they seem to be concerned with what happens when you have too much information, how one differentiates good information from bad information, and what the morality is of seeking information.Modern warfare and the war on terror is a war on information. What are the first things the SEALs grab when the kill-shot is fired? Hard drives and files. Characters in both films can't seem to see beyond what it is they're trying to obtain and they're willing to ruin their lives, and others, to obtain it.These characters are obsessed and have tunnel vision They see only their goal. (I think of that scene where Maya watches a drone strike occur on a monitor as she's nonchalantly on the phone with someone.) I don't feel like any story arc was needed for Maya, all I want are the facts, so I don't feel cheated in that sense. I think Bigelow made the right decision by just putting her in there and not giving us much. It's not about her, it's about the hunt for Bin Laden and how it went down. Why she put in the final shot though I don't know.If you are looking for a good thriller based on factual events, this is terrific edge of your seat entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Dense, Valid and Sometimes Riveting, it Frequently Gets Lost in its Own Material","This (slightly) fictionalized dramatization of the decade-long hunt for Osama Bin Laden is often difficult to watch, for a variety of reasons, but that doesn't mean it isn't any good. It's just not your typically polished, glistening Hollywood rendition, and that takes a bit of getting used to. Flubbed lines are left in the final cut, which serves to humanize the cast. Quiet, unsuspecting character moments are unforgettably interrupted by sudden explosions of violence - effectively mimicking (or so I have to imagine) the bloodrush of a real-world terrorist assault. The methods of torture employed in America's hunt for Al-Qaeda's leader are brazenly featured, as are the mixed spoils of their occasional success. The first act points a firehose of information at the audience, leaving them just as overwhelmed and buried by minutiae as the lead. Jessica Chastain is fiery and confident in that role, essential traits for the complicated character she occupies, but the rest of the supporting cast fades into the wallpaper when she's around. The actual onslaught on Bin-Laden's compound, which eats up the last hour of the film, is the smoothest and most accessible scene by a longshot, remaining factual and vividly lifelike while also ratcheting up the pacing and the tension. As a whole, though, the film is well-acted and effective, but often slow and over-inflated. Though it paints just one side of the story, it refrains from drawing any final conclusions and instead leaves the viewer to deal with the validity of America's motives and methods.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Superlative political thriller,"Maya, a tenacious CIA agent (Jessica Chastain) searches for world's most wanted man: Osama Bin Laden, against the background of terrorist attacks against Western targets. Director Kathryn Bigelow does a masterful job of blending tension and action with the sometimes tedious processes of data analysis and surveillance (the film compresses eight years of searching for the 9-11 mastermind into 160 minutes). Chastain is excellent as the driven analyst and the film wisely wastes no time on her life outside the search (i.e. No gratuitous romance, personal affairs, etc). The rest of the cast is also quite good, especially Jennifer Ehle as Maya's colleague Jessica. The lengthy climactic set-piece, as the special-ops team move in on bin Laden's compound near Abbottabad, Pakistan is outstanding. The film was controversial for its depiction of torture (aka 'enhanced interrogation techniques') as an effective 'necessary evil' in the 'war on terrorism'. 'Ends vs. Means' arguments aside, 'Zero Dark Thirty' is a riveting adventure with some great action sequences, but I admit that I have a very non-PC love for films like this and that some people might find the film repugnant (especially the first half-hour).",10.0,Anonymous,History
Superb,"Superb espionage/military-drama from Kathryn Bigelow (who directed the even more impressive The Hurt Locker). Details the search for and elimination of Osama Bin Laden.Tight, intriguing plot. Excellent direction from Bigelow - the tension is built, and even though you know how it ends, it stays incredibly engrossing throughout. You hardly realise that the movie is over 2 1/2 hours long, the high level of engagement is so constant and the pace of the movie so perfect.Great performance from Jessica Chastain in the lead role. Good support from Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Mark Strong and Jennifer Ehle. Minor parts for Joel Edgerton and James Gandolfini.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Torture,"It has been established, it wasn't torture or, quoting that dishonest euphemism, ""enhanced interrogation"" that took the intelligence community to Bin Laden. So, how is it possible that this film by intelligent people would perpetrate that lie? The film is technically brilliant but it becomes tedious because, naturally, we know the ending. The other strange fact is the casting of Jessica Chastain. She seems elsewhere, emotionally and otherwise. I couldn't connect with her, I was far too aware of the ""acting"" I see she's getting lots of acting nominations, I don't quite get it. Katheryn Bigelow at the helm does a truly extraordinary job, but I can't help, worrying that most people will take this as fact and, perhaps, the most important aspect is pure fiction. No tortured prisoner took us to Bin Laden, okay?",7.0,Anonymous,History
Better than Argo,"I've seen all the reasons viewers (and some critics) dislike this film, but in my opinion it is infinitely superior to ARGO in its authenticity and dramatic quality. The final scenes, when the SEAL team, goes into Ben Laden's house, are brilliantly rendered. The idea of doing it mostly in the dark with flashes of illumination by ""night vision"" green is a brilliant touch, which most directors would never have attempted.The performances by Jessica Chastain, of course, Jason Clark and Jennifer Ehle are top drawer and the torture scenes, while brutal, are necessary--because that's the way it happened. Congratulations to Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal for getting it right.I don't want to put the knock on Argo, because I found it entertaining.

The Straightforward Hunt,"One's appeal for Zero Dark Thirty is to see how it depicts the search for Osama Bin Laden like it seems too impossible to find him, like he's probably already dead, or almost doesn't exist. Even though there are controversies going around and some revelations, the story is still all dramatized. Without a surprise from director Kathryn Bigelow, the film is totally electrifying and deliberately engrossing. There is humanity left in the end that made this a lot more compelling, but that's the last thing we should talk about. It never backs away from the promise and stays focus on the mission. Zero Dark Thirty is a powerfully gripping thriller.It's a straightforward mission and only about the mission. We can see the main protagonist's obsession of capturing Bin Laden even without showing any backstories. She's brave, probably too brave, enough on what she's doing. They have to make difficult decisions to where are they gonna go or who are they gonna find. The film is indeed a dramatize version of the ten year hunt. It plays too much suspense and sudden shock, but no matter what, every tragic event are still portrayed in a completely terrifying way.There is no doubt this film will fall into a controversy. It features a torture scene that many think they justify it. It is so talked about and was against it but it seems the scenes only exists nothing more than showing that sort of truth. The most awaited part of the movie is indeed the climax. Just like anyone would imagine, it's a silent and mercilessly violent raid. There's a lot of humanity in the character Maya. As much as she aggressively wanted to find her target, she still cannot stomach any brutal interrogation and tragedy happening on her associates and other people. Jessica Chastain manages to weigh all of her personalities. Other strong actors like Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Jennifer Ehle, and Mark Strong keeps their roles effective as well.Kathryn Bigelow's prominent style is slick tension. Here she displays danger in any place where the characters go like something will suddenly explode or a loud gunfire. The action scenes is filled with suspense. One of the sequences can be tad too ridiculous for this movie but it didn't ruin a single thing to the experience. When it takes place inside the CIA or a meeting, it gets undeniably absorbing. The screen writing makes sure it's factual enough and interesting.People's expectations might mislead them. Zero Dark Thirty is not only about finding and killing Osama Bin Laden but it's also about one's obsession and revenge to this terrorist. In the end, there's plenty of guilt to express but that proves that they are still human beings. We could merit its brilliant filmmaking and strong storytelling that made it feel like we're part of the search. We all know this is just a dramatization of the true events but all the horrifying truths like the violence stays to the picture. It's a story with nobody calling themselves heroes even though they defeated their enemy. It depicts the darkest parts of its history. Some might wonder how worse it could have been but ignoring all the commotion, Zero Dark Thirty is still a compelling thriller.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Bigelow's Masterpiece?,"Zero Dark Thrity is the new movie from Hurt Locker director Kathryn Bigelow who has enjoyed a rich and varied career to date which will surely be swamped under the weight of opinion lumped on this picture. She is a highly adept film-maker and the aforementioned Hurt Locker might just be the finest example of a war movie since Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. Zero Dark Thirty is a different beast altogether. It is a fact-based account of the events leading up to the killing of Osama Bin Laden. Its a touchy subject which is largely handled with great care and aplomb by the cast and film-makers. Thats not to say the movie is perfect, its actually far from it.The movie is talky without being overly analytical or detailed. I learned nothing from the 157 minute runtime that i couldn't find out in 20 minutes on the web, but maybe that's the point. The word chronicle is often bounded around when talking about Zero Dark Thirty. Chronicle is defined as 'A factual written account of important or historical events in the order of their occurrence' and thats precisely what the film is and not a touch more. There is no meat offered to the viewer by way of engaging character or story development, indeed, the film is mostly an anti-cinematic experience aside from the last 20 or so minutes.An interesting counter point is the popular 'Homeland' show which also charts a driven female CIA agent as she tracks a known and dangerous terrorist. Its true that both works have completely different end-games but it is interesting to note just how far removed the two are. Homeland is purely for entertainment purposes and Zero Dark Thirty strives to be factual and relevant. I would argue that Zero Dark Thirty could have never won over every critic and begs the question, can you really expect to make a piece of solid entertainment about tracking and killing Osama Bin Laden? The answer is no. They would have been surely lambasted for glorifying a potentially inflammatory event (please see Oliver Stone's dreadful 'World Trade Center'). Therefore, we are left with this glossy, extremely well made, pseudo-documentary which is never particularly involving or like-able.Also with all due respect, Chastain can count herself very lucky to have just been nominated for best actress. She was surely a shoe-in for the Oscar nod for just turning up here as the film lends itself, due to its 'factual' nature, to receiving the adoration of the academy. Her performance, much like the film, barely exists but to prop up and relay the events. She cries when people die and she is cast iron in the face of a male dominated, scary world but she is barely a character in her own right. People aren't talking about Maya's dominance of the screen, they are talking about the half-truisms of the events themselves. I'm not asking for any meaningful superfluous back story or exposition but i wanted to see her out of the situation, if just for a few minutes. As an audience we need to know the characters aside from them telling us what is going to happen in the movie. Don't get me wrong, Chastain does nothing wrong here, its more a problem with the writing or maybe just with the style of movie they were trying to make here that breaks her for me. Another interesting counter-point is Ben Affleck's excellent Argo. Here we have a movie based on some pretty harrowing true events but its handled with a cinematic eye. Affleck takes some liberties with the truth in Argo but what he does make is a piece of cinema that excites the audience, involves you in the picture and the characters completely and most importantly stays with you after the fact. I felt nothing at Zero Dark Thirty's conclusion, even when watching Chastain cry, i didn't appreciate the action or care. I didn't feel anything for her character, i knew her about as well as i did Osama Bin Laden (movie equivalent of course).I think my main problem was with the point of the whole exercise. Its a film that sits on the fence, never glorifies or revels nor does it offer any comment or insight. So what then was the point? Do we really live in a world where is it necessary to make a film about every important event in history? How is this any different to watching a fluffy news story? Do we really need attractive people on the silver screen for people to give a sh*t about whats going on in the world? I hope not.All of that being said, Zero Dark Thirty is never an exercise in patience, it rumbles along at a steady pace and if all your looking for is a chronicle of events post 9/11 you'll find a lot to be interested in. I just cant shake the question, what was the point?",6.0,Anonymous,History
Zero Dark Thirty chronicles the decade-long hunt for bin Laden with profound neutrality.,"Darkness. A blank screen echoes the desperate screams and howls of innocent civilians telephoning their loved ones before the World Trade Centre crumbled over them. 2,977 fatalities. Over 25,000 injuries. ""9/11"", at the hands of Islamic fundamentalist group al-Qaeda, became the ""deadliest terrorist attack in human history"". The Bush administration swiftly launching the ""War on Terror"" to depose the Taliban, after the proposed extradition of leader Osama bin Laden floundered. Future terrorist attacks were imminent, with the CIA employing controversial systematic torture programs known as ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" to extract information from detainees in undisclosed black sites. Maya, a fictional CIA analyst tasked in locating bin Laden, soon becomes obsessed with potential lead Abu Ahmed that rapidly sends her down a monomaniacal path of danger, with growing pressure to save thousands of lives in the process.Bigelow's thrilling decade-long depiction of events, in what is claimed as the ""greatest manhunt in history"", can only be described as uncompromising scintillating cinema at its most raw. The extremist behaviour of Islamic Group members have been widely reported, detailed and sensationalised by the media for countless years. ""7/7"" bombings in London. The Camp Chapman attack. The 2008 Mumbai attacks. All co-ordinated actions that drew widespread condemnation. However, dramatising these profound events to stir further hatred for extremist behaviour and imply celebratory national patriotism, are not functionalities for Boal's succinct screenplay. Both Bigelow and Boal, whom collaborated on 'The Hurt Locker', utilise modern history to insight political critique upon the questionable actions of the Bush administration and malevolence of al-Qaeda.A proliferate narrative neutrality that produced an unyielding barrier of risk, querying the legitimacy of bin Laden's assassination and the gruelling process leading up to that pivotal raid. In the process, supplying sensitive philosophers and cowardly politicians with enough controversial ammunition to fire allegations from every direction. Supposed partisanship with the Obama administration, improper access to classified documents and pro-torture portrayal (more on that later...). These assertions are just that. Allegations. Because Zero Dark Thirty is a stark reminder of how ambivalent America's contribution to this war was, and that undoubtedly irked ""experts"" and officials.Putting aside the historical politics for one moment, the essence of Bigelow's intellectual assertion comes in the form of Maya. A lone female operative shrouded in the masculinity of warfare. Her tenacity and tough-minded persona undeniably receives the most acute character development arcs ever written, acting as an independent pressured employee expending her entire career in chasing bin Laden and a conduit for the narrative's neutrality. Her initial reserved attitude towards approved ""enhanced interrogation"" allows viewers to question the permissibility of such authoritative techniques. Then she becomes obsessed, gradually succumbing to the ferocity of her work. Weeks, months, years. A decade passes. The pressure breaking her meticulous persona down, utilising any and all methods in finding bin Laden. Yet Maya combats the systematic ideologies of the CIA consistently to grant her fictionalisation a required neutrality that issues humanity. Chastain's exceptional performance is littered with nuanced emotive details that gingerly bestow a provocative rage. Commanding, intimidating and menial. Chastain fluctuates her power from quaint whispers to enraged shouts, yet never lets her guard down. Until the final scene. A scene that profoundly reflected the morality and ethicality of all the preceding events that happened over the decade-long manhunt. The first and only moment where Maya exerts emotional fragility. A cluster of overwhelming feelings. Relief. Disappointment. Melancholy. Maya is the representation of the entire Iraq war from an emotional standpoint, and her culminating frame of film is perfect.Bigelow, alongside Fraser's clinically bleak cinematography, explores the dark side of war. Bolstered by a commendable supporting cast whom exude professional urgency to the matter at hand. From the desolate anticipation of the Camp Chapman attack, to the night-vision filtered compound raid of Operation Neptune Spear. Zero Dark Thirty never dissipates its tension and technical astuteness, despite the chapter segregation that does regrettably disjoint the elongated runtime.Now, the torture interrogations. Waterboarding in particular. Famously generating a mass amount of controversy for its propagandistic nature and pro-torture stance. Makes you wonder why it conjured so much attention in the first place. To add on Bigelow's response, it is a part of history. It shouldn't have been, but it was. Consequently these government approved techniques should not be ignored regardless if it lead to bin Laden's location or not, and it absolutely does question the morality behind such actions. Maya's inclusion complying with that thought-process entirely. It categorically does not normalise torture, nor does its involvement endorse such issues. It simply provides exposure, arguably creating a statement against torture by implying the antagonistic behaviours of CIA agents.There's a reason why Zero Dark Thirty was marred with controversy. There's a reason why Zero Dark Thirty pursues a neutral narrative. It raises a fundamental question. ""Was the death of bin Laden worth the price we paid?"". By showing the unspeakable, unflinching and the uncompromising, Bigelow audaciously challenges on an intellectual scale by using modern warfare as her weapon of choice. Producing a near-perfect film in the process.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Trust the Hype,"For over eleven years now the War on Terror has dominated global foreign policy and has transformed America as we know it. One can hardly remember what life was like before 9/11 anymore. Since then we have been in a constant state of war and, in many ways, a constant state of fear. We have given up many of our own liberties, abandoned many of our stated principles and have sacrificed thousands of our own in an attempt to ""make us safe."" Where do we go from here?If you are looking for a film to validate your own political position on America's recent international exploits, Zero Dark Thirty is not for you. If you want a film to take a moral stand on perhaps the most significant event(s) of your lifetime, you may want to look to a different source. Zero Dark Thirty transcends politics. It isn't a film that tells us we were right or we were wrong. It's a film that shows us what lengths we went through to kill the man responsible. Kathryn Bigelow's masterful follow up to the much lauded ""The Hurt Locker"" is no doubt the best film of the year, and I think it is an important movie in the history of American cinema.The film is led by Jessica Chastain's astounding performance as Maya, a CIA operative who dedicates more then 10 years to finding Osama Bin Laden. The film begins with Dan (played by Jason Clarke) who is interrogating a detainee named Ammar (played by Reda Kateb) while Maya observes from the corner. Amid the torture, which is often hard to watch, Dan steps out of the room for a quick minute at which point Ammar begs Maya for help, for compassion. For a second it appears as though Maya may succumb and help the poor man, but instead she replies with stony passion, ""You can help yourself by being truthful."" Jessica Chastain's Maya goes against the conventional ""female"" role often given to women in Hollywood. These roles are generally broken down into two categories: sluts and mothers/wives, and usually involves plenty of tears and emotions. Very rarely do we see a bad-ass female character like Maya surface. At the same time Maya is neither the bad girl or the good girl of this story. She's not the evil stepmother, nor is she the fairy godmother. She is a shade of gray.Perhaps the same can be said for the movie as a whole. It isn't really a heroic tale, nor one of failure and defeat. It is somewhere in between. The film takes us on a decade long journey in America's effort to bring justice to the worlds most hated and notorious terrorist. Throughout the struggles and hardships, we finally reach our goal. We find out where Osama Bin Laden is hiding, and after months of surveillance and planning, we go in for the kill. The last 30 minutes of the film are breathtaking, as the SEAL team boards helicopters and make the journey to the compound in Abatobad. Controversy has, of course, surrounded this film as many decry it's use of torture. These people believe that just because it doesn't take a firm stand against torture means that it must be pro-torture. Nothing could be further from the truth. First of all, we shouldn't need a movie to tell us that torture is wrong, we have a conscience for that. Secondly, the film is a story about the War on Terror, and to omit torture completely would not tell the full story. Whether torture directly led to finding Osama Bin Laden or not, torture was used in the hunt and it was important that we saw this in the film.The real brilliance of Zero Dark Thirty comes with the allegory of Maya, however. In many ways Maya represents the country as a whole. Like Maya we invested a decade in this hunt for Bin Laden. Like Maya we sacrificed a lot for this war. For the last ten years we have put all of ourselves (as a nation) into this single goal. Now that Osama Bin Laden is dead, and the War in Afghanistan is coming to an end, where do we go from here? Maya is asked this same question at the end of Zero Dark Thirty. It is a question she cannot answer. Perhaps in her zealousness, and in our own zealousness to find and punish terrorists, we lost ourselves along the way. Now as this difficult time comes to a close, we should perhaps sit down and take a moment, as Maya does in the film, to think about what we have done over the last decade and reflect on what we lost, and more importantly reflect on where we go from here.",10.0,Anonymous,History
torture is just another form of terrorism,"(1/10/13, one star) Kathryn Bigelow and her new movie Zero Dark Thirty deserve our universal contempt and condemnation for condoning torture. Bigelow revisits the darkest chapter in U.S. history (U.S. torture in the Middle East in the aftermath of 9/11) and dwells on it, not to condemn the actions of U.S. leaders who authorized this campaign of state terror against Muslim prisoners but rather to vindicate the torturers and justify the savagery that earned the undying enmity of millions of Arabs. Bigelow is too crafty to explicitly hold up criminals as heroes worthy of veneration but instead constructs a superficial veneer of faux-journalistic neutrality that will fool only the most gullible along with those anxious to buy into the dangerous delusion she is peddling. She dedicates large segments of her movie to portraying U.S. torturers as selfless patriots and their victims as homicidal maniacs, but not one minute to explaining why they attack us. Of course, we can't have Americans wondering what our government had been doing to make Muslims hate us so much. And with 9/11 our national descent into deceit, denial and self-delusion began, with no end in sight yet. According to the official myth still being perpetuated by our government and unconscionable propagandists like Bigelow, Muslim radicals are never rational actors but rather just crazed fanatics, to be tortured and destroyed like mad dogs. And now Bigelow compounds this ongoing national folly with the resurrection of its corollary Big Lie: torture of detainees is compatible with democracy, even necessary to protect it.Torture is just another form of terrorism. When the state tortures detainees, it is state terrorism, directed ultimately against all humanity as well as against individual detainees. Torturers degrade and dehumanize themselves, their victims, and any society that tolerates their crimes. How can anyone claim victory over terrorism when they employ it themselves? Besides, torturers (most famously, the Nazi and Communist regimes in Germany and Russia) have always rationalized torture on grounds of public security, but have always ultimately used torture as a weapon to terrorize the public and crush political opposition. (Do we really want to emulate the Nazis and Communists?) In the long run, torturers are a more pernicious threat to both our security and our liberty than any Al Qaeda agent could ever hope to be.Senator McCain is right when he says that Zero Dark Thirty gives our enemies powerful ammunition to use against us, especially if it garners awards. Audiences around the world will see the movie as confirmation that the horrors of Abu Ghraib reflect the real soul of America.",,Anonymous,History
The Hollywood Hype Machine Strikes Again,"I am a big fan of several Kathryn Bigelow-directed movies including The Hurt Locker and Blue Steel. Zero Dark Thirty was a let-down. Clearly the Hollywood Hype Machine strikes again. After watching this movie I cannot for the life of me fathom how it could be considered for movie of the year. There is very little suspense and the characters were very one dimensional. Alternatively, The Hurt Locker literally had me on the edge of my seat but Zero Dark Thirty seemed unnecessarily long and slow to develop. Seeing Lincoln and Zero Dark Thirty in the same week I have to say that Lincoln was a far superior movie and is definitely worthy of movie of the year. Zero Dark Thirty is not a bad movie but it is no The Hurt Locker and it is far from Oscar-worthy.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Jessica Chastain in Command ! ! !,"Do not get me wrong, the movie is not that good when you get the lovely, energetic, fascinating and brutally honest portrayal of Chastain's CIA agent Maya out of the picture.It would've still be solid, controversial and updated with events, but the X-particle would have been missing.That's what the actress brought to the movie.The cast is fine-a solid, convincing ensemble, that did their respective jobs very well.I can see why people like Mark Strong and James Gandolfini got some roles in the movie.It's always good to work with a so-called red-hot director at the helm of her so-called favourite turf- war movies.Their cameos, especially Gandolfini's (because Mark Strong was under the spotlights for a little longer) made a refreshing break from the main tone of the movie midway through it, at the moment we needed something different the most.Overall, the cast was an improvement over Bigelow's last effort in the genre.With ""The Locker"" i wasn't impressed at all, i was actually on the other end of emotions-i did not understand what all the people saw in it.Overlong and flat, you' be left wondering why so many strange sequences occurred in the movie.And if you are still awake, that is.But Bigelow has improved in those few years.She has a better eye for the cinematic, her cast is stronger, she changes paste effortlessly and now has a sense of jumping in one scene after another almost flawlessly.Those things, in my humble opinion, were not that visible in ""The Locker"" as mostly critics screamed they were.But the movie ended being the biggest Oscar contender and winner without being the best movie that same year, so what do i know.The only department ""The Locker"" still overshadows ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is the tension.No that it wasn't evident here, but more than enough was provided by Bigelow in her last effort.Well, frankly, the nature of the movie was different and couldn't have hurt it.So, with all that being said, with the beautiful performance by Chastain, who is becoming a real power on the horizon with every single movie she takes, with a haunting performance from Reda Kateb's Ammar in the beginning, where one might feel heartbroken for the guy, what's the problem with the movie, You might ask.The script!This thing that has been nominated out of sheer patriotism is worth nothing.Some of the lines Boal wrote were sheer ridiculousness at it's finest.No one screams words like ""motherfucker"" in the CIA director's face at a high-level terrorist-related meeting, even if there is no profane context hidden behind it and even if the CIA boss's role has been handled by the almighty Tony Soprano.Jessica Chastain was actually so good and mesmerizing throughout the course of the movie, that she handled this particular scene with calm and confidence.She was the one screaming it, if it is not yet crystal-clear.And she's been forgiven, she's not to blame at all.Continuing with Boal's outrageous screen writing we find ourselves in the middle of a mission, where the SEALs (who behaved like total children throughout their limited number of scenes, shame on you, Edgerton, i'm looking at you, because one would expect this from Chris Pratt) enter a suspect's house and begin to quietly repeat every single inhabitant's name until, like rabbits, they all come out and they all get shot.A totally unneeded and distracting scene, which took off a lot from the sheer brilliancy and tension off the last sequence of the movie.And even if there were some documented evidence speaking that it was all true, i don't believe that a clever off-the-grid person will be so stupid to get out and check who is calling him by name in the middle of a SEALs mission in his home.I repeat, even if it were true, for the sake of the film itself, leave it out, do not go there!!That's why i think the final act was less suspenseful than Bigelow's last warfare effort.Besides the fact we all now how it ends, of course.And, once again, thank God Jessica Chastain is around to save the day and bring some humanity and emotion to the movie.:But what the heck, let's give a 100/100 to the movie, because we love America"".That's the reception right now, as it was with ""Argo""...and once again, thank the cinematic Gods for Jessica Chastain's true, emotional, fascinating, electrifying performance!!At the very end she showed that even in a job well done and even in the years spend doing nothing but this particular job, there is no consolation, there are no smiles, nor happiness.Only a 12-years long hole of emptiness that's being left there.Like a homecoming soldier, who still lives with his brothers in arms, Jessica Chastain's Maya-has a tough way ahead of her.A way filled with new strives and challenges, dreams even.But a long and tough way back to ordinary life, life as it was.This sense of nostalgia is brought in absolutely uncompromising way to the screen by Chastain.The movie itself would have been a 6/10 without Chastain to say the least, with Boal it falls even steeper, but this new actress (by Hollywood laws that is), makes this whole ride unforgettable in the coming awards-season.Two thumbs up for a lovely Chastain and hopefully an Oscar this time around!!My rate:9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History

The bin Laden Identity,"Zero Dark Thirty will appeal to fans of action movies, and the fact that it is based on true events should complement that appeal. It's an odd- duck movie in that the ending is never in doubt; only the path to the goal. The hunt for the most notorious terrorist of them all, Osama bin Laden, occurs over a ten-year period from the point of view of the Americans and, chiefly, the CIA operative running the operation. It is very compelling, riveting stuff. However, I don't feel that it is a great film; despite a remarkable performance by Jessica Chastain and solid camera work, the movie comes off at its worst as over-the-top jingoism masquerading as patriotism, making America look great to those who wave their arms at how Number One the good ol' USA is, the best of the best, and making America look terrible, perhaps, to those who are not American.The movie is unflinching in its depiction of violent methods, but we should get one thing clear right away: it's a work of fiction based on true events. Just because something occurs in this film does not mean it happened in real life.The film is difficult to watch for a couple of main reasons. For one, there is audio of phone calls from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, and those alone may raise your hackles. Then there is the use of waterboarding and other forms of torture, and knowing that this sort of thing did go on after 2001 makes for some harrowing viewing.Here's an interesting comparison for you. Adolph Hitler was a genocidal maniac. When the war was closing in on him, he took his own life, thus depriving his enemies the same satisfaction. Bin Laden, however, did not; he continued to operate remotely, unseen except by the occasional video to al-Jazeera. His mere presence kept people angry, demanding action. Whereas Hitler's death definitively ended WW II, bin Laden's survival began a new one. What if bin Laden, who had been cooped up in the caves in Tora Bora, had killed himself? No war, perhaps, and no real satisfaction on the part of America and its comrades.Maya (Chastain) is a neophyte operative when she begins the search for bin Laden. She needs to fight bureaucracy and lack of good leads; she travels from Langley (CIA headquarters) to Yemen to Pakistan to Afghanistan and on and on, surviving only on her zeal to capture the fugitive. We're never really told why this all means so much to her, after a decade of work. Is it personal, or is just for the sake of country? Somehow, if it is the latter, one gets the feeling that move has been played out in so many other movies - we must get our man. But perhaps her motivation is immaterial. Since we know so little about our main character - just that she is a loner with apparently no friends or family - the main thread is simply Finding bin Laden. Simple and to the point.So. If we remove the relative recency of 9/11/2001 from the equation, this is simply another action movie. Lots of explosions, Navy SEALS, blood and guts, political intrigue, and so on. But we can't remove that from the equation, can we? Many of us were alive and kicking in 2001 and remember this all too well, so it's a little different from watching an old Hollywood movie about the Second World War.It is implied, very subtly, that information gleaned from detainees leads, obliquely, to the capture of bin Laden, but this was never the case. People say all kinds of crazy things under extreme duress. Again, I stress that this is fictitious based on true events; liberties have understandably been taken with plot elements.As I was leaving the theater, I had some questions to face: Did I see what I expected? Well, I knew the ending, so yes, I suppose I did. But was it truly a great movie? I don't think so, no. I think it glorified - to the consternation of the US government itself - many aspects of our operations overseas that we'd rather not have glorified. The movie made us look great to the win-at-all-costs populace and look worse in the eyes of the international community. And, to be clear, this isn't a political statement, this review: President Bush is hardly mentioned, and when President Obama is shown on screen, he's declaring that America does not torture - while a room of CIA operatives who do just that watch, idly.Zero Dark Thirty is a good film. Kathryn Bigelow's earlier The Hurt Locker was much more entertaining and better crafted; this one is not as well directed, as it feels like a cookie-cutter action/political thriller with a dash of topicality thrown in for spice.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Tremendous – gripping and thrilling!,"Short-n-sweet because this movie  was AWESOME, and I don't want to ruin anything for you!!!!! Kudos to any movie that does not Hollywood-ize a true topic – ZDT does exactly that and perhaps better than any other true-life story made to date.Do not get caught up in some of these reviews that claim 'torture scenes' will turn your stomach, or that the first part of the movie is slow and boring – I found the first hour of this movie to be extremely well done and absolutely necessary to establish what the CIA went through to find OBL.There are many scenes in this movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat and startle you, but do not expect to see over-the-top writing or easy-n-cheap one-liners that most directors would have thrown in the movie to draw attention to themselves – again, this is NOT a pro-Hollywood movie. Which is probably why Kathryn Bigelow was sniped of any Oscar best-director possibility.The depiction of the raid which kills OBL is one of the best/realistic scenes every filmed. I was very pleased with the length of this film and the attention to detail. Despite some reviewers who claim human sentiment is missing or that the characters are shallow – don't believe a word of it. This entire film is overflowing with emotions and the story lines of these characters are spectacular – don't forget for a minute that these are CIA operatives, whose job it is to find and kill OBL.Well done Kathryn Bigelow, VERY well done!",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Intriguing, but lifeless","When the Oscar nominations were announced, many felt that the exclusion of Kathryn Bigelow, Academy Award-winning director of The Hurt Locker, was a particularly large snub. Having now seen Zero Dark Thirty, Bigelow being nominated would have been a pretty drastic misstep on the part of the Academy. While it certainly isn't a bad film, Zero Dark Thirty isn't necessarily a great one either, which is a disappointment from this director coming off of an incredible job on The Hurt Locker. The fact that the film is topping many ""best of 2012"" lists is equally baffling. Despite the even pacing, some great production design, and a phenomenal performance by Jessica Chastain, ""the greatest manhunt in history"" ends up being little more than a whimper when it should really, really be a bang.Starring as CIA agent Maya, Jessica Chastain absolutely commands on-screen, leading the manhunt to capture public enemy # 1, Osama bin Laden, beginning in 2003 up to his eventual capture and killing in 2011. Make no mistake, despite some really interesting casting choices (wonderful to see Mark Duplass in a supporting role), this movie belongs 100% to Chastain. She owns every second of screen time that she gets in this film, her performance quiet, strong, and dedicated, her mind set ultimately on one goal: finding bin Laden. Her performance is subdued and restrained outside of the few moments that it need not be, and in all of them she shines.Sadly, however, Chastain's performance is the only thing about Zero Dark Thirty that is subdued. Based on true events, far too many elements of the film seem to be just a touch too dramatized, to the point where they become detrimental to the film. The multiple torture sequences become difficult to watch after a time, and too many scenes of following and tracking and analyzing seem to go on for a bit too long. Perhaps this was Bigelow's intention, to infuse the audience with the same kind of despair and hopelessness that Maya had felt about the mission to find bin Laden, and to express that it was about much more than the final action-packed raid on the compound. This is lost in the translation, however, and despite the film's even pace, it really just seemed to... keep going on and on. Don't mistake this, however, for a cry for more action- the film doesn't have much, and doesn't need or want for more. It is the failure on Bigelow's part to keep the interest, the tension, and the intrigue going through the runtime that is, ultimately, the film's weakest point.This film did not need to be 2-1/2 hours long, and it feels like it's every bit that long and then some. It wasn't exciting, thrilling, or engaging; it is stuffy, over-long, bureaucratic, and boring. It was all very interesting to watch, of course, and it has glimmers of greatness within it, but too much of the film is spent watching characters stand around, look around, or wander around. Again, this could've been intentional, but if it was, it begs the question: ""Why?"" The film is so well-shot, its production design, sets, costumes, and atmosphere so masterfully realized, that it is criminal that this environment doesn't yield anything that, in the end, is really worth watching. The nuts and bolts of the hunt for bin Laden are so complex and wide-sweeping and Bigelow does a good job of exploring this macrocosm in detail. Why isn't it more interesting to actually watch it? In this light, it isn't difficult to see why Kathryn Bigelow wasn't nominated. The bigger mystery for Oscar devotees might be how on Earth this film was nominated for best picture in the first place because it certainly isn't, and it more than certainly shouldn't win. Outside of Maya, all of its characters exist only on the periphery of her mission to find bin Laden; the audience learns nothing about any of them, and most of them are flat and one-dimensional. Living, breathing characters drive the narrative of any good story, and this film suffers for lack of them. Having directed The Hurt Locker, Bigelow and screenwriter/producer Mark Boal are no stranger to this, so it is all the more surprising to see them fall so drastically short. Maya, as she is written, isn't a very compelling character either- it is Chastain's effortless performance that elevates her to something more, but without her it'd be hard to find anything very redeemable about the film at all.In spite of all of this, however, the film is not a bad film, and is certainly not a poorly made film. Rather, it just seems that Bigelow chose an odd direction to tell her story, and it just isn't very entertaining to watch. Its marketing is strangely telling of the misshapen structure of the narrative; few trailers for films are so off-putting and boring as is the feature trailer for Zero Dark Thirty. It doesn't even look like a film someone would want to go see. Everything rests on the premise that this film depicts the capture and death of Osama bin Laden, but it lacks any sort of substance, tension, or depth. When the audience already knows the ending, the purpose of the film then should be to make the journey to that destination something engaging and intriguing- Zero Dark Thirty, however, seems to be looking at its watch, wondering when it will ever get around to it.Check out my profile for links to other reviews!",6.0,Anonymous,History

"If You Need A Synonym Of What You Believe What Happened, Watch 0 Dark 30","The first half is boring, heavy on writing and full of torture as you might have heard. It is full of technicalities which might be pretty hard to perceive. But Jessica Chastain is mind-blowing and real in this pompous, predictable and easy thriller. The first half deals with more of details and is a precise stuff of how it all started since 9/11 to 2010.Coming to the second half is where you move your head closer to the screen. Of what I have heard and watched over 2011 & 2012 in Reuters, BBC, TOI, NatGeo - if you add them up - you get ZDT. It is not action packed as it states but surely is a thriller. Music is typicality, and this is not much of a absolute 'The Hurt Locker' type film-making. Kathryn disappoints a lil bit because the astronomical expectations were not answered well.The problem with ZDT is that you know what will happen and that oozes 50% of the fun of it. But, still the intricacy and accuracy of this movie (as they say) is worth appreciable. The remaining cast is par excellence and the people who worked as Seal team need a couple of claps.What I liked about the movie is secrecy that they do not show the minutiae of how, why and when about the operation. One minute you see them in the Langley room/White House and the next second you see two ""canaries."" Second thing is the Quentin Tarantino type narration with titles for scene like ""Human Error""! I felt it is pretty awesome.Overall experience after watching ZDT is ridiculously average and non-zealous compared to the SEAL TEAM 6: The Raid On Osama bin Laden which released in the 2012 beginning by NatGeo or The Hurt Locker or any similar kinds. But it is recommendable, although I cannot guarantee the enjoyment. As cinema, ZDT fails down and under.

Morally ambivalent product from a lazy director,"Kathryn Bigelow who made history by becoming the first woman director to win an Oscar (""The Hurt Locker"") continues her tryst with 9/11 and its aftermath with her latest creation - Zero Dark Thirty.ZDT like its predecessor, ""The Hurt Locker"", chronicles the polarization of the world from an American standpoint. To the credit of the director, she manages to build in a fair amount of suspense and edge of the seat thrills as the hunt for Osama Bin Laden reaches its crescendo, despite the end result being known to the viewer.The other high light of the movie is the portrayal of Maya, the lead CIA operative by upcoming actress Jessica Chastain. Its rare to see a mainstream Hollywood movie where the lead female actor is shown as cold, bull headed, steely, self centered and socially inept. Chastain pulls it off remarkably well. What a transformation it has been for the classically beautiful actress from playing vulnerable, quiet, mother of two in ""The Tree of Life"" or from playing the air headed, rich, bored housewife who wants to desperately hire a house maid and impress her husband in ""The Help"". Slowly but surely, Chastain is building up a formidable oeuvre of work. No wonder she is bookies favorite to pick up the Best Actress Oscar this year.On the acting front, an honorable mention must be made of James Gandolfini's robust, business like and heavy duty cameo of CIA Chief, Leon Panetta.Beyond these odd exceptions, the cupboard of ZDT is starkly bare. Is this movie pro/anti war? Is the movie pro/anti Jihad? Is this movie pro/anti prison torture? No one can tell. Director Bigelow takes a convenient and morally ambivalent stand on all these issues. Why is Maya so single-mindedly obsessed about hunting down OBL? What drives her to shun friends, social life and risk her own life and limbs to be devoted to the cause? Once again no one can tell. Bigelow does a shoddy job of fleshing out Maya and other characters. Also for Bigelow, the age old American policy of fostering trouble in Middle East and the resultant rise of militancy in those regions is not something to be bothered with in the narrative. Even a TV series like ""Homeland"" is more comprehensive in its reach and coverage there.In summary, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a movie bogged down by a weak script, stuffed with process and operational details and helmed by a lazy director, ultimately winding up in the graveyard of many forgettable films on the topic of Islamic terrorism.I am going with 2.5 stars on 5.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Slow, propaganda but entertaining.","Well, here's my review for Zero Dark Thirty:The Bad: This movie has a main issue. It's too long. Almost 2 hours and a half is too much to bear if you don't watch it in two separate parts. This is increased by the fact that the first part is too slow and for some, harsh. The action packed part comes almost in the last hour. I can't say what because i'll be flagged for spoilers, but it is stupid to talk of spoilers when this movie is based on an well-known and widespread operation. So, if you understood me: THE operation is great. THE research is slow and boring. Get it? Although not a Michael Moore movie, it does contain some propaganda. Long story short: with Bush, you torture but you're effective. With Obama, you maintain human rights, but are not effective. Yet, this is an interesting question for the viewer. Which is most important?The Good: That reflection I was talking about. The final action packed of the movie makes the whole of it. You are able to understand better a confusing operation, and answer some questions like: Why was OBL killed rather than taken to court?Final Ruling: Try to watch the movie in to separate parts. Although an Academy Award Nominee, certainly not a movie that deserves the Oscar. You'll enjoy it, just, try not to give up with the slowness of the first part of the movie. 6 Stars is fair enough.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Superb film-making,"The title is never explained, but it is military jargon for 30 minutes after midnight, the time that the raid on the Abbottabad compound was launched, and apparently it refers also to the darkness and secrecy that cloaked the entire decade-long mission to capture or kill al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden (or ""USB"" as he is referred to sometimes in the movie). The film reunites the winning team of director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal, who were responsible for the brilliant ""The Hurt Locker"", and who have now produced a stunning piece of work.When bin Laden was eliminated by SEAL Team Six on 2 May 2011, it was obvious that there would soon be a film about the exploit, but few would have guessed that the director would be a woman, the lead character would also be a woman, the focus would be on the intelligence-gathering operation rather than the military planning of the raid, and the whole thing would be so lacking in machismo and so non-triumphalist. All these unexpected features, plus outstanding acting, brilliant cinematography and superb sound, make this a superlative exercise in film-making.The narrative is in the form of a triptych: a deeply disturbing set of interrogations involving torture, a painstaking and obsessive pursuit of intelligence links to the courier, and then the audacious raid into Pakistani territory under the noses of the country's equivalent to West Point (depicted in almost real time). Linking the three segments is Maya, the female CIA analyst on whom we have no background information, played by Jesica Chastain who confirms her status as one of the finest actresses of her generation.In this long, but gripping, film, only one scene did not work for me: when a CIA chief lambasts his team for failing to find their man. This scene apart, the whole movie is utterly absorbing in its authentic presentation. There are clearly conflations and mistakes in the telling of this true story, but it is clear that Bigelow and Boal have had access to people who know a lot about this unique operation and have helped the creation of a work of great verisimilitude and power.",,Anonymous,History

Kathryn has a crush on somebody important in the US,"Hollywood has been fooling the American & Allies' people into wars for so long now. It makes wars look easy, puposeful & glorious to its people. ZDT makes people believe that the enemy can be so easily tortured and is easy to win against. I hope somebody in US soon makes a truly real and unbiased war film. Then perhaps American people will go against being fooled so easily.And Katheryne Bigelow definitely has a crush on an Oil Corporation guy or a Federal banker or a politician. I wish she was as much cinematically creative as she politically is.Neither I'm surprised to see the Metacritics rating it 9.5 and nor for it & Argo being over recognized through awards & nominations.

Ten Years in the Making,"So we'll get this out of the way now so we don't have any miscommunication. If you still firmly believe that 9/11 was 100% the work of the US government, as in they set charges in the towers, they killed everyone on United 93, then don't watch this film because this is not for you.Now to the film. Much like The Hurt Locker, it was an excellent film with great acting writing and directing. But before we go into the film and it's positives and negatives (and it's lacking of them), let's close our eyes and take a ride down memory lane (Please picture this as rough as it was). 11 years ago, our nation was changed forever by deliberate and disgusting attacks that not only put an unfair stereotypes to Muslim's everywhere, but it also killed about 3,000 people around the time a normal person becomes productive at work (10:28 A.M. to be exact). People jumped to their deaths, people lost family, friends and people were taken from this world way to soon. Now open your eyes and watch the film knowing that you know the ending without even seeing the film (if you don't you're an idiot).Ms. Bigelow does a great job introducing us into the film without any visuals and it allowed you vision the things yourself. Something anyone could consider chilling, which shows her skill as a director to bring the audience in. Then the hunt begins, as the film progresses through our hunt. She reminds us on why America keep hunting and the attacks in between 9/11 and the day of justice. Along with that, she, with the help of a solid script by Mark Boal, showed the politics and the pain that was getting the plans in motion. With that we get to know the people who helped make it happen. We meet Maya, who is played wonderfully by Jessica Chasatain, who if in another world, would be a great as a homicide detective. We see her changed as time progressed. Along with her is great performances by a solid supporting cast. Jason Clarke plays a great CIA agent who has his fair share of great moments as he mentors her in the ways of hunting terrorists in the good ways and the bad. Jennifer Ehle does a great job as her closest friend in the agency. Plus with good brief performances by Tony Soprano, Michael from Lost, Mark Strong, Edgar Ramirez and even Mark Duplass from FX's The League. Not a lot was wrong with it, even the interrogation techniques and the politics that made you either uncomfortable or angry or both. But what makes this film great isn't the story itself, but the feeling of it.Bigelow doesn't make this film anything more then what it its, a honest portrayal of history. It isn't a right wing rah rah piece of American propaganda nor is it a left wing Michael Moore selfish anti-government video that was made just to make money (even though it was made for that reason, anyway). She wants us to feel what those people felt and it worked like a charm. You couldn't feel happy, you couldn't feel sad, which brings up the final part of this review.No matter what kind of film or thing that is done regarding 9/11, it can't bring back the lives lost that day or after that day. So the best thing we can do is learn from past mistakes (mistakes that continue throughout the film a.k.a politics) and learn from them and bring everyone responsible to justice whether it's in court or Seal Team Six style. That's what Bigelow expressed in a great way, she showed how far we went to get to the prize and what prices we paid to make it happen. The only flaw was that the film was predictable but then again we all knew the story when we went in, we just wanted details.For those who were uncomfortable with the content. Yes, this film shows torture at it's finest and respectably, much like Django, it will make people uncomfortable. Like Django, you got to keep it in perspective, remember what happened on 9/11 and every attack after that. Is it wrong, maybe (personally I didn't have a problem with it but then again I'm not everyone), but was it the right thing given the circumstances and knowing what's at stake. Hell Yeah. On that note enjoy the film and let's not forget what was lost and what it takes to bring justice to those who want to kill our friends and family. If you remember that you'll understand it.Bonus Points: Seal Team Six performers were solid as well, particularly Chris Pratt from Moneyball, that man has a future to say the least.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Zero Dark is Slow and Steady,"My first inclination watching this movie was to tell people to wait for it to come out on DVD or play on TV. But I did go ahead and write a full review so here goes...If I would have left the theater in the first hour and then written this review, I would tell you to skip the movie. Seriously. For the first 50 minutes, take a cat nap. I literally did for about 5 minutes and didn't miss a thing. Save a couple of mild, yet still uncomfortable, torture....excuse me, ""information extraction"" scenes, the first almost hour of this movie is a snooze. We don't even get any character development until after that first hour.The rest of the movie though reveals why that painfully slow build-up was beneficial. The movie does pick up but keep in mind that this movie will not be a flashy, violent thunderstorm. It's supposed allure is that it's a slow and steady, long (2 hrs 37 mins long to be exact) rain storm. The last hour was unexpectedly gripping (compared to the beginning at least) and you're left feeling satisfied, now understanding the pace and heaviness. If you believe the Osama Bin Laden (referred to as UBL for Usama Bin Laden) search and destroy story in the first place, it's a fascinating look at what really went into finding him. If you're skeptical, which I think is healthy, it's still an interesting look at what tactics our great U S of A uses and how terrorist cells often work. There are quite a few unrealistic elements about CIA operations thrown in though. Sometimes I found myself wondering, ""Really? THAT'S what they want us to believe the CIA would do?""A little caveat for you, war itself is not pretty. But this isn't the bloody, front lines side of war (though there's quite a bit of blood in the final scenes). This is the CIA side of war, the counter- terrorism side (whom some may argue is ALSO terrorism, but I won't get into all of that). It's uncomfortable to watch a human being purposefully hurt or slowly physically destroyed, no matter for what reason, even though the scenes shown (all within the first hour) were VERY mild, IMO, compared to what's probably really going on in those concrete rooms. I used utilitarianism to justify it in my mind. But if the visual of the aforementioned will bother you, do not go see this movie. If you can get through that first hour, there's no more after that. The rest of the movie is pretty much the wild goose chase to find UBL. And again, I mean ""wild"" only figuratively because this is a subdued movie.So in conclusion, be PATIENT with this one, do not expect a purely factual documentary, take on the heaviness and seriousness of the actors (particularly the lead actress Jessica Chastain, who did a great job conveying the weight of this world on her shoulders), and you will leave satisfied.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"""If you lie to me, I'm gonna hurt you""","Easily one of my favorite films of 2012 as well as my favorite film from Director Kathryn Bigelow.The film depicts a gritty look at the manhunt for Osama bin Laden (OBL) how accurate this film is to actual events I do not know. But it's one of the best films on the subject that I've seen.Great cinematography, great, writing, a great score, and phenomenal performances from the entire cast. Particularly Jessica Chastain as Maya she was brilliant, how Chastain did not win an academy award for her role in this film is beyond me. There a lot of noteworthy actors in this film but the two standouts are Jessica Chastain and Jason Clarke. Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt are great here as well in there miniscule roles as SEAL team operators.Obviously though I cannot go through this review without mentioning the sequence of the raid on OBLs compound. This is definitely where the film shines the cinematography, the sound design, the visual affects. Everything comes together so well and it's absolutely beautiful on screen, especially in 4k Blu-ray.The tactics, the movements, the chatter or rather lack there of Kathryn Bigelow had the genius to let this entire sequence play out unencumbered by music. She truly let the moment have its due and it all looked and felt so real. As someone who has seen a lot of military action in film the intensity, and the thrill of this sequence is unrivaled in anything I've ever seen before. It was expertly shot and choreographed.This film and The Hurt Locker are two of my favorites from Kathryn Bigelow but I have to say for me this one takes the cake. It was a great watch and one I would recommend to fans of the drama, thriller genre.IMDb: 9/10

A great thriller and a thrilling history.,"""I'm gonna smoke everybody involved in this op, and then I'm going to kill bin Laden."" Maya (Jessica Chestain)It's challenging to think of a more wanted fugitive any time in history than Osama bin Laden. It's just as hard to think of a better thriller than Zero Dark Thirty (meaning military time, 12:30 a.m. when bin Laden was killed), Katherine Bigelow's docudrama about the decade-long search headed by the lone female CIA operative, Maya (Chastain). She tries desperately to convince the boys that she can find bin Laden by following his personal Al Qaida courier.The cool with which she amasses agent reports and fleshes out her hunch is as fascinating as the final segment where, in cinematic yet real detail, a chopper goes down but so does bin Laden. Yet her cool keeps us from knowing her in any depth, a drawback for me, who prefers fleshed out characters even in a docudrama. Then, we don't know much about anyone else in the film either.We do witness in the first third of the film some torture techniques scary to behold, including the use of water. And while it is argued that no substantial information was gleaned from these situations, Zero is, after all, a re-imagining, and the torture is instructive about warfare, regardless of where your politics come in.The last thirty minutes fulfill all expectations: Bigelow expertly shows, it would seem in real time, the Navy SEALs infiltrating the Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound. Killing women along the way to get to bin Laden is the collateral damage no one wants but must endure. Realism prevails.Certainly, the gets-you-to-talk factor is strong--strong for me especially with the distaff topic, the singularity of the female among a dominant male culture. In an inspired move, Bigelow and Boal (they won the Oscar for Hurt Locker) do not lard the film with male chauvinism; in fact I found only one reference to her not taking a lover in her assignments.Osama bin Laden is the only game Maya has played and the only one I wanted to see. I got what I wanted.",,Anonymous,History
"What it wants, is for you to savour the poignancy of the hunt. Outstanding.","Political controversies aside, Zero Dark Thirty is a thriller par excellence that grips you firmly and quietly by the neck. It is also the kind of film that demands focus from the outset. If you choose to give in--investing 157 minutes will pay off handsomely.At the center of Kathryn Bigelow's ninth feature is the manhunt on Osama Bin Laden, and the world knows he is dead. The film title is military speak for half past midnight--Osama's alleged time of death. Popular misconceptions will have you believe that knowing how a story ends works against it; but this film operates outside political and social repertory. What it wants, is for you to savour the poignancy of the hunt.Set two years after 9/11 attacks and told from a predator's (the US) perspective, it starts on the strength of CIA operative Dan (Jason Clarke). Stationed at a black site somewhere in Pakistan, he interrogates a detainee connected to Saudi terrorists using brazen techniques. At this point, you may be tempted to write the sequence off as propaganda by torture apologists, but don't be too quick--Dan is a red herring--a vehicle at best, for the sole intention of designing cause-effect to the outcome of Zero Dark Thirty's key narrative.New agent Maya (Jessica Chastain) is assigned to the team and Dan guides her transition in this highly elusive, volatile world. Like a cold and calculating chess-master, Maya quickly learns how to exploit variables of the game. She thrives on psychological warfare required of interrogators, yet cranks to the right rhythm necessary to benefit from a politically oriented trade. Throughout the chain of events leading up to Osama's death; Maya is often photographed behind barriers, suggesting the distance necessary for her to guard against and self-protect.This is when it occurred to me that something strange is happening to Bigelow as a director--she has emerged from The Hurt Locker with a style that is distinct, yet subtle. In the classical paradigm of historical-war films often infused with dramatic muscularity; Bigelow has forsaken traditional myths, and engineered a new kind of modern, masculine instinct.Zero Dark Thirty is set in the thick of a chase spanning ten years, but it moves fluidly with unknowable force--driving you forward into a riveting climax executed with precision and realistic memesis.Apart from a screenplay by Mark Boal that reveals masterful technique, film score by Alexandre Desplat (performed by London Symphony Orchestra) evokes the right emotional currents critical to this film. Its musical motifs parallel the aura surrounding Zero Dark Thirty's mysterious protagonist--melodies are sophisticated and stoic, with an undertone of sensuality.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",10.0,Anonymous,History
Just tell it how is okay pa?,"I just wanted to write this review mainly in lieu of all the bad reviews I just read. I'll give you the tl;dr (too long didn't read) version now - OMG some of the reviews here are hilariously bad, - movies are terrible vehicles for historical events, - and strangely enough; good movie.I like to read the reviews on IMDb in a voyeuristic oh what did everyone else think of it kinda way. Everyone's got a point but my issue is with people writing like they KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY CLEARLY DON'T. I sometimes want to hear the word of the man/woman on the street, but lets face it, the man/woman knows little about well.. directing.. the behind the scenes.. script writing.. well everything really. Most people writing/reviewing here are not professional critics or even budding critics in the making, they probably didn't study acting, drama, script writing or set design. They may not even know the director's name or anything about Italian cinema and there is a strong chance some of them thought Shrek 3 was OK. My point is I am interested in your opinion but please be honest! If you are not very smart and the amount of the color red in the film left you feeling queasy, great! But before you start judging the script, acting, or hair styling was, trying adding a constructive argument and even some cross referencing e.g. the hairstylist in Indiana Jones really captured the style of the times whereas in this piece of garbage etc.. It was bad because I didn't like it seems to be what Im getting from the negative reviews here. I enjoyed this statement very much, ""I don't think the writer knows how to correctly use the F-bomb and other variations"", it is not the writer of the film that needs to be worried about their writing dear fellow.I have strong reservations about historical movies because in essence they are false. Based on actual events does not mean real events. It annoys me greatly when I watch a movie or documentary and delve deeper into the subject only to find facts have been altered to serve the entertainment of the piece. Movies are a falsehood, a fabrication, but yet they can also contain deeper truths that plain facts and figures can never convey. In my opinion its a fine line to tread so I was not anticipating that a movie about the death of Osama Bin Laden could possibly be a good thing. I don't even 100 percent believe that half the truth of the entire situation regarding 9/11 is and ever will be presented, but that's just my dumb opinion right?So after saying all that I really enjoyed this film and was even quite moved by it, there is a very poignant and rather sad/theme statement about humanity that left a lasting impression on me. As a piece of art and entertainment the movie worked for me rather well. Now get back to typing your wonderfully well thought out reviews friends!",8.0,Anonymous,History

Odd mix of the serious and Hollywood action movie clichés. 75%,"""Zero dark thirty"" is quite a dry movie and its endgame looks like a fly-on-the-wall documentary. Presumably you are well aware of the resolution to this tale - the execution of Usama bin Laden - but are more interested in how his demise came about. In broad-brush strokes, this movie tells that story. One issue I had with this movie was just being baffled about who the terrorist suspects were...I feel that an actual documentary would just have a greater feeling of coherence as to how all the pieces of this 'jigsaw' puzzle fit together. Sometimes it wasn't even clear to me what was happening...as with that sequence where a Middle-Eastern looking man is fitted up with...something...and notices women (?) in full Muslim cover around him.Jessica Chastain stars as ""Maya"", a crucial C.I.A. operative in the hunt for U.B.L. At the start of the movie she comes across as being a work experience would be torturer or something and progresses to following the script on the strategy to get information from detainees. I'm not exactly sure what Maya's position title in the C.I.A. was, but she does appear to have more clout than her seniority would dictate.I am curious if many of the comments she makes actually happened. It's these moments of bravado or vulgarity which make this movie come across as some sort of Hollywood action movie...Maya's dialogue is along the lines of something you would expect Eddie Murphy to utter in ""Beverly Hills cop"" or Bruce Willis in ""Die hard"". They didn't really ring true to me. Fair enough if she actually said this, but hopefully these weren't inventions to make the movie function as a C.I.A. recruiting ad. Other times Maya looks like a sitcom character or a Little Princess having a hissy fit. I have in mind that part of the movie where Maya writes numbers ostentatiously in lipstick on her superior's window. Again, fair enough if this actually happened, but if not, it just seems a clumsy way to make Maya look ""sassy"" or...whatever.For a while I made a point of not reading reviews of this movie or articles which delved into it and the topic of torture. That was short lived. Before watching this movie I did read a couple of articles, one a review, I think, and one on the topic of torture. What I saw on the screen was not particularly horrific...I was perhaps expecting some stomach-churning gore as you might see (implied) on the TV drama ""24"", as practiced by the anti-terrorism agent Jack Bauer. There was nothing so bad as that...which is not to say that the torture you do see inflicted by the C.I.A. is not horrific if you imagined yourself being subject to it. It's just not horrific, in other words.From my own point of view, I think there is one issue which is relevant which the movie does not cover...all the times that torture was inflicted on people who were actually innocent. In the movie, the tortured were always guilty, so ""the end justifies the means"", one could argue. If we saw depicted horrific torture which was of no purpose, our views on the practice could be challenged.One of the articles that I read was ""Tortured justifications"" by Waleed Aly in The Age newspaper (07/02/2013?). His view was that since director Kathryn Bigelow got most of her information from the C.I.A., the movie is pretty much supports what they did. Before I had watched the movie, I did read Bigelow's article where she said depicting the torture in the movie was not condoning it. Years ago I watched a very interesting documentary called ""Operation Hollywood"" which outlined how movies which used U.S. military props or whathaveyou were subject to censorship by the U.S. military...in other words, they got to say how they were depicted...for instance, they insisted a story element from ""Lassie"" be removed...one which implied that the U.S. military might make defective products. The point of raising all this is just to suggest that I hope Bigelow isn't a C.I.A. dupe or apologist...the former charge being more serious, perhaps.In any case, the torture was not that big of an issue for me. And I had even less problems with the U.S. taking the action it did against U.B.L. without authorisation from the sovereign nation (Pakistan) where he had been 'hiding'.Points of interest:* I did find the actions of one C.I.A. woman in this movie incredibly stupid (naive at best), which had devastating consequences for U.S. citizens...the one where she does not follow strict protocol.* Was it necessary to shoot (kill?) U.B.L's wife? * I get the impression that a British actor played the role of a senior (government?) figure in this movie...and I wasn't convinced he was an American...I would have guessed it was the guy from ""The thick of it"" who swears a lot (I've not seen that series though)...but looks like I'm wrong on that.* Usama bin Laden is referred to as ""UBL"" by the Americans...I had read somewhere that the U.S. made a point of spelling his name ""Osama"" as they didn't like the fact that he had ""USA"" in his name (i.e. ""Usama""). So, it's interesting that they call him ""UBL"" for that reason. Calling him ""Osama"" in general thus seems like a propaganda move.* Surprised to see two Australians in this movie...the Edgerton brothers.Personally, I would really like to see a movie or documentary concerning the events following 11/09/2001...the fact that the president of the U.S. (George W. Bush) ignored all evidence of Saudi Arabian involvement (the Bush family had lucrative relationships with Saudi royalty, I think, who were implicated in the attacks on U.S. soil in 2001. He also waged war on a nation not involved in those attacks on U.S. soil...as a useful diversion since Saudi Arabia was implicated?",7.0,Anonymous,History
A very slow movie,"This film is about a female CIA officer, who tirelessly pursue all leads for years to find Osama bin Laden.""Zero Dark Thirty"" is supposed to be a war and action film, but the pacing is so slow. You see every detail that happen, such as putting video tapes into bags for a minute and then taking these tapes out and stacking them on tables. Such unnecessary actions are shown throughout the film, which makes the pacing ultra slow. Scenes drag on and on, and most scenes are much longer than necessary to portray what is happening.

"""Zero Dark Thirty"" is no zero of a movie!","I am about to embark on the biggest punhunt in the history of my corny pun-induced movie reviews. And I am also on a mission to hunt down men and women to witness the mastery of ""Zero Dark Thirty"". OK, I am sorry to scare you away, and I am also sorry that I bombed with that opening of my movie review of the spectacular ""Zero Dark Thirty"". Director Kathryn Bigelow's movie about the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden is about as gripping as it gets in watching a motion picture. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" stars Jessica Chastain as Maya, a CIA Agent who had an integral role in finding the Pakistani three-story home where Osama Bin Laden hid and where he was eventually killed by the U.S. Navy Seal Team Six. The Maya character is based on a real female CIA Agent who was the secret-operative defining force in finding Bin Laden. The movie opens with no images but of audio recordings of 911 calls from people in the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001; the day that changed our world forever. And then it jumps two years later at an undisclosed Detainee Prison where supposedly CIA Agents used torture techniques as waterboarding to Islamic terrorist detainees to force them to divulge information. The information from the detainees was the watershed or should I say waterboard moment that spurred up the eventual finding of Osama Bin Laden years later; but obviously this did not happen abruptly. It was a rigorous and challenging process that is captured authentically by the great directorial hand of Oscar-winning Director Kathryn Bigelow. Remind me again why she was not nominated for a Best Director Oscar for her exemplary orchestration of ""Zero Dark Thirty"". Talk about terror! The Academy sure slipped big time with that omission. The last 30 minutes of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" in depicting the Navy Seals raid and the killing of Bin Laden was a thing of cinematic beauty. Mark Boal's compelling screenplay of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" was a bowl of sharp and cerebral dialogue that accentuated the heroism of Maya. Chastain's performance is the best I have seen by any actor or actress in 2012. In fact, it is one of the best (if not the best) I have seen by any leading actress in motion picture history. Chastain brilliantly captures a woman's determination to accomplish a challenging mission. The supporting cast of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" earned their medals of thespian excellence like Chastain. Jason Clarke's performance as CIA Agent Dan, who ran the Detainee Camp, is not torturous to watch at all and it should have merited a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Kyle Chandler shined under the ""Zero Dark Thirty"" lights as Joseph Bradley, who led the CIA Delegation in Pakistan. Jennifer Ehle was a revelation as CIA Agent Jessica who also befriends Maya. Mark Strong's brawny performance as CIA Administrator George added to his strong thespian resume. And James Gandolfini was a hit as the CIA Director. Now I am going to hunt down a few more deserving accolades for ""Zero Dark Thirty"" in the technical department; those would be Greig Frasier's stunning cinematography, William Goldenberg & Dylan Tichenor's perfect editing, and Jeremy Hindle's astonishing art direction. I also have to score one more, that would be Alexander Desplat's mesmeric score. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is the best movie of the year, and please don't raid in my parade by disagreeing with me.

That is not to say her direction is lacking here, it is interesting and unique and more importantly does not dwell on one aspect, particularly in scenes following troops in action.Jessica Chastain leads the acting performances alongside a brilliant Jason Clarke. There are also very enjoyable cameos from Stephen Dillane and James Gandolfini. Overall the support cast is of the highest order, and for me both Mark Strong and Kyle Chandler play traditionally awkward, dull government roles very artistically indeed.Highly thrilling, intelligent and at times emotional, Zero Dark Thirty confirms film's very healthy engagement with post 9/11 related war material.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Zero Dark Thirty simple review.,"Zero Dark Thirty, thank you for introducing me to Jessica Chastain. She is not only a great actress but in the movie she is perfect for the part. Emphatic and grasping. She is also beautiful. Most of the other movies on the list you could buy the DVD, with this one I was unable to take my eyes off of the screen. I had to urinate so badly after the film ended. Not because of my excessive water drinking but because the movie took hold me of so well I couldn't stop it, couldn't take a break. The assassination of Osama Bin Laden wasn't the best part of the movie although it was a fantastic edition. The raid on the house was a great scene to finish the movie with. Afterward toward the ending moments of the movie you can feel the emotion running through your veins, the same emotion that Jessica Chastain displays. The beginning of the movie is a little bit slow as the first scene lasts for what seems 20-30 minutes. But it is only slow because you are not introduced to the characters or the setting, you are thrown into the plot automatically. Although I didn't take much of a liking to it at first I do feel that Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal aimed to do this. Telling you that the movie is unconventional and (slightly loosely) based on the true story. Though i didn't like the beginning of the film at first, thinking of it now i don't think that i or anyone else could think of a better way to start it. Kathryn Bigelow is creating a better name for herself then her ex- husband. First ""The Hurt Locker"" and it's Oscar achievements, then ""Zero Dark Thirty"" which could've easily won multiple Oscars any other year. Just watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Film making at it's best,"The hunt for Osama bin Laden is told through a heart stopping, adrenaline filled tale that show's just what a genius film maker Kathryn Bigelow. The story follow's CIA operative Maya hunt to find Osama bin Laden. Following the plot through ten year's it show's just what a mammoth task the hunt for bin Laden was.Jessica Chastian is brilliant as the CIA agent who is completely committed to the cause. It's harrowing performance that is certainly Oscar worthy. The supporting cast of Mark Strong, Kyle Chandler and Jason Clarke are all brilliant and show just how difficult personally the hunt was on them, with the screen time that they are given. All of the cast do this in such way without having any character development or back-story. Which is great to see. As with such films the flaw can be the back-story that as an audience we don't really care about. Bigelow get's straight to the point. That this is about the hunt for bin Laden and nothing more.Controversy has surrounded Zero Dark Thirty about the way torture is depicted. Most namely that it is depicted in a positive way. This is certainly an stupid statement. That any one who has watched the film that I know completely disagreed with that statement. The film is certainly not saying that. From the get go you certainly know that it is not glamorizing at all torture.This is high octane thriller that finishes off with some of the tensest last 20 minuets you will ever see. Considering you know the end of the story you are completely on the edge of you're seat all the way through the sequence leading to a great ending.Written, shot and edited in a period of 18 months. This is filming making at it's best. From the start you are completely enthralled leading up to a completely satisfying end. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Zero out of Thirty,"High expectations are understandable, given Kathryn Bigelow's dramatic (and deserved) Academy Awards success for The Hurt Locker (2008) and given Jessica Chastain's equally deserved nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in The Help (2011).What The Hurt Locker (THL) did achieve, Zero Dark Thirty (ZDT) failed to. Emotions were high in THL, it was tense, thrilling and there were pulsating moments that captured beautifully the role of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team. Much of this had been shown before but Bigelow was able to unlock the human element and add much more emotion. ZDT fails to do this, resulting in a rushed documentary-like picture where no bond between audience and character is formed; where no dialogue is gripping; and where no part of the story is full of suspense or thrilling.Much thought was put into, and much will be spoken about, the torture portrayed in ZDT. This was ZDT's unique selling point and indeed is, politically or otherwise, thought-provoking.In today's modern world, I ask myself whether the media does a good enough job in documenting real life events; whether it is the rise and fall of Osama bib Laden or the Tsunami of 2004 that struck Thailand (and other countries). If so, do we really need a film director to cash-in from these events and churn/re-document these out onto the silver screen?Taking this point further, The Impossible (2012) - the Oscar nominated picture about a family's incredible tale following the 2004 Tsunami, and like THL, told a single story amidst a big event and proved that a drop of a pebble into a still lake will form more beautiful ripples that the plunging of a boulder. Katheryn Bigelow in ZDT, opted for the latter and it ultimately disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A winning team for a CIA narrative,"Mrs. Bigelow is obsessed with obsession. Blue Steel, Point Break, the Hurt Locker, now Zero Dark Thirty. The background of the story changes, but the story remains the same. Behind different faces, the same obsessive character. The obsession portrayed in her films actually is quite simplistic and straightforward, but anyhow, in our time her ""oeuvres"" are considered as deep, realistic, and arty. After an adrenaline fix come the inevitable frustration and emptiness of living, Mrs. Bigelow shows it to us over and over again; her hero has a conniving streak in him/her, but a hero nevertheless. She's so focused on her obsessed character, it's easy for her to claim that the Iraq war film she made was apolitical, and ZDT, a political thriller, has no political agenda.Mr. Boal is a journalist. When he begins to write stories for the big screen, we praise his ""journalistic approach"", and we can easily forget that, as most journalists these days in the US, Mr. Boal is an embedded journalist.Unlike the Hurt Locker, which, by opening with a quote from Chris Hedges, gives a false impression of an antiwar movie, ZDT is at least honest. At the very beginning it gives us a warning:""Based on first-hand accounts of actual events""Aka what CIA told us and what CIA wants you to see.The decade-long war on terror seen through a CIA agent's eyes, the whole film is shaped into a CIA narrative. As Mrs. Bigelow wrote in her LA Times article, defining ZDT's raison d'être:""we should never discount and never forget the thousands of innocent lives lost on 9/11 and subsequent terrorist attacks. We should never forget the brave work of those professionals in the military and intelligence communities who paid the ultimate price in the effort to combat a grave threat to this nation's safety and security.""How many times do you hear this from a CIA/Pentagon/WH spokesperson?Yes never discount and never forget the victims of 9/11, we heard their voices; we saw the London bus bombing survivors bloody faced, eager to share their story. But we can well forget hundreds of thousands innocent civilians killed by US forces in the past ten years, not single one of them had a place in this film. We saw angry Pakistanis gathered in front of American embassy, jumping like savages. But we would not see those CIA drone strikes, bombing Pakistani wedding, killing women and children. ""They hate us for our freedom!"" we saw Mayor Bloomberg repeat Bush's line. Yes never forget the brave work of those professionals in the CIA, they worked their ass out torturing terrorists, what a psychological trauma it would be watching so many naked men every day? But we can certainly forget there was also innocent people got kidnapped, tortured by these brave professionals. Forget torture is a war crime, we got Ben Laden.""Those of us who work in the arts know that depiction is not endorsement."" Mrs. Bigelow defends her film in her LA Times piece. No Mrs. Bigelow, your film is not art. There's no art without truth.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A monumental cinematic achievement.,"Jessica Chastain's performance as ""Agent"" Maya is as restrained as Kathryn Bigelow's direction of one of the most monumental moments in detective and military history.It's so restrained (as is the direction) that one almost thinks it's for real.I honestly can't imagine how two men could have taken the story of UBL (Osama Bin Laden) being meticulously hunted down and killed and made it as restrained and yet still menacing as this absolute triumph of a movie. But Bigelow and Chastain do just that.Chastain, hard as nails, yet soft as silk, throughout, carries the movie with so much ease it's like she isn't actually acting. She is miraculous. But only because Bigelow affords her the space to breathe, the edit to breathe, the whole idea to breathe with such subtlety that it's almost as if there IS NO DIRECTOR.Is this documentary or drama? There's been much made about the depiction of torture (especially water-boarding) in the first reel that it sounded to me like I was about to embark on a torture-porn outing. Believe none of that. This is no torture porn movie. The only porn is what inspired it. Yes, the beginning is uncomfortable, but it is considered, restrained and important in the storytelling.For two hours this astonishing piece of film does next to nothing other than scratch away at the forensics of tracking down the most untrackable mass murderer in history before exploding into the dimmest lit, scariest half hour of action you'll see in any action movie. And you know the outcome. Weird.It IS a documentary really.Character development is minimal and storytelling is at best sketchy, off camera, challenging to the viewer (but that's what's so involving about it).It's pin drop territory - I don't think I've ever heard such a quiet cinema audience. Popcorn eating would have incited a riot in our multiplex.James Gandolfini makes his second cameo performance this year in an Oscar nominated movie (after Argo) and it shows that he is politically connected and wise of late career choice. Soon, perhaps, we'll see him in full-bodied, lead role political material.Two hours in, the first bars of music creep into the soundtrack. The effect is electrifying. It almost immediately disappears before re-emerging in the credits. It's that kinda film where music seems unimaginable, yet Alexandre Despal's contribution is vital.The final scene sees Chastain reflect on her achievement. Her tears were echoed by mine.A monumental achievement in cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,History
What's the solution?,"The movie showed the story about a member of CIA hunted down Osama bin Ladin.
At first, she didn't want that assignment. But it turned her calling when she found even just a few possibility. Even if it was justice, it looked like the hunting. In the detective dramas and the war movies, everyone fights and hunts down the enemy for each justice. I wonder if I enjoy because I have a hunting instinct, too.A lot of people became and suffered mental illnesses. Someone tries to forget the incident, other was obsessed with it pathologically. Even so, the indiscriminate terror attacks have been caused still. She played a big role in the mission though.",7.0,Anonymous,History
MY REVIEW: The Hunt Worth Finding!!,"Zero Dark Thirty. Not sure why it is titled that but anyway it is the chronicle of the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, and his death at the hands of the American military in May 2011. From the word go, the movie takes you to the hunt, importance and desperation of it. Here the lead character Maya played by terrific Jessica Chastain fights fire with ice but in few scenes her outburst gives you the goosebumps in this thrilling chase. In last hour or so where they believe that they have located their man, movie converts into the one of the most thrilling and realistic missions showcased on celluloid. On the flip side, I kept waiting for some back story of Maya to know why she is like that. Even though I felt that they just got lucky in finding Osama Bin Laden and some sequences were over simplified, there is no denying because of this movie I was able to experience the most important man-hunt of recent times. Don't miss it!!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Neutral depiction of historical events,"The film is dramatically taut and very realistic. When you arrive at the culmination of the film, which is well done, you have already seen a great film. This is no film for war mongers or pacifists : it neither condemns or promotes what we did to get Bin Laden which I really appreciated, there is even a line in the movie alluding to how much money we spent to do so. The film is so well made that the story has a natural flow and the torture and terror depicted are there to tell the story and aren't gratuitous which is too often the case in these sorts of films. I streamed it on IMDb TV for free and was pleased to get it for free and was always entertained and didn't find myself ""picking the movie apart"". A great watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"If you know what to expect, it's very good","The main hot political potato that has arisen with the film is the subject of whether or not it champions torture, and whether it was, in this case, successful or not as a means to obtain information. For me, there are two very straightforward things to say on the matter. Firstly, and backing up my feeling that the film maker remains at a moral remove from the subject, I am not entirely sure what the people who are upset about it wanted; torture occurred regardless of our feelings about it, and as Bigelow has pointed out, to not depict this part of the story would be dishonest. Secondly, the very fact there is a raging debate as to whether the movie does or does not champion its use is evidence, in itself, that it does not make it a clean-cut, black and white case. Unlike other reviews, I will not spoil the movie by mentioning the crux of a key plot point in relation to the matter, but it could be well argued that the film remains deliberately neutral on it. Boal and Bigelow put the subject out there for debate, seemingly playing devil's advocate in terms of their own feelings; I suspect they felt it would be wrong to imprint their personal stance on a film such as this.This film is larger in scope than The Hurt Locker, but they actually share a lot of DNA; both are timely works about the war, and both are notable for examining the psychology of their central character, the big difference being that one film is set in the midst of the hot zone and about a group dynamic, while the other shows us a war which becomes almost personal, and is fought from behind a desk. Where The Hurt Locker had the freedom afforded it by not being based on a set of events, Zero Dark Thirty adheres very strictly to a specific set of events, namely the zig, zags and frustrating dead ends that were the decade-long hunt for the world's most wanted terrorist.This is, at once, a strength and a weakness of the movie; the film focuses on detailing one event after another, with a cold precision and little character development. Thankfully, the movie is crafted in such a way that, despite knowing how it ends, as with Apollo 13, we find ourselves gripped by the details of the hows, whys and wherefores. Nevertheless, whilst the who's who of a cast all give believable performances, there is generally the sense that you are simply a fly on the wall, not getting to know these people, but rather watching things play out, in the moment. There are two exceptions to this, one being Dan, the expert in ""enhanced interrogation techniques"", who in another context you feel you could like. He is played by the fantastic Jason Clarke, previously of Lawless; his lack of nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars is a huge oversight. The other is Maya herself; Chastain plays a woman who does not give much away, and so it is understandable that, to some, her performance seems flat, and certainly not worthy of her Oscar nomination. I will not say she deserves to win it, but I definitely disagree that it is a flat performance; on the contrary, she actually has some rather amusing and deftly written dialogue, which is a pleasant surprise, and I find the subtle shifts in her character's psychology, the growth of her obsession, even in the face of people telling her to let it go, to be one of the most compelling elements of the film.And it is on her performance the film takes its final bow; Zero Dark Thirty goes out, not with a bang, but on a downbeat. The final half hour of the movie is a well-executed, realistic depiction of the raid of the house and the killing of Osama, and yet we miss the drama of the preceding two hours. Could this be the point? Maya's tears and final exhalation are of what? Relief or joy? She's not smiling. Sadness? Understanding of loss? Perhaps it is something not so easily captured in just one word or phrase, but one things is for sure, you know you are looking at a character who, like us, found that the chase became more important than the objective, and only now has come to realise that the last decade of her life has yielded nothing; no friends, no love, no family, no real home, nothing but one man's death. At one point in the movie, upon being asked what she has done for the CIA other than this, she has to answer: ""Nothing, I have done nothing else."" You do not leave this film, with its quiet closing credit score, feeling at ease or like it celebrates anything, other than perhaps the bravery of the men who put their life on the line for an important job; the movie actually leaves us with an unexpected feeling of hollowness. This is a thoughtful movie, put together by somebody who understands it is not a simple subject to relay; it doesn't tell the audience what to think, and there are those who might not like or admit that. Those of the general public passing judgement on a subject about which they know little, especially when they have not even bothered to see the film, are, I believe, bandwagon jumpers who like the sound of their own, mostly ill-informed ramblings, and who should perhaps see the film first.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Well done,"ZDT is a granular look into the momentum leading up to the demise of Bin Laden. The movie presents a unique viewpoint without trying to force morality onto the viewer. The viewer is encouraged to ponder the morality. The story is based on a true events, but dramatized through fictionalized characters.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Thank you IMDb,"Knowing this movie was nominated for best picture, I was afraid that I was losing my mind after seeing it, since what I saw in the theater was: one dimensional characters being frustrated about not being able to do anything, inter-cut with a newsreel about current events, followed a ridiculously overdone operation to kill a couple people in a house.No doubt this is a difficult story to tell dramatically, since it's about people who are doing a job that is passive by nature. But what was striking is how completely devoid it was of character. Courtroom dramas trade in the same stock, but even the most pedestrian episode of Boston Legal or LA Law contain more compelling characters than anyone in this movie.And most movies about real events overcome the inherent story problems by provoking thought in the audience about the events themselves. What they lack in dramatic momentum, they make up for in unsettling questions. But it was amazing how completely empty this film was of anything resembling a question about what was going on. It was as if Kathryn Bigelow thought she was just ""presenting reality"" to the audience.In 50 years, people are going to look back at this movie in the same way that we look at the jingoistic WWII Hollywood features now - as empty fare designed to prop up our fragile national psyche. Maybe that's what people need right now. But let's not pretend it's a quality film.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Intricate,"I feel like people are going into this film with the wrong expectations. I'm not sure what most people went in expecting but I got pretty much what I thought maybe a little less. Not as powerful, emotionally resonant or captivating as Hurt Locker Kathryn Bigelow's controversial follow up to that film is still a throughly engaging, edge of your seat dramatic thriller. One that realistically for the most part tells the stories of the brave women and men involved in the hunt and assassination of the terrorist known as Osama Bin Laden. The film chronicles and centers on the exploits of a woman named Myra who id hired to lead the search. What follows as we all know are many the pitfalls and fake outs that happened over the years eventually leading up to the event. What we do see an an addition to that is a look on the inside of the investigation. The anxiety ridden events, the tragedies, the friendships, the assassination attempts, the vendettas and although the film doesn't fully work as a procedural because there doesn't seem to be enough detail or as a character piece because it doesn't seem to want to go to those depths it does work as a smart, adult piece of grade a entertainment. Jessica Chastain tackles her role of Myra with a fiery, school girl enthusiasm I can imagine such a person filling that role and the supporting roles fill out nicely as well. I'm sure many things were added to dramatize many of the events and you can feel the Hollywood anchor throughout but the film still carries a subtle power to it and even though you know what the culmination of the events will be you still feel like you don't know how they will enfold. And that is the stamp of some truly intricate film making. 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,History
Exceptionally Well Directed Thriller,"Zero Dark Thirty (2012)**** (out of 4)Excellent thriller from Kathryn Bigelow about the decade-long hunt for Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks. ZERO DARK THIRTY ended up hitting theaters less than a year after the final events in this movie so one might think we'd end up with a rush job but that's certainly far from the truth. What's so amazing about Bigelow's direction is that everyone watching this movie knows how it ends yet she still creates a wonderful tension that grabs the viewer during the opening scenes that are just audio and holds them till the very end once the mission starts. This movie clocks in over 2 1/2 hours yet it never feels long, which is another compliment to Bigelow because the majority of the movie is mostly dialogue. You have to give the director credit for making the dialogue scenes just as tense and compelling as the more controversial torture scenes and of course the scattered action throughout the film. Another major plus are the terrific performances with Jessica Chastain leading the way as the CIA agent who has given her life to bring bin Laden to justice. Jason Clarke, Mark Strong, Jennifer Ehle and Joel Edgerton are also excellent in their supporting bits but everyone from the lead to the smallest roles are perfect here. The visual look of the film really puts you in the middle of the action and I think this helps with the tension and especially during some of the terrorist attack scenes. The same is true for the torture sequences but I give the director credit for just telling the story and not shying away from anything or trying to play political on either side of the subject. I like the fact that the film doesn't preach at the viewer and instead just tells its story. The final sequence is certainly incredibly thrilling and seeing how Bigelow managed the various visuals is quite an achievement and it works beautifully. ZERO DARK THIRTY is a political thriller at its very best and one of the best directing jobs out there, which just once again proves how smart the Academy is.",,Anonymous,History

Patience pays off at the end !,"Curiosity is at the center of our taste for cinema. A new premise always makes for exciting movie watching with most of the thrill preserved for how the climax culminates. Now even before you have bought your popcorn and settled into your seats, you're already aware of the Zero Dark Thirty's premise (the hunt for OBL) and the climax (the infamous capture at Abbottabad, Pakistan). Then why watch it ? The devil, and all the chilling thrill in this case, is in the detail.Director Katherine Biglow's progression as a story teller from her previous work Hurt Locker to Zero Dark Thirty is highly laudable. While Hurt Locker did win the Oscar for Best movie for 2009 and Zero Dark Thirty may not in spite that it is nominated, there is no doubt that the latter scores remarkably higher in drama quotient and entertainment value compared to the former. And although Biglow is divorced from her ex-husband and one of the most famous directors of our times James Cameron, she is truly wedded to this genre of cinema and settled very well in this marriage indeed.Biglow unveils the intense and passionate search by a CIA agent named Maya in the movie (real name is CIA confidential info for obvious reasons) who will move heaven and hearth to find Osama Bin Laden. Her struggle to find OBL is compounded by the natural ethos of her organization, the CIA, as she battles the intensely bureaucratic system and it's surprisingly high aversion to risk. Jessica Chastain as Maya excels in this role, and already stands vindicated by the Golden Globe award for Best Actress awarded to her for ZDT. The movie depicts her meteoric rise from a shy newly hired CIA agent to someone who rattles the top brass of CIA in order to nab OBL. Several times during the movie Chastain reminded me of Julia Roberts in Erin Brockvich due to her feisty no-nonsense character and performance that showcases the steely spine of a go getter. The meat in her role is enough for the scholars at the Academy to chew on and have no room left to ask for more before they get compelled to declare her as the best female performer of the year.Zero Dark Thirty does try your patience at first due to slow pace at the start of the movie, but it gradually builds and then compensates to a large extent in the second half when the pace almost inverts and the movie just can't run any faster. The detail which emerges behind the hunt of America' most wanted man is purely captivating, and leaves even the highest detractors of our government with some respect for what the men working in it's agencies do to keep us safe. The sets built for OBL's Abbottabad mansion with its compound look fascinatingly real and support a perfect climax to the tale. And although everything about the climax is known in advance, one of the most memorable scene is about the 2 Blackhawk helicopters that begin the daring raid at 12:30am on the fated day to travel from Afghanistan border deep into Pakistan territory and land into OBL's compound that is just a mile away from a Pakistani military establishment. The scene is so hair razing that I felt compelled to keep my fingers crossed in spite of everything we know about the terrific success of that mission without loss of a single American life.Mark Boal's writing and his research that has gone into writing the screenplay is exemplary, in spite that it has attracted Republican accusations that the Obama administration inappropriately provided material to make this movie. The dividing line between a fine screenplay and fine directing is sometimes blurry, as one could be easily mistaken for the other. In the case of Zero Dark Thirty, the balance appears to have moved in favor of Boal who is nominated for an Oscar for Best Screenplay, but not Biglow for direction of the same movie.Subjects like this generally make powerful documentaries but not necessarily entertaining movies. Creating a power packed dramatization without deviating from facts is a huge challenge but one that the team of ZDT has successfully overcome. This movie is a must watch for every American to learn what went into the capture of the nation's most wanted outlaw. And finally, this movie rekindles the spirit in you.. that if one puts his mind and heart into a task then nothing is mission impossible.Love USA.",8.0,Anonymous,History

It starts with Dan (Jason Clarke) enters a dirty room where a terrorist financier, Ammar (Reda Kateb), is held captive by several other balaclava-wearing CIA members. Make the rules clear: if Ammar doesn't look at him when addressed, Dan will hurt him. If Ammar steps out of line or lies about something, Dan will hurt him too. Dan has Ammar put more restraints on and motions for one of the masked individuals to follow him outside. He orders his men not to talk to Ammar, outside, the masked individual removes his covering; she is a young CIA agent named Maya (Jessica Chastain) in her first experience in interrogation. She is a reluctant participant in extreme duress applied to the detainees, but believes that the truth may only be obtained through such tactics . The biggest chase in history!. For ten years a woman did not stop searching for the most wanted man in history !. God as woman !.This 2012 American thriller deals with the lead-up intelligence work and special operations forces assault that ended with the death of Osama bin Laden. The filming of the film was located in Chandigarh, India. Parts of Chandigarh became Lahore and Abbottabad, Pakistan, where Osama bin Laden was found and killed in May 2011. There were reports of protests by Indian right-wingers against areas of Pakistan being recreated in India.The film was well directed by Kathryn Bigelow (Point break, K19 the widowmaker, Strange Days, The hurt locker, Blue Steel) with a perfect and assured direction which keeps this movie on the edge of your seat. Including a screenplay by Mark Boal, both associated with The Hurt Locker, another military action thriller. It displays all-star-cast with a number of known faces, such as: Jessica Chastain, Jason Clarke, Joel Edgerton, Chris Pratt, Jennifer Ehle, Mark Strong, Kyle Chandler and Edgar Ramírez. The film received five nominations at the 2012 Oscars in the categories of best film, best actress (for Jessica Chastain), best original screenplay, best editing and best sound editing, achieving the latter.Based on facts, these are as follows: The killing of Osama bin Laden was announced on May 2, 2011 when elite units of the United States Armed Forces killed Osama bin Laden (codename: Geronimo) during a shootout in Abbottabad, Pakistan. President Barack Obama publicly reported on the night of May 2 that a small special operations team had killed Bin Laden. The soldier who killed Bin Laden was Robert O'Neill, a member of the Navy Seal. The mission, codenamed ""Operation Neptune's Spear,"" was carried out by units of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (an elite SEAL unit) under the United States Operations Command. United States Special Forces, in coordination with operatives of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Pakistani authorities confirmed that Bin Laden died in Pakistan in a clash with American soldiers. According to the Obama Administration, Bin Laden's body was thrown into the sea after verifying, through DNA tests, that he was indeed the fugitive. The decision not to make public the photographs and DNA samples that the United States claimed to have would later generate controversy. The operation itself was also not without controversy. Some organizations and people criticized her. On May 21, 2015, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh published an article in the London Review of Books titled ""The Assassination of Osama bin Laden,"" denouncing the official version as completely false. Hersh maintained that Bin Laden had been captured by Pakistan five years earlier and kept in isolation in the Abbottabad house, and that when the United States found out through an intelligence leak, it simply asked the Pakistani government for access to the detainee, at which point who was murdered in cold blood.",7.0,Anonymous,History

But hey It's a freakin' movie,people take a chill pill.If you're politically bent on believing torture does not work,should not be used etc.etc.,and you can't see past that political view...then don't see the movie.The movie is about what people did, the CIA.,Soilders did behind the scenes,that keep us safe and shielded from not having to see the dark ugly side of humanity.I did not find the beginning of the movie slow as some have said.The movie starts out showing what had to be done,whether you believe it was effective or not in getting Bin Laden.I enjoyed the movie .I say go see the movie and chill out.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Nutshell Review: Zero Dark Thirty,"Let's get a key sore point out of the way. There are those who take offense and have genuine concern about the torture scenes in the film, which had actually opened the movie, and have a few more going in various interrogation scenes given threats, and veiled ones, aimed at enemy combatants in order to try and elicit useful information from them. I suppose it is tactically naive to deny that torture, in its various forms, and as loosely used a term, does not exist. Otherwise there would be no need for black sites in locations of allies who condone such a practice, and frankly speaking, depravity is something quite expectedly used as a tool, because humans are susceptible to using any method to force or coerce co-operation. It's hypocritical to deny the propensity of evil within us.After having run around with the big boys and their various operations in The Hurt Locker, director Kathryn Bigelow now opts for another aspect in the theatre of war, and that's of the intelligence community, working behind the scenes to obtain credible information, where content is truly king. It took almost a decade to hunt down what would be the most elusive man on the planet at the time, with his closed network of associates and trusted inner circle, to shield him from everything that technology can be used to track him down. It is this hunt, based on gut, instinct and sheer hard work, that forms the basis of interest in a film like this, and worked as a capture of key milestones that had gone to this monumental effort.And for a film spanning a decade, Mark Boal's story managed to weave in the various iconic terrorist incidents that had taken the world by storm, starting with September 11 recapped without visuals, then the recreation of others such as the London bombings that followed, the attacks in camps, and the blowing up of the Marriott hotel in Pakistan, amongst others. Perhaps the bit of a stretch would be to weave Jessica Chastain's lead character of Maya into some of them, because it's almost a statistical stretch to have someone at the right place at the right time, if not to lend an almost personal objective to Langley's mission to get their man.For characterization, we can look no further than Maya, whose hard nosed determination we see being developed from the days of being a rookie where we start, to a seasoned veteran in the field unwilling to make compromises, and almost always demanding her ways because as part of the rank and file, she's there to see through changes, rather than to be air-dropped into the ivory tower. Politics also comes into the fray, and just like The Hurt Locker, Bigelow throws on some uncredited roles played by famous faces, that you'd be looking forward to just about who she'd throw on next.But it is Maya's story and development that makes Zero Dark Thirty compelling to follow, one who is void of emotion, with very little personal life, deliberate in clue us in on her immense dedication to the cause and mission. Not only as the noose around Bin Laden and his hideout get closer, but to observe Maya's change as an intelligence analyst in a world where it's black versus black, with real and present danger set amongst them even though they're in office most of the time, especially when complacency sets in, and enemies use that as leverage when games are played against each other.Action junkies will take heart at the key action sequence in the film, which is that full scale assault on a rather conspicuous three storey building by the Seal Team Six. It is presented in almost real time, lending some authenticity to its version of the event, although not without its own controversy since nobody can vouch for accuracy given the cloak of silence surrounding this operation. So it's pretty much left to the filmmakers' discretion in how it all went down. Those looking for more development behind the Seal Team Six preparation can perhaps view Code Name: Geronimo, which provided that army preparation that's missing in Zero Dark Thiry, offering a different take as well on the final assault, something that this one is clearly steering clear from in order not to distract from its cat and mouse focus amongst the think tank involvement.Still, Zero Dark Thirty proved to be immensely engaging and gripping as it unfolds, even if artistic license got liberally applied to tell this tale of a determined manhunt in recent history. A definite recommend!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Bit Of A Rant!,"Firstly I have to say that I believe that Bob Dobson's one star rating of this film (that for some reason ,at the time of writing, occupies top spot in terms of reviews) may be based on (to paraphrase a moron) ""the classic dim witted American ""misogynist with a chip on his shoulder"" view of life!""This idiot can't even reconcile the fact that some western translations of the guy's name call him Usama rather than Osama.I'm guessing if Fox News doesn't verify it for him he doesn't understand it.Honestly, check his review, he simply can't comprehend why they call him UBL in the film and simply doesn't possess the curiosity or more likely intellect to even investigate further via the dark and mysterious portal into what us Liberal's like to call ""knowledge"" that is Google!Putting my initial rant aside, I found this to be an intelligent and understated portrayal of a subject that could so easily have been handled in a crass and jingoistic manner by a lesser director. God know's I've seen enough adverts for film's loosely based on the same material, all of them seeming to resemble ""Call Of D..."" sorry I mean ""Act Of Valor"" type Gung Ho fest's designed to make the cerebrally challenged amongst us whoop and holler as the bullets reign down and the eyelids droop.As an historic document of what probably happened this film is surely a triumph.It doesn't tackle the reasons that 9/11 happened in the first place( Come on Americans do you think people would do that without you REALLY pissing them off first?) but then it was never meant to.At least it was honest about what very likely happened in the aftermath (P.S. I was very drunk when I wrote this!(But I still stand by it!)",,Anonymous,History
"A mixed bag, but ok","So, i gave this movie a 6/10. It would have been an 8/10 for all the things like the camera work, editing, sound, scenery, you name it.... This movie had a good budget and used it well. The acting would be a little bit below this score, because a lot of it felt very forced and maybe a bit rushed.The movie loses a lot of good will, because it is a serious subject based on a true story, some of it very detailed and down to the point on how it happened. This gets contrasted by just run of the mill Hollywood tropes that should make it more enjoyable, i guess.And last but not least, this movie sets the woman known as ""the torture queen"" in the main role and tries to make her a sympathetic figure, blocking out the critique about the CIA torture techniques and making it look as if this was a good thing.So, its a fine movie, but leaves a bitter taste.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Movie of the year,"I found this movie riveting. I don't understand the negative reviews. I have read nearly all of them for insight. Although the torture scenes are difficult to watch, they are necessary to give the film perspective and emphasize the importance of the mission. The film does have a slow pace and it is not a pure action movie. If you are expecting Mission Impossible, then don't see it. Some of the characters probably could have been developed a little more, but Maya is the central character and is a tour de force. I think Jessica Chastain does an amazing job and her character is multi-dimensional.The film could definitely be divided in two, much like other war movies, i.e. Full Metal Jacket. The first half establishes the mission and the difficulty in finding Osama Bin Laden's position. The second half is the mission. The depiction of the steps the Seals took to invade the compound kept me on the edge of my seat. I suspect that many of the people that gave this movie a negative review are either a) not American citizens or b) conspiracy theorists c) fans of being indifferent to movies received by critics. It is a great movie and I highly recommend it. I have watched Django Unchained, Life of Pi, and Flight recently which are all good, but I think this movie really stands out among this years elite.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Unfortunately, the lead is unlikeable.","The main problem with this film is that the lead character is completely unlikeable. Ultimately, she is proven correct, and the film uses this to excuse her previous behavior - a frustrated person convinced that she is correct fighting against the rest of the bureaucracy. But as a viewer, I can't help but wonder if the lead character's goals could have been accomplished sooner if she had tried to be even a tiny bit more personable or relatable towards those in charge. I end up sympathizing with her chain of command - I also would have doubted her conclusions because she comes across as a fanatic convinced of her own superiority. The ultimate heroes of this film are Seal Team 6.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty Much a Masterpiece with the Best Performance of the Year,"NOTE: I do not care about the historical accuracy of this film nor the  supposed stance it takes on torture. It's a movie and its job is to  tell A story, not necessarily THE story. Bear that in mind.   Making a movie about the tracking and killing of Osama bin Laden could  have been a rather easy endeavor. Just about anyone could have made  that movie and turned it into a blockbuster sort of film that would  have brought people to the theater even if the quality was low. Turning  that movie into an award-winning, dramatic spectacle, though, was quite  a tall order. When virtually the entire audience knows the ins and outs  of your story right on up to its conclusion, it can be very difficult  to create drama and intrigue that doesn't seem false. Katheryn  Bigelow's ability to do just that takes Zero Dark Thirty over the top  and propels it into the discussion for best of the year.   Zero Dark Thirty begins two years after the bombing of the World Trade  Center with the brutal torture of an al-Qaeda prisoner at the hands of  CIA interrogation expert Dan (Jason Clarke) and a young special agent  named Maya (Jessica Chastain). The information gathered through the  interrogation leads Maya on an eight year quest with only one goal in  mind: the location and apprehension, by whatever means necessary, of  Osama bin Laden. This process proves more difficult than finding the  proverbial needle in a haystack and costs Maya a great deal throughout  her time on the case but the effort is finally justified on May 2, 2011  when SEAL Team 6 is sent in to take down America's number one  adversary.  Zero Dark Thirty opens with a black screen backed by a 911 call from  the World Trade Center on 9/11, a choice that sets the tone for what is  to follow in no uncertain terms. To call this movie ""intense"" would  require a new definition for the word. It's more like ""mega-intense"" or  ""my- blood-pressure-will-never-recover-intense."" Bigelow throws the  audience into the torture sequence that made me squirm not for its  gratuitous depiction but for its realism. The man being interrogated is  BROKEN and that hits home fast and hard. From there, the pace slows at  times but the tense urgency of that opening scene never wanes, leaving  you on the edge of your seat even when there's virtually nothing  happening. And if you do make the mistake of putting your guard down,  Bigelow is quick to comeback with an action sequence that reminds you  of this film's stakes. Perhaps the finest moment is in the final scene  in which SEAL Team 6 invade bin Laden's compound. The sequence takes  over 27 minutes to unfold and even though I knew exactly what was going  to happen, Bigelow still drove the moment home with a quiet yet furious  injection of natural adrenaline that kept my pulse up throughout.   What really sets Zero Dark Thirty apart, however, is the performance of  its lead. I don't know who discovered Jessica Chastain and gave her the  big break she needed but that person should be given a large sum of  money and some sort of medal. To think that Chastain could go from  completely unknown to the woman who gave the year's best performance  (which is what I would call this portrayal) in less than 18 months is a  true Hollywood success story if ever there was one. Maya is an awesome  and complex character to begin with (a credit to Bigelow and  screenwriter Mark Boal) but Chastain takes that character and runs with  it, creating a persona that serves as the driving force behind the  entire movie. Chastain shows Maya to be a brash, single-minded  personality and in the wrong hands the character could have EASILY  become abrasive and obnoxious. Instead, Maya is truly dynamic and begs  to be embraced by the audience.   It goes much further than this, though; it isn't enough for Maya to be  strong and likable. Bigelow puts the entire film on the shoulders of  Maya and Chastain by making her the in-movie representation of the  audience and moreover, the American people. Chastain is our window into  the hunt for bin Laden and the emotions that she goes through are, I  believe, symbolic of the ones the audience has gone through over the  last decade. Zero Dark Thirty is built with remarkably strong beams in  the form of terrific writing, an engrossing and familiar story, and  outstanding supporting work from a strong cast of actors (most  particularly Jason Clarke who should receive award attention for his  role), not to mention a host of technical attributes that serve to  heighten the experience. But Chastain is the load-bearing beam of the  film and even a great performance might have left the film wanting.  Well, it isn't great but instead a powerhouse portrayal that  reverberates with far more emotion than I expected to find going in.  The relief that Chastain exhibits in the closing moments washes over  the audience in a way that can only be described as surreal and, for  me, it is this final shot that solidifies Chastain's performance as the  best of the year and Zero Dark Thirty as one of the more iconic films  of the last decade.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Surface readings don't do Zero Dark Thirty justice,"""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a decent examination of the post-9/11 era in America. Just like Bigelow's last work, ""The Hurt Locker,"" most of the film is presented without commentary; a nearly documentary account of the hunt for bin Laden, starting from the nascent days of the Bush-era War on Terror, to the more recent and more surgical approach of the Obama administration. But, in the same way as ""The Hurt Locker,"" the film builds to a climax where the main character - seemingly underdeveloped and superficial - comes to represent something greater than herself: potential and innocence consumed and slowly corrupted by the hunt that offers no meaning at its termination.The raw nature of the cinematography is to be commended. Even the most difficult to watch scenes, the famed torture scenes, are presented without commentary, without music or any particularly fancy effect. Realism is emphasized. Hand-held cameras are used whenever possible. This realism builds to an amazing 30-minute climax at bin Laden's compound that brings the event back to life.Surface readings of the film don't do it justice. The torture, while questionably successful in the film, does not serve to glorify the practice, but builds toward the film's greater point. Complaints about the one-dimensional and unexplained obsession of the main character fall under the same category. A deeper reading, more evident when the ending is taken into account, reveals the futility of the enterprise of the hunt for bin Laden in the same way Hurt Locker's final scenes revealed the obsession with combat and danger that had beset the main character throughout the film. It is not relevant that torture had ""worked"" if the end that it worked toward was never worthwhile in the first place.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Like Bigelow's Hurt Locker in quality and excess hype,"As with her first film Hurt Locker, Bigelow has managed to accomplish far more in film PR than in the films. Both I end up rating 65 of 100. They both have moments and are worth seeing, but far from being great or Oscar/Academy worthy films.It fulfills the basic aspects of an intelligence action/suspense film and is interesting and entertaining in that respect, far more so than the last 007 film Skyfall.This film is more of a recount of a history timeline with dramatic filler. It, like Hurt Locker, feels almost like a military propaganda film. Far more interesting and historically significant after Osama's discovery and killing is Where in the World is Osama Bin Laden (done in 2008), which was ahead of the military/CIA by 3 years in tracking Osama's location. Strange there's no reference to that actual documentary anywhere in this.While the film claims to be made on ""first-hand"" accounts, it's mostly first-hand public accounts rather than Wikileaks/whistle blower accounts. While that make it seem more real, and some publicly known information definitely deserves repeating and more than a couple minutes of time in the news, it limits the film to the conventional. In addition, first-hand accounts don't mean true. If not verified or given broader context, they're like listening to any other story. Bush & Cheney could give you a ""first-hand account"", but that doesn't make it accurate or worth listening to.Contrary to criticism, there's no endorsement of torture. If anything, it reinforces ""enhanced interrogation"" is actually torture. It also ties together a massive failure with torture-based intelligence.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Very impressive,"This is filmmaking like it should be: profound, mature, masculine to that extent that I hardly can believe it has been directed by a woman. I only can praise the bewildering qualities of mrs Bigelow. It was an utter pleasure to see this movie: so professional and exciting that it takes your breath away. You really get impressed by the work of the FBI, the intelligence officers and the special troops. Mrs Bigelow has elaborately shown the step by step process of hunting down Bin Laden and it constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat. It also showed me once again the treachery of those Muslim terrorists, to whom nothing is holy: no honor, no humanity, no loyalty, no positivism. They are the Nazi's of our days and vigorously have to be dealt with. Why this movie, despite all of this, gets sharp criticism by some weirdos is a puzzle to me, but I gather these are the kind of people that only can grow by kicking down and spitting on others who really do have potential (a behavior the Nazi's were also good at, by the way). I'm looking forward to see more work from this qualified movie director!",9.0,Anonymous,History
As Good As Imagined,"There is only one reason for giving this movie a lower than 8 or 9 star rating or an average review - political bias.ZDT accomplished what it sought to do. Tell a story. Like the story or not, it told the dramatic story of the search for Osama Bin Laden - centering on the CIA female agent who stuck to the information and details. Leaving aside, again, all politically charged ideology, the search and finding of Bin Laden was an amazing feat in the face of deeply challenging opposition.The movie itself captured the drama and the pain of the search in a powerful narrative. It is difficult to imagine a more realistic account - at the same time making a film in which everyone knew the ending - still come across as riveting and dramatic.The last 30-40 minutes alone had both a realism and drama that I have never seen before in a film. Not even close.Bigelow is a master of creating intensity and drama out of as realistic a political-military narrative as possible.The only thing hurting this film and the only reason for a negative view is political bias in a negative political atmosphere.If you watch this film, watch it with a lack of bias (politically; militarily; or otherwise). And, watch it through the lens of the powerful narrative following a great fictional-historical character played by Jessica Chastain.Chastain clearly deserved Best Actress (and, yes, I loved SLP). Bigelow at least deserved a nomination for best director and should have won.Sad that Hollywood - long promoting art over PC, this time chose PC over artistic value.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Zero plot 30,"I was speaking to an old friend the other day and the conversation meandered into the latest movies, she began to talk about Zero Dark Thirty and i knew i would have to tell her that i thought it was a complete waste of time eventually. This idea didn't excite me as it usually does when I'm given an opportunity to argue with someone about the merits of a film. I asked myself 'why?' and immediately realized why when she began to talk about it. ""I didn't know that a women played such a major role in the whole thing.."" she said. ""Its interesting that someone like her was behind the whole thing pretty much..."".I was about to begin to explain to her why the presence of a woman in that role was not meant to be taken literally, or perhaps it was, but thats not the point.This movie is different for Bigelow in that it doesn't appear to have a clear message, to me at least. Her other films always portray the subject in such a near-perfect light. Strange days, The hurt locker, Point break, and K-19 all seem to give a fair presentation to both sides while staying decidedly in the realm of opposition to the main ideals and themes depicted. This ""opposition"" is exactly what draws a person like me to a Bigelow film. I could not find her stamp on the movie until the end. Thats the other thing, did i really spend that much time watching a buildup to an event so highly spoken of in our time? (in north America at least). I was awestruck by the amount of desperate justification of the US' methods of war, interrogation, and the like. Its almost as if she believed that this truly was a means to an end, that showing this would do anything but convince people that harsh interrogation works and that if you make the US mad, seal teams will come to your home and efficiently deal with you. Then i remember what my friend said, and i realize that most people will take every scene as truth, every action as an insight into the workings of the situation. Its our point of view and interpretation that points us on the path of understanding.That being said, don't waste your time on this two hour bore-fest, this pro-American barfy justification of perseverance and 'righteousness'. the first truly poor film on Bigelows list without a doubt.",,Anonymous,History
Good,"In its category it is amongst the best even though it is difficult to watch and has no shortage of violence, abuse and neglect. As another reviewer stated, Zero Dark Thirty is the type of film that needs good writing to work, because it's about a long process mainly done by people sitting at desks. Many scenes do not feel believable. But great performances help to enhance this amazing story. This is one of those movies that the cast isn't only in for the paycheck. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods, and there are verbal fisticuffs back and forth. There are slow spots, but to me the movie is too good to dismiss based on them.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Dirty on Zero Dark Thirty,"Maya is a CIA operative whose first experience is in the interrogation of prisoners following the Al Qaeda attacks on the U.S. of 11 September 2011. She is a reluctant participant in extreme duress applied to the detainees, but believes that the truth may only be obtained through such tactics.For several years, she is single-minded in her pursuit of leads to uncover the whereabouts of Al Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Finally, in 2011, it appears that her work will pay off, and a U.S. Navy SEAL team is sent to kill or capture Bin Laden. But only Maya is confident Bin Laden is where she says he is.The film makers say it's a Work of Journalism. But really, it's just a standard action revenge movie with the fingerprints of the U.S. Government all over it. That very same government that has proved over and over again to lie to we-the-people about everything from WMDs to the reasons they send our fine young men and women to die while killing innocents around the world in the name of defense.The same ole guy did something bad to us and we got him script is standard issue.

Really?Now I am NOT just slamming this movie as a farce but I am talking about this whole dam Osama Bin Laden character. This Washington D.C. creation is one of the best characters created, well, probably ever! Well, scratch that, clearly Moses, Jesus and Mohammed trump this over embellished so called real person cartoon character. But that's a another story!Nevertheless, the Bin Laden character has now become a legend, a brand, an ongoing narrative that is now in the consciousness of the American public who can't seem to figure out that there was NO BODY, NO DNA, NO IMAGES, NO REPORTER ON THE SCENE and a government cabal that told us the reason we do NOT have his body is that we respect Islam and so we threw him into ocean with the sharks in the same manner of respect that we gave Saddam Hussein as we hung that Muslim by a rope.

"Truly exceptional film-making, Jessica Chastain becomes a star","Zero Dark Thirty was one of my most anticipated of the year for many reasons. First, I loved The Hurt Locker and it's probably my favorite recent Best Picture winner. Secondly, Jessica Chastain, an actress that broke out in 2011 with several fantastic performances, was starring in it, her first true lead role. This would be a role that would, essentially, define the rest of her career.The film has been raved about quite a bit, but one thing was certain based on reviews, and that was that it was very much a journalists' films, presenting information and information about countless of attempts to get closer to Bin Laden. Because of this, I did expect exactly what I got from it and from Chastain. A film like this is definitely not going to be loved by the mainstream that want something a little more ""dramatic"". I'm quite surprised it's gotten the level of acclaim The Hurt Locker got, because fortunately, it stands on its own. This isn't the showy technical film Hurt Locker was, not the showy directorial film that was. But its gripping all the way through to the final act, which is among the best things I've seen all year. There's not much to say for it except that one has to surrender to what the film is and not ask for what it isn't. I already expected it would be what it was so I wasn't surprised or disappointed, but I can see many people dismissing this.I am quite surprised Chastain has gotten so many critic wins for this performance though. It's just not meaty in the slightest, meaty in the sense of drama or any real character-arc that defines awards. I wasn't even sure I would want her to win anything for this during most of the film. But in her last scenes, her performance comes together. I realized just how much Chastain had done with, arguably, so little. There are tons of supporting performances that have a lot more to do when it comes to dramatic stakes, but Chastain makes it work with her face. The best thing that can be said about her is that there are not many actresses that would be able to make this character work as well as she did. The emotional baggage she carries underneath without ever having anything to show in terms of dramatic satisfaction, and the way she lures you to the screen, proves that she has a powerful presence. Even with how detached the film is from her character in terms of not really digging into her most of the time, it's her film. It's her face that haunts you by the end of it when you realize just how much she did. If you weren't sure about it before, this marks the beginning of a true star.This is a film that I see haunting my subconscious more and more and that will refuse to leave my mind. Another jackpot for Bigelow and Boal? Definitely.",,Anonymous,History
Mediocrity Defined,"Due to its receiving of academy attention and the generally positive light in which critics have viewed this movie I was expecting quite a bit from Zero Dark Thirty. Alas ZDT is just another movie in a series of over hyped movies released this year which i responded to with a resounding meh. Don't get me wrong this is not a bad film but I find it hard to say that is fantastic as many others have.To begin I would like to say that this movie contains nothing strikingly original it is full of sequences ripped straight out of other modern military action movies, the best example being when Jessica's (Jennifer Ehle) meeting with an apparent informant. I don't want to spoil the result but the scene is full of tension building clique's that movie goers have seen so many times I just about understood its anatomy before it had even begun.Can I add that casting actors who have been in cult TV series to play minor supporting roles in movies is never a good idea. Both the one true king of Westeros Stannis Baratheon, Thomas Jefferson and Henry Francis appear in this movie and it caused me to think and then say aloud 'wait a second isn't that the guy from Game of Thrones.' I become instantly aware that I'm watching a movie and it annoys the heck out of me. I'm not saying avoid TV actors all together (I think it would be a shame if Charles Dance never appeared in another Hollywood film) just cast them as major characters so that they become immersed in the role enough for me to forget that they were once the guy that Betty had an affair with in Mad Men. Just a suggestion.Other then this the movie is nothing special, the climactic sequence in which the raid on Osama Bin Laden's complex is undeniably interesting and certainly lifted the movie but ultimately reminded me of playing Call of Duty. Yes the Zero Dark Thirty does contain an interesting true story (though I'm unsure how true it really is) but is directed with nearly no style and lacks any innovation. It is good action movie from a good director but an innovative and Oscar worthy film it certainly is not.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Do Not Be Swayed By the Political Fallout...just go see it.,"Perhaps this film came out too soon. With the issues of torture and the lingering questions our country is debating on the ""war on terror"", this film was bound to provide a soapbox for both the left and right side of the debate. I would advise you not to worry too much about what this movie says or doesn't say about torture, and just go see if for yourself.Why? Because the film provides an engaging, well scripted depiction of the uninteresting, boring, tedious and often unproductive nature of the CIA's tracking down of OBL. I thought this film was going to be like Black Hawk Down in terms of the time line it would follow. I was wrong. The story arc begins with 9/11 and is largely set in Pakistan where you watch a young CIA analyst (Jessica Chastain) slowly obsess over and piece together the leads that get her to OBL.There are weaknesses in the writing and some poorly developed characters. Yet, over all I preferred the plot which stuck completely to the CIA's base in Pakistan rather than mix and match the DC politics with the ground game analysis. Of course the DC bureaucrats need their say, and the film gets you to DC during the final stages before the strike. In total, this is not a ""24"" type of film. Its not about the ticking bomb and torturing someone to get them to talk. Its a thoughtful depiction of a very difficult intelligence mission that does not make the mistake of intentionally trumping up any political ideologies nor does it advocate torture. It just gives an admittedly dumbed down view into the post-9/11 intelligence issues this country faced, which include as you will see some pretty brutal methods of culling information from sources.",7.0,Anonymous,History

But my entire family fought for our freedoms and rights in our country their entire lives and I appreciate them for doing so.Unfortunately, I have to agree with one of the past posters, that people are grading the film based on their political leanings and sadly, they've forgotten the most important philosophy when it comes to art depicting life.

Good but flawed,"Over and above the retrospective narration on 'the greatest manhunt in history', ZERO DARK THIRTY is either a finely crafted espionage drama, or a controversial piece of political propaganda, or a little bit of both. As a cinematic experience, the entertainment quotation varies depending on what you might have grown to expect from this film. And depending on that expectation, this film will either appeal to you, or turn you away in indifference.The title is military jargon for 'half past midnight'. It also refers to the time stamped go-order issued by the Pentagon, to raid a compound in Pakistan said to be housing Al-Qaeda terrorist and chief Osama bin Laden. As of 2nd May 2011, we are told that bin Laden was Allegedly eliminated by the US Navy SEALS. This film is all about the ""deductive reasoning"" as one CIA official puts it, in tracking down bin Laden before he was shot to death. The film opens with a blacked out screen stating that it is based on ""first hand"" accounts of actual events. In total darkness, we listen for two minutes where American citizens cry out in horror and chaos as the World Trade Centre succumbs to terrorist attacks on 11th September, 2001. Two years later, the CIA has detained Ammar, a suspect linked to Al-Qaeda terrorists in Saudi Arabia. Held at a CIA black site (a location disavowed by the US government) in Pakistan, Ammar is interrogated, tortured and humiliated until he gives CIA operative Maya (Jessica Chastain) a name – a person said to be bin Laden's courier and confidant. Working with probability on one hand and informed guesses on the other, Maya must now convince the male dominated corridors of power that the courier will lead them to bin Laden.At the time of reviewing this film, ZERO DARK THIRTY has been nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Motion Picture of the Year. I concur that this is an important film and perfectly timed as such. Over 3000 people lost their lives on the ill-fated and historically infamous 9/11 2001. Add to that hundreds of thousands more on the so called ""war on terror"" and over a trillion US dollars in defense spending. But what has all this amounted to cinematically? Sure, various other films have tried to throw light on what America has done to avenge the loss of innocent lives since 9/11, but what makes this film so special? Try Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal – the production team that got 2008's similarly themed THE HURT LOCKER six Academy Awards including Best Picture. Bigelow returns as director, co-producing with returning screen writer Boal. It is fairly evident that Bigelow and Boal have pulled out all the stops in delivering a top-notch film. That said, I am still not convinced that this is the best film of 2012. My problem lies in the murky prologue and an indistinct epilogue. It is almost as if the director and the writer expected the whole world to be tuned in since 9/11. This downplays the narrative in as much as saying ""Meanwhile, in a CIA black site in Pakistan"" The ending is even more annoying. Bin Laden gets his duly deserved double-tap (standard engagement procedure, none less), then what? Is the world safe from terrorism? Do the surviving dependents of thousands of slain victims find closure? Does Maya become a hero? Will the CIA recruit more women? Sadly, none of these questions are answered, and by not answering these questions, where lies the point of this film, less its making?Then there exists the controversy that becomes a thin line between fact and fiction. By claiming to have the film based on reliable sources, we are given to believe that the US government endorses torture as an enhanced interrogation technique. This part of the narrative could be over hyped if associated as the political propaganda that aided President Obama's re-election. But given that Bigelow made THE HURT LOCKER without propaganda, I am content in accepting this film as an espionage drama rather than a trigger-happy depiction vindicating the US government's trillion dollar deficit.ZERO DARK THIRTY also manages a cut above the rest if perceived for its other cinematic qualities – engaging and fast paced narrative, nail biting suspense that leads to startling moments of terror, and some fine acting chops. Jessica Chastain delivers a tour de force achievement transforming Maya into a fiery CIA officer with conviction. There is one particular scene that reminds me of a younger Meryl Streep. Ironically, bin Laden is said to have loathed women in office. By the looks of it, Chastain and Bigelow may have just sent bin Laden a whirling undercurrent to upset his watery grave. Also worth mentioning are a plethora of supporting roles. Most notable are Jason Clarke as Maya's colleague and interrogation officer, Mark Strong in a fierce pep-talk speech, and some amusing sarcasm from James Gandolfini as former CIA director Leon Panetta. The actual raid is left for the last but best thirty minutes of the film. This is also when I was pleasantly surprised with the use of some military hardware, the likes of which have remained a top secret like the elusive 'Area 51'. At least till now.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This film will not help to make a better world. No...,"The only question I have in me is: Is this movie done to shock and ask why America is spiting on human rights? or is it to justify it?

Ah no yes ... message is torture helped us to fight evil...Shocking... leaving a lot of questions to me. Disgusting display and pseudo ""justification"" of human rights violation... poor world.

Chastain and Bigelow are living proof that gender has no part of who can make effective films in certain genres.,"Kathryn Bigelow seems to have found herself a niche in thrilling, gripping War on Terror films. I absolutely relish her masterful The Hurt Locker, and Zero Dark Thirty is as fine a companion piece as can be found.Inevitably for a film about a decade-long manhunt, the first third (with false leads and an overwhelming sense of helplessness) drags mercilessly. The first time I ever watched this film, I turned it off thirty-five minutes in and went to sleep, before I came back to it and was blown away by the far better paced and high stakes second and third acts. A series of explosions are catalysts in the film - I just love the way Bigelow does explosions. Its all dust and vibration, no excess of flames that would make it feel like a Michael Bay or a Roland Emmerich. Its understated and thoroughly believable.Pacing or not, Bigelow is a master director. She knows how to film tension and pain like no one I've ever seen. Her cutting between the lead up to the bombing of Camp Chapman and Maya's instant messaging screen to her friend is so brutally effective its almost sadistic. The storming of bin Laden's complex is so well directed that I was taken out of the film and put there in real life - only when Maya appears back on screen did I remember this was a film. Zero Dark Thirty is very much a sum-of-all-parts film, and the film's cinematography, sound, visuals and editing comes together spectacularly. Above all else, I can feel Bigelow's mark on the film, just as I can in The Hurt Locker. I maintain to this day that the 2012 Oscars accidentally nominated the 5-9th Best Directors instead of 1-5, because the omission of Bigelow (and Affleck, Hooper and Tarantino) is inexcusable.Jessica Chastain is a powerful actress - probably my favourite working today - and she's in her element here. Not many actresses could turn from a loveably ditzy housewife to a determined woman seeking to find and kill the world's number one terrorist. See one scene in which Chastain screams at her Station Chief for the single reason why she got a well- deserved Oscar nomination. But unlike Jennifer Lawrence, who undeservedly took home Oscar gold that year, Chastain's performance is impressive beyond one shouting scene. I fully believed that Chastain - who is a stunning actress - was a withdrawn, friendless obsessive with certainly no husband prospects. I completely bought into her reactions as the culmination of her life's work leaves her without a sense of direction. She completely earned her Golden Globe, and its tragic that she lost the Oscar to Lawrence.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Engaging with an even-handed approach but it is a bit dry and not all the hype suggests,"This film arrived in the UK with the critical praise and Oscar nominations all very fresh and mostly untouched by negative opinion. The story is one all viewers will know going in – or at least the ending is. It is a story that has such a potential for emotion, whether it is in the terrorist attacks played out on screen or the final raid of the film and this potential had me worried that it would be overdone. Indeed since the events happened there was always going to be a film made of it, the question was whether or not it would be a gloating, excessively patriotic affair made to make 'Murica feel good about the revenge aspect of Bin Laden's death. Happily this is not really the case here (although it is hard not to feel some satisfaction) because director Bigelow and writer Boal have delivered a very patient film that condenses a decade-long manhunt down into a few hours and done so without overly pushing any agenda so much as trying to remain distant and just play it out.On one hand this makes for a very engaging film. Using Maya as our central character, we follow the story through torture, setbacks, small leads and ultimately into the risky raid. It is unfolded in a patient way which summarizes without making it a total simplification and, while it moves slowly, it does still hold the attention because the path is interesting and the destination important. The manner of the telling is important because it could easily have overdone the torture to condemn it, or alternatively overdo its use to justify it, but it really manages to do both and neither at the same time which is another reason it engages the viewer. It takes the same approach with the raid; those of us with Call of Duty style images in our head of what happened will be disappointed but it is actually more effective and tense for just how simply it is allowed to go – there are no excessive action move clichés and it is better for it.That said, I don't totally see the film that the critics are gushing over because the downside of how methodical and even-handedly it approaches the story is that it does lack the emotional highs that a more manipulative approach would have brought and it is telling how often we get these in other films since their absence is something you'll feel even if you know you don't actually miss them. The character of Maya is one example; Chastain has been roundly praised for her performance but actually I found her quite blank – which fits the approach but does mean she is not a strong character at the core of the film. Likewise the matter-of-fact move through the story does occasionally drag – not in so much of a way that it lost me, but just in a way that at times it felt quite dry to watch. The performances throughout fit this mould although again it is a necessary evil to keep it balanced and not allow big colorful characters or set-pieces to overtake reality.Zero Dark Thirty is a really interesting and engaging film that benefits and loses from the even-handed approach that it takes. It is a good story and I appreciated that I was allowed to bring my own politics to the film, not have others heavily thrust onto me. This does mean that at times it can be a little dry and slow in the telling and this does hurt the film, but to me the benefit outweighs the loss. Not everything the hype would suggest but certainly a very well told story.",,Anonymous,History
Surprisingly Realistic,"I think this film receives a lot more hate than it deserves because people say it's extremely dull and boring. But I certainly am rating this higher than it deserves, but let me say I think it's about a 7.6/10.Thing is, they aren't smart enough to understand that you're job as a CIA spy is not going to dramatic or action packed like most people think it'd be. It's careful intelligence gathering and analysis. The director got this spot on.He was able to show how the United States secret corps actually function and he did it quite finely. Then what's the big problem? He did it excessively to the point where it was starting to get boring. There wasn't enough psychology in the film and much character depiction lacked. This movie should've been a psychological journey of the spy instead of how she tracked down Bin Laden. The movie misses several key elements such as why she spent twelve years trying to find Bin Laden and is still persevering. What caused her to go after Bin Laden? How does her stubborn attitude and perseverance affect those around her?The movie misses these several key points to the point where it feels less like a movie and more like a cinematic documentary. This movie could've easily passed for a documentary. Take out Jessica Chastain's dialogue, put a voice over of some random dude. There you go, a documentary on the hunt for Bin Laden.The highlight of the film has to be it's technicality. The film is shot beautifully and this showed the technical awareness of the director. He purposely breaks certain rules while film making to give a sense of reality especially in the DEVGRU operation scene (which is easily the highlight of the film). Coming to the Neptune Spear operation scene, I have to say. It is easily the best shot modern military scene. Chris Pratt was just outstanding as a DEVGRU operator and not once was I reminded that he was Chris Pratt.Overall, this movie certainly has it's flaws but it's not a bad movie. It's good , but not great. Hence I rate it 7.6/10 due to my high liking for military movies. 
This is one of the few movies I've seen that are actually correct to reality.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A straight forward depiction of sordid exciting facts, very very well made","Zero Dark Thirty (2012)An amazing movie for what it says and for what it doesn't. And a brilliantly well constructed movie--the camera-work, editing, and writing are all in synch here. The acting is excellent in a purposeful way, too--some of the best performances come not from the leads, who are restrained professionals looking at computer screens and going to meetings, but from the people in the action. This includes soldiers and spies, but also victims and those who underwent torture.Torture, depicted one way or another, is a key element and famously controversial part of what happened, and it's shown here with quite a bit of brutality, untempered. You might guess it was even worse than this, or that it was unfairly brutal in the film--we're sure never going to know which. But it's an unfriendly part of the movie and I had a hard time watching it. (I would have edited to a shorter awful sample and then shift to allusions to torture in order to avoid torturing the audience.)But there are other elements that you come to admire and wonder about accuracy in the best way because it seems so true. Like just how did the events in the final capture and kill take place? And what kind of process did the CIA have then (and still have now) with operatives and clashes with white collar diplomats? The CIA operative here, centering around the unusually perceptive and tireless Jessica Chastain, is convincing. In fact, the whole movie is convincing, which is why questions of truthfulness matter.And which brings up the other point about all movies based on fact like this--there was no real surprise in the big sense. We know the end. We know the climax. This is almost an illustration of recent history, a ""dramatization"" to use a belittling term. And so it depends a whole lot on doing a bang up perfect job. Which it nearly does. It's a powerful and interesting movie, as well an exciting action drama. And there are implications that lurk after it's done that need some sorting out. For those who care.See it, for sure. It's an interesting pairing with ""Argo"" even though decades apart in setting. I found Katheryn Bigelow's previous film, ""The Hurt Locker,"" to be more interesting and surprising in many ways, a better film I suppose. But this is equal to it in some ways, and so if you liked that one you ought to be in good shape here.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Perfect Film.,"Let me start by saying that I am not into political films at all. But Zero Dark Thirty is a masterpiece of cinema that manages to be historically educational and bring nail biting thrills throughout the entire 2 hours and 30 minutes. I'm not going to rant for too long but all of this B.S about the torture scenes really is false. The torture scenes didn't go too far but rather showed the audience barely a taste of the torture that happens EVERY DAY around the world, and involving the U.S. All I'm going to say is that there's no denying that worse forms exist in the U.S and the government should be lucky that Kathryn didn't show anything worse than water torture and a few punches thrown.Go see Zero Dark Thirty and although there's no twist ending of Bin Laden's eye opening at the end, you still will be thrilled the entire time!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Potentially the Most Overrated Film of the Year,"There is much to be said about ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" Kathryn Bigelow's cinematic retelling of the hunt and killing of Osama bin Laden, but the most apt term that comes to mind is ""overrated."" Plot-wise, we all know how it goes and how it ends. War, hunting, research, torture, invasion, death. It covers a very long span in two hours and forty-five minutes and gives a somewhat choppy rendition of the ""actual"" events that lead to the discovery of where the world's most infamous terrorist was hiding.I put the term ""actual"" in quotes because there is much debate as to how much of the film is true. Having seen it with a friend who knows more than the average person when it comes to American military manoeuvres, in my humble opinion, the all so-called ""controversy"" of the details of the film being somewhat untrue were created to mislead the public into thinking the truth was actually potentially fictitious.Smart move, US military. Smart move.That being said, the film is quite entertaining and really enlightening on many aspects of a hunt for a man that took almost a decade to find. Knowing the film was already in production prior to the actual killing of bin Laden, forcing Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal to backtrack and rewrite the entire ending to the film, lends much gravitas to the information being shared. Knowing some military officials' careers were put in jeopardy for revealing too much intel to Boal lends even more weight. That and the fact that I, myself, had my own intel that some details shared were thought to still be deemed ""classified."" However, the only reason this film is getting so much attention during Awards Season is mainly because it deals with such a climactic moment in American history and not because the film itself is actually any more worthy of an Oscar than any other military/action-like film like, say, ""The Avengers."" To not nominate it might be seen as ""un-American."" There is a reason why Bigelow did not get an Oscar nomination for Best Director: the film is simply not even close to being worthy of such a distinction. That being said, Jessica Chastain's highly-lauded performance as the CIA agent simply known as ""Maya"" who is believed to have been the mastermind behind the discovery of bin Laden's hideout is even more overrated than the film itself. Yet somehow, she is the front-runner for the Academy Award for Best Actress.Usually an extraordinary talent (most deserving for her nomination for ""The Help""), Chastain's cardboard performance is utterly one-dimensional. Her lack of emotion or personality throughout the film made me think the role could have as easily been played by even the most dynamic of actresses, Kristen Stewart (read: sarcasm). As much as I was swept up in learning so much about the efforts that were made to capture this horrific individual, Chastain's performance from beginning to end left me wondering why exactly she would even be considered for an Oscar, never mind being a front-runner.And alas, there is a good chance the Golden Guy will go to the second-least-deserving of the lot when three of the other performances nominated were actually nothing less than exceptional.Technical nominations aside, the only truly deserving nominee of the bunch is Mark Boal, whose screenplay is based on intel collected by clearly rigorous research.Many will be enthralled by this film. However, I highly doubt it will be because of the production value and more so for the information contained in its details. Thankfully, Bigelow has no chance of stealing an Oscar away from a far more deserving nominee for a second time. However, this time, that distinction has a good chance of falling in the hands of Chastain.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Okay, and the raid is some excellent filmmaking, but Chastain is weak and it drags","Not bad, but I'm really at a loss to explain critics tripping over their own feet trying to exalt it. The story is interesting, but, of course, this being a movie, you have to take its history of events with a grain of salt, which makes it kind of worthless in that respect. Cinematically, the raid sequence is by far the highlight, and definitely one of the best sequences of the year (I didn't time it but it had to run for 30 or 40 minutes), but after that it's fairly pedestrian. And I've gone from a waffling Jessica Chastain skeptic to full-on Jessica Chastain denier. She's very mediocre in this film, having little presence and delivering her big lines with no conviction (""I'm the m.f.er who found this"" had my eyes rolling hard). Since most of the story revolves around her, I didn't find anything in particular to attach to. I wasn't bored, per se, but I wasn't much interested, either. The character doesn't even do much. Her big break comes straight from someone else's hands. The best you can say about her is that she's the one who insisted upon it. The Jennifer Ehle subplot is so embarrassing you hope like Hell it never really happened, and, as far as the filmmaking is concerned, it's one of the worst sequences of the year, at least in a major film, so telegraphed and drawn out that if I was watching it on DVD I probably would have just skipped to the next chapter. There aren't any standout performances in the film, but I was happy to see Harold Perrineau, Mark Duplass and Chris Pratt show up.

"Over-hyped, bad acting, terrible writing; bad as fiction, worse as history","This movie was SUPER-hyped when it came out, mostly because of the political & historical context, and also because it featured a woman lead and woman director. If that offends you, go back and review the promotional material AND the reviews by industry 'professionals'.The acting is pedestrian, on par with a high school play. The writing is terrible, so it's hard to determine which is worse. The director is responsible for how all of it comes together, so she bears the most blame, here. The use of a handheld camera technique is an amateur affectation. This whole movie - NOT 'film' - is nonstop manipulative. There is essentially no story, no core. It's just quick melodramatic vingnettes interspersed with incredibly boring, slow exposition. None of the portrayals are convincing for the roles their trying to convey. Viewers should come away from this movie with a real fear for the competence of US military & security if they believe what appears on the screen. It's a telling choice for the director to put the two actors featured most prominentlybon the first 20 minutes. They're children playing a game of trying be serious people. They're lost. As in every other facet of this movie, they're not up to the occasion. At least their failures don't stand out against the rest of this garbage. They're completely consistent with the amateurish qualities of the overall.Examples: a character in a meeting of 'the suits' speaks American English; in a scene in a hallway a few minutes later, he has an odd, fake British accent. Bizarre. The main focus of so many reviews at the time - the Seal Team Six raid - is profoundly badly filmed. Again, I think this is a function of the writer & director not getting to know the reality of the raid from the real people involved. They hid behind a humble of dark scenes and super-quick cuts. They may have hoped that viewers would feel the tension, but what all of this does is to create a lot of annoyance and - amazingly - even more impatience, since we can't see or understand enough of what's happening.Take any 10 minute block of this movie, and you'll find lousy dialogue, lousy acting, contrived camera work.... just dreadful. Amateurish.There's nothing to be gained from this drivel propaganda garbage. I look forward to the public estimation of this trash declining faster & faster as we gain perspective on its context & content.For comparison, read the reviews of 13 Hours in Benghazi on IMDB, written by people who had real experience in the field at the time, contemporaneous with the events depicted.

"I'm the motherf**ker who found this place, sir!","One of the best movies I have seen in ages. Director Kathryn Bigelow did a masterful job with Mark Boal's script.Yes, it was about the hunt for Usama bin Laden, and yes it was about Seal Team Six and their raid on the compound in Abbottabad, but it was so much more than that.I cannot imagine one awards show or one critics choice for Best Actress no going to Jessica Chastain, who played Maya (Jen in Mark Owen's ""No Easy Day). She nailed the character. She made the film. She was it.Everyone else in the film just circled around Maya. She was the one driven to find UBL. So driven that the real CIA agent depicted by Maya was denied promotion because she managed to really irritate her superiors. Go figure.So driven that the CIA Station Chief that replaced Bradley (Kyle Chandler) told her he found it easier just to agree with her.I was understandably impressed by Maya because I have found myself in that situation many times in the military, and in government service. ""We're 60% certain"" is often as far as most bureaucrats will go. They talk mission, but it is the resume that drives behavior. You see this in those around Maya, and it makes her drive to succeed so much more enjoyable.I was not expecting the ending. It was not typical, but IT WAS PERFECT. I won't spoil it as some reviewers have already done. It has to be seen and savored.

"This Is A Well Made Movie, But Truth Matters And This Narrative Is False","I struggled with a rating for this, because I appreciated the film's dedication to realism. The raid on the compound at the end, in particular, was at least in terms of its in-the-moment feel extremely well-executed. There were odd choices made for dramatic purposes (no women were killed in the real life raid, for instance). But for me the most important thing about this movie is the most infamous thing---the inconvenient fact that torture did not, as depicted, produce intelligence that led to the mission that killed Bin Laden. Ironically, the original premise of the movie was a tragedy detailing the failed attempt to find Bin Laden, despite the use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" (i.e. Torture). Unfortunately (fortunately?) Bin Laden was killed while the movie was in preproduction, and it was rewritten with the false narrative that torture of Black Site detainees yielded reliable intel about a courier named Abu Ahmed who was eventually tracked down to the compound where Bin Laden was hiding. The directors and writers repeatedly tried to brush this off as creative license, saying again and again that this movie is a ""dramatization"" and ""not a documentary."" But that's code for, ""We tried to make a movie about the uselessness of torture, and then when the ultimate object of the torture was unexpectedly achieved we tried to salvage our production by making torture look ugly but ultimately helpful."" It's not true, and the fact that it's not true matters. America really lost its right to lecture the rest of the world about human rights because we tortured people after 9/11. It wasn't okay, and it's an ethical choice, not a creative choice to make it look ""practical"" or ""complex"" or however else people talk about it. It's such a well-made movie with a very bad accidental retelling of history.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Taxi To The Revisionist Side,"So let's deal with the torture first, because that seems to be what everyone is talking about. The scenes depicted in this movie should not be shocking to anyone who has been watching the news for the past 8 years. If anything they are quite mild compared to what you might see in an average episode of ""Criminal Minds"". What some have found shocking is the claim that it was torture that ""found"" Osama. Again, this has been in the news for over a year now - but there are things to consider -a) Kathryn Bigelow's movie is based upon the CIA version of events so take from that what you like. b) The US has been more successful in taking out al Qaeda targets after torture was removed as an option than it was under Bush/Cheney. (Google it if you don't believe me). c) We see a successful interrogation at Bagram. We don't see any interrogations of innocent dudes who also ended up tied to the ceiling there (see documentary ""Taxi To The Dark Side"").So my feeling is, if you go in accepting the movie as unexpurgated truth, you're a bit daft. But then I'd say that about all movies anyway. Moving on.As drama, it is semi-successful. The issue here is that the subject matter is pretty dry for the first 3/4 of the story. People mostly sit in rooms discussing leads, politics and techniques. In an attempt to humanise the story and draw us in, we are given the character of Maya to follow. She's a young CIA agent who becomes obsessed with finding Abu Ahmed, Bin Laden's courier. But is he still alive? Does he even exist? He's so shadowy her superiors think not and we follow her frustration over the years as other leads are followed to no avail.I think the reason this part of the movie felt a bit dry to me was that essentially it was covering documentary territory and the character of Maya is so one-note (driven and dedicated) that it's hard to find an emotional foothold in the film.Compare it to the more emotive ""Argo"" and it's nowhere near as compelling. But then we reach the last act. The assault on Osama's compound. It's brilliantly staged and, given that we know how it ends, incredibly tense. The whole audience was holding their breath the whole way.So I was glad I saw ""Zero Dark Thirty"". It is a good film and worth seeing. Is it ""Best Film Oscar"" material? I think so - but for me ""Argo"" & ""The Sessions"" are much more satisfying films.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A very good film but oddly it didn't really hold my interest.,"""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a very funny film. This is because the far Hollywood left condemned it for condoning torture and the far right (and CIA) condemned it because it seemed to indicate torture was often used when it wasn't--and odd case where both extremes seemed, in an odd way, to be in agreement! As for me, I wanted to see it simply because Asner and others DIDN'T want me to see the film and the more they complained, the more I felt it would be worth while. That, and the fact that it was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar guaranteed that sooner or later I'd see ""Zero Dark Thirty"". Despite this, however, I really wasn't all that anxious to watch the picture and didn't love watching it. Why? Because I know in general what happened and none of it really came as a surprise--and so it was all very anticlimactic.Despite not adoring the film, it was pretty much what I expected from director Kathryn Bigelow--a very competently made film that seems almost documentary-like and with many lesser-known actors. She did a great job with ""Hurt Locker"" and once again she did a fine job with this movie. I would say more but frankly by this time (well after the Oscars), there have already been a bazillion reviews and I doubt if I would add more.By the way, did any of you feel a bit odd seeing Chris Pratt (Andy from ""Parks and Recreation"") in the film? After seeing him in this other role, seeing him with the Seal Team was odd to say the least!",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""I'm the Motherf*cker Who Found This Place""","Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty may not be as highly accurate as it is advertised but it does contain all the potent & explosive elements that made The Hurt Locker, the Best Picture Oscar winner of its year. Right from the beginning until the very end, the film generates an unrelenting atmosphere of severe tension & throughout its runtime remains highly gripping, suspenseful, very well detailed & is a superbly crafted film.This is Kathryn Bigelow's most mature effort, much ahead of The Hurt Locker & her direction is very impressive. The writing is taut, very well-researched, finely detailed & nicely layered. The acting is brilliant as well with Jessica Chastain stealing the show with her intense knockout performance & the crew has tried to re-enact most of the events with as much authenticity as possible. Photographed in a documentary style, the film is finely edited & features a potent score too.Yet in spite of what's great about it, the film isn't devoid of flaws & there were two things that really disappointed me. First is the absence of 9/11 footage when it gloriously displayed all the other terrorists bombings in full scale and the final climactic scene which, in my opinion, should've been entirely filmed in the night vision camera technique instead of jumping out from that into absolute darkness.On an overall scale, Zero Dark Thirty may not be suitable for all viewers due to its explicit display of torture & grim atmosphere but there is also no denying that it's one of its year's best films which promises & delivers a nail-biting experience to its viewers.",,Anonymous,History
Bigelow in the creation of a new genre.,"The first thing I want to say about this film is related to the power  of women in the 21st century. Not only the film follows a strong, brave  and extremely persevering woman wanting to be heard, but the brilliant,  bold and daring Kathryn Bigelow who directs the film. These two women  put together one of the most desirable scripts out there in Hollywood,  having in commercial plot that features theories from 9/11 and the  killing of Osama Bin Laden, but it also focuses on the life and  psychological mindset of the person behind the planning of a risky and  pretty frightening operation that changed the world. Yes, ""Zero Dark  Thirty"" is raw in its essence and sometimes hard to watch, but it  touches and sticks with you, deeply.  This is not a simple political attempt to show events or inform people  about an event in a nation's history, and although it sometimes feels  like the way a documentary is shot due to the work by Greig Fraser, the  cinematographer, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a powerful tale of a woman who  knows her work and trusts her research and is sure about her vision,  and it is far from being or attempting to be only an informative film.  We follow a historic event through the eyes of a woman who seems shy  and passive in the beginning, being overshadowed by her male  colleagues, but that ends up ripping everybody's theories apart, and  gaining the trust of her boss first, for then even screaming and  cursing to the man in command of the CIA, only before he presents her  idea to the President of the United States of America. ""I'm the one who  found this place, sir"", says Chastain to the man in command of the CIA  referring to the house where Bin Laden is. Mark Boal who wrote the  script and collaborated before with Bigelow in ""The Hurt Locker"", does  an extraordinary job in taking us through this journey without it ever  feeling long or overwhelming. The film moves quick and precise, and it  tells us what we need to know, nothing less or nothing more. I've  watched the film twice and I still ask myself: How do you start writing  a script like this? There are 10 years to cover and 2 hours of footage,  having in mind the last part of focused on the detailed operation to  get the target. It is unbelievable for me to make a film like this work  so effectively like ""Zero Dark Thirty"" does. So many people, theories,  stories, names, locations, details. The Afghanistan American camps, the  offices, the helicopters, the people and extras that are constantly  around, the CIA rules and regulations, the language, the equipment. I  mean, the amount of research and dedication to this project is  mind-blowing. And the result is a clear understanding of the events and  a highly entertaining film that could mean the start of the new  blockbuster, where you have a commercial, appealing film, in the  context of it being exceptionally well crafted. ​ This time, Boal deals  with a globally controversial story that has many sides and personal  truths, and he has the responsibility of sharing only one vision of the  story with the world, including the Muslim population. The security in  the theater was pretty crazy and I think the whole paraphernalia around  the subject matter was part of the impact the film had on me, but that  didn't separated me from analyzing the script and noticing its many  levels and dimensions in terms of character writing and craft. Each  person working in the operation has an important tale in the film and  they all attribute important sides to the main quest, mainly followed  by Jessica Chastain's character. Her CIA girlfriend who gives up her  life, her boss, the American soldiers, all the incarcerated terrorists  and suspects she interviews, they all are solid characters with very  clear roles in the film, and they all contribute to making it not about  a difficult story to understand, but a human journey based on people  involved in a tragic war that has terrible consequences. ​ I love that  the film is not only about the killing of Osama Bin Laden, but  ultimately our desire as humans, to protect our lives, our friends, our  country. Jessica Chastain's performance intensifies that slow discovery  of personality of this character who appears fragile but is stronger  than expected. This is a side to Mrs. Chastain that we haven't seen and  very different from her work in ""The Help"" or ""The Tree of life"". It  really shows her diversity and drive to create and build interesting  characters that are risky and that have captivating and really  fascinating minds. ﻿ ""Zero Dark Thirty"" by Kathryn Bigelow is a  detailed and exceptionally crafted journey of discovery and tension. It  highlights our sense of intrigue and indecision in problems that  affects us all, and makes us feel grief for the bizarre way in which  we, humans, act sometimes. I never thought it was possible to show all  of these in a film, or maybe I simply don't have the nerve to deal with  such delicate issues. This is one of the best films I've seen this year  and puts Kathryn Bigelow in my list of filmmakers to study and from  those who I impatiently wait to see the work they give us.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Discussing the Enhanced Interrogation Aspects,"Because the plot revolves around information gathered from detainees subjected to so called 'enhanced interrogation methods' which, according to the movie, contributed in locating Osama Bin Laden, many critics have gone so far as to condemn this movie, claiming it to be pro-torture in essence. I myself felt a little ill at ease immediately after viewing the movie as I tried to process what exactly it was attempting to say. There is no doubt that if, like me, you abhor the disregard to basic human dignity of any individual, this movie will, at best, be challenging. However, I believe 'challenging' can be a good thing!The director, Kathryn Bigelow, maintains she was simply making a historical representation of the events leading up to locating Osama Bin Laden. However, it has been argued that the importance of critical information supposedly obtained from detainees, was either non-existent or has been greatly exaggerated or by the movie. This feature then raises the age old question of whether or not the film maker has a responsibility in the stories he/she tells, especially in a historical context, and if so, where do these responsibilities lie? Was it irresponsible to depict that the inhumane treatment of individuals can lead to a positive net effect? Yet, taking the hypothetical assumption that the interrogation methods did yield critical information in real life, might it not have been a greater crime then, to simply fluff over aspects of history in an attempt to exude political correctness? That is, if the torture scenes were left out and their context not assimilated into a truth that was, would we not then, whether by good or bad intension, be rewriting history with a glossy coat?I can understand perfectly well why some anti-torture organisations are angered by this movie, but I would argue that sometimes groups pushing an agenda --even where it be a socially positive one-- often fall into the trap of assuming that the greater audience will simply act like a sponge and 'soak up' what is fed to them in a rudimentary fashion. And so, without wanting to fall into the trap of assuming what others will take out of the movie, I decided to adopt the introspective approach and see if it changed my views in any way. Just say torture did lead to finding Osama Bin Laden, did that then change my view in the use of enhanced interrogation methods? Indeed, I remember living through those years and hearing very technical debates on the precise definition of torture: Of whether 'water boarding' could be considered torture? Was torture defined by bodily harm? Was it defined by death? And if so, without the result of even bruising, could sleep deprivation really be considered torture? ...and so forth. By focusing these debates on individual aspects of enhanced interrogation, they perhaps had a diminishing effect upon the issue as a whole. Whereas ZDT delivers a brutal and vivid representation, liberated perhaps from the limits of minimising definition. We, as the audience, whether we condoned or condemned such techniques, are forced to watch what that reality surmounts to.By not overtly condemning such methods, or at least by seemingly standing on the fence on such issues, the movie avoids preaching to, or patronising its audience, but instead leaves us to shift through some unsettling contradictions and draw our own conclusions. I believe its true voice is therefore both subtle and subversive. Even the main characters are quite contentious and provocative. Dan (played by Jason Clarke) seems to take near sadistic pleasure --or at least pride-- in his methods of interrogation. Right from the opening shot, we are left with an unsettling feeling as we see one of the detainees stung up, too weak to stand, yet, due to his restraints, unable to lie down. Maya, the main character (Jessica Chastain), is obviously disturbed, but still, whether through a sense of duty or patriotism, not only watches without protest, but later, through the actions in her own interrogations, seems to have come to condone such practices. Where then does that leave us as the audience? Can we sympathise with such characters? And yet, as we watch their stresses and strains; the emotional exhaustion and the mental anguish, we are only but compelled to be at least a little sympathetic towards the conditioning and dehumanising factor of their job. Does that then make us somewhat complicit? Are we drawn into their world of 'us versus them'? At every corner, at every consideration, the movie challenges our sense of justice, of patriotism, of righteousness. Perhaps there may well be those who watch this and immediately conclude that the ends do justify the means, but this is a movie with many layers and it has a residual effect that continues to nag, to pluck, and question our ideologies well after the movie is over. As part of the wider western word, we are only now beginning to pick up the pieces from a decade long War on Terror, and now we must try to reconcile, rather than flinch away, from a history that has as many dark corners as it had a hunger to seek out and find justice. This movie, without shame and without quivering, lifts the rock on as many ugly truths and makes us look inward at ourselves, as much as it closes the book on potentially the greatest manhunt in human history.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Momentous,"It is inevitable with movies such as ""Zero Dark Thirty"" to wonder how accurate the portrayal of historical (albeit recent) events can be. Most of us who lived through those times will be in no doubt that Osama Bin Laden was clearly labelled ""US Public Enemy No. 1""Yet this movie revolves around one woman's determination (""Maya"" played by Jessica Chastain) to find this vindictive and reclusive figure-head, often forced to clash with her bosses to get her own way, as she closes in on her target.Whether or not the portrayal is accurate it is clear that a lot of hard graft, and determined (if somewhat questionable) interrogations- plus one vital piece of previously overlooked intelligence – went in to locating the Al Qaeda No.1.And whilst it has to be said that the CIA operatives who died at a supposed meeting with an informant were naïve in the extreme, their deaths in action can be considered no less a sacrifice than all those innocent souls whose lives have been truncated by these dangerous zealots without any real cause.The ambivalent security situation in Pakistan is evident as three terrorists armed with sub-machine guns rake Maya's car (which luckily for her is modified with bullet-proof features) with bullets in broad daylight.The eventual raid on the Bin Laden household is clinical and bloody – with enough intelligence captured that the CIA must still be poring over it even now.This movie captures the powder keg that is Pakistan, the painstaking work that went into locating Bin Laden, the crucial debates in the President's office on percentages of probability that it was Bin Laden's residence (Maya was always 100% convinced), and the professionalism and discipline of the military as they planned and carried out what was, and remains, a daring military raid on foreign soil.It does it though without fanfare or embellishment. It depicts the events but does not seek to influence, and that is what makes this a truly great movie – it is made by those who understand that it depicts one of the most momentous events of the 21st century, an event that exorcised the demons of an entire generation.No further dramatization is required.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Zero Dark Thirty (2012)...... Hunt for Osama bin Laden.....,"""Zero Dark Thirty"" chronicles the events that lead to the hunt of Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the film runs like a full feature documentary that overlooks dramatization and becomes digressive most of the times, but by the end, the film is rewarding in terms that it remains truthful and is based on the first hand information (as the film claims). Perhaps it wasn't easy to chronicle the decade long hunt of Al Qaeda leader; so the film and the tactics in the beginning was a bit confusing and clumsy. The beginning shows few inhumanely tortures done on the detainees following terrorists attacks of 9/11. (We have the whole documentary ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" on this) But the final half an hour raid filmed is perhaps one of the best shots I've ever seen in movies and brings the essence of the film as zero dark thirty which stands for the military mission carried half past the midnight. In terms of historical importance, the film garners a lot of momentum and would be remembered much for the role of Jessica Chastain, as a CBI officer, who firmly pursues her hunt for Bin Laden after her reluctance in the beginning. The role doesn't parallel Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich or Jodie Foster from The Silence of the Lambs, but she carries the film in the end with a feeling of gratitude for her contribution to nation and its peace. Perhaps the film might be overwritten for its documentary feel, but personally, I feel it was the second best film nominated for Oscars this year after 'Argo.""Rating: 3 stars out of 4",7.0,Anonymous,History

Wrong equipment, adding characters, fattening the story with trivial embellishment, creating situations that never happened, changing the story to what they want it to be, just ruined this movie.

Blows Argo out of the water!,"Thirty minutes after Zero Dark (the military term for midnight) on May 2, 2011, the greatest manhunt in history came to an end. Osama Bin Laden, the man responsible for 9/11, was finally found and assassinated. It was a triumphant day for the U.S. military. But who was the hero behind it? (If you say Barack Obama, I will be starting a manhunt of my own) The writer and director of the Oscar-winning ""The Hurt Locker"" give us ""Zero Dark Thirty"", chronicling the events behind the hunt for Bin Laden with superb craftsmanship and unquestionable accuracy.The central character of the film is Maya, a young CIA officer who has spent her entire brief career since graduating from high school focused solely on gathering intelligence related to Bin Laden following the September 11 attacks. She is a reluctant participant in extreme duress applied to the detainees, but believes that the truth may only be obtained through such tactics.Despite losing the Best Picture win, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" blows ""Argo"" out of the water, in all drama, detail, and verve. Running necessarily for almost three hours, the film is intriguing and exciting from start to finish, and stays respectful by never showing any more of Bin Laden's face than we see of Jesus's in ""Ben-Hur"". Even if, for some, the leisurely pacing takes some getting used to, it's impossible for anyone not to be stimulated by the suspenseful last 45 minutes, in which the Navy SEAL Team 6 flies in to Bin Laden's hideout to carry out Maya's final plan.The screenplay was actually in progress before Bin Laden was killed, and completely re-written after his death. The film was originally going to tell the story of the unsuccessful decade-long hunt. It's hard to believe that the movie could have worked this way. It's a fascinating story on its own, true, but looking forward to the climax is the main cause of how invested you get in this picture. Plus, Maya's research and determination wouldn't be building up to anything. You wouldn't feel her directionless mode as you do here.Jessica Chastain gives a persevering and intense performance as Maya, who is a composite character primarily based on a female agent described in the book 'No Easy Day', which was written by a member of the SEAL Team 6. Otherwise, very little is known about the woman whose work made the vengeance of 9/11 possible. But whoever she may be, the film certainly pays honest-to-God recognition to her. This is one of those films like Paul Greengrass's ""United 93"" that truly honor the heroes of this wonderful country. ""The Real Maya"" is one of those heroes.And Obama thanked himself.10/10 for ""Zero Dark Thirty"", for my money the best film of 2012.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Another superior combat film from a beautiful lady,"OK...I'm a bar-band musician, and I love the ladies....Kathy Bigelow is a heartbreakingly gorgeous woman who just happens to ""get it"" concerning soldiers and combat. The ""hotness"" of this combination is mesmerizing. The film actually tells the true story of a woman, we will never know her real name, who also got it---she wanted vengeance, and she understood the young men who would have to do that job.As in the masterpiece ""Ben Hur"", the central character in the conflict is never shown full-on---UBL's bloodied nose and beard are seen briefly as he lay in his brand new body bag, courtesy of the United States Navy Seals.This film doesn't fit the usual Hollywood scenario of gorgeous, eco-consumed, soldier-hating, clueless females portrayed in 99% of the films belched out from the New Hollywood.I have no idea what Jennifer Chastain's politics are, but I loved the scene of her watching the SEALs goofing off, showing off----her endearing amusement showed the reality of real women, and how they feel about the men who have to do the wet work....I get the feeling Kathy Bigelow feels the same way---with ""Zero Dark Thirty' she has made another Oscar-worthy, stunningly realistic combat film.",,Anonymous,History
gr8 film,"It's been said numerous times elsewhere but zero dark thirty really feels like it should have been made 20 years from now. The film employs an objective observational style to some highly contentious and prescient issues still at the forefront of America's political and military conscious.This film seems to have jazzed everyone off with the conservative right proclaiming it as pro-Obama propaganda and many on the left stating that the way in which torture is depicted is dangerous and morally wrong to even be shown. That first point I won't touch on but I've read pieces from people such as Alex Gibney who I respect highly attacking the film for depicting torture as more effective than it actually is. I strongly disagree with this as no effective information is ever really yielded from the interrogations, and although there is a greater statement to be made about the wider reality of ""advanced interrogation techniques"" yielding extremely little and unreliable information on high ranking members of Al-Qaeda, that simply isn't the story the film is telling. In fact I feel these sidebars and themes that get pushed into the background in the hunt for Bin Laden heightens the drama on display showing the lows a country was willing to sink to in its hunt for revenge (I'm not opposed to him getting capped, rather delighted actually).The film is divided into 4 sections and all offer different yet important aspects of the whole operation while remaining a cogent whole. My personal favourite scene in the film is a conversation between Mark Strong and Stephen Dillane discussing the statistical probabilities involved in the assault compared to those that justified the invasion of Iraq which is masterwork, mad props to Mark Boal on that one.I feel the movie kind of negates the need for other films on this subject matter through its exhaustive attention to detail for the entirety of the 11 or so years it takes place in and should be viewed as a reliable text on a lot of what America meant to the world for this period in history.Quickly, Jessica Chastain and pretty much the entire cast are awesome, the night raid sequence is tense as all hell, the score is quickly becoming a personal favourite (if a little derivative of Desplat's past work on Syriana) and the direction and writing meld superbly. I wish Kathryn Bigelow was up for a second Oscar on this one but I'm sure this film will be remembered for many more years than whatever does win for 2012.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Seems realistic, but too protracted and too focused on a single character","Although the plot covers the events over a decade, the ones picked for showing could have been much shorter - 2,5 hours is too long for a movie where interrogations, surveillances and mappings prevail. Thus, the movie is often arid, although there are sudden twists; well, the first is really sudden, then you start to expect a frames before shocking events are rather similarly depicted. The ending is trivial as well.The casting is decent: Jessica Chastain is brilliant and deserves her Golden Globe and Academy Award nomination, but she is too much on screen, at times one might think that this was her operation, being the chief coordinator or so. All others are supporting actors and not really catchy, with the exception of James Gandolfini and Mark Strong - but they were too briefly on screen. So it is all like a solo story, there is no even cast to follow and enjoy.Zero Dark Thirty is above average, but 5 Academy Award nominations?! Too much, I think. Mrs Bigelow has directed far better movies; by the way, Hurt Locker did not impress me either, too static and the events too ""far"" from me and not attractive.

The Hunt for Bin Laden,"Another tense nail-biter from Kathryn Bigelow, who is easily one of the top, say, three directors working when it comes to filming combat action sequences.""Zero Dark Thirty"" isn't quite as visceral as ""The Hurt Locker,"" Bigelow's break-out film from a few years ago, but it's not meant to be. This story about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden takes primarily in makeshift offices, where various people comb over CIA intelligence in an attempt to track down clues as to Bin Laden's whereabouts. The film is anchored by a no-frills performance by Jessica Chastain, playing a somewhat odd and unsympathetic character, a young woman who's so obsessed with finding Bin Laden that she comes a bit unhinged when he's found and she realizes she had nothing else in her life but the manhunt for him. Bigelow makes some of the smartest action movies ever put to screen, completely lacking in bombast or audience manipulation. She directs with an objective, journalistic approach, and lets her audience do its own thinking, a rare treat in movies these days.The last twenty minutes or so are given over to a breathless sequence detailing the raid on Bin Laden's compound and his death, and I was sweating bullets by the time the whole thing was over even though I already knew the outcome.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,History
A bit tepid despite good acting.,"The film is about the events which lead to the dispatching of terrorist Bin Laden. Because of the subject matter one might think that this would be a nail biting, white knuckle, edge of your seat suspense drama. It isn't. The pace is comparable to Contagion or Silence of the Lambs. Much more low key and slow.But why? We as the audience aren't really pulled into this and held captive. We aren't caught in the grip. We are watching from a distance. Which is too bad. The acting is excellent, the cast does a very good job. The sets are fantastic. I don't feel the casting is right for this though. As good as the actors are I felt the wrong people were chosen. They just didn't grab me.Also, I think it isn't paced correctly or perhaps the editor didn't have the right footage to work with. It was a bit of a letdown.

More fiction than fact,"Went to the movie expecting to get the real scoop on the assassination of Bin Laden. Turned out it was really historical fiction based on a real event. It amazes me because the way it really happened was exciting enough that there was no need to embellish the story. The real kicker to me however, was inserting the torture scenes into the picture. It not only was not true, but it added nothing to the picture. Worse, when this film is shown in the Arab world, there will a lot of backlash against America and perhaps cost American lives. It is unbelievable that the writers and producers were not insensitive to this but one of the problems with Hollywood today is that anything goes regardless of the potential consequences. Being a combat veteran I was not impressed by the directing of this movie. I thought it was too faked up at times. They say that this movie wasn't meant to be a documentary and it certainly isn't.

"Perfect pacing, attention to detail and a fantastic lead performance.","For a movie that had so much to tell, pacing has to be right and it was perfect here. Driving this epic story which the entire world has followed so closely through a single human going by a single lead may sound preposterous but may never be far from the truth as well. Another good aspect is that it gets emotional only to an extent to remind the viewer that the characters are indeed human but the entire movie is more about leads, operational details etc. I have closely followed Jessica Chastain's career from the time I have enjoyed her performance in 'The Debt' and she has never disappointed so far. Coming back from a superior directorial performance by Katheryn Bigelow in 'The Hurt Locker' she doesn't hurt her reputation here with her complex yet structured, sensitive yet brutal, emotional yet efficient handling of her movies.Maya (Jessica Chastain) is following up leads on various terror suspects post 9/11 and is assigned with Dan (Jason Clarke). After chasing a few threads she arrives at a pattern that could potentially lead to a courier of Osama Bin Laden. Along the way there were disappointments, dead ends, loses her friends but what keeps her going is her infectious confidence and belief in her lead.There are so many characters in this movie and one cannot go into performances in detail. But to generalize it, not one gives a bad performance. The screenplay could have been a little hastier in the first 20 minutes, but the director and writers might have done this intentionally to communicate to the viewer about the tedious process of getting information and during the later part of the movie this point is brought back to emphasize on the reason that they could not confirm the identity of Osama in his house due to the stricter detention rules and the tedious process. This might also be intentional but the background score or the lack of it did not work for me. May be the creative team might have thought this way it may look more realistic or just could not find the right theme they liked. Again the hierarchy and the working process of CIA is repeated in the most generic way and also plays the underdog card to its advantage. One more aspect I did not expect was the amount of screen time given for the actual raid itself. Based on the trailer I assumed they might just open the door to the compound and rest is history, but they actually go through the entire process of entry and exit which was good.Perfect pacing, attention to detail and a fantastic lead performance.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Overrated, but still OK.","Zero Dark Thirty follows the extensive 10-year search for Osama Bin Laden by a persuasive CIA agent called Maya played by Jessica Chastain.I had pre conceived notions that this film was going to be good. I had read reviews before hand and the main complaints were that it was slow and boring at the beginning and it picked up incredibly fast and became great at the end. For me it was the other way around. I loved the first half, however overplayed it was, and didn't enjoy the second half as much. I personally found this film to be very overrated and it's failed attempts at tension just didn't fit. And supposedly everything in this film is more truer to life than any other based on real events films, which is ironic because I didn't like Argo due to it's dramatized ending.I wasn't the biggest fan of The Hurt Locker, I tend to disapprove of shaky camera-work and just didn't find any the characters intriguing. That wasn't necessarily the case here, as I found Maya to be interesting, and then when it drifted away from her struggle for about 30 minutes the whole film seemed like it went downhill fast. And, to be honest, Jessica Chastain was great and all, but she wasn't as fantastic as everyone claims. Also, in my head, the climactic scene played out a lot better but when I saw it, I felt no climax.

24/30,"""Zero Dark Thirty"" captures the decade-long manhunt for Osama bin Laden, the terrorist responsible for 9/11. I was pleasantly surprised about how poignant, elegant and sophisticated this film was. I expected a classic kill-everybody type of violent hollywood movies but it was quite far from that. The movie felt real and personal as there wasn't really too much violence for the sake of violence and it tried to depict civilians and the countries in a candid way. Jessica Chastain was super solid in this film. The cinematography and the overall style was very well-directed and I appreciated that (although I didn't love how dark it was in the actual manhunt scene but that did make it feel more visceral and realistic). I was also amazed about the effort it took to actually take down bin Laden. Immense amount of pressure as the politics around terrorism shifted and the level of patience required to truly attempting to find a needle in the haystack were all depicted excellently in this film. Not to mention the actual dangers of working and living in Pakistan, even for non-military personnel.Aside from the many controversies surrounding this movie including torture depiction (which I thought was done well), historical accuracies, I think the movie makes a powerful statement on the war against terror. You can't help but think at some point - all of this work for one man? How empty it must feel after finally getting him and Chastain killed that ending scene. So far, this is my favorite piece of film portraying the Middle East conflict. Loved it!",8.0,Anonymous,History
So that's why it took ten years,"Originally meant to show the unsuccessful 10-year hunt for Osama bin Laden, Katherine Bigelow's film was hastily rewritten to include his execution. The rationale for this film, so soon after the event, was to explore the effects that history's greatest manhunt had on the woman who led the chase. That's what we were told. After watching two-thirds, you realise that actually this is – and I don't necessarily have a problem with it – a celebration of bin Laden's death.That said, there's no overt triumphalism in the dramatisation. A good thing, too. This unique story in America's history has inherent significance, which any trace of Hollywood jingoism would cheapen.Jessica Chastain assumes the daunting lead character Maya, the CIA op who pursued 'UBL' (the US gives cool nicknames even to its enemies) when everyone else lost faith. There are dangers in being too true to your character. It's a very reserved performance. I didn't notice much acting, and I suspect it is the character, not the characterisation, which is drawing attention.ZDT deals with the same subject matter as Bigelow's directly previous film, The Hurt Locker. But whilst THL took place in the field, where Jeremy Renner was intrepidly disabling bombs as we prayed for him not to explode, ZDT takes place mostly in CIA 'black site' locations, makeshift offices and soulless boardrooms.Flashing through key milestones in the hunt – meetings, interrogations, suicide bombings – the one insight you come away with is why it took the most advanced military nation in history 10 years to do the job. This mission wasn't a priority. Perhaps that's why there was such a small team with inadequate financing. Maya suggested dropping a bomb on the Pakistani compound despite their uncertainty that UBL was there, but the powers that be demurred due to changing politics.The torture scenes – the big talking point – are underwhelming. The guy committing the waterboarding, played by Jason Clarke, is a hip young Doctor, uncomfortable in meting out pain but only does so as a last resort. 'If you lie, I hurt you' he tells a suspect, in a pleading not pleasure-seeking tone. The suggestion that showing them somehow condones the practice is absurd. These scenes are necessary for drama and realism.Despite my overall disappointment, I felt the last half hour, a step-by-step re-enactment of the 12:30 a.m. attack, was the most palpably tense and suspenseful sequence I saw last year. And the sound was absolutely deafening. I'll be buying the DVD for that part alone.Although never boring, ZDT is often draining. It is over-hyped and overrated, securing its box office success solely on the premise. But the award ceremonies, the ultimate judge, are giving the film the lukewarm reception it actually deserves.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Not one of Bigelow's best,"(2012) Zero Dark Thirty
DOCU DRAMA WARAnyone expecting this to be another desert war movie like Bigelow's previous film ""The Hurt Locker"" will be gravely disappointed since it centers on CIA operatives involving the whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden. Shown at times like a docu-drama with no plot and by accordingly to one person who's also a CIA operative, she is being played by Jessica Chastain which during the first few minutes has one of the detainees getting tortured or abused in exchange for information. Now, I just want to say that the controversy regarding torture tactics/ methods has been used in movies before, some are based on fact- some not. The viewers who are offended by this practice either hasn't seen enough movies about it since I can name about 3 movies that does this too which're ""Battle Of Algiers"", ""Death And The Maiden"" and ""Prisoners"", or that viewers may have thought of other ethical ways of obtaining information as well as ignore practices practiced by extremists since in this particular film, it appears these particular extremists do have a secret pact to keep vital information to themselves, and keeping them in a cell doesn't seem to do anything if suicidal explosions continue to happen before and after the fact throughout the world including India, Great Britain and of course USA. Now, this ""passable"" rating does not mean that the movie is bad, it just means that I had different expectations and different accounts regarding the events such as the SEAL Team that executed Bin Laden strategizing and performing their route multiple times since it was kind of like a fortress, and in this film ""all"" we were given is just the model of the household where Bin Laden's been hiding. I mean, where's this rigorous training we've heard so much about! And because Bin Laden was actually executed by SEAL Team Six, I would've preferred to have seen the tough rigid training they had to endure before performing the mission took place, and this film only based on the accounts by one person, and that is Maya played by Jessica Chastain. Did the information such as discs hard drives, files that SEAL Team Six obtained from the location where Osama bin Laden's been shot ever come out of it for their was no aftermath. Did it led to more arrests? Where's CIA director Leon Panetta and David Petraeus, how much are they involved in all of this? The movie never explains for it sometimes feels somewhat restrained making viewers asking more questions, and I can understand why if other people who were also involved did not want to get involve into the filming preparation that led up to... How can a single person find Bin Laden when it also has to involve many others for it should be perceived as a group effort and not so much as a single one. This film was never boring but after the movie was over, I was still baffled despite the end result and hoping for an aftermath for the film never gave us one.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Very exhilarating!!,"I believed that it was a terrible idea to make this film and, even after having watched and thoroughly enjoyed it, still believe (albeit, to a lesser degree) it might not have been the best idea. Certain things don't need to be publicized. However, the movie itself is terrific. It doesn't matter that all the details may not have been completely accurate. The point was to make a movie about how Bin Laden was captured and they managed to do it well. Every element is well executed and Chastain really made a name for herself (and definitely a fan) with her performance. I really felt like I was part of all the operations taking place. And the level of pride and patriotism evoked is an achievement in itself. Not only that, my heart was pumping throughout and especially towards the end. I would highly recommend this to anyone and would gladly watch it a second and even a third time. Watched 04/05-04/06/2013, written 08/08/2013.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Showtime,"I meditate while watching most films, simple mindful attention to breath. I do this while cooking or walking the dog, it isn't a big thing. Anyway, a recurring notion is that things are both there and relative, it's nothing new but you actually feel it happen and go away, the nagging mind as it complicates the story of what is plainly there.So I am open to films that paint a relative truth, or in some way the mind at work. I like to think I'd be a fan of this film as originally intended, or at least until news of Abbottabad. We have a woman who obsesses for years over what she wants to be true, at the cost of having a life. We see her living inside a maze of labyrinthine, ambiguous information, framed small in front of gigantic satellite screens.Looking, searching, waiting.Creating in your mind the story that you want to see, a cinematic subject. Ostensibly to high purpose, but in actuality?I'd like to think that was the film as originally intended. Then, on May 2nd, Bin Laden was reported dead. So now the filmmakers had to have closure. In cinematic terms, it had to be revamped from a Blowup of sorts to All President's Men, from open-ended examination of perception to a procedural where intuitive logic wins.To Bigelow's credit, she masterfully handles the Abbottabad raid, with silence (bar a few shouted orders which wouldn't happen if you know the Seals), terrified loss in the children and wives, mute astonishment in the killer, and fleeting glimpses of the killing and body. She frames in the most poignant scene of the film, the CIA heroine lost and empty now that's all done.Unlike the simple-minded Argo, there is no sense of patriotic triumph, or even much relief in any of this, and the way we experience the fight, foggy as the ensuing White House reports of it, and see the dead Osama mirrors in a way our understanding of the situation—we haven't seen the body, but we're told it's him. That's the published story.So you'll decide what use you have for it.Pondering on this for a few days, I've decided I frankly have none. It isn't a bad film, no. Strictly as procedural, it's well made but uninteresting, even silly in spots and it lacks the cinematic space I seek in the best films. However, as a broader study on relative truths? It is both interesting and complicated.But it isn't complicated because the art is, Bigelow is generally a straight-forward gal. It is ethically and politically so, starting with the simple fact that we got the staged images before public disclosure of the real ones.It's still a story at this point, issued to Bigelow by an agency whose very purpose is to complicate truths. I am implying nothing beyond this simple fact, but as it is, served as 'real', it only exploits the fact that we don't know, masterfully so. So the filmmaker sets up questions, that she can dodge by alternating between 'journalism' (that we can't verify anyway) and artistic license.It feels sneaky to me, no real use for it.",,Anonymous,History
Near perfect,"This has everything I want from a film and I'd say it achieves near perfection. Bigelow makes some incredibly good choices about how to tell this story: the slow build, watching the inner-workings of the intelligence community, the evolution of political attitudes. The soundtrack is phenomenal with powerful horns underlying a lot of the tension and the finish is both understated and climactic. Chastain is brilliant as an uncompromising CIA operative who seems to treat her role as an unenjoyable calling.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Not perfect, but good enough.","This film has received a lot of gripe for not being historically accurate, specifically because it included scenes that included EIT's (Enhanced Interrogation Techniques). Unfortunately those that criticize this are surprisingly ignorant, or purposefully deceitful. If you want convincing evidence that EIT's were instrumental in keeping the world safe and in limiting terrorists, you must check out the book Hard Measures from Jose A. Rodriguez the former chief of the CIA's clandestine service.As far as the action sequences and the plot line go it is as good as can be expected from Hollywood. They are intense, well choreographed and get the point across. Of course they depict some of the most secretive and poorly known groups in our intelligence and military services so the fidelity is always suspect as it was likely someone's interpretation. As a soldier myself, I always find inconsistencies and dramatic twists that affect the accuracy and veracity of these kinds of films, but none that necessitate discussion here.Overall the gestalt of what transpired is all there. Bad guy does something terrible, we dedicate a wonderful group of highly trained and completely committed men and women to finding and killing him, and at the end it all works out with the bad guy being dead.I recommend that you see this film, it's definitely worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Long but interesting, a must watch","Zero Dark Thirty, directed by Kathryn Bigelow, is a gripping portrayal of the manhunt that led to the death of Osama Bin Laden, a moment in history that resonated globally. The film, almost immediately produced after the real events it depicts, offers a window into the intricate, years-long process that culminated in one of the most famous military operations in recent history. It not only recreates the moment of Bin Laden's death but also delves into the detailed intelligence work, the agonizing bureaucracy, and the moral complexities that defined this monumental task.The movie boasts a star-studded cast, featuring James Gandolfini, Chris Pratt, Mark Strong, and Kyle Chandler, among others. The sheer number of recognizable actors reflects the significance of the story being told, and it's easy to see why they were drawn to this project. The film's gravity and relevance to modern history would naturally attract such talent. However, despite the strong ensemble cast, the heart of the movie revolves around Maya, played with incredible intensity by Jessica Chastain. Her performance is the emotional and intellectual backbone of the narrative, embodying relentless determination and focus as a CIA agent who dedicates years of her life to tracking down Bin Laden.Chastain's portrayal of Maya is nothing short of stellar. She captures a character who is deeply immersed in the world of intelligence, showing a woman whose life is consumed by the hunt for Bin Laden. Maya is single-minded in her mission, and Chastain gives her a quiet, simmering intensity that makes her both formidable and deeply human. As the driving force behind the manhunt, Maya's character is central to the film's pacing, and her emotional arc keeps the viewer engaged throughout the lengthy runtime.At 2 hours and 37 minutes, Zero Dark Thirty is undeniably a long film, and while it covers a wide span of time, the pacing can feel uneven at moments. There were times when I found myself wondering what year or month the events on screen were taking place. The movie spans nearly a decade, compressing a vast amount of information and events into its runtime. For some viewers, this rapid progression through the years might be a bit disorienting. That said, the film's attention to detail is remarkable, and while the timeline may be hard to follow at times, those details-the precision of the intelligence work, the bureaucratic hurdles, and the psychological toll on the characters-add a layer of realism that enriches the overall experience.One of the most striking aspects of the film is its unflinching depiction of the inner workings of the CIA and the U. S. government. Zero Dark Thirty doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of intelligence work, including the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, the ethical dilemmas faced by operatives, and the often murky line between good and evil. The film raises thought-provoking questions about the cost of justice and the moral compromises that come with it. It forces the audience to confront the uncomfortable reality that believing you are on the ""right side"" doesn't always translate into righteous actions.This moral ambiguity is one of the film's greatest strengths. The characters, particularly Maya, grapple with the weight of their decisions, and the film subtly critiques the idea of a clear-cut hero in a world where every action has profound consequences. Kathryn Bigelow does an excellent job of showing the psychological toll of this work, and the film invites viewers to question the ethical boundaries of the war on terror. It's a sobering reminder that history is rarely black and white, and that even when pursuing a just cause, the methods employed can be morally questionable.While Zero Dark Thirty thrives on its procedural elements and moral complexity, it also succeeds on an emotional level. The performances across the board are excellent, with each actor conveying the strain, fear, and emotional exhaustion that comes with working in high-stakes intelligence. The tension in the film is palpable, and even though we all know the outcome-the death of Bin Laden-the journey there is fraught with uncertainty and suspense. The final sequence, which depicts the raid on Bin Laden's compound, is executed with meticulous attention to detail and is as gripping as any action sequence in modern cinema.Despite the film's many strengths, I did find myself occasionally questioning the accuracy of certain events or processes depicted on screen. Given the classified nature of much of the material, it's hard to know exactly where the line between fact and creative license lies. Nonetheless, Zero Dark Thirty feels authentic in its portrayal of the secrecy, the frustrations, and the high-stakes nature of the operation. The film doesn't aim to provide all the answers, but rather to give a glimpse into the labyrinthine world of counterterrorism.In the end, Zero Dark Thirty is a movie that everyone should watch-not just because it depicts a significant moment in recent history, but because it asks important questions about how that history was made. It's a film that doesn't simply glorify victory but instead offers a nuanced look at the cost of that victory. This is a story that all of us, in some way, lived through, and watching it unfold on screen is a reminder of the complexities that define our modern world.While not perfect in every aspect, Zero Dark Thirty is an intriguing and thought-provoking film that demands your attention. The performances are stellar, the direction is tight, and the story is one that will continue to resonate for years to come. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 for its intense portrayal of real-world events, strong performances, and the way it forces us to confront the ethical dilemmas of our time.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Insanely well done,"Who knew that the director of Point Break would make one of the best films I have seen so far. You thought the Hurt Locker was good.Now the Hurt Locker when I saw it, I couldn't find a story out of it. This movie is based on true events, so there is an excess of story. The actual manhunt for UBL goes back to the Clinton administration in the late 90s. The story here actually starts in 2003, and the screenplay does a good job in actually keeping the progression of the plot pretty linear. You can actually keep up with it and it trims a lot of the excess information. The movie focused solely on one narrative from the point of view of a single CIA agent who is obsessed with finding a certain courier.Now the actress who plays the CIA agent is very solid, I really enjoyed her screen presence. She really convinces you that she is thorough, dedicated and methodical and at the same time you still notice that she is hot. And the supporting cast were pretty good too.You will also notice that some of the lines are kind of cheesy or the delivery of them were cheesy. For example 'he is one of the disappeared ones','I'm the mother****er who found the compound', 'what convinced you? (guy waves his hands around) her confidence' or 'I'm not your friend. I'm here to break you'. Seriously we didn't need lines for the trailer.The authenticity is what really struck me. I am kind of suspicious as to how production manage to reproduce the surveillance footage of the compound. Hmm. Also the torture scenes, wow, they really make you uncomfortable. Is the film pro or anti-torture? Or is it that they just want to present you with the hard truth? Still the director decided to take some artistic liberties, such as the depiction of the Marriott bombing, which you will see what I'm talking about or actually notifying the SEALs who their target is days before takeoff to name a few.Speaking of which the last half hour is intense. We all know what happens so this isn't really a spoiler. The realism of the event was phenomenal, showing every maneuver and breach etc. So if your expecting some sort of Rambo like shoot out... umm no.What I actually really liked about this film was that it really didn't on the religious aspect that much, in fact barely at all. Generally films about Islamic terrorism like Executive Decision, The Siege, Body of Lies and The Kingdom always have this message of religious tolerance. This movie, like me, doesn't care about that at all. It just outlines who the bad guys are and how they operate. It doesn't explore the topic of their ideological motivations that much, but in one or two scenes they do talk about their financial motivations.All in all this is a really well done, gritty production and I don't think personally it glorifies or antagonizes anyone. It just shows what happened. OK there maybe a small chance where some guy in the theater may go 'USA! USA!'.",10.0,Anonymous,History

It shows some finality in the fact that the worlds so called biggest ""Terrorist"" is actually dead. After years of hunting him down.Good fiction movie, worth the watch. But i don't buy into this war for a second. Bush is a crook, just like his old man. The buildings of the world trade center were designed to withstand the impact of up to 5 707's, possibly more.. 3 of the towers were basically demolished. It just so happened to be on the same as the U.S government was participating in a training exercise designed to help them deal with the exact same imminent threat. Making it perfect cover for the so called ""Terrorist planes""Sorry, bit off topic here. But, whenever i watch movies like this it just makes me think of the actual facts even more.Remember, if you want facts & facts only. Watch Zeitgeist the movie. This war has been nothing but a hoax in many of the smartest peoples minds.Also remember George Bush himself, directly after September 11, he is giving a public speech. Discussing ""The terror & The terrorists"" He says something along the lines of ""Sadam Hussein, I mean.. Osama Bin Laden has no where to hide""Showing, he always had the thought of invading Iraq before Osama.

Zero Dark Thirty — A tracking tale told from the basic ground work point of view,"Zero Dark Thirty is telling the story about a possible series of event that could have led to the assassination of Osama bin Laden. Unlike what the subject matter and the trailer could lead us to believe, this is not a military movie or even a high octane flick. No, this is the relentless pursuit of a single goal by the CIA, and all the ground work it required. The point of view adopted is somewhat unusual, but absolutely excellent.At first, you are shocked by the initial introduction to what it really meant originally. After capturing your attention, the film pulls you deep within the folds of the operation, the paperwork, the interrogations, the videos, the calls, the meetings, the orders... It sounds boring, but somehow, it keeps you riveted.The actual military action is but a small part of the whole scenario and it is treated in the same business like manner, it's not an adrenaline rush. Neither is it a detached affair. You really feel the intensity. The whole flick has very personal feel, you get into the shoes of those working on the whole operation, from every perspectives: administrative, management, investigation, interrogation... It's not just because we follow that one CIA agent, played so brilliantly by Jessica Chastain, but because we get to know everybody, even some individual in the enemy camp.I can't find even one thing to say wrong about it.

"A gripping, suspenseful thriller","Jessica Chastain's performance is worth the price of admission, just saying. Her performance makes me debate weather or not a CIA operative like her existed. She's just a great character to watch. The torture scene is the most controversial of the film, but in my opinion, the one in Casino Royale is worse. Jason Clarke gives a very underrated performance as the torturer. Even though i've seen worse, it is still a very tough scene to watch, surprisingly, he's the comic relief. The latter quarter of the film could just be it's own film (I won't tell you why, but you will think that too after it's done). Everyone else though, is very out of the way. Chastain's the star of course but even so, they all are pawns in her game against Bin Laden. To be honest, I kind of like that.

"Intelligent, gritty and riveting.","Filmmaking duo Katheryn Bigelow (director) and Mark Boal (screenwriter) follow-up their astonishing The Hurt Locker with another gritty, authentic inspection of the individuals faced with the most extraordinary duties during the Middle Eastern conflict. Exchanging a bomb disposal sergeant in Afghanistan for a female CIA agent (Jessica Chastain in an Oscar-nominated role) striving to find Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan, Zero Dark Thirty has a more emphasised thriller streak but retains the grounded realism and unsettlingly deep devotion to truth of character that made Locker such a riveting experience. We all know how the search for Bin Laden ends, however this film cares more about the journey; about the mistakes made, the chances taken, the opportunities missed and the decisions pondered over at great length. The tension is built remarkably well and the sparse pay-offs are smartly chosen, with Bigelow refusing to sensationalise the events though never cheating her audience either. Chastain is understandably garnering the plaudits but there is a wealth of small yet pivotal supporting performances that are essential to the film's success: Mark Strong, Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Jennifer Ehle and Joel Edgerton, among others, elevate proceedings.

A Fantastic Fiction Based on a Historic Event,"IMHO this is the absolute worst of movies. They had the biggest story to tell since the death of Hitler and they made a day time soap out of it.Here are my reasons: 1) Bad/overacting acting...by almost everyone except Jessica (Maya)2) Who writes such script?...sounds like a school play. Bad dialog...""I am the mother*****r who found that house.""....was the rock bottom which to me sounded like a daytime soap.3) Factual inaccuracies abound...starting from the premise that torture yielded actionable info leading to OBL. Also if you want to show enhanced interrogation show it properly. I remember torture scenes from Syriana that churned my stomach. EDIT If you look into the torture scenes one detainee is being made to stand forcibly by tying his arms to the ceiling....fine. But in almost every scene that was transitioning showing his arms bound to the ceiling...his arm kept moving too much upwards in one scene to very slack in another that it almost got quite distracting for me to focus on anything but the angle of the arms. This is clearly an amateur mistake. I am sure others will pick up similar other silly things. Perhaps the only reason I will re-watch the movie when it is available in DVD is to get kicks out of them.4) A string of incidents we all read in the papers starting from the bombing of the Karachi Marriot, to double agent CIA suicide bombing, to unmasking of CIA operative in Pakistan after a shooting incident have been strung together as if it is a fact that they all had something to do with the hunt for OBL. Somehow the characters were forced to be a part of all the incidents.5) There is a scene where the CIA deputy director gives everyone a dressing down on how incompetent a job they are doing in tracking OBL and thwarting terrorist acts...and he slams the table as he makes a point. EDIT This outburst was rendered somewhat comical due to the timing of the table slamming which if you watch closely is slightly off-timed and that millisecond difference made it look fake/comical emotional outburst.6) The depiction of what was perhaps a nail-biting raid on OBL residence was slow, boring and lacked drama. Katherine Bigelow should learn from movies like Green Zone, Syriana, Argo, Rendition how to maintain taught tension (even though viewers know how it ends).7) Also this happens right under the nose of Pak Agencies and nothing except a few passing reference to the ISI is made. What was the relationship between the CIA and ISI, the spy Vs spy angle the back channel communications or failure of back channels...so much have not been explored. (see movies like Fourth Protocol, Quiet American, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and you will get an idea what I mean).This movie depicts arguably one of the biggest historical events since the death of Hitler and fails in historic proportions in doing so. Honestly this movie would have been so much better if it came out some 20-25 years later after some of the documents gets declassified and we know for real what actually happened rather than going on a fictional trip where perhaps the only real historically correct event shown was the death of OBL.I sincerely hope someone with better skill, writing ability doing proper research does justice to this historical event and not just pander to the jingoist.",1.0,Anonymous,History

The script is as empty as Jessica Chastain's meant-to-be-hard-ass-meaningful-empty-robot gaze. The editing is a mess - it's unbelievable to me that this is a Hollywood production?! Scenes go absolutely no where. Worst editing and I believe this movie was nominated for Best Editing? How is that possible?! The score(music)and cinematography are equally boring like everything else.This movie is a shill for the United States. Looks and feels like it was hurriedly made without any conscious effort to truly tell the story they (director, screenwriter and producers) claim they are exposing. They're(director, screenwriter and producers)nothing more than shady carnival barkers shouting about how great and powerful the all-knowing all-seeing United States is but like the Wizard of Oz there is nothing behind the curtain, or in this case film.",,Anonymous,History
Jessica Chastain is too beautiful.,"I wish I could believe that one person was doggedly responsible for maintaining the focus on the manhunt (womanhunt?) for Osama. But I cannot. Jessica Chastain says in her IMDb biography that the facts are real, its a real story about this woman. I cannot. Maya, the Heroine is too beautiful to be believable. She's a ""10"" in beauty and a ""10"" in persistence.The soldiers are likable and loyal. They are heroes and all of this action will attract more recruits to the Army. I cannot find any fault or criticism in the way the Director portrayed them.Because this movie does not touch the heartstrings, it is sort of gritty all of the way through, it left me speechless. I watched a one dimensional story with a already known ending. Another dimension could have been portrayed with the (false) story of some lovers. This heroine does not have any friends the movie says. Think of ""Titanic"", an action/drama movie that had a 2nd dimension regarding some lovers tucked into the story. Here we only have persistence and action.I wonder how Muslims view this movie.To be sure, Karen Bigelow is a master crafts-women of action movies. But movie of the year? ""Lincoln"" gave me time to reflect on moral issues, law, the character of Lincoln and other historical facts. This movie ""Zero Dark Thirty"" seems to try to gain something by showing us ""how to torture"". Take the towel, take the water, pour it on the towel. We've learned how to torture.In Lincoln, on the other hand, we saw the manner in which moral gray areas were decided upon. Here in Zero Dark, we see there is a procedure to torturing somebody. Step 1, 2, 3. Pretend to be their friend, then torture them if they don't tell the truth. I think this movie could have had more depth if the moral issue of torture were attended to.I cannot agree that this is movie of the year. It never hit my ""revenge button"" because this is old history. I liked how well it was paced with no slop. It is a well crafted one dimensional action movie that uses a heroine who is too beautiful to be believable. Please, Hollywood, please stop using these gorgeous women to always take our attention away. In this case, it disallowed me to focus on the revenge motive. It glamorized the heroine for her persistence; yet it was the soldiers who were the heroes.I felt that ""The Impossible"" was a more painful movie to watch. I feel that ""Lincoln"" should be a a more likely pick for movie of the year. Sorry audience.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Darkly Compelling,"Zero Dark Thirty opens with a black screen. We hear the distressed voices of Americans immediately after the 9/11 attacks, including many who are still inside the towers. This simple but effective scene draws us completely into the world of Maya, a young woman completely obsessed with finding and killing UBL. The rest of the film details the search for Bin-Laden, a journey filled with innumerable dead-ends.One would think that the search for the world's most wanted man would be a fascinating story, but unfortunately this film doesn't really portray it that way. What we do see are several dialogue scenes filled with incomprehensible jargon, which really prevents the viewer from understanding much. The basic plot points are easy enough to get, but the film is filled with so many details that it sometimes clouds the overall picture. I was hoping this film would completely lift the veil, and shed some light on the search for UBL, but by the end of the movie, I really didn't know much more than when I walked in.As far as acting is concerned, Jessica Chastain is perfect for the lead role. Her character is basically a representation of post-9/11 America; she is determined to find and kill Bin-Laden and isn't willing to make many concessions to get there. I thoroughly enjoyed many of the other actors as well, particularly Jason Clarke, who plays Dan, the only person we see torturing detainees on screen. What's most impressive about both Clarke and Chastain is that they play characters who are almost completely emotionless, yet they still manage to subtly show these character's underlying humanity. Considering that neither of the characters are given any back-story to work with, I'd say that's pretty incredible.Another thing I really enjoyed about this film is its complete lack of a political bias. Every scene is completely objective, which I found remarkably refreshing.A final thing worth mentioning concerns the final hour or so of the film, which depicts American soldiers storming the compound and killing Bin-Laden. This is one of the most exciting, realistic, and enthralling scenes I have ever had the enjoyment of watching; I have never heard a movie-theatre be as quiet as it was during this sequence.To summarize, Zero Dark Thirty is a good film. The first hour can be difficult to watch, as it is basically a combination of torture scenes and hard-to-follow dialogue, but the second half of the film is incredible, and the acting throughout the film makes up for many of the shortcomings in the storytelling. Go see it.RATING: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Not that bad,"I myself don't find this movie was that bad at all. I don't quite understand why people are so against torture of these terrorists. These guys would not show us any mercy when delivering their attacks, and if we want to get relevant info from them we need to use any means necessary to do so. That's only my opinion. I thought the movie was pretty good, mostly because it's based on real events, and the object is to find Bin Laden who I've been told is the man we need to get. I would agree with another reviewer, that a lot of the names thrown out during interrogations could've had more character development, mainly cause it was hard to follow who was who. I got the gist of it, but that was a complaint that I had while watching. Overall a decent Hollywood make of a real event. I'm sure there are plenty of holes, and embellishments, but I'm just a regular movie watcher not a critic in any way other than, was it entertaining or not. I enjoyed it, was engaged, although I initially didn't want to watch it cause of the negative reviews. It felt like watching a movie and not a documentary, which is what I wanted, with factual events.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Worthy of Best Picture!,"I went in to this film with mixed opinions, hearing all the praise but also hearing lots of hate. So I really didn't know what to expect. And, my God, it was fantastic!The film was executed so beautifully. Ever since the first scene I was attached and couldn't keep my eyes off! No doubt about it, Jessica Chastain led this film, she was just brilliant. Watching the film, you knew her character, her personality, and her determination to kill Bin Laden. She was SO strong on her part, and it was by far her best performance. I also have to mention that Jason Clarke was undeniably amazing in the movie. He was terrific for his role(like always), and his performance was so deep. There were also some other actors that didn't stand out as much, but still gave a good performance, like Kyle Chandler, and Mark Duplass, many more.While the acting being so brilliant with every character, I must say the film was shot so extraordinary. Throughout the film I was honestly thinking, ""Wow, this is truly beautiful!"", and it's true because it is. It almost plays out like a documentary- and it makes it feel like one because of the solid performances- because of the shaky cinematography. For some people, the shots and shakiness may get on people's nerves, but I find it absorbing, it keeps it feeling more realistic.I also have been hearing many people saying that the film is too long and boring, and I definitely disagree. I can understand why people are saying this, though, because it IS a very slow-paced movie about the search for Bin Laden. This is no action-thriller(although there are some explosions which are pretty awesome), this is a very slow moving film. But for me, I found it very suspenseful, and the length was just perfect. if anything I thought it was too short, at the end of the film I wanted more!If you want to go see an action-packed thriller with explosions and gun shots every minute of the film, do NOT see this. This is NOT action-packed! i must say,though, the last 40 minutes of this film are just teeth-chattering. This has to be one of the greatest ways to end a film!Anyways, none the less, the film is brilliant. Best movie of the year, I loved it so much! 10/10 for me!!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Ambivalent,"6.5/10 In sum: first 3/4 boring, final quarter is interesting; not worth it, but has good production effectsI thought the Hurt Locker was boring, so I figured this might be along the same lines. It took me 3 weeks of the BluRay sitting by the player to actually force myself to sit down and watch it. So possibly I went into it and it became a self fulfilling prophecy with it being boring.TBH I feel like the movie did a disservice to the story and it made it all so painfully boring. If you're going to watch this movie, skip to the 2 hr in mark. That's when everything is finally interesting.I get the slowness of the movie in illustrating Actress Jessica Chastain's character's difficulty in sleuthing and convincing.

Chastain shines in a so-so film,"Zero Dark Thirty is a retelling of events that ultimately lead to demise of America's number one enemy: Osama Bin Laden. Lead by CIA operative Maya (Chastain), the mission takes about 8 years to be completed, as both sides play their tactics of deception in what appears to be a dead- end confrontation. Kathryn Bigelow directs this Mark Boal script in the fashion that she wants. In a neutral role, Bigelow presents us with what happened in a period stretching from 2003 to 2011, as the US intelligence worked extensively to apprehend the most ruthless terrorist on earth. Jessica Chastain is once again brilliant as her character conveys determination, but also fear and uncertainty as leads come and go. By the end she is the one pushes the most to see her 8 year work be rewarded with the ultimate goal being achieved. As for technical aspects, the sound is used to great extent to support the visuals. Overall the film does tend to drag at points, and the constant documentary-like look on the story adds a little to the toughness i had connecting with it. I applaud it's virtues in filmmaking and the wonderful performance by Chastain, but in the near future i won't look to this movie to impress me.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Of course, terrorism should not be tolerated in any way, but still is appropriate to ask ourselves about roots of such acting.Characters in the movie don't seem real. I did expect more.

No heroics - just another job to do. Bigelow, the director, has done another marvelous job showing our men in action. We may not agree with the politics, but the guys doing the job are great. Me?

An Epic Tale of Current Events and Foreign Policy,"A chronicle of the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden after the September 2001 attacks, and his death at the hands of the Navy S.E.A.L. Team 6 in May 2011.If you look through the message boards on IMDb, you will find accusations of ""jingoism"" and ""American propaganda"" concerning this film. Now, I did not read through the arguments made by these individuals, so maybe they had some valid points. But nowhere in the film did I think this was a propaganda attempt to make America look great. Few people are as critical of American foreign policy as I am (at least in this country), and what I saw was a general presentation of the facts. Agree or disagree with the tactics and methods, but this was probably more or less what actually happened.This film was nominated by the Academy for Best Picture, Best Actress (Jessica Chastain) and Best Original Screenplay. Let us explore these nominations briefly.As far as the Best Picture is concerned, I think the nomination is fair, as this is an epic film and well-made. This could easily made anyone's ""top ten of 2012"" list, so I will not argue against the nomination. However, I find it highly unlikely it will win. (Actually, I am still unclear how ""Hurt Locker"" won.) The picture is great, but not flawless. My biggest issue is actually a personal complaint -- the casting of Chris Pratt. Seeing him only as Andy from ""Parks and Recreation"", I found it hard to take him seriously as the leader of Seal Team Six.Moving on to Jessica Chastain, it pains me to say that she does not deserve this nomination. Chastain is an exceptional actress and has made a name for herself over the last few years, going from unknown to A-list in record time thanks to roles in ""Tree of Life"" and ""Take Shelter"", among others. But this was not an ideal role for her. Every time she cussed, I cringed inside. Some people cuss naturally and some do not -- Chastain does not, and it made it hard for me to believe she was this person. In general, she hardly seemed the part. An intelligent spy, sure... but she seemed so out of place during the ""heavy"" scenes.Now that I have been critical, I feel ready to heap some praise. And that comes with the Best Original Screenplay. Not only was this clearly deserving of the nomination, but it probably has a solid chance of winning. The script was dense, detailed, covered a wide range of places and people. The research that went into such a script is immeasurable. This attention to detail allows the film to work on two levels, too. The general audience (ignorant of world affairs) can see it as a hunt for bin Laden. Those who are more aware of the situation will be able to take in terms like ISI, KSM and various other factoids that the characters spout in reckless abandon. There really is a narrative here, despite the film being called plot less by many (including the Great Ebert).This is not a feel good movie, and it is not the kind of film that I will probably watch a second time. And heck, it might give the false impression that killing Osama bin Laden actually stops terror, which is a terrible mistake. Yet, it is a well-made picture and worth seeing. I fully endorse it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Very bad,"I got tired of watching movies that show things that are not true. While the operation must have been real, not the result. When Saddam was hanged on video was distributed through the network like an epidemic. Bin Laden's only an edited photo with some program. Proof? Only the word of the government, it said there were weapons of mass destruction were never found. Trying to ignore all this and looking at the film as a fiction (or science fiction), I felt very bad performance of Oscar-nominated actress. Very overacted. But hey, it's just my view.

"For God and country... Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo","When you ask yourself ""Is this the same movie I saw ads for?"" it's usually not a good sign but in this case it is. The ads sell Zero Dark Thirty as a pure action movie which it defiantly is not. The hunt for Osama Bin Laden was a long and arduous process and director Kathryn Bigelow does a remarkable job illustrating the devotion and sacrifice that was required to finally find him. It's a unflinching look at the tactics and internal politics that evolved over the years it to bring Bin Laden to justice.There is a sense of of tension and urgency that drives the movie forward from the first moments of the movie. As Maya, Jessica Chastain ably acts as the fulcrum around which a strong ensemble cast revolves. Her strong portrayal of an agent who's determination turns to obsession in her ceaseless campaign to find Bin Laden is central to the success of this movie.Bigelow has made one of 2012's best crafted films that should be in contention for much recognition (and rightfully so) during award season.

"How Hollywood navigates black ops, geopolitical espionage and covert vested interests","How should Hollywood approach real world stories about black ops, geopolitical espionage and covert vested interests, around which whirl clouds of doubt and conspiracy? According to Zero Dark Thirty, you tell something close to the official story and let it stand or fall on its own merits.Events seem, at least initially, to be barely evaluated and leave much interpretation up to the viewer. But then, what to include and what not to include? While being taken to task for suggesting that information gained via torture was effective in revealing Bin Laden's whereabouts, all Zero Dark Thirty really does is show that it occurred behind the USA's delusions of moral ascendancy, regardless of the intelligence outcomes.The potential for a heroic narrative is allowed to unravel somewhat. The film's authors lend a hand by portraying the hunt for Bin Laden as a bitter obsession that hollowed out the life of its female protagonist (in truth a melange of several female agents who drove the long quest for retribution and closure).More at moviedump.org",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Thorough, absorbing but demanding (maybe over so) true life account","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningEven after the tenth anniversary of 9/11 hadn't quite approached, I can still remember the jubilation and news domination of Osama bin Laden's demise at the hand of the US army unit that took him out. To this day, in the mind's of many, it's still incomprehensible that the American military, with all it's might, couldn't find a guy living in a cave, and that it took so long, and so much man power. I suppose it is one of those things where you'd think to yourself what a great movie it would have made. After making an account of the first consequence of the 9/11 attacks, in the shape of war drama The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow here invests a lot of time and energy in to this account of the hunt for bin Laden, an epic saga that fundamentally holds your attention, but not, necessarily, for nearly three hours.We open with CIA interrogator Dan (Jason Clarke) putting a captured suspect through his paces, setting an uneasy opening demonstrating the uncompromising American resolve for answers. Enter our main character Maya (Jessica Chastain), recruited straight out of high school, observing these methods for her training, and agreeing with their effectiveness as a means to an ends. From here, she sticks with the program through thick and thin, gaining experience and intelligence, using her new found skills to help eliminate terrorist cells and capture suspects, before setting her sights on the biggest test of all- capturing Osama bin Laden, the big daddy of Al Qaeda.The film takes a gamble by casting two relative unknowns in the lead roles, while sidelining more prominent acting talent, such as Mark Strong and the late James Gandolfini in basically cameos. With this in mind, it's certainly a blessing that it elicits a strong performance from Chastain as the driven, no nonsense under graduate who becomes even more fierce, wanting bin Laden's blood rather than merely his capture, after losing a friend to a suicide bombing. The performances certainly not being a problem, the trouble is the film's over reliance on the current trend of constantly skipping back/forward in time and outlining it on the screen, as well as giving titles to each new chapter. Somehow, it makes an already complex and very demanding story even more laborious , especially so with it's length in mind.It's a story that demanded to be told, which the movie going public and anyone interested in world affairs would have a natural interest in, and Bigelow has probably done as good a job as could be hoped with this story. You're just left wondering what it would have took to have managed a perfect adaptation. ***",7.0,Anonymous,History

soulless,"What is surprising for this two and a half hours film depicting the search after Bin Laden, the planning and the execution of the action that killed him is how superficial it is in its approach. It may be that the level of expectations was set too high by the previous film by Kathryn Bigelow, the Oscar decorated The Hurt Locker one of the best if not the best film made up to now about the war in Iraq, about the men in uniform involved in it, about the moral and human impact of the war on the people who carry it. Zero Dark Thirty is a very well made film which also proves that making very well a film is not enough for the result to be a piece of great cinema.The film follows a decade of mostly covered activity carried by the CIA in tracing Bin Laden and punishing him. The film tells the story of the searches, with the ups and down, the false tracks, the mistakes, the labyrinths of lies and the misunderstandings caused by the cultural differences. Good action, well told, well filmed. It is just that we are expecting to see something else - because it is a film by Bigelow, because in a film about tracing and punishing Bin Laden we should learn something that we do not know from the stories in the press about tracing and punishing Bin Laden.It may be that the intention of the director was to provide the human interest by pointing to the character of the principal hero - the determined and fearless CIA agent played by Jessica Chastain. Too little, too schematic, I am afraid. Who is agent Maya? What makes her so obsessed with her mission? Where did she learn to fight and win her way in a world and a profession of males? There are a few moments where we are hinted to moral questions about the methods of interrogation, or when the agent mask trembles for a moment leaving room to human feelings, but none of these elements of 'softness' are pursued. All we are left is a character that despite spending two and a half hours on the big screen in front of us and despite good acting does not let us know more about her soul than a routine TV detective hero. Oh, yes - and the memory of a scene of confrontation with James Gandolfini (in the role of the Director of the CIA) little time before the great good-bye of the actor.Much less than expected.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Chilling, And Engrossing Without Adding Unnecessary Glorification To Its True Story.","By far, this movie has the most gripping and riveting story among all political thrillers I've seen so far. I can't believe that I was so invested watching a movie from one of my least favorite genres. That's largely due to Boal and Bigelow's intelligent script that offers a knotted, nuanced, realistic, and somewhat honest look into a real story about war on terror. Each small detail that leads to another is more convincing than the last. And however the plot is very intricate, I never felt that it was so convoluted that can be difficult to follow.Of course, we get a one-sided look into the real events, but the movie didn't try to be patriotic at all. There are quite a lot of torture scenes at the beginning that are really intense and brutal.The use of hand-held camera Kathryn Bigelow famous for did more harm than good in Zero Dark Thirty. Aside from that I often find the documentary style so distracting and also so obtrusive, Bigelow's reliance on this style deprived Zero Dark Thirty from being one of the best-looking movies of the decade. For Greig Fraser, the director of photography, did an amazing job capturing some of the most stunning images I've seen recently.
That being said, this very documentary style gave the movie a somewhat realistic look that only paid off in two situations; the interrogation and torture scenes, and a couple of surprising sequences that are truly heart-pounding. The thing that reminded me a little bit of Villeneuve's Sicario.Speaking of Sicario, this movie suffers from the same issue I had with Sicario. Which is giving so much attention, nay , priority to the moral aspect of the protagonist. But the major issue is that, Maya, our main character, is an entirely flawed and poorly-written character. Without delving into details, there are central changes happened to the character that are as clichéd as they are contradictory, and very very hard to swallow. Putting the blame on Chastain is a crime I won't commit. As she gave one of her best performances in her career. An Oscar-nominated performance that could have been Oscar-worthy unless it was dedicated to an otherwise terribly-written role that made Chastain herself confused as much as I was.The editing in general is pretty elegant and masterful. But the sound editing is what stand out for me. This movie has one of the best uses of the J-cut ever!Nail-biting, nuanced, and thoroughly captivating, Zero Dark Thirty sees Kathryn Bigelow delivering one of the most interesting based-on-true-story movies that is, sadly, lacks a well-wrought, and relatable protagonist.(7.5/10)",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Brilliant Ending But Uneven Beginning,"23 February 2013. The very beginning black screen of the movie with only the audio 911 calls seemed to be, understandably chaotic, but in the directorial use of such audio chaos, it also provoked unnecessary confusion and detachment from the more reflective emotional aftershock of the event. Oddly enough the physical violence of the interrogation scenes were tame compared to the fictional violence of most action, adventure thrillers such as Daniel Craig's brutal beating in Skyfall (2012) and even such actions as urinating on the detainees which was widely reported by the news media at the time were omitted. Jessica Chastain's character was also uncharacteristically stereotypical during the early torture scenes with the requisite facial expressions of supposedly suppressed disgust. Her character throughout the movie was underdeveloped with no backstory, not significant revelation of her attitude, motivation except implicit hatred and revenge. There is the bus explosion which is also oddly inconsistently muted and only indirectly shot. All these minor flaws only contribute to any uneven flow and tempo of most the movie until the final insurgent sequences. By the end, there are two shots, one an editing flow problem where one moment the American insurgent team or on the ground and then suddenly in the air and finally Chastain's character is asked where she'd like to go with no response and no shot of the airman who asked the question before the fade out.Comparatively speaking, the ending and climax of the movie is technically similar to the amazing, ground breaking beginning sequence of Saving Private Ryan (1998) and has some of the visceral compelling intensity of Black Hawk Down (2001). Yet in some ways, most of the the cinematography isn't quite as densely raw and rich as United 93 (2006), Body of Lies (2008), or Munich (2005). As discussed, the movie is also missing the rich depth of the humanity of the characters as portrayed in Breach (2007), Jarhead (2005), Manhunter (1986), and even Apocalypse Now (1979) or the balanced depiction of the characters on both sides of this military conflicts as better presented in Green Zone (2010) which also had several strong military action scenes. As for Argo (2012), Zero Dark Thirty's contemporary movie, Argo was more consistent, more emotionally riveting, and had more connective depth. If only Kathryn Bigelow as a director has been able to learn from director Sidney Lumet's fine black and white gripping and tense focus in Fail-Safe (1964) what could have this movie become.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Needed More Character and Less Story Development,","Zero Dark Thirty is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's very intriguing, revolving around a bittersweet true story that will surely be of interest to anyone, Jessica Chastain was given a very serious job when she was cast in the lead role of such a heavy film, but she does a fantastic job, she's the highlight and holds the whole film together, her emotion is real and a sense of tragedy and hurt is always evident in her face and voice. I didn't like this movie as much as most people did, and that's mainly because it was too interested in its story, though it was definitely very interesting true events, it should have focused on its characters much more, there is a lot we don't find out about the main cast, the main thing I wanted to know more about was Maya and Dan's past, they are all left as blank canvas towards the end, which despite the victorious finale, still feels significantly anti-climatic. The big moment of the whole movie is a disappointment, once the soldiers finally go to pursue Osama bin Laden, it could have been much more intense and it should have been longer, this was the scene everyone was waiting for, and it sadly comes and goes quite fast and holds back on being as thrilling and exciting as it could have been, it should have been at least an hour long. While it definitely has its flaws and is unfulfilling, Zero Dark Thirty boasts terrific performances and an intriguing story, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama if you ever see it on television or Netflix.An intelligence officer's intuition and hard work helps the U.S. to track down Osama bin Laden.Best Performance: Jessica Chastain Worst Performance: Édgar Ramírez",7.0,Anonymous,History
The greatest manhunt in history 8/10,"""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a really well made film. About the biggest and most complicated manhunt ever done in history. The ensemble of actors is amazing and each one of them gives a great performance, From Jessica Chastain to James Gandolfini. The movie delivers a lot of tension and suspense moments, it gave me chills near the ending. The story was interesting and as long as the plot moved on the more creative and perfect it got. The final sequence of the film was pure cinema, a perfect example of how to create tension in a drama film. Overall this was a really good movie based on actual events. Kathryn Bigelow has done a good job.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Realistic and educational but not helped by the pacing,"We are all familiar with Osama bin Laden and the story of his decade-long evasion from justice but few will have known the details of the painstaking hunt that lead to his capture and killing. 'Zero Dark Thirty' tells that story and does it with great realism and attention to detail - it is fascinating to watch, especially if you aren't familiar with the events in this film beforehand.The film does a good job at remaining informative and realistic while never losing sight of the fact that it is a movie with the purpose of entertaining. It does have its flaws though and my main criticism would be the running time. I understand the need to tell the story as it happened and not cut corners, but at over two-and-a-half hours the film is too long and, despite the fascinating topic at hand, the pacing means you really do feel it.'Zero Dark Thirty' is a informative and necessary film that gives us a detailed insight into the decade-long hunt for the world's most wanted man. A very good film about a fascinating true story.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Working Within Limits of Reality,"Disclaimer: Bigelow had to work within certain limits, as Pakistan was not about to allow her to film the tale in Pesh, Rawalpindi, Islamabad or Abbottabad. Thus, one hears a lot more Arabic than Urdu. Poetic license.The movie, about the hunt for and killing of Osama bin Laden, is fairly accurate in both telling the tale and conveying the manner in which intel work is carried out. Yes, it can be boring to an outsider or a movie-goer more accustomed to exploding vehicles and infallible superheroes. Real intel work often requires building on tiny bits and pieces of information, drawn from many sources, and often difficult to collate. Perhaps trying to depict that reality does not make for exciting film, but it is pretty darn close to reality.Some critics argue that 'Maya', the main character, was one dimensional and never fully allowed to develop. Ironically, that is EXACTLY what the real 'Maya' was like, and by the way, she looks nothing like Jessica Chastain. There is some befuddlement that in the film (SPOILER?) she claims she 'was recruited out of high school'. She wasn't recruited, she joined. She was not an ops officer, which is what most people would consider the typical spy. She was a Targeter, which is an updated version of an employee who used to be called an 'IA' or Intel Assistant. Her function was to do name traces, provide support, and try to pull pieces together, which she would then feed to the ops officers who go out and recruit/meet clandestine assets.Maya was obsessed, as the movie shows her to be. She was demanding, and to this day likes to think she alone got ObL, when as the movie shows to some extent, many people and many Directorates were involved over a period of years.For those who might take a second look at the movie, look to the characters played by Jason Clarke as a pretty good representation of an ops officer, Kyle Chandler ('Bradley') as one kind of Chief of Station, and Edgar Ramirez ('Larry') as a good rep of a Ground Branch type in the Special Activities Center of the DDO.Many may not find this the most exciting film, but if anyone is looking for insight into how real intel work is actually done, it's a good place to start.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Jessica Chastain deserves an Oscar,"Scotched to my TV for the entire time.There are a lot of brilliant scenes, eventhough the torture might be disturbing for most people, including me. The intelligence in some dialogue makes me think of Mad Men.Most importantly, even in this movie, that I would rate 10/10 either way, the ending scene is just another level of beautiful.It is so unexpected in regards to what happened before, and accompanied by such beautiful music, that I watched it maybe 50 times more without rewatching the whole movie.Maya, the character of Jessica Chastain, has an incredible psychology and depth for a movie that lasts less than 3 hours.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Good film that goes on far too long,"Gritty look at America's justified or not War on Terror and the lengths they went to in their search for Osama Bin Laden including using so called ""enhanced integration methods"". While the politicking was interesting the extended runtime hurt itJason Clarke continues to be one of my favourite actors for the simple reason that I love listening to him yell. Something about his voice just gets me I don't know why. Be it this or White House Down I need more films of Jason Clarke screamingly angrily and pointing fingers.Jessica Chastain is good here but her character at times unfortunately came across as a sort of Mary Sue. She is a phenomenal actress but her never failing confidence and inability to ever be wrong made her unsympathetic and hard to root for.Kyle Chandler and James Gandolfini also round out a stacked cast with their brilliantly nuanced performances which both showcased a will to follow Chastain balanced with an understanding of the bureaucratic road blocks standing in their way.The last forty minutes or so of this movie which chronicles the Seal Team 6 assault on the Bin Laden compound is still one of the most brilliant moments captured on film. Ultimately, this is a decent film that cannot get out of its own way to tell a streamlined and coherent plot.",,Anonymous,History
Processing Ghosts in a Morally Ambiguous Maze,"In Katherine Bigelow's previous film, The Hurt Locker, a borderline mystical, obsessive outsider(Jeremy Renner) attempts to exorcise violent malevolent spirits (bombs) from within their innocuous, unassuming hosts(cars, cadavers) whilst negotiating a labyrinthine haunted house teeming with spectral enemies(post-invasion Iraq).In this equally hauntological follow-up, a woman (Jessica Chastain), who's self seems more defined by what's absent than what's present, hunts the ultimate ghost(Usama Bin Laden) in a perhaps misguided attempt to vanquish and banish the black hole vacuum that's been feasting on the soul of her and her country since September 11th 2001 and attain a sense of, well what exactly? Retribution? Justice? Closure? Maybe she's simply trying to lay some ghosts, both public and private, to rest...Chastain anchors the film with a controlled, subtle performance proving she has a versatility that should propel her beyond her already brilliant support slots as wife/girlfriend etc. Only Cate Blanchett, and possibly Charlize Theron, can touch her right now. Her delicate exterior of feminine porcelain fragility belies an intelligent, taught and tough core that combine to create a surprisingly believable performance. One that puts paid to the lie that women have to act like men to succeed in a man's world. This is a film driven by a female character operating in a male dominated environment that never once resorts to hitting us over the head with gender politics. She is a professional person going about her profession in a professional manner. Nothing more, nothing less. This is true equality of the sexes on screen and it's refreshing to see it handled in this way.The supporting cast are equally as good and all give note-perfect, generous low-key performances that are entirely in keeping with the ensemble-like nature of the film. Nobody is out to steal the picture here and it's all the better for it.Technically Zero Dark Thirty is near flawless in direction, camera-work, cinematography, editing and music. Never once are we subjected to BOOMBOOMBOOM audio cues and blaring emotional music. Restraint is the watchword here and Bigelow manages to wring tension out of every set-piece whilst keeping us guessing, which is no mean feat considering we all know the overall outcome before we've even sat down.Sadly I don't know how popular this ambiguous and complex film is going to be with mainstream audiences. Already, a simplistic knee-jerk critique implying that the film is a justification for torture seems to be emerging and becoming consensus opinion amongst some people, most of which have not even seen the film yet. I would position myself as centrist to left-of-center/liberal politically (I subscribe to Chomsky,Klein and Zinn, but also Ferguson and Hitchens) and I find these accusations to be overly glib and analytically myopic. Whilst within the confines of the story torture does elicit useful information, the characters never seem entirely comfortable with it and it is left up to the viewer to decide whether the ends justify the means. Events are presented as they, supposedly, occurred and, I felt, served more as a jumping off point for discussion rather than a pro-torture polemic. This is not a didactic film and its ambiguity and, perhaps misplaced, faith in the intelligence of its audience could be its ultimate downfall.There is also a refreshing lack of triumphalism and nationalistic fervour permeating the film (the stars and stripes are especially noticeable by their absence for example). At the end of the day this is a story about process. Laborious, painstaking process. About people doing a job. About that job taking them to the darkest recesses of human thought and action and trying to return unscathed. About attempting to negotiate a map-less and morally bankrupt terrain in search of answers to questions nobody's posed before. Answers they may not even really want.It's also quite a cold film (which is as it should be given the subject matter) and many audiences may find it difficult to connect with it in an emotional way. The characters have little to no back story and relationships are more professional than personal. At one point the death of a 'lead' appears to be mourned more than a colleague. Perhaps this is what happens when humans become mere collateral in the pursuit of ideologies...?Ultimately Zero Dark Thirty is certainly not for everybody, but if you like adult, technically adept, taut, political info-thrillers that don't lead you around by the nose and aren't afraid to leave moral spaces in place of simplistic didactic-ism then you'll find much to wrap your brain around. It poses more complex questions than offers simple answers but, as we enter the second uncertain decade of both the 21st century and its questionable 'War on Terror', this seems entirely apt.The problem with hunting ghosts is: how do you know when you've caught them and, like memories, how can you be sure they won't simply rise again to taunt you once more?",8.0,Anonymous,History

Did it matter that we knew in advance how the story ends? Nope.While I wouldn't call Zero Dark Thirty ""entertaining"", exactly, it is a superb piece of movie- making, all the more amazing when you realize that Osama bin Laden was killed on 2011 May 2, and this gripping full-length feature film was released a mere 619 days later. Director Kathryn Bigelow's mastery of the logistics rivals that of SEAL Team 6 itself. You'd think it would be gravy to get even a decent performance out of the lead performer (Chastain, playing dedicated CIA analyst Maya) in such a hurried time frame, but Bigelow doesn't settle for anything less than a brilliant one, assisted by rock-solid supporting performances and thoroly convincing sets, props, locations, and dialog, all wrapped up with the you-are-there immediacy of the final half hour, depicting the Abaddabad raid itself as seen thru the eerie green light of the SEALs' night-vision goggles.What a terrific movie!",9.0,Anonymous,History

GREATEST MANHUNT IN HISTORY.,Beyond all the controversy about torture this is a film that manages to tell a fact based story with almost no attempt to humanize it's characters and make it engaging and understandable.,8.0,Anonymous,History
Giving further insight and intensity to what we've seen on the news,"Kathryn Bigelow is arguably one of the best war film directors of all time and with Zero Dark Thirty, her cinematic synopsis of the decade- long hunt on Osama bin Laden, she has realised yet another mesmerising portrayal of real-live events.The film captures a timespan of almost ten years, beginning with actual recordings of the September 11 attacks over a black screen and ending with the killing of the Al-Qaeda leader and as such, it is understandably long – more than two and a half hours long to be precise. From a realistic perspective, this seems only reasonable if Bigelow wants to authentically recreate the many years of failure and despair in the famous manhunt through almost every shot lingering on for a couple of seconds and an immense lot of bureaucracy. From a filmmaking perspective however, trimming or excluding some parts and omitting at least a handful of the estimated 200 characters would have been very helpful. This didn't happen and therefore the result is nerve-rackingly boring at times, but Bigelow mostly manages to overcome this with a brilliant acting cast, several of them getting a chance to prove all their dramatic talent, and a phenomenal Jessica Chastain in the leading role.What's additionally beneficial for Zero Dark Thirty is its way of handling the controversial source material: the inhumane ""enhanced interrogation methods"" by the CIA are fittingly dreadful to watch, as long as you aren't an uber-patriotic racist, you won't find solace or even joy in the ending, and none of the characters of both parties are likable. And then there is the action. Going out on a limb, I'd say that the raid on bin Laden's hide-out will become one of the most iconic pieces of filmmaking of the 21st century, as it is just so masterfully crafted. The sequence goes on for about as long as it did in reality, which is some twenty minutes, and Bigelow really makes you feel as if you were there. The downright perfect sound, editing, and cinematography create a mood that has its audience sitting on the edge of their seat, even though they all know only too well how it's about to end, which is one of the biggest cinematic feats a director can achieve.Zero Dark Thirty is a highly important film – one that suffers from its length and sloppy exposition that doesn't always make clear what has just happened, but one that gives further insight and intensity to what we've seen on the news.",,Anonymous,History
"Fine, but not worth the hype","The opening scene of Zero Dark Thirty is absolutely brilliant. The screen flashes the words ""September 11, 2001,"" and then fades to black. All we hear are audio clips from that infamous day: firefighters, screams, panic. All of the pain, anger, and sadness of 9/11 comes back at you full force without any images. Sadly, the rest of the film doesn't live up to the first thirty seconds. Zero Dark Thirty is director Kathryn Bigelow's account of the U.S. government's efforts to kill Osama bin Laden. The first act is pretty audacious, with its unflinching portrayal of the torturing of captured Al-Queda members. The last forty minutes is interesting as well, when we finally get to see American soldiers invade bin Laden's secret compound. But the second act manages to bring the film to a screeching halt as it shows us, in extreme details, the paperwork and governmental procedures involved in taking bin Laden down. I understand that these scenes are all for the sake of accuracy, but that doesn't make them any more compelling. To be honest, the film might have been more enjoyable if the second act was downright fabricated. As a wise man named Jimmy Stewart once said ""If the legend is better than the truth, print the legend!"" I suppose Zero Dark Thirty's real virtue is that despite having a very political story, it never takes sides, so to speak. The film's makers never condone or condemn the killing of Osama bin Laden They simply tell us the facts. Today, that kind of unbiased reporting is unheard of in journalism, much less in the movies. Zero Dark Thirty is currently up for a slew of Oscars none of which it really deserves, especially when compared to contenders, like Argo, Lincoln or Django Unchained. On its own merits, its a decent film but we can only hope that a better film will someday be made about the subject matter. Rating *** out of *****.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Good Portrayal of events for one of the biggest Military Ops of the last 20 years,"I watched this again last night which was the first time I had seen it since I watched it at the cinema back in 2012.Again I really enjoyed the movie. For the benefit of anyone who hasn't seen it, it's kind of into two parts. The first explains the background to the hunt for Bin Laden showing the leads they took and how some of them ended in disaster. The second part is the actual operation itself which was what happened when they believed they had finally tracked him down. This part is extremely well done and gripping to watch. To its credit it doesn't shy away from the fact that like most military operations at this level they rarely go to plan with the US somehow managing to crash one of their uber expensive helicopters in the process. That being said, the op was clearly a huge success given it met its key objectives - 1. Locate and Kill Bin Laden, 2. Find sufficient material which could be reviewed and developed for intelligence in order to continue the fight against global terrorism.What I like about the film is that it clearly doesn't shy away from most of the toughest subjects. Namely that the Americans did use torture techniques throughout detainee interrogation of their prisoners and that at times, innocent people get killed.My only criticism upon further review would be that it's a bit disjointed at the start and when the story gets going it gets difficult to keep on top of who is who, in particular with the suspected terrorists as so many different names bandied about.That being said, the movie is a good document of these events and well worth watching if for nothing else for the second bit about how they actually went about the basis of pulling it off.",8.0,Anonymous,History

It's also superior to The Hurt Locker, probably because it gave Bigelow meatier material to work with.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Artistic Reflection of Unseen Labor,"""Zero Dark Thirsty"" offers an intriguing exploration of seemingly mundane lives enriched by a remarkable performance from Jessica Chastain. This cinematic piece is an eloquent expression of how much effort hides behind what we perceive as ""simple,"" rewarding the audience with a profound revelation.Jessica Chastain delivers an exquisite performance, her profound character development and nuanced acting technique keeping us engaged throughout the narrative. Every glance, gesture, and word uttered by Chastain is carefully curated to build an intricate portrayal of her character. She breathes life into the role, embodying her character's journey from the first frame to the last. Her artistry is beautifully palpable and serves as the emotional epicenter of the film.The filmmaking of ""Zero Dark Thirsty"" is praiseworthy. The narrative never strays away from its context in pursuit of aesthetic sinematography, creating a balanced equilibrium that neither betrays its artistic intentions nor jeopardizes its authentic storyline. The cinematography complements the story, instead of distracting from it. It is purposefully crafted to reflect the movie's tone and themes. The choice of lighting, the framing, the color palette, everything is thoughtfully arranged to convey a specific atmosphere that resonates with the story and the characters.The writing is yet another star in this film. It is sharp and focused, and the dialogue is realistic and believable. Each character has a distinct voice, and their interactions form the backbone of the narrative. The script subtly reveals the layers of effort behind seemingly simple tasks, forcing us to question our own perceptions and appreciate the often overlooked complexities of everyday life.The film's pacing might be a point of contention for some viewers, as it adheres to a slow-burning trajectory that meticulously unravels the narrative. This deliberate pacing could be interpreted as either a strength or a weakness, depending on individual taste. However, it offers an introspective exploration of character dynamics, keeping the viewer engaged through quiet moments that gradually culminate in a crescendo of revelations.""Zero Dark Thirsty"" could also be lauded for its immersive sound design and stirring original score. These elements work in tandem to create an auditory experience that effectively complements the visual storytelling.However, no film is beyond critique. ""Zero Dark Thirsty"" may not appeal to everyone due to its heavy reliance on character development over plot-driven momentum. Some viewers may find the pace overly slow, or the subtlety of its themes too understated. Nonetheless, this critique is subjective and can be seen as a matter of personal preference rather than an inherent flaw.In conclusion, ""Zero Dark Thirsty"" is a film that values the essence of storytelling, a refreshing deviation from the spectacle-driven tendencies of modern cinema. It presents a study of life's unnoticed intricacies with a compelling performance by Jessica Chastain at its heart. A thoughtful narrative, combined with a nuanced performance and visually harmonious cinematography, makes for a movie that truly stands out. On a scale of 1 to 10, my rating for this film would be a 9 - a testament to its excellence in cinematic storytelling.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"An insight into an event without any insight into the event. A dull, hollow misfire.","The Hurt Locker is still one of those films I can't believe has won Best Picture at the Oscars. Not that it's undeserving, it's just that it came from nowhere. I remember it as a festival favourite in 2008 and I saw it via a screener in the Summer of 2009. I enjoyed it a lot but I don't have any particular affection for it, besides Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie's performances. It lacks something cinematic which I crave from Oscar movies even if I dislike them, although I do kinda resent it for Mark Boal beating Quentin Tarantino for Original Screenplay, which seems like it'll happen again. I was never interested in Zero Dark Thirty and I only watched it out of awards obligation, but I was a little intrigued after a lot of critics loved it. However, I was swiftly disappointed. The script is so dry and procedural that all potential for emotional investment and tension are lost. Although it attempts to have some, it lacks a very essential human and society element to give the film more purpose as common knowledge of the event isn't enough.While most of the film is a slow adventure to Osama Bin Laden's hiding place as characters mention details lost on the casual viewer, all the explosive scenes beforehand feel like their beats were taken straight from Homeland so none of them or the consequences were surprises. Unfortunately Jessica Chastain isn't given enough consistent material to be truly great, and while she has a few decent scenes there's nothing coherent enough to what her character deserves. Jason Clarke is great in a side role, a real highlight of the first act, and a real shame when he has to leave. The film is overlong, disjointed and void of momentum but there's nothing particularly bad here besides the average approach to the topic. The only irritating aspect is the cinematography with its constant wobbling in every shot. It provides a really bland and dull atmosphere. Zero Dark Thirty is an insight into an event without any insight in the event. With films like this, Zodiac and Argo, I don't think saying ""this is what really happened"" is good enough to justify them being good when they underwhelm as a film. I don't think there's enough in Zero Dark Thirty to justify it being a film, maybe a book or a magazine article, as long as it's not written by Mark Boal.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History

A strong fact-based thriller,"With the success of 2008's Iraq war drama The Hurt Locker under their belts, it shouldn't have been tremendously surprising that director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal would chose to make a film chronicling the decade long search for Osama Bin Laden that culminated in his death at the hands of Navy Seals in May of 2011. The resulting production, Zero Dark Thirty, is a strong, at times involving, story of obsession and the, at times, monotonous and detail oriented search for Bin Laden that largely revolves around a single, dedicated individual.Zero Dark Thirty begins with audio clips of the assault on the Twin Towers of September 11, 2001 and then jumps forward a few years later, where we see the rough interrogation techniques being applied by the CIA to Al Qaeda members to attempt to glean the location of Bin Laden. The early scenes largely focus on fresh CIA analyst Maya (Jessica Chastain) and Dan (Jason Clarke) a more grizzled veteran of relentless torture of the various detainees. The two of them, overseen by the Pakistan chief Joseph Bradley (Kyle Chandler), utilize a wide variety of approaches to break the men down, getting various references to a shadowy courier of information for Bin Laden, Abu Ahmed. As the years stretch on, various incidents of bombings, including one in London, another in Pakistan, and a devastating attack on a U.S. base in Afghanistan, lead the various CIA superiors to begin questioning the search for Bin Laden, but Maya, who has devoted her every waking moment to the hunt, refuses to give in. When a happenstance of information crosses her attention, she is able to eventually determine, with the help of a military operative, Larry (Edgar Ramirez), what she believes is the location of Bin Laden at a heavily fortified compound in Pakistan. She must then convince the CIA that Bin Laden is there so they can move forward with a plan to take him out.Zero Dark Thirty is a film that is driven almost exclusively by plot, recounting the various major events of the years since 2001 to the eventual raid on Bin Laden's compound in 2011. Various characters come and go in the course of the story, but few are given much of an opportunity to grow beyond the technical dialogue they are given to recite. The exception, for the most part, is Jessica Chastain's Maya. We still learn very little about her beyond a few details here and there, but some of that is one of the film's central points: Maya has allowed herself to be all consumed by the search for Bin Laden that she has let it subsume the rest of her life. In one scene, a co-worker of Maya asks her about her friends and a boyfriend, and she cannot respond in the positive to either question. What character driven aspects there are to Zero Dark Thirty are almost exclusively derived from Maya's story.The early scenes of Zero Dark Thirty can prove a bit disorienting to watch at times. The filmmakers throw a lot of acronyms, technical jargon and half explained dialogue at the audience, and it is up to us to try and see if we can keep up. On the one hand, I appreciate the filmmaker's willingness to not dumb down the material to keep it extra accessible for the general movie-going public, but on the other hand, by constantly trying to scratch out some semblance of what is going on, the film does lose of some of it's draw. Eventually, the details begin to coalesce into a story you can generally follow, but at times it feels like we are one step behind the details being unspooled on the screen.Some have criticized Zero Dark Thirty's depiction of torture by the CIA operatives on the various Al Qaeda members, and it even seems to take a neutral stance on the use of those techniques. Many of the torture scenes are harrowing to watch, as human beings are treated as animals by the agents trying to glean information from their prisoners. Zero Dark Thirty isn't a meditation on the ethics and morality of the use of torture, however, it is simply telling a story of what happened, and the filmmakers choose not to shy away from the darker aspects of that hunt.Bigelow and Boal do an exceptional job of building suspense at key moments in the film. More than once, the film will jump to a specific moment in time to correspond to a particular event that occurred over the course of the last 10 years, and the build of tension until a seemingly unavoidable moment of violence unfolds is effective and palpable. Other moments are without warning, as the films forward momentum is suddenly punctuated by an unexpected jolt. Both techniques work well and keep you riveted and involved in the film. The only time this fails to deliver is a late action scene involving Maya outside her home in Pakistan as the film careens towards a rather expected development. It doesn't rob it of power, but it still seems more and more certain before it arrives.Zero Dark Thirty's cornerstone is the final raid on the Bin Laden compound. It unfolds without music, in a very matter of fact fashion, lacking the sensationalism of most thrillers or action films. Zero Dark Thirty lives up to its perception of being true to events as they happened. Nevertheless, this sequence provides an at times moving climax as the events of the previous two hours finally lead to a resolution.Zero Dark Thirty isn't perfect, its early scenes can prove disorienting, and the film's lack of emotional depth can keep us at arm's lengths to the proceedings on the screen at times, but nonetheless, it is an effective thriller that delivers an at times powerful tale of one woman's unwavering dedication to complete her mission, moving all obstacles in her path.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Those Puffy Sounding Body Shots,"Hollywood has the ability to create incredible effects and adapt its talents to whatever has gone on. Like Argo, we are left wondering just how accurate these efforts can be. The film begins with torture and sheer brutality. A prisoner has things done to him that make us sit back and cringe. Are the people doing this supposed to be heroic in some way? Are there results really effective. After about fifteen minutes of this, we get to see the dogged, monomaniacal Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, use her anger and frustration with the slow acting military to get her way. I'm fully aware of the atrocities that had been committed and the role of Osama bin Laden, but was it worth any more than a publicity stunt to put the kind of effort into getting this guy. There is some very good intrigue and I am willing to bet that the movie is pretty accurate in its portrayal. My worry is that this kind of movie glamorizes the ""anything goes"" mentality that has filtered into the minds of people. We have always prided ourselves on being better than this. In the movie, when things go bad, it's because of inadequate security and indecisive authority. This, of course, ultimately leads to the Bin Laden compound in Pakistan and the raid that took the guy out. Once launched, we are treated to a feast of violence. Those second and third shots into an already dead body have a puffy little sound. These men will be seen as heroes, but they also will be seen as people have been trained to kill first and ask questions later. This mission was successful, but did it require a total disregard for the rights of humanity. Bin Laden was the target, but the bodies piled up all over the place and little children were terrorized.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Extremely suspenseful,"'Zero Dark Thirty' is extremely suspenseful, even though we know how it ends. It shows how, by combining tiny bits of information, by patience, hard work and sheer luck, the CIA succeeded in locating Osama Bin Laden's whereabouts. We know everything about the raid in which he was killed, but not very much about the decade long hunt for him. This has been a complicated affair, with bribed informants, bugged cell-phones, mistaken identities, and yes, information obtained by torture. However, I don't see 'Zero Dark Thirty' as a film tolerating torture. It merely shows torture, in a graphic way that just as well could be interpreted as criticizing it.What makes this film special, is that it is focusing on a woman. The strong point of this movie is the contrast between Jessica Chastain's pure, breathtakingly beautiful looks and the cruel, ugly world of killing and torture around her. All she wants to do is hunt down Bin Laden, and there is nothing female in the obsession she shows for her work. There is no love interest, no relaxation, no private life. Only at the very end, when the job is done, she shows the first sign of emotion.The film focuses entirely on chasing and capturing Bin Laden. There are no subplots, no psychologic insights, no sidelines. That's what makes this film so good: there are no Hollywood-like concessions to a wider commercial appeal. It would be incredible if Kathryn Bigelow would win the Oscar for Best Picture again, after 'The Hurt Locker'. But in my opinion, 'Zero Dark Thirty' is the better film. So it would be entirely deserved.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Gripping and tense and exciting with great acting. Hard to do with a story everyone knows the ending to. Watch this! I say A,"""This is what defeat looks like bro. Your jihad is over."" On September 11, 2001 the United States was attacked by a group of terrorists taking orders from Osama Bin Laden. Following that attack the intelligence agency of the US began a man hunt for him to bring him to justice. Ten years later with the help of Seal Team 6 he was taken down. This is the story of the man hunt. I love movies that are based on real events but they are sometimes hit or miss. The hardest part for a movie like this where the events have just happened is to keep it interesting and keep you watching even though you know the end. This movie succeeded beyond all hope. Much like Apollo 13 when the climax happens you are on the edge of your seat and wanting to see what happens even though you know the outcome. That is what makes this movie great. Also Bigelow has almost a Spielberg like quality to take hardcore war movies like this and Hurt Locker and transform them into movies that rely on great actors and not just the action. As great and exciting as this movie was Jessica Chastain was incredible in this and she is one of the reasons you get so involved with the story. This is another movie I could go on and on about but this is a definite must see and one of the best movies of the year. Overall, tense and gripping. Which is great for a movie where everyone knows how it ends. I give it an A.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Good film, not a great.  Yet I can't stop thinking about it....","So i must confess that I feel the same way about ""Zero Dark Thirty"" as i did about ""THE HURT LOCKER"".Both are good films that are competently made, but they both seem to be lacking that character-investment factor that REALLY elevates a good movie to a great one. Outside of Jessica Chastain's character (which, you can't deny, is a terrific performance and a great role-model for independent women!) there is NO one else in this movie that you can connect with. No other character is developed in any way. Like when the Seal Team shows up. They show up and you are almost immediately thrown into an action sequence where we are expected to care about these people, but we have NO connection to them whatsoever.All that being said, my initial reaction to the film was underwhelming. Not surprised, really, as after her previous film i went into this one expecting to be underwhelmed, and Ms. Bigelow didn't disappoint.And yet.....I find that 3 days after i saw the movie i am still thinking about it. I am still coming on these boards and discussing it.So maybe its' a better movie then i give it credit for.There are some silly moments, to be sure (one attack in particular is presented with some very glaring issues of stupidity), but overall it is a good film.Not the best of the year by any stretch, but it is pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Zero Dark Thirty: The hunt for UBL,"On the off chance you are wondering what ""Zero Dark Thirty"" stands for, its a reference for 00:30 hrs, or in English half past midnight. It's a pretty important time in the film, so keep an eye out for it.This film I found rather interesting. There isn't a mass emphasis on the actual strike against Usama Bin Laden, but more of a focus leading from 11 September 2001 up to how they found him, including the dead ends and trials and tribulations within. Some parts of this film might seem a bit boring and bland to some, however a lot of the people on the way out of the cinema last night enjoyed it. I think there is a lot of appeal here for different groups. If you're an action film fan, you will enjoy the back end of the film but appreciate the lead up to it. This isn't a suspense film as you all know what happens in the end, and they sure as hell won't be able to make a sequel. However, this film isn't a documentary but it also isn't a completely fictional film. If you enjoyed Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy then you will really enjoy this film. As for the rest of you it could either way, but it is a well made film and doesn't come across as something cheap and nasty.The main character in this is an attractive redhead and she starts out as very non confident and wet behind the ears. You see her developed into a harder and more determined person. My favourite line in the film is when someone asks who she is ""I'm the mother f****r that found this place"". Though the film doesn't directly place its success purely on here performance and many of the characters in this add value and decent performances. If you are easily entertained then don't go see this, if you like a good thinking persons film then despite there not being a ""6th sense"" style twist, you will very much enjoy this.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Not a True  Believer,"Jessica Chastain is an excellent actress, but she is not a True Believer, which is what Maya must be, in reality. In ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" Chastain gives the role her best shot. During the course of the movie, she does manage to work herself up to an obsessive-compulsive fury for the cause of pursuing and killing Osama bin Laden, but it is almost like watching Tiger Woods miss a putt.The willingness to die for her cause, blind faith and total allegiance, held together by the glue of hatred - these qualities propel the woman of words, the woman of action and the fanatic together. That combination is probably not very entertaining. It is probably very ugly, very off-putting to the judges at Cannes, the Golden Globe, the Academy Awards. To portray the real Maya, Chastain would have had to capture and project the sort of maniacal fury that her acting counterpart in ""Coriolanus,"" Ralphe Finnes, projected. That wasn't pretty because it was raw ruthlessness, pure savagery, what the CIA calls termination with extreme prejudice.I thought the first two hours of this film did a good job of depicting in almost mind-numbing detail, the realities of the bureaucratic labyrinth: the carping and the back-biting, the colliding egos and the rampant ambition, the governmental anti-terror organization operatives continually bumping into each other in an effort to reconcile political correctness with justice or retribution. I almost walked out of the theater several times, but I made myself stay put and watch, because I had to know how the entire movie unfolded.Mark Savage and James Gandalfini projected far more knowing weariness, stamina, cynicism, real-world wariness and Machiavellian caginess than the other actors; and the movie began to interest me about the last 45 minutes of the film. That is where it began for me.The rest of this movie was not taut, not gripping, not shocking, not convincing. There was way too much slack in the movie. I would have edited it so that it held the audience's interest like a Wallenda high over Niagara Falls on a slender wire.Maybe it's just me, but I didn't learn anything new either about the pursuit, capture and assassination of bin Laden. Feelings are not facts, but the latter are important especially on the stage and screen. Actors are professional pretenders, and Gandolfini and Strong do more acting, grabbing my attention more than the other performers, with their eyes, their facial expressions, with gestures, commanding the very space about them, and the silence and the stillness. Such gifted performers do not even require language in order to act. I saw some of that power in Chastain when she began using her erasable marker on the window of her boss's office, but I never saw the person who would give up 12 years of her life to pursue, doggedly, irrationally, like some sort of female Inspector Javert, that illusive target.Maybe it's just me, but I expected more tension, more suspense, more intense character development. I was disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Very good indeed.,My Rating : 8/10I've lost count how many times the F word was spoken in this movie but let's not talk about that.

"Important, yet heavy, meandering, and somewhat vacuous","Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty derives its title from clever spy language meaning half past an unspecified time after midnight, or the time when Seal Team Six finally killed known terrorist and Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. The film she has made only devotes about twenty-five minutes to that time period, which is a wise choice from her standpoint and screenwriter Mark Boal's. The remaining two hours leading up to that shows how the CIA finally got there, after numerous leads, little evidence, and a brave woman who went against their original ideas.A large majority of the CIA believed that Osama Bin Laden was hiding in a remote cave, some miles away from the cities of Pakistan, and was sick and ailing. After a ten year manhunt, we finally found him, hiding in a large, heavily-walled compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, not far away from a military college. And now we have a film glorifying and boasting our efforts. I was off-put by this idea, despite my positivity towards Bigelow and Boal's previous effort, The Hurt Locker. The whole concept seemed to be rather narcissistic and overly patriotic on the United States' part.Thankfully, the film actually has a brain in its head and substance in mind. The story's shell is kept simple, yet the interworkings are much to complex and to keep things safe, I'll do some oversimplifying. We open with a collection of 911 calls from that faithful day twelve years ago that, I believe, needs no introduction. We cut to scenes set at the U.S. embassy in Pakistan, where Maya, played by the wonderful Jessica Chastain, accompanies Dan (Jason Clarke) during ""enhanced interrogations,"" basically meaning that they involve tortuous methods. All the torture and endless questions are attempting to lead up to the whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden, and as the film goes on, we see how Maya climbs the social ladder of the CIA, to even going boldly against the word of the top representatives (Joel Edgerton) about where exactly he is hiding. After spotting a shady, plain white compound in the middle of Pakistan, with black windows and no third male living in a house with various females, Maya is 100% convinced that Bin Laden is residing in that large area, while the CIA clings to their idea that he is out in some cave in the middle of nowhere. They pragmatically believe that if not Bin Laden living there it is someone who clearly is evading the law, like a drug dealer.The film works around this plot for about one-hundred and twenty five minutes, leaving the last act to center around the raid of the compound that has the outcome everyone is aware of. Bigelow still maintains the ability to surprise her audience in some sequences, mainly the Marriott Hotel bombing and the Camp Chapman attack. She concocts this very uncertain atmosphere in many of the instances when two characters meet to discuss a detail or an operation that works in the film's favor. The CIA dialog we are presented with is hit and miss. Some scenes, involving Maya talking with the analyst Steve (Mark Duplass, one of my favorite actors working today) are captured with the driest of wit, while others, show Maya desperately convincing several people in the organization she is right through polite conversation or shouting matches, become a tad overbearing and plod along with heavy jargon and a meandering focus.The the grand difference between Zero Dark Thirty and Bigelow's Oscar winning Hurt Locker is the unfocused narrative. The Hurt Locker was about the deteriorating sanity of an Iraqi war veteran shown in a deep, intimate character study through a sensitive lens, which won me and a lot of others over. Zero Dark Thirty bears more weight and spans the course of a decade, making for a lot more material and a lot more events that Bigelow and Boal clearly struggle to capture. This causes some events to be more interesting and others to be only mildly amusing.Much has been made about the fact that this film depicts instances of torture from a seemingly slanted perspective The torture sequences aren't much to blow out of proportions but the fact that they are close to what really happens. I'm not sure this film is partisan in any regard, and while it subtly states the reason why we knew where Bin Laden was located was because of a message obtained through waterboarding, another scene shows its occasional ineffectiveness by having a man scream various days when asked about when a bombing will take placed. It's a very original, even-handed approach.Zero Dark Thirty is a film I'd still call important for its deep depiction of one of the largest manhunts in history, yet to call it a masterwork or even hold it up on a pedestal as one of the greatest espionage films of all time is strictly an overstatement. The film is tricky, informative, and occasionally entertaining, yet it's heavy, meandering, and shortchanging in the regards of characters. This can become a difficult thing to tolerate when the whole film is watching characters interact with others when morally just decisions are on the line or soon being proposed.Read the more complete review at http://stevethemovieman.proboards.com",7.0,Anonymous,History
Justifying torture??,"Is this film a joke or something? All it seems to do is trivialize and try to justify America illegally murdering,kidnapping and torturing detainees. These idiots should be tried for war crimes,not sensationalized by Hollywood and anybody thinking this film is good should carefully examine their own morals,,the film is just wrong and a disgrace to humanity!!!!!!Hows about making a film where America illegally invades Iraq and Afganistan,American soldiers murder 100,000 innocent by-standers,all the politicians the gave the go ahead for it making billions of dollars personal profit via the companies that supplied the arms etc,is that the sequel to ZDT,or will that truth be swept under the carpet of history?",1.0,Anonymous,History

Could Have Done With Some Trimming,"How's this for a great idea for a film ? It's a thriller but it's not any thriller . It's a true life thriller but it's not any true life thriller . It's a true life thriller featuring the hunt for Osama Bin Laden ! Wow what a great idea and the cherry on top is that it's written by an Oscar winning screenwriter and directed by an Oscar winning director . And yet despite all this ZERO DARK THIRTY is never the compelling true life thriller it could have beenThe problem lies mainly in the directing . I guess Kathryn Bigelow is trying for a fly on the wall cinema verite type of style . We as the audience are put in to the action as spectators in much the same way as the CIA characters are spectators finding it more and more difficult to influence events and becoming frustrated by it . The detached manner does make for a strangely unengaging film despite the subject matter . It's also about an hour too long and would have made a much better movie if it clocked in almost two hours rather than three . I know it's not the fault of Mark Boal but when I heard the constant references of ""Bin Laden meeting Farage"" I had surreal visions of the leader of Al Qaeda popping down the pub having a few drinks with the leader of The United Kingdom Independence PartyWhere the film does deserve some acclaim is that it doesn't sugar-coat the fact that the CIA isn't some group of happy clappy vicars and shows the moral ambiguity of having to break the law in order to stop international crime and to bring criminals to justice along with the suggestion that if someone is poor and they know something they get waterboarded while if they're rich and know something they get a new sports car ! I also liked that the fact we had a film directed by a woman with a female lead protagonist was tracking down the leader of an organisation who want to take humanity in general and the female half especially back to a medieval dark age .

A gripping first-draft of history,"A CIA analyst played by a pretty, pale-skinned actress, tracks a terrorist mastermind. She has an obscure theory that could crack the case but no one else seems to believe her. Her mentor is a more experienced analyst with a scruffy beard. No, I'm not describing the Showtime series, ""Homeland."" It's the new real-life thriller ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" about the hunt for Osama bin Laden.Seldom before has there been a docudrama such as this that can be truly described as ""action-packed."" It's hard to believe a movie based on true events can have as many explosions as your average Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. But director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal demonstrate how ten years worth of chases, shoot-outs and bombings represented twists and turns on the path to finding the leader of al Qaeda. Every good action movie ends with the heroes storming the villain's lair. This one is no exception, but instead of a Death Star or a hollowed out volcano – it's a house in Abbottabad.Bigelow stages the final assault on bin Laden's compound in near-real time. We all know the outcome and exactly how the scene will play out. But the fact Bigelow can still manage to make the sequence tense and riveting is a true testament to her skill as a filmmaker. The quiet precision of Seal Team Six is shot in large part with a ""night vision"" look. We feel like we're one of the soldiers on the ground. (The style also reminded me of the finale of ""Silence of the Lambs."" In the glowing, green dark -- bin Laden's compound is as scary a place as Buffalo Bill's house.) Boal and Bigelow take a detached, journalistic approach to dramatizing the events that lead up to the moment. The most controversial of those events, is the use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" on a number of detainees. The movie doesn't hold back in showing the how these prisoners were treated. But it leaves it up to the audience to decide if that treatment was justifiable. Elsewhere in the movie, important information is divulged through normal interrogations of men who had been previously been forced to submit to those enhanced techniques. Do the men decide to talk in these circumstances because normal interrogations work better, or because they're afraid they'll be waterboarded again if they don't provide answers? This movie doesn't try to solve that puzzle – perhaps no one can.""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a thoroughly researched, well-executed first draft of history that also happens to work completely as a Hollywood thriller. On September 11th, 2001 – many said that it felt like we were suddenly in a movie. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is that film, and now, we know how it ends. The question is, what comes next?",8.0,Anonymous,History
The hunt is on. But first here are some torture scenes.,"Zero Dark Thirty prides itself on being based on documentary evidence but it becomes clear that this is a fictionalized account on the hunt and capture of Osama Bin Laden. The story might be based on true facts but to distill the story in 150 minutes the focus is on a lone wolf CIA operative who spent the best part of a decade hunting for clues and fighting her superiors for resources and support.The film starts to pull your emotional heartstrings from the very beginning with voices of victims from recordings made in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The film-makers must be targeting the kids who might be unaware of the events September 11 2001 or more cynically softening us up for the next sequence of scenes.Now if I was watching a film where some half naked women were being tortured, made to defecate in their underwear, have dog collars put on them, I would find the film under the Grindhouse section of the DVD store with an added commentary by Quentin Tarantino. However as this film features Arab men being tortured, an Oscar nomination for Best Picture is the order of the day.The film gives you prolonged sequences of torture and of course the trendy water-boarding sequences are included. The film does not seem to condemn torture apart from a throwaway line later on in the film and seems to give the impression that torture has its uses.The first two thirds of the films is looking for elusive clues that might lead to a breakthrough from all the mountains of information obtained over the years. As we moves on from the Bush regime to the Obama years, we have that breakthrough and move on to the capture of Bin Laden.The central focus is on the Jessica Chastain character who I believe is a composite. She is very driven and carries the film well which does start out rather slowly as we deal with the fragments we offered that might develop into a strand. However Chastain is saddled with more than a few clunky lines.The last third is very much for the Call of Duty generation as the armed forces head for the Bin Laden's hideout in Pakistan.Kathryn Bigelow who is the first female director to win an Oscar was working on a hunt for Bin Laden film but quickly reworked the premise when Bin Laden was killed and rush released it within 18 months of the events. I think the script needed more time to develop and the approach might have been different as the film-makers would had been able to have access more information regarding the factual accounts and have more time to mull over things, especially some of the lines given to the actors.It is a good film although in trying to be neutral with the politics especially regarding torture looks like a mis-step. I think there is a better production regarding these events waiting to be told.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Zero Dark Thirty Review: Where were you at Zero Dark Thirty?,"Funny thing, I actually don't remember where I was when the announcement was made. I remember hearing the news, and the emotions that came along with it. It was after all one of the biggest events of the 21st century, overshadowed only the World Trade Center attack of September 11th, 2001. You might even say that this was a defining moment of my generation. A watershed moment that was 10 years in the making that could end up defining how we govern and/or deal with the world when our time comes. And it is coming soon. Yet as I was watching the movie detailing how it happened, I was struck by the thought that I couldn't recall the moment I had heard.There has been a lot of talk about the film and controversy surrounding it, most notably regarding the torture and detainment of prisoners as a way of finding him and the representation of it in the film. I have to say, that the scenes in the film were hard to watch. Anyone who can watch this type of thing and not cringe should be examined by a psychiatrist. Which is not to say necessarily that the scenes were overly gory or violent. By the standards of some films out there in the torture porn genre, these scenes are pretty tame. They don't really push the envelope in any serious way of cinema.I would say that the reason why there is so much controversy around this film is because we know that where in most films the characters being tortured or killed are entirely fictional. Given that this is based on a true story, it is harder to imagine that these people aren't real. It is more than possible that the characters in these films really existed. Their names and physical attributes might be different but there really could be someone out there in the world who was on the receiving end of this type of treatment, and that rubs people the wrong way. Very much rightfully so in fact.Despite that though, I think that the scenes are necessary exactly for that reason. As much as Seal Team 6 should be commended for what they did, the people who were hurt along the way deserve to be allowed their place in history. As disturbing as it might be and uncomfortable as it is to watch they played a part in what happened and the ultimate result. If we are going to be outraged at the prospect of torture let's make sure we actually understand what it is that means. A lot of people in the Western world talk about having standards and only doing things which are morally right but they don't really understand the true extent to which people go through.More to the point, if it was used in the process of finding and killing Bin Laden then let's not sugar coat things and gloss over it. Put it out there where people can see it and decide for themselves. Let's present ourselves as who we are rather than who we want to be. I may not like torture being used and I certainly wouldn't want it used on myself, but I don't presume to be morally righteous about whether we should use it or not. I'll leave that up to the people in a position to decide whether to use it. Voicing my opinion is one thing, but I will neither condemn or support those who I voice it to. Nor will I do that to Kathryn Bigelow for putting it in her movie.Where were you at Zero Dark Thirty? I may not remember where I was, but this movie should be remembered and for more than just the torture being used.To check out more of my reviews, go here: http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/",8.0,Anonymous,History
Worth a watch; even after some apparent drawbacks,"The biggest problem with this thriller was that the 'thrill' was no secret. The whole world knows the broad outlines of the greatest manhunt in the history. So the challenge in front of the filmmakers was to make it gripping and investigative (much more details are expected than those we already know from TV channels/newspaper articles).Overall the film is worth a watch, but the lead character - Maya - played by Chastain is poorly written and developed. She does not seem knowledgeable about Al-Queda, Afghanistan, Pakistan or anything related to that geography. We are just supposed to take her word for it! Like when she scolds her senior for not knowing Al Queda. Nowhere in this film we feel that Maya is anything more than a desk analyst! On the contrary, the character of Carrie Mathison (played by Claire Danes) in the TV show Homeland is much closer to what the real life Maya (if such person actually exist/ed at all) should have been.Anyway, the talk about torture scenes is more hype than anything else. The scenes were not so gory at all; much more gory details are shown on American Television! Too many goof-ups in geographical details are a constant turn off. But only the Indians and Pakistanis will find or mind these goof-ups; most Western (or non-Asians) will not notice them.The last 20 minutes or so are superb and the real highlight of this film. Notice how quickly the 'target' is eliminated without much drama.Overall, a decent film that could have been very good if the cared to develop the lead character rather than presenting a documentary.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Dancing in quicksand..,"Zero Dark Thirty is a compelling film with a real chance of making the largest number of people, yet, to introspect and come to their own conclusions about the war on terror, its troubling origins and its continuing cost.After one Sunday of watching Bin Laden's killing on the news networks, most Americans and the rest of the world went back to business.Several scholarly books and newspaper articles tried to overwhelm us with information and commentary on the greatest manhunt ever.Most of these did not find itself into the consciousness of the masses who continue to struggle with economic realities despite the ""Osama Bin Laden is Dead and General Motors is Alive"" rhetoric. Zero Dark Thirty arrives at an opportune time.The debate about torture is meaningless, we will always be willing to kill for stuff that the powerful value, like political mileage.Its a technique as old as the hills.Obama may try to rise above torture, but drone strikes are nothing but a rich nation swatting flies for political gain. Drones are neat, so must have been torture when it was invented.Rendition, the 2007 film by Gavin Hood was an impassioned commentary on torture and put a huge question mark about its effectiveness. Zero Dark Thirty is brilliantly scripted and shot by the team of journalist/screenwriter Mark Boal and veteran director Kathryn Bigelow. It holds our attention for all of its 150 mins runtime, which is remarkable because we all know the ending.In the course of the very complex hunt for Bin Laden we see lots of torture, small victories in eliminating some key players, large losses in the continued terror attracts around the world except on American soil, and more importantly a regime change.We are swept up in the passion of Maya, a low level CIA operative played by the increasingly brilliant Jessica Chastain. She pursues her hunch about a courier with great single mindedness and embodies the promise of both Bush and Obama to hunt down Bin Laden.In its own way its also a film about work, how we approach our jobs and how wide the gamut of human experience can be, if we cared to look.The question of what motivates Maya remains open.She remains an enigma till the very end, true to her name which also means ""illusion"" in Sanskrit. How I wish Maya was an environmentalist! The most important events in history take a very long time for society to assimilate.The assassination of JFK has still not been resolved, nor of Mahatma Gandhi.Some of the issues that were at the heart of Gandhi's assassination will surface in 2014 when India goes to the polls.Its just that they will not be linked directly to his death. Perhaps a long way off in the future there will be somebody like Oliver Stone who will rake up the Bin Laden killing to illuminate issues in America but for the moment Zero Dark Thirty must serve as the first cinematic draft of history.This is another milestone in the growing importance of film as the current medium of choice to engage with history. Obama's address to the Islamic world from Cairo, which was dubbed an apology tour, was a step in the right direction and so is a growing reluctance to go to war in far corners of the world.The Iraq war has amply illustrated the futility of shoving profound political change down the throat of a people who will continue to engage in bloody battles on Shia Sunni lines. Zero Dark Thirty shows us the high cost of capturing a high value target, both human and material and the long term cost which must be paid by future generations. A forgotten film by Wim Wenders called Land of Plenty made in 2005 captured a fractured post 9/11 American state in a beautiful and sensitive way. The Clash of Civilizations, a theory proposed by Samual Huntington which identifies cultural and religious differences as the fountainhead of future conflict, is certainly underway.While the world obsesses over the nuclear weapons Iran is building, it conveniently forgets that Pakistan is the most dangerous and unstable owner of a huge nuclear arsenal.When this clash of civilizations takes a turn for the worse, India is likely to be biggest collateral damage in history, thanks to the Pakistani militaries cunning use of India to maintain its grip on that failed state. Charlie Wilson's War was a smart Hollywood comedy which depicted the genesis of the whole Afghanistan/Pakistan crisis that is unfolding today.As a people we continue to dance in quicksand.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Not the best but a good one.,"Zero dark thirty is based on capturing Osama Bin laden after the events of 9/11.The movie starts strong and than falls apart, the movie also describes the investigation of a woman CIA agent Maya (Jessica Chastain), who is just want to find out the location of Osama on any cost. She finds Osama almost a decade.The director Kathryn Bigelow makes another good movie but not that good enough as we comparing to The Hurt Locker (2008), it was an excellent movie also won an Oscar award. Besides, zero dark thirty is a good movie to watch but not a brilliant kind of movie.Reason's to watch this movie1 Jessica Chastain's peerless performance (deserves an Oscar for sure).2 Created good thriller as well, and it will not loose the grip till they found the location of Bin laden.Weakness1 Long duration: about more than 2:30 hours, rather than the movie could cover the whole story in 2 hours.2 The worst part is when they killed Osama (its kinda boring).So, for my side it was a good movie, Jessica Chastain and Jason Clarke(Dan) played a very good role in it.I gave 7/10 just for Jessica's performance and it was only one time watchable but not an Oscar type material.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"For what it is, it's great...","If you want the REAL story of how Osama Bin Laden was tracked down and eventually killed by the Yanks... you're probably not going to find it here. Forgive me for saying this, but I always get very cynical when it comes to governmental accounts of their international deeds, particularly the USA who haven't got a great record for transparency. What this movie is though, is a gripping spectacle in it's own right, in a world which seems as far from peace as a game of Battleships.If a woman existed with the talents of the agent played by Jessica Chastain, she'd be the first lady USA president, no sweat. She reminded me of Carrie from Homeland, in that her gut instinct was always proved right, and her professionalism stood out in stark contrast to her bumbling male colleagues. Is it THAT obvious the movie had a female director? Never mind, I guess it's nice to see a strong representation of the fairer sex in a war film, so credit where it's due.The thing is though, has Bin Laden's death REALLY changed anything? The guy was stuck in the middle of nowhere, reduced to a bit part player in terrorist affairs. His moment in the sun had come and gone. The way people celebrated after his demise, you'd think they'd vanquished the devil himself.

"An intense, realistic, uncomfortable, intelligent, emotional, suspenseful, dramatic & spectacular piece of work.","It's easily my favorite movie of the 2012 year. This film reminded me a lot like the 2006 movie ""United 93""; where it seems more like a documentary without the commentary, and where the audience is living & witnessing all the scenes with the actors. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" chronologies the events leading up to the location & death of Osama Bin Laden; a movie that very few people could've made, where it really shows the directing talents of Kathryn Bigelow. This is a much better film than ""The Hurt Locker"", which won he Academy Award for Best Picture of 2009. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" also showcase the incredible acting talents of Jessica Chastain, whereas the entire movie has excellent dialogs & amazing acting from the entire cast. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is an intense, realistic, uncomfortable, intelligent, emotional, suspenseful, dramatic & spectacular piece of work. This isn't a gung-ho or a political film..; but instead, it shows the talents & intelligence it took for the men & women behind the CIA & military had to take, in order to catch the most wanted man in the world.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Lacks Humanity,"It's unfortunate that this film is made as purely a piece of entertainment. Typically, when you get a film of this nature, there is some sort of redemption or sacrifice that leaves the viewer with a sense of something. Private Ryan gave you a sense of the brutality one encounters in war a leaves you with an appreciation for life and sacrifice. Letters from Iwo Jima shows you that there are two sides to every story and allows you to understand that humanity the greatest victim of war. Full Metal Jacket and Jar Head both give you an understanding of the absurdity and personal costs of war. However, Zero Dark gives you none of this. You don't feel for any of the characters, you have no emotional connection to the film and you are left with ""Zero"" impression of the human or emotional costs associated with the sacrifices made in order to eventually catch/kill UBL.This film reminds me of the scene in Gladiator when Russell Crowe walks into the arena and summarily kills all of his opponents and turns to the crowd and asks ""...is this not why you came, are you not entertained?"" No, this is not why I came and I was not entertained. There is a deeper costs to war and terrorism. There is more sacrifice made than this film makes you feel and I find it difficult to enjoy watching what can only be described as a dispassionate depiction of the singularity of retribution.",2.0,Anonymous,History
It's a 21st-century  war movie.,"This movie is outstanding. The acting is strong, the story is compelling, the dialog incisive and the cinematography impressive. The movie does not play politics. Rather it tells a tremendously dramatic story about courage, fortitude and determination. The story has a beginning, a middle and an end, and although the audience knows the final outcome, that does not affect or reduce the movie's dramatic impact. The source of the drama is not the actual tracking down of Osama bin Laden but the interactions within the intelligence community that was under a lot of pressure to find targets, relying on uncertain information obtained by questionable means in a hostile environment. The movie graphically depicts frustrated American operatives frantically using torture to obtain information from detainees regarding bin Laden's whereabouts with limited results. The movie also depicts American operatives flagrantly violating Pakistani airspace to attack bin Laden. Whether these actions were proper is left to the audience to decide; the movie does not take sides. But what the movie does convey is the fact that the United States is fighting a war that is unlike any war previously fought, with an enemy that is elusive and transnational, and that tactics requiring speed and stealth can produce positive results, provided there is accurate intelligence.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Good Quality Movie,"Realistic portrayal of CIA's efforts to locate Bin Laden and Operation Neptune Spear without too much frill. By doing so, 'Zero Dark Thirty' is able to focus on the task at hand in chronological order. The whole organization of the movie is professional, clean, and even chic. Personally, the navy team's operation part is more interesting because that's where the actual action starts. Much preparation on the CIA's side is also a crucial part. And who keeps casting Jason Clarke? His pronunciation and delivery are unclear as heck. It's not a part of acting; it's just who he is. His facial expression is weird, and his performance is uncharismatic.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Fascinating Look at Human Perseverance...Told by Two Masters of the Craft,"""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a fascinating story of human perseverance, told beautifully (Greig Fraser definitely took some notes from Barry Ackroyd for the cinematography). With a superb cast (Jessica Chastain clearly deserved the nod, and Jason Clarke brought his controversial character to life), Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow did everything right...again. The scribe of ""The Hurt Locker"" wrote and executed iconic lines and scenes (specifically the Maya and Joseph confrontation, as well as the eventual raid on Bin Ladens hideout) and Bigelow was able to nail every breathtaking and emotional moment perfectly.Probably the biggest standout of the film, though, is the editing. The complete fluidity was mind-altering, and the 18 minute long scene when the S.E.A.L.s raid Bin Ladens house is perfection.Overall a superb and emotional film (especially backed my Desplats breathtaking score), definitely a lot better than some of the other Oscar contenders.This film is Golden.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Dramatic Movie,"This is just a outstanding movie, I really liked the movie but itwould've been much if they reveled the face of bin Laden,Literally no one knows whether he is Bin Laden or no? but overall its a good performances by actors who ever acted in this movie.Highly appreciated for shooting at real places, but the dog didn't do anything in movie? in reality he did something to find terrorist. isn't he ? The truth is that the film, having been shot in India, is more close to the Indian reality than it is to ours. Jessica Chastain's character tells her colleague ""SUV's are very rare in Pakistan"". Nothing can be more farther than the truth. In India, yes, the trend of bigger cars is quite non-existent. But in Pakistan? I can bet we have more Range Rovers, Land Cruisers, Pajeros, Prados, Vigos and Lexuses than in most middle-sized American cities like Denver or Dallas. Streets are littered with such displays of status and power, and they are often used even in the villages by local landlords. The number plates did not match any of the ones in use in Pakistan, and the beautiful and juvenile city of Islamabad was shown as a shabby, dingy, worn-out city one could have called Hyderabad from India. Places like the Marriott Hotel are some of the most upscale places in the capital with little or no conservative practices, yet women in the film are almost always burqa-clad.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Controversial? Sure. Entertaining? Oh yeah,"A chronicle of the hunt for Osama Bin Laden from the perspective of the CIA culminating with the raid by Navy SEALS? Yes, please. While this year's Act of Valor had the action and authenticity, Zero Dark Thirty brings the writing, pacing, and true story to the big screen, and it's one hell of a ride.Relative unknown Jessica Chastain takes the lead as Maya, an abrasive and driven CIA agent that joins the search for those that are responsible for 9/11. Over the course of a decade, her grit and determination bring the ultimate goal within reach: finding enemy #1, Osama Bin Laden.This movie is evidence that Kathryn Bigelow can continue to meet the high standard she set with 2008's The Hurt Locker. Even though the search takes place over a decade and there are many more setbacks than successes, Zero Dark Thirty keeps your attention throughout and has you on the edge of your seat for the gripping conclusion. The acting is superb; Chastain knocks it out of the park and the performances by Jason Clark and Kyle Chandler add a lot of depth (both of them should get more prominent roles in my opinion, especially Chandler). In the end, though, it's all about the story. With the book No Easy Day coming out last year, this story is already known to some, but it's always different to see it on the big screen. The fact is that Americans grew tired of wars that seemed to be producing no results, so it's a pretty big deal when our original target is finally eliminated. Whatever your political stance is, you have to respect how important this event was. The script was actually originally written before Bin Laden was killed (and was subsequently changed afterwards), so believe me when I say that this film isn't the waving of a victory flag. Instead, Zero Dark Thirty is a testament to how long and difficult the mission was.The only real issues I had with this film are also something to be appreciated - the true story wasn't overly cinematic. I don't want to give anything away, but the end sequence just didn't feel as smooth as the rest of the movie. Go check it out and judge for yourself, though!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

Torture porn,"This is largely a work of fiction, as are all movies that pretend to recount history. They may contain a few facts, but they invent more and leave out most, giving at best a distorted, partial view, and at worst outright propaganda.However, this one is much worse than usual. It begins with an extended and entirely gratuitous sequence of torture scenes, and then pretends that torture produced actionable intelligence against Osama bin Laden. In real life torture is useful only for extracting false confessions and whatever ""information"" the torturers have settled on in advance.To make matters worse, the creators of the movie pretend that they are not defending torture, but simply presenting what happened for the viewer to evaluate. This is in the spirit of the Fox News propaganda slogan, ""We report, you decide"".There are multiple versions of the hunt for Osama bin Laden. It is proposed that someone, possibly Barack Obama, possibly CIA torturers, possibly those who actually got the information, heroically defended the nation from the ultimate bad guys, or else someone, possibly Barack Obama, possibly CIA torturers, possibly CIA operatives posing as immunization workers in Pakistan to look for bin Laden, shredded the Constitution and the standing of the US around the world in assassinating Osama bin Laden, with little effect on actual Al Qaeda operations, and increased danger to US soldiers and to civilians everywhere. Or Obama did it all for political gain, because he hates America. None of these versions has much to do with the facts of the case. Certainly this movie is more part of the problem than part of the solution.For example, CIA torture is one of Al Qaeda's strongest recruiting tools, and the CIA's fake immunization program in Pakistan has resulted in the murders of nine actual immunization workers in the tribal regions of Pakistan, and will result in hundreds of deaths of children and crippling of many more by polio. As I said, movies are necessarily fictional by omission, and this one is more fictional than most.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Zero Dark Thirty,"Remember ""Act of Valor"" from earlier this year? Do you also remember how terrible it was? What dreadful performances the SEALS tried to provide? That movie was a bad concept to begin with, but the last thirty minutes of the thrilling and powerful ""Zero Dark Thirty"" make up for it swiftly. The half-hour scene where the SEALS invade Bin Laden's hide out and gun him down is easily the most pulse-pounding half-hour of the year. Somehow it goes by in seemingly both mere minutes and long hours, because while thoroughly enjoying ourselves, we are also painfully eager to find out what happens next.The director, Kathryn Bidgelow, who brought us a great film called ""The Hurt Locker"" in 2009 after twenty years of making bad ones, has surprisingly made a film even better than ""The Hurt Locker."" I have a feeling Mark Boal, the screenwriter of both movies, brings out the best in her as a director. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" tells a story spanning a decade with a brilliant and electric urgency. It's the blow-out, eye-popping, heart-stopping, mind-rocking thriller of the year. Be ready to be blown away. Like I said a paragraph ago, the way the film rolls along is almost indescribable, because we're so eager to get to the end, yet so wrapped in the moment, that keeping track of the way time is actually passing is virtually impossible. Though it doesn't sound like it, I'm nearly completely sure that's a compliment.Let's move on to Jessica Chastain. She's incredible here, even better than she was in ""The Help"", and, though the performances were vastly different, that's still saying something. It also says something that both of those performances can be so vastly different, but still both manage to be great. Chastain is currently a very underrated actress who can display a variety of emotions, but isn't familiar to your average Joe because rather than picking mainstream money-makers, she picks good films to star in. I hope to see her in more developed and varying roles in the future.You can expect ""Zero Dark Thirty"" to take a chunk out of Oscar, because, not only is it a great film, but it also touches on a subject that was featured on the news. Oscar loves those types of movies, because they don't judge films based upon their quality. No, Oscar judges films based on their ambition and their relevance, so Bidgelow's thriller should be a shoe-in for a Best Picture nomination and four or five others. Though both aren't the Best Picture of the year, but are both great film, I believe, and you heard it here first, that the award will go to either ""Lincoln"" or the film I'm currently reviewing. Apart from award-show banter, I just want you to go see ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" and see it in the theaters. I assure you, it's a knockout.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Among The Best Movies of 2012,"The movie begins with a black screen. It is 11th September, 2001 and there are voice overs talking about the crash,about the cockpits and last words of the passengers who were on board the fateful flights or who were burning to death in the towers. The action then shifts to 2003 wherein the CIA is torturing a detainee to find out relevant information. There is a CIA analyst who is watching the torture and is being repelled by it. A few years and a few bombings and attacks later, the detainee tells them the name of Bin Laden's courier and the hunt begins. Brilliantly directed, this for me is the movie of the year. The viewer has to have rudimentary knowledge about the ""honchos"" of Al Qaeda to follow the proceedings and I was kind of fortunate that I had read No Easy Day by Mark Owen before watching this. The acting is brilliant with Chastain looking like a sure shot bet to win the Best Actress Oscar. She is amazing and conveys her disgust,anger and sadness so well that it is very difficult to digest the fact that she is a comparative newbie.Screenplay is very gripping and Boal is in a fight to the finish with Tarantino for the best original screenplay. The direction is better than it was in The Hurt Locker and hence I was surprised that Bigelow wasn't nominated.

A great movie of manhunt... with some drama,"The mission to neutralize the greatest terrorist of the time and mastermind of attacks of 9/11, was most important mission of all. Death of Osama bin Laden was widespread topic of interest. Everyone was shocked as well as surprised to know that hunt of this man was over. This shock and surprise is one of the factor which helped 'Zero Dark Thirty' to get everyone's attention prior to release of film. But after watching movie it will be not much to say that it was last factor in success of this movie.Zero dark thirty is dramatic version of mission of greatest manhunt in the history. It is point-of-view presentation which revolves around one CIA agent.I watched movie with the point-of-view-of-a -movie, of course. If I try to forget about some controversies it is surrounded with, then I can definitely say it is a great movie. I enjoyed the movie same as I did the last movie of this duo, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal. Kathryn Bigelow as a director has done splendid work to connect every piece together and create a great movie that keeps the audience to stay on their seat till the end. It was also a great work of Mark Boal in screenplay. Cast is full with great performances. Jessica Chastain's work is impressive as CIA agent Maya. Composer Alexandre Desplat has came up with some good pieces , as he has done so before this year.

The CIA Gives It Two Thumbs Up,"Here's another controversial one, ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" due largely to its depiction of torture as providing valuable intelligence, including, if not vitally so, in the main narrative dramatizing the hunt for Osama bin Laden--the killing of whom during the movie's production led to its riveting night-vision climax. I'm not interested in debating the merits of so-called ""enhanced interrogation techniques,"" let alone the merits of euphemisms, though. Besides, these scenes are portrayed in a similarly composite fashion to that of the made-up character played by Jessica Chastain, her PhD-inflated buddy CIA officer who from scene to scene goes about waterboarding seemingly on a whim to re-enacting the infamous photos from the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal. It's all historically dubious before we even get to the matter of to what end and before that fully emerges, the Bush administration and torture is out and the Obama administration is in. The throughline here is that it's a CIA-approved dramatization.Just like the various branches of the Defense Department, the CIA has an entire department devoted to supporting scripts; it's just not usually as profitable to Hollywood as the taxpayer-provided production values of American military weaponry. But, in this case, it can gain access to real intelligence operatives and, reportedly, get screenwriter Mark Boal invited to a ceremony where CIA Director Leon Panetta allegedly divulged classified information. It's a two-way street, though, and if Boal and director Kathryn Bigelow gained by such access, the production would've also had to submit to what the government would allow it to portray. No wonder the CIA comes across looking good here or that their ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" are treated as ambiguous at worst and ultimately overcome. Glimpses on TV of Bush's ""Mission Accomplished"" speech or an Obama interview against torture do little more than mark the passage of time. Nobody of higher rank than Panetta, by way of James Gandolfini, is portrayed by actors here.Yet, it's quite an engrossing and thrilling procedural, looking for that ""needle in a haystack,"" whether monitoring torture sessions, tracking terrorists, or observing satellite footage of Bin Laden's obscured fortress, and topped off by an outstanding climax based around sight where the camera shares the night-vision points-of-view of SEAL Team 6. As I've said in my reviews for these other titles, ""The Report"" (2019) and ""The Mauritanian"" (2021) may afford to be more critical of the CIA and torture, but they're simply not as well-made movies as the officially-compromised and supported ""Zero Dark Thirty."" About the only time Bigelow and company succumb to the sort of cute formulaic tricks heavily exploited in those productions is when Chastain writes in marker on her boss' office window the numbers of days they had yet to act on her finding Bin Laden's compound.Overall, Chastain deserves the acclaim she received for her performance here. It had to be good to make such a non-character character of the slightest interest to follow around for some two-and-a-half hours. When she says she's done nothing for the agency besides finding Bin Laden, she's not wrong, because she doesn't exist outside of that narrative purpose in this movie. She's not real. There are benefits to such a protagonist, though. There's nothing to distract from the mission, which seems to take on an almost journalistic aesthetic at times, beginning the picture with just audio of phone calls from 9/11 victims and proceeding from terrorist attack to terrorist attack (the best case here of torture being ineffective, as in preventing those attacks), mixing shots of their dramatization to clips of actual TV footage. It makes sense given Boal's journalism background. Indeed, I just reviewed ""In the Valley of Elah"" (2007), which was inspired by an article he wrote. Such a style works well, too, with Bigelow and company's realistic and grimy shaky-cam work. Just the CIA-approved facts, ma'am. The pure, devoted public servant. I'll even take the depiction of torture here over Bigelow and Boal's subsequent and exploitative ""Detroit"" (2017). At least torture is only part of the narrative here that is about combatting terrorism and not torture porn masquerading as anti-racism.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Jessica Chastain shines in a nail-biting thriller,"With ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" Oscar-winner Kathryn Bigelow (""The Hurt Locker"") gives us an up-close and personal look at the ""the greatest manhunt in history"" and the result is a cold, calculated film effortlessly mining the dark world of terror. While the film may not be the best of the year, its true winner is Jessica Chastain's knock-out, Oscar-worthy performance.""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a taut, sometimes menacing thriller, but with an almost three-hour runtime, it is a slow burning movie. The film opens with controversial torture scenes then plods along with interrogation after interrogation until the team discovers the identity of Osama bin Laden's most-trusted courier. Until that time, the film is stagnant, but once it takes flight ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a nail-biter all the way to the final raid on Bin Laden's compound.While the torture scenes and the SEALS raid bookend the film, it is Chastain's mesmerizing performance that is most memorable. Chastain is brilliant showing us the dramatic change of character over a ten year period. The majority of the dialogue in ""Zero Dark"" is unemotional, centered around data, field-talk and speculation, but Chastain shows all the inner conflict in her tired, exhausted eyes.""Zero Dark Thirty"" is often like a cinematic history textbook as it takes us through some of the past decade's most horrific moments, from the 2005 London bombings to the 2008 attack on the Islamabad Marriot. Each incident propels Maya further down the rabbit hole, increasing her obsession and isolating her within her own department.But Bigelow's film-making chops are best shown during the action scenes. The Navy SEAL raid on bin Laden's compound really is an incredible piece of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Knowing what come next was good,"Zero Dark Thirty is a dramatized version of CIA decade hunt for Osama Bin Laden. The impetus of the search was led by ""Maya"", a CIA agent whose dedication led to the Al Qaeda number 1. Anyone who had been following terrorism closely would more or less knew the plot and would anticipate what would be coming next in the movie. However, unlike other movies that knowing the plot would certainly kill your pleasure of watching the show, this ""almost"" accurate portray of CIA hunt for OBL had you wanting to see what is going to come next. The climax of the show is the Navy Seals raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Though most had felt this part as the holy grail of the show, I would think that the depiction and events leading to the raid as the essence of the movie. I would certainly urge anyone who had the slightest interest in terrorism and history to watch the show. Even someone with no propensity or inclination for terrorism or history would be moved by the dedication of Maya in her search for OBL.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Genuinely not impressed,"Here's what I expected going in to Zero Dark Thirty: a really fantastic piece of cinema that I would grudgingly be forced to appreciate even while disagreeing with its depiction and value judgement on torture (I was aware of the controversy prior to viewing).What I got instead was a surprisingly boring movie, that had almost non- existent character development, very conventional (mundane) writing, and not much substance. I don't know why critics are in love with the movie; it's not a good documentary, and it isn't a very compelling piece of fiction either.I would give ZDT an average rating overall (technically, it's by no means a TERRIBLE movie), but for the ""small"" fact that it ends up being unabashedly apologist for ""enhanced interrogation"" (torture). We're told time and time again throughout the movie how important the ""detainee program"" was to finding Bin Laden, we're shown how torture broke the captives, and then how prisoners eventually start spilling vital secrets because of ""biology"" (the inevitable conclusion to torture, the movie tells us, is the truth). This all is, by most clear thinking and civilized people, morally reprehensible and patently false. Just ask John McCain, himself a victim of torture.Even a well crafted movie would get a low score from me if it presented torture as a necessary but evil truth serum, and Zero Dark Thirty is not that.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Nice Mystery-Thriller Type Story,"There was movie a long time ago, ""The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight,"" about some bungling mafia guys. ZDT could be subtitled ""The Gang That Couldn't Think Straight,"" in reference to the bungling at the highest levels of the CIA that unnecessarily prolonged the track-down of Osama Bin Laden, except that this movie focuses on the analyst who stuck to the job and got it done, with only fleeting glimpses of the higher-level nitwits in D.C. that she had to deal with right up to the day of the climactic raid. I liked the way the story was told as a detective mystery thriller, not a military action violence-soaked saga like so many other war movies have been lately. Well, after all, the raid on Bin Laden's hideout lasted less than an hour anyway. What came up missing, though, was the backdrop of politics that pervades all decision-making in the CIA/Defense Department, and how their incompetence helped delay the tracking down of Osama Bin Laden. One scene depicts a suicide bomb attack at a ""secure CIA base"" in the Afghanistan in December 2009 killing eight Americans including a DC-based analyst, a direct result of CIA administrators bypassing security measures and sabotaging that analyst's efforts at finding Bin Laden, but we don't get that political backdrop in the movie. The heroine of Zero Dark Thirty had to have faced the same political hurdles, but all we see are the male vs. female attitude conflicts, like a bunch of guys in a meeting room who can only give the CIA Director 60 percent confidence they've found their target because they're afraid of saying 100-percent and putting their careers on the line. If the story/movie is accurate, my first question is ""if this is the gal who found Bin Laden, why isn't she running the CIA now?"" Well, because she's a woman, that's why, and the movie makes that crystal clear. It would have enhanced the movie to include scenes of what Bin Laden was doing in his lair all that time, based on what we now know that he wasn't ""in the background of Al Qaeda"" like many CIA thought simply because his house wasn't on the electric grid. It never occurred to these guys how a guy who hid in caves could mastermind 9/11, he could just as easily keep running the outfit while hiding in an apartment? Duh! The performance by Jessica Chastain is well worth the acclaim she has received for it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Greatest Man hunt in History,"""I'm not your friend. I'm not gonna help you. I'm gonna break you.""Zero Dark Thirty is one of the best directed films of this year. Kathryn Bigelow managed to orchestrate a film that transcends it's own cultural relevance delving deeper into the true depravity of human nature. Bigelow shows the extent American citizens went to capture Osama Bin Laden and the pathos of each individual who had to give up their lives, families, and even morals to capture an immoral man.Jason Clarke (lawless, 2011) plays Dan, a CIA employee, PHD recipient, and ruthless interrogator. Clarke opens the film truly frightening, ""When you lie to me I hurt you."" He says every line in this film with such conviction that you cannot help but feel unnerved by his presence. This in not to say Clarke does not draw sympathy, he later becomes the perfect foil and at some points mirror image of Maya (Jessica Chastain). Clarke really surprised me in this film by showing his range as an actor, his ability to draw many different emotions from a complex character who could have been played off as a solider of fortune rather than a patriotic man who has reached him limits.Jessica Chastian once again shows her range in this film as Maya, a CIA researcher compelled to find Osama Bin Laden. The obsession and dedication present in a man hunt is executed perfectly by Chastain, who really understands the depravity present in the ever changing character. Chastain is able to show the strength and innocence both present in Maya, and how these two characteristics juxtapose each other truly reflecting realistic person; who struggles to maintain herself in extreme circumstances.One thing this film really shows is the idea that in order to understand a character you must first understand the historical influence which effects them. This film perfectly crafts the loss of morals required in a man hunt against an immoral man. As each character struggles to maintain a standard. that same feeling is present in everyday life. To witness horrors and vow to never be a part of them, only to be the facilitator the next minute. Zero Dark Thirty shows the capability in humans for evil.The set design was fantastic in this film. They were able to perfectly re-create Osama Bin Laden's safe house. Also the helicopters and mission sequence felt very authentic through the use use of appropriate steady cam (unlike The Hunger Games) and the use of night vision.The pace of the film is excellent, with a balance of suspense from a thriller and knowledge from a documentary. Bigelow manages to make the film seem less overwhelming by balancing the names, dates, facts, and information with human pathos. the 25 minute mission sequence is a bit lagging as I found myself waiting for emotional reward. This also shows the power of Bigelow's directing, even though I knew the conclusion I still felt an overwhelming suspense for the unknown.Zero Dark Thirty is one of the most emotionally resonant films of the year, but also one of the best. Check it out while it's in theatres.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A bit overrated but still a good movie.,"Zero Dark Thirty was not the movie I expected. I went in expecting more of an international thriller involving the capture of Osama Bin Laden but the movie has much more of a crime drama feel to it. It's very slow and has almost no action whatsoever. That's not necessarily a bad thing it's just not what I expected based on the trailers for the film. I will also say this: The critics have highly overrated this film. Now don't get me wrong, I do not mean to make this review sound negative because I thought it was a really well made movie. The acting, especially by Jessica Chastain was superb. She's truly one of the best female actresses out there and I expect her to have many more leading roles in the near future. I also thought that the way the movie focused on her struggles to fight for her stance was well done. Lastly, I loved how the film ignored any political bias whatsoever. I was worried that there would be a slight liberal slant in the film and I didn't think there was any. With the way media is today, that was refreshing. The only negatives I had were that the ending wasn't done as well as it could've been and didn't feel like it fit with the tone of the movie. Also, the director decided to break up the movie into chapters for some reason and that was a terrible decision. The film flowed just fine without it but that added an episodic element that made a long movie feel even longer.

"Tense, gripping and satisfying end...","The controversy surrounding Kathryn Bigelow's latest manhunt saga may pertain to the depiction of inhuman interrogation techniques employed by C.I.A in its pursuit of Al Qaeda operatives but what might really worry the Agency, is Hollywood's persistent depiction of its scandals, cover-ups and failures overseas. While the 'Green Zone' blew CIA's cover on the pursuit of WMD in Iraq, its credibility was at stake in a decade long hunt for Al Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Bigelow's 'Zero Dark Thirty' enlightens us about one agent's single-minded, relentless pursuit of that leader for almost a decade, through various leads, targets and disappointments. Her challenges are not only within the immediate environment in the region but also the bureaucratic nature of the Agency and Pentagon's contrarian directives back home. Bigelow takes quite some time to go through the decade of investigations and frustrations but soars in the last 30 mins as the film arrives with the navy seals in Abbottabad, Pakistan.As Maya (Jessica Chastain) joins the CIA on field in Pakistan, she quickly learns that truth arrives only after intimidation. The detainees offer some vital leads about suspected leaders of Al Qaeda but Maya's tireless efforts in pursuing each one often leads straight into a wall. The world's most dreaded militant organization isn't such an easy nut to crack and therefore, through the years following various attacks across the world by the militants, the CIA is yet unable to obtain any clue about the leadership's whereabouts. This leads to Pentagon questioning the billions spent in Afghanistan and initiating troops withdrawal with the lack of success in finding Bin Laden. But in 2011, it all turns a sharp corner when there is conclusive evidence about Abu Ahmed's movements. Maya has long pursued this close aid of Bin Laden who was either believed dead or impossible to find, owing to his critical role as the leader's trustworthy messenger. Ahmed's car is followed to this compound that might have the jackpot that America has been on the hunt for a decade. It is now up to Maya to convince the Agency's heads to deploy a team to apprehend those hidden in there, based on her intuition, knowledge and experience in the pursuit of Osama Bin Laden. Thus, a US Navy Seal team is sent on a quick, discreet mission to Abbottabad, near the Pakistan Military Academy.The failures and frustrations confronted by Maya are similar to those faced by Mariane Pearl, played by Angelina Jolie in 'A Mighty Heart'. In both cases, leads were hard to find and most findings led to a disappointing end. The complexity of working in a foreign land that can occasionally turn hostile on its tourists, is also well depicted in both these movies but there is one distinction; Jessica Chastain lacks the credibility that was portrayed by Angelina Jolie. Indeed the characters are completely different but drawing parallels between them does put the Oscar hype around Chastain into some doubt. With just one main character in the entire story, we needed a more dominating performance to really feel the complexity, the intricacy, the dedication, the frustration and the closure. Chastain has a couple of strong moments, such as her defense against her superior and in the decision room before the climax but are they enough to justify her trophy against many worthy contenders?Through the film's patient, dedicated pursuit of several leads, hurdles and set backs, we arrive at the crux of its subject matter in the last half hour when it gathers an all new momentum. Suddenly, this docu-drama turns into a 'Black Hawk Down' action showdown and leaves us satisfied in the end because we had known it all along. Kathryn Bigelow's treatment of the story is similar to her Oscar winning 'The Hurt Locker'. She keeps the grip tight with some excellent narrative, which compensates for the lack of stronger characters and brings in the action at the right times, aligned well with their real time occurrence in recent history. The final 30 mins are simply brilliant with the Navy Seals preparing for their mission, flying through the Hindu kush ranges and eventually engaging in a tense raid of the compound at 12:30am.Kathryn Bigelow deserves the respect and appreciation that she has garnered with her two most recent films and while 'Zero Dark Thirty' is a gripping dramatization of the real events leading to the end of Osama Bin Laden, the CIA on the other hand, will be glad that their hunt for the weapons of mass destruction wasn't futile. They simply had the wrong country and it was just 'a weapon' that caused mass destruction.8.25 on a scale of 1-10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Good but not as good as ""Hurt Locker.""","""Zero Dark Thirty"" is unfortunately not ""The Hurt Locker."" The success of ""Hurt Locker"" was its attention to detail and well-formed characters. Boal and Bigelow scrape together office loads of people and create the rather annoying heroine, Maya, played by Jessica Chastain. A woman who in the middle of the Afghan desert still has the ability to have perfectly pressed clothes and coiffed hair. Her acting was way over-wrought. The fight between Maya and her supervisor seemed cliché. The movie felt like a made-for-TV reenactment. Unlike ""Argo,"" this movie had little suspense. It went through the motions without giving the audience anything to care about. Sure, Bin Laden was killed. Okay great. I didn't feel anything for Maya. This was a good movie, but certainly not Oscar worthy.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Zero Dark Eight out of Ten - Noodles Review,"Though it didn't win Best Picture, it's a movie worth seeing. Zero Dark Thirty is directed by the Academy Award-winning director Kathryn Bigelow, known for her 2010 best picture-winning The Hurt Locker. It's the true story about the pursuit of the infamous brain behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks.Right off the bat, Zero Dark Thirty is a very intelligent movie. It's not just another war movie about the troops running around with their guns (although there are very thrilling sequences of this). The heart of Zero Dark Thirty is really with the people behind, tracking the paper trail of the bad guys. Jessica Chastain's character, Maya, leads the way. This film is really her show. There are other characters that come in and out, but Chastain is the center of this movie. Zero Dark Thirty spans quite a few years, starting in 2003, all the way to Bin Laden's death in 2011. It's interesting seeing Chastain's character grow up from a rookie at the start of the movie to a veteran near the end. This type of character development is almost as stellar as that of Tom Hanks's Forrest Gump. The development of Maya is one of the most important components of the film. In watching it, the viewer is truly on board with her, hunting down Bin Laden with her. However, the amazing development of Maya overshadows the other characters in Zero Dark Thirty, making the majority of them much less important.What was really lovable about Zero Dark Thirty was that it really pushed the limits. There were a lot of scenes that were disturbing to watch and unapologetic, but that's the beauty of it because these things really did happen and it makes the film that much more realistic and engrossing. At times in the movie, you really feel like your in the situation with the characters. The realism doesn't stop there; it continually transcends itself for the two-and-a-half hour run time. Unfortunately, the realism of it also includes some boring and long scenes of office work and phone calls. Though, this adds more to feel that you are there with Maya on the hunt. You feel how she feels: the frustration, the boredom, and the apathy at some points.On the contrary to the long and drawn out scenes of the office, the film contains a ton of intense and suspenseful scenes; particularly the last half hour. Before watching this movie, I was informed that the last 30 minutes of Zero Dark Thirty would be one of the most thrilling movie- going experiences ever. It really doesn't disappoint. Even knowing how the movie will end, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.All in all, Zero Dark Thirty, so far, the best film of 2013. It's acted phenomenally (especially by Jessica Chastain who was my pick for the Oscar for Best Actress); it's gripping to the edge; it's strong, realistic, and unapologetic. Zero Dark Thirty is a movie recommended to anyone who can handle the intensity of it and will, without a doubt.",8.0,Anonymous,History
This is an incredibly powerful movie!,"The movie ""Zero Dark Thirty"" has won a lot of awards for its amazing job in capturing the events surrounding the killing of Osama Bin Laden. The search began in the year 2001 and continued through until 2011. It is based on the hunt for Osama Bin Laden due to his destruction of the World Trade Center. The Seal Team Six was the main group of people who physically took down Bin Laden and his group.The bulk of the movie takes place in Iraq. The main characters portrayed in this movie were Dan, Maya, Joseph Bradley, and Jessica. Since the Al- Qaeda terrorist organization took down the World Trade Center, the then President Bush, made it a huge priority to put an end to Bin Laden and his group for good. Through it took ten years to bring the terrorists to their knees, it was well worth it.The real life person, and character in the movie, who is credited with actually finding Bin Laden is, Maya, played by Jessica Chastain. She was the one who ordered people to help find his compound. Maya did a great job in finding the compound. Jason Clarke, who played Dan, helped to get a lot of information out of the people who took part in 9/11.What I like most about this movie is how it captured the feelings of the actors and actresses. They depicted the movie well. Also, they really made you feel for the characters. I remember one scene very vividly, after Seal Team Six took down Bin laden, Maya went to verify the body. She gave a slight nod, to indicate yes and then left the body, started packing, and went back to Washington D.C. When she had all of her belongings, she went on the plane, and started to cry. I would say that Maya was very happy that Osama Bin Laden was finally killed. She had just spent the last ten years of her career working to hunt down Bin Laden, and now it was over. This was probably very overwhelming her. I felt truly happy for what Maya had accomplished.One of the lessons in this movie is perseverance and sticking to what you believe in. Maya stuck to what she believed in and her determination helped to bring down one of the most notorious terrorists. She played a huge role in the take down of Osama Bin Laden. Another lesson is, don't let someone in a higher position pull you down. You are all equal, no matter what position.The main group of people who would enjoy this movie would be adults, or people who were there from the beginning with 9/11. Also, people who were or are a part of the military. Lastly, people who are interested in the history of this country would enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"engrossing, entertaining propaganda","I saw this movie in a rather strange form. I watched the first hour, but by the end of that my girlfriend was so freaked out by all the very convincing torture scenes and general sense of gritty violence that she couldn't watch anymore. A year later, she decided it was time to watch the rest. Oddly enough, it turns out by the time she had stopped, the torture was over.In fact, the movie has at least three distinct parts, an early section devoted to interrogation, then a section devoted to analysis and lobbying Washington, and then an infiltration section.The first section is gritty and well done, but it's also where all the controversy lies. The movie takes the position that torture is how we got our actionable intelligence, something a later congressional report suggested was not true. The movie hues very closely to how the military wants this mission to be portrayed, from its effective interrogation to its brilliant analysis to its artful infiltration.Of course, lots of movies portray torture as magically effective, even though historically, torture is anything but. The problem is, this movie claims historical accuracy.Beyond that, it's an interesting movie, especially the final section, which goes against pretty much everything you'll see in a typical war movie. The soldiers are methodical, gunplay is over almost before it begins, and the body count is kept to a minimum. It feels very realistic and completely devoid of Hollywood flash.While well made and engrossing, I never found this movie as thrilling as the critics did. It is a good movie, but I wouldn't call it a must-see movie, even if I didn't have issues with its politics.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Fantastic film making,"I can not, of course, know what is true and what is not regarding the torture in the beginning of the film, but to call it ""torture propaganda"" as some of the comments claim, I just think is incorrect. I don't think anyone who saw the film thought the depiction of the waterboarding, for example, was anything but horrible, and I even started feeling sorry for the guy having to endure such a treatment..And to trash the ENTIRE film based on ones opinion on torture is just silly. You can't neglect all the qualities it holds: the acting is as good as flawless and the sense of realism during every scene is incredible. Even though it was over two and a half hour long, I could easily have sat through an additional couple of hours, thanks to the amazing dialogue and suspenseful storytelling.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Tough thriller with no heart,"An epic-length film chronicling the complex, confusing, and sheer frustrating decade-long hunt for terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden, ZERO DARK THIRTY is directed Kathryn Bigelow's follow up to the masterful THE HURT LOCKER. Unfortunately this turns out to be a middling production that's just not in the same league as its predecessor.The nature of the problem seems to lie in the script, which struggles to make a decent storyline out of lots of chaotic and seemingly disconnected events. The nature of the hunt is a long and ultra-slow one, and it doesn't help that the viewer has no characters to connect with. Jessica Chastain won all the plaudits for her role in the lead as the woman who simply refuses to give up the hunt for what might well be a bogeyman, but her acting consists of blank-faced staring for much of the running time and I didn't warm to her at all.What ZERO DARK THIRTY becomes is a string of loosely-connected set-pieces, some of which are fantastic, others less so. The torture stuff seems rather interminable and too heavy-handed in its efforts to make a political point; on the other hand, the scenes with Jennifer Ehle are handled very well. The movie as a whole is technically proficient but it lacks bite and heart; there's no suspense or excitement here, even at the climax, which should be palm-sweatingly tense. The male characters are reduced to macho posturing (Chris Pratt, Joel Edgerton, Jason Clarke, Mark Strong) and Bigelow seems to focus more on providing distracting cameos (Scott Adkins, Edgar Ramirez, James Gandolfini, Stephen Dillane, John Barrowman) than making a truly remarkable film.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Stylized depiction of the Endgame,"Although the movie is a bit stretched in terms of time, It gives an accurate account of the Bin Laden hunt. All the actors have done a wonderful , events like London and Pak Marriott Bombings are masterfully woven in the narrative which keeps the viewers hooked. Scenes in Pakistan and Afghanistan are in my opinion are best yet in any Hollywood movie. Cons : * Feels 45 minutes too long. * Given the length, I'd have like if personal life & emotions of some of the characters were more deeply delved into (ala Hurt Locker) even if it was at the cost of factual accuracy !! - just my opinion.All in all if you have not been on earth throughout the last decade or were (like me) just too bored to care due to all the Bin Laden news overload, this movie can be a quick and dirty reference point to catch up and reflect on one the most gripping endgame in modern history.Note/Caveat : My review is for the movie as it is and not a critique of the rights or wrongs of the real world settings it is based on.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Gripping and Intense.,"The film is very intense. I had high hopes for this film as it fits my preferred genre. The film reminds me of a murder mystery rather than a man-hunt and isn't right for you if you are looking for an action packed war film. Towards the end when the investigation comes together, you heart begins to pump with the characters as they approach the compound.I found parts of the film quite disturbing when the characters are interrogating suspected members of al-qaeda, however towards the end, you begin to realised that the interrogation just adds to the effect and makes the man-hunt far more intense.I would recommend this film to people, however don't be expecting a action packed thriller unless you start watching from about three quarters of the way in.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Impressive Story, Flow Inconsistent",I thought this movie was pretty solid. I've never gone into much detail regarding the killing of Osama Bin Laden and this movie did a fantastic job of portraying the story starting with the attacks on 9/11 to the successful raid of Bin Laden's hideout (albeit some parts might be fictitious). The way the movie was able to portray real-life events while developing the story was very well done. I wasn't a big fan of Jessica Chastain in this one. I usually like her work but possibly since it was early in her career it didn't do much for me. It's possible the character was also written that way but I just wasn't connected to the protagonist as much as I wanted. The final raid scene was amazing and it tied the movie together. 3.5/5 stars.,7.0,Anonymous,History

"Remember that this is a movie, not a documentary","If you do so, you may be able to enjoy the movie better.Of course, not everything is accurate in the movie. Certain events seem to be over-dramatised. Sometimes, things happen in the movie that are actually very implausible in real life. And of course, a lot of facts or truths are incorporated into the story to lend credibility.Stop imagining this as a documentary on the search and death of OBL. See it as a dramatisation of the real story that incorporates fiction because we suspect no one really knows the entire truth, due mainly to the scope.You may not feel for many of the characters - the story isn't as character-driven as you may expect. But you may come feel that the characters all become insignificant in the grand scheme of things.And no matter your views on torture, you will come to realise real life cannot be supported by idealism alone, and may start to question yourself how staunch your beliefs are, and whether they will stand up to application in real life. It is easy to sit back, in the comfort of our homes, and moralise. I like this movie because it can help one feel the visceral impact of our own morals, wherever we may stand on them.",9.0,Anonymous,History

It does show a run of Jessica's tenacious pursuit and how she latches onto a lead which eventually gets her there. There's the bureaucratic wall that she has to bang her head against, the matter of fact depiction of the torture of suspects and the thrilling eventual raid on Abottabad.

Nomination for worst movie ever,"A very unrealistic and flat out boring depiction of this so called ""suspenseful search"".The ONLY REASON I DID NOT WALK OUT due to how terrible the film was in general, was to see the final search and assassination of Osama Bin Laden- which turned out to be even less suspenseful than the rest of the film...The situations were blatantly unrealistic, as well as the speech/communication between characters.Characters were very bland and annoying. The movie seemed to drag on forever with absolutely zero intense scenes. A few here and there were obviously somewhat intense, but never got my full attention due to unrealistic causes.Extremely high ease of foreshadowing is present, the movie is very predictable.The few attempts at humor were pathetic. The overall attempt to cover up propaganda was pathetic. Most pathetic of all was the unbelievably obvious, over dramatic acting and directing.I've never written a movie review before, even for my most favorite movies, and my most hated ones. However, this movie was so boring I felt the need to let others know, so that they will not waste their time and money on it. This movie does not deserve any awards or nominations.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A Thrilling Manhunt and One Woman's Obsession with the Mission,"I've never been much of a patriot but that doesn't mean I wasn't affected by the events of 9/11/2001. I still remember where I was when the news broke (sitting in senior English class, waiting to begin an exam) and I still remember how I couldn't quite process the events at first. Nothing of this magnitude had occurred so prominently and close to home in my lifetime. And I still remember the anger towards those responsible that I soon felt. So, while I've never been a huge supporter of a lot of our government's behavior, I was always gung-ho with the hunt for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan (before everything turned toward Iraq and it's ""WMDs""). I became incredibly intrigued with the hunt to bring this modern face of evil to justice. ZERO DARK THIRTY is all about one woman's obsession with just that: hunting Osama bin Laden. Maya (Jessica Chastain) is somewhat new to the C.I.A. but she's got laser focus on her goal: locating the man behind the most horrific attack on American soil in decades. Her quest begins at a CIA black site where Al Qaeda operatives are being interrogated and drained of information through any means necessary, and over the course of the following ten years she will risk her career (and at times, her life) in pursuit of bin Laden. Seeing as how this is a recreation of recent historic events, we pretty much know how it will end: with a team of expertly trained Navy SEALS and a seemingly impenetrable compound in Pakistan.I've never seen Kathryn Bigelow's last major film, THE HURT LOCKER, though I have read the script (and don't recall much of anything about it). I just wasn't interested. The only war movies I've ever really been interested in focused on the Vietnam War (FULL METAL JACKET, APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON, etc.). Modern warfare just doesn't grab my attention the same as Vietnam, but I was willing to give ZERO DARK THIRTY a shot based on the subject matter. I'm glad I did because Bigelow's account of the hunt for bin Laden is tense, exciting, and had me sucked in until the end credits began to roll. A lot of the credit belongs to Jessica Chastain. She brings a severe intensity to the role of Maya. Her character is driven, focused on the hunt and only the hunt. She's a keen thinker and uses her unique perspective to pursue leads that her superiors find too insignificant to bother following. Over the course of her ten-year mission, she watches as friends die and colleagues are shamed but she pushes on relentlessly. While the overall premise of the movie is the search for bin Laden, the movie is truly Maya's story. She's our hero and it's her quest we're following, even if she doesn't really figure into the final half hour or so of the film. Noinstead the final half hour is the pay-off of two hours spent following Maya's investigation.Right, so there have been a lot of accusations against this movie with angry viewers labeling it ""propaganda."" And my response would beso what? What do you expect from a movie detailing the United States' hunt for its most hated target since World War II had us killing Nazis? The movie portrays America going to insane lengths to uncover each and every bit of information they can to bring them closer to their goal (so much so that the actual C.I.A. decided to come out and vehemently deny some elements of the movie). All of this builds up to a killer TEAM America: WORLD POLICE moment with American soldiers sneaking into Pakistan for a top secret operation culminating in the moment people have waited almost an hour and a half to watch. The propaganda complaints might not be unfounded, but I just don't care. It's an engaging movie with a real-world villaina villain that murdered thousands of innocent people. I'm not watching ZERO DARK THIRTY for the ""Hooray America!"" vibes but for the manhunt and the payoff.The trick with a movie like ZERO DARK THIRTY is to go in with the mindset that you're watching a moviea fictional movieand not a documentary. Because that's what it is. I knowcrazy, right? This might be based on actual events but that doesn't mean it is 100% accurate. It is a film made for our entertainment. And it entertains. At least, it did for me. I thought ZERO DARK THIRTY was a great movie, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't normally care for these sort of movies.",9.0,Anonymous,History

I kept trying to figure out whether the character of Dan was supposed to be from the US or not. Seemed weird for him not to be, but he sure didn't sound like he was. And the National Security head (Stephen Dillane) didn't even try to sound American. Can someone in that post be British?! A strangely big and distracting detail for Bigelow to miss.

A gripping third act preceded by the fight against U.S. bureaucracy.,"There are a few key moments from cinema that stick with me, even years after watching them for the first time. Zero Dark Thirty (2012) is a little frustrating to watch, but I suppose that's the whole point. Maya Harris (Jessica Chastain) had to deal with excessive government bureaucracy to avenge the United States after September 11th. That the last 30 minutes of this movie is the most gripping sequence I've ever seen is a testament to the payoff for two hours of buildup.What strikes me with this film is how raw it feels. It's unflinching in its depiction of torture. It doesn't hesitate to show that the U. S. would do anything to get back at those who killed so many on American soil. The problem is that it seems to insinuate that continuing in this extreme manner would have brought the eventual result a lot sooner. These red tape holdups were there to prevent Americans from becoming terrorists themselves-at least in the eyes of the public and the world. Don't get me wrong, it makes for a thrilling watch despite being uncomfortable to watch.The problem with all the setbacks Maya encountered in her quest to find Osama Bin Laden was that it made this movie perhaps 30 minutes too long. The second act seems to drag as everyone around her loses interest in her objective. It's great that she's stubborn enough to persist so we could get that fantastic ending. However, the trigger for this operation seemed to come out of nowhere. The stars finally aligned for Maya to get the support she needed, but it felt so sudden as to make me wonder what changed in leadership to allow it to happen.A gripping third act preceded by the fight against U. S. bureaucracy, I give Zero Dark Thirty 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Maya/Jessica Chastain vs Osama Bin Laden,"After the horrible attacks which happened on September 11, 2001, one man became the most wanted man on the Planet by every law enforcement authorities in the world: Osama Bin Laden.Zero Dark Thirty recalls the decade long search for OBL by the CIA and in particularly by one woman, Maya, who dedicated his life and friends to bring him to justice.Maya is very obsessed with OBL. She doesn't focus on any other objective than the capture or kill of the most wanted man on the planet, the brain behind 9/11 and the murderer of thousands of people. She is a very dark character who doesn't show much her emotion and who doesn't flinch. Most of all she is resilient and while everyone around him lost hope to find Bin Laden she was the only one to carry on and finally successfully tracking him down leading to the Seal Team Six operation which ultimately ended his life.Jessica Chastain is very convincing in her interpretation of Maya as a cold CIA analyst. Such an intense character requires a certain resilience especially while shooting the torture scenes which are quite hard to see.I can't talk about this movie without evoking the torture scenes. They are certainly crude and really hard to witness but you can't deny that those enhanced interrogation techniques were widely used by the interrogators to get information from their prisoners. On that movie we are directly introduced to them at the very first scene, a sign that everything will be disclosed even the harshest truth about how intelligence was obtained. So yes those scenes are terrible but necessary. Ignoring them would be ignoring the true reality.Now lets finally talk about the assault of the Abbottabad Compound which sheltered Osama Bin Laden. I have to say that I was amazed by the high attention of details brought to the construction of the set. It is looking so real I had the impression it was shot on site while the real one was demolished soon after the raid. This is really an amazing job from the construction crew. The attack is also very well shot and intense without any exaggeration from the scriptwriters and actors.So here it is I give it a 8 out of ten. The story is captivating and well shot. The performance of the casting is convincing especially Jessica Chastain's. But this movie is not for everyone. It is a violent movie at the image of what the reality looks like. The torture scenes requires to have a solid stomach. But it's a great movie which is probably not to the taste of everyone but it deserves its Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Not a Bad Movie,"I wanted to like Zero Dark Thirty better than I did. It is a good film, but it takes a long time to get started. You never really feel like you know any of the characters.

That is very exciting and very well crafted.The torture scenes at the beginning of the movie are tame compared to others I have seen. Why there was so much controversy over torture which never reveals anything valuable is a mystery.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Unique combination of boredom, bad movie-making and tastelessness","I have not seen a worse movie in a long time. This is a unique combination of boredom as it is 2 and half hours long, with poor pace and cut. Bad movie-making, full of clichés and bad rip-offs, there is not a single good actor to find in the whole long film, and I mean really not a single one. The leading lady is absolutely unable to play and the lesser roles are packed with second grade TV series actors who look laughable in a ""serious"" movie. But what disturbed me most was the lack of any taste, morality or at least an opinion. The first part of the movie is packed with pretty graphical examples of torture by CIA and US Army, mostly on kidnapped people in black prison sites all around the world. In the movie it goes without even mentioning if this is OK, legal, or even productive as the suspects even in this movie tend to lie even more under duress. So the question that remained unanswered for me after seeing this movie is: in what sense is the US actually ""better"" than Al-Kaida when they are both using the same methods to ""win a war""?",1.0,Anonymous,History
Contemporary War Movie,"Appealing to delve into the freshness of portraying this most contemporary of wars. This is a war movie and it is one of the first Hollywood ones dealing with the War against Al-Qaeda. Similar to how the climax of WWII culminated in D-day this is the first big movie showcasing the climax of the war against al-Qaeda (dropping the elite 6 over Ben-Laden's house) and like the many portrayals of D-Day in the history of cinema there will likely be other portrayals of the elite six coming down and getting Ben-Laden.A war not so much about troops or arms or traditional battles of armies but rather a clandestine war consisting of sly CIA operatives and fanatical terrorist leaders hiding from the world. Victories and defeats not won or lost by traditional army battles but by achievements in intelligence or thwarted efforts to gain knowledge, continued concealment leading to more acts of terrorism. The beginning shows one of the battles of this contemporary war as an American operative tries to gain information through use of torture. Interestingly exposed is the strategy to gain information through the mechanism of torture. It shows how we did it and raises questions as to the morality of it. The movie did not leave the morality open for the audience but provided its biased interpretation of the situation.Innovative to make a detailed account of this contemporary war however this innovation might be giving this film more accolade than it deserves and although a very good movie not the best one of the year. More sterile historical lesson than cinematic experience as the step-by-step detailed process in getting Ben-Laden moving through the scattered military bases seemed well researched yet long, not completely thrilling and at times a bit confusing. The protagonist was the driving soul of this movie slowly becoming more and more driven, obsessed? with her goal of getting Ben Laden this was to the detriment of anything else in her life especially human interaction. She had vulnerability but a mere couple of minutes was devoted to making a real character thus the sterile feel was not only in how the story was told but was also infused into the main character. She ultimately became more symbol than human being.I do not know if one person was behind all this intelligence gathering it is hard to believe that all these years it could be one person yet the movie made it seem that it was all on this woman's shoulders. This gave Zero Dark Thirty a feminist quality by having this woman becoming the symbol and visual connotation of the CIAs secretive war against Al-Qaeda. The men either couldn't hack the intensity of the tortures and wanted to go back home, were far less committed and driven or were mere subservient foot soldiers for the female protagonists. The male soldiers were literally her arms as in a scene she touches one of them on command so that he would punch the victim being tortured. Even the elite 6 felt like extensions of this female protagonist. It was interesting to give this movie this feminist quality but it didn't seem realistic, not because it was female but because it seemed like there was only one person trying to get Ben-Laden.It was immersive, there were some nice scenes transporting us to the middle east as we see the desert towns and hear the call to prayer. A well researched, well made, immersive movie about this freshly portrayed contemporary war.",8.0,Anonymous,History
What a Story,"What a story. And what a storyteller! Katheryn Bigelow is now among my top 5 working directors. Who'd have thought you could balance sensitivity with brutality in one movie and in one actress, Jessica Chastain, who's Maya is the feminine version of Jeremy Renner's William James in ""The Hurt Locker"". Casting couldn't have been better.Bigelow probably had a feminist (as opposed to feminazi) agenda for doing this, a motivation well placed in this case, what with the focus on Maya who is the heart of the story in the eye of the storm, and the prime mover behind keeping the CIA in the hunt. The story takes your from phone recordings on 9-11, through the 10 intervening years and the near real-time portrayal of the operation, to the perfect ending with Maya in the C-130. For me, this closes the book on the 9-11 event (some would say closure), while at the same time helping us never to forget what the whole thing was about and that Al Quaeda is still out there--re: Benghazi. This ought to shore up the fears so many directors have of sticking to the history, using research to fill out the story and the characters instead of fabrications which usually end up being disappointing.The political accusations from both sides prior to its release are near nil after they moved the wide release to Jan 11. I saw one pro and one con element and they were both muted. It's showing now in only one theater in metro Phoenix, and the two screens showing it had the parking lot overflowing by 2-3 times what I'd ever seen there before at night, much less mid-afternoon. My ONLY negative is the absent or nearly unnoticeable music. I'm giving it a 10/10, but if they'd have let me pick the music to play over the credits (""Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue""), I'd be giving it an 11.For me this closes out 2012 for any award considerations, leaving this in contention with my other 10, ""Life of Pi"". It's a tossup, art vs. grit.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Tense from start to finish,"Jessica Chastain as Maya the lead character in the film does a thoroughly professional job as a CIA operative obsessed with the tracking down of the most wanted man in the world and willing to break a few eggs to make an omelet as the saying goes. The film relies heavily on actual terrorists incidents to move the story along, starting with the communications traffic that occurred in real time as 9/11 was occurring and then abruptly moving to secret off-site locations where the CIA interrogated captured terrorists suspected of being involved in 9/11. The torture scenes are not for the faint of heart and are of course the most controversial part of the movie. The movie makes the premise that torture does indeed work and that in fact it did occur, as reported by actual CIA personnel. Whether you agree with torture as a tactic or not, the scenes are hard to watch and uncomfortable. It is difficult to reconcile the horror of 9/11 with the horror that the United States of America will resort to torture to get the information it desperately wants. From the opening torture scenes the movie moves along to other major terrorist incidents that were world-wide headlines including the bus and train attacks in London, the bombing of the Marriott in Islamabad, and the attack on CIA agents at a base in Afghanistan. Parallel to the real events depicted in the movie are the use of electronic snooping to look for leads as to the whereabouts of BinLaden. The movie does a good job of showing the painstaking process of getting leads and piecing them together to provide a larger narrative. Finally as we all know they found the location of OBL and the last fourth of the movie covers that actual mission by the Navy Seals. The screenplay was excellent overall with the exception of some silly dialog related to potential boyfriends and there may have been some exaggeration of the dialog for dramatic effect but it makes the movie enjoyable and at certain points funny. This is one of the best movies of the year and a must see. Jessica Chastain adds to her already impressive resume.",8.0,Anonymous,History
What just happened?,"Impressive movie with lots of toys and factual accuracy... but somehow felt hollow and failed to keep me engaged for the length of the movie..Some of the things that bothered me.. 1) that use of torture is justified.. I understand that some seriously bad people are detained in these camps.. but not everyone is guilty..what about those innocent people who faced no prospect of a release and have been in confinement for the last decade?2) The characterisation of Maya, was in my opinion, inconsistent.. she is portrayed as this go-getter tiger, who was posted here to get things done.. and yet cringes away when someone is tortured and then act like this cold ""muthafucka"" in front of her superiors.. what is up with that?3) The movie has traded cinematic gravity for factual accuracy.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Chastain rocks, The Rest is Decent","Zero Dark Thirty is another addition to the historical movie genre. This time Bigelow has decided to glorify America by focusing on the hunt for the greatest manhunt of all time, the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. While the realism and constant evolution of the quest are impressive, this film still has some pace and balance issues to sort out to be almost three hours long. While some of the meeting scenes were interesting to me, there is only so much political bickering and repetitive complaints one can take. Despite this though, Bigelow and company did a nice job integrating the driving motives of the manhunt within the planning stages, bringing one into the CIA's world. Yet the biggest strength for this reviewer is Ms. Jessica Chastain, who once again graces the big screen with not only her charm and looks, but with her amazing talent. I felt this was her best role yet, but that's just me.For a more detailed review please check out:http://robbiesmoviereviews.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/chastain-leads- this- manhunt-to-good-things-but-lacks-on-others/",8.0,Anonymous,History

A nerve and spine tingling raw real life political international drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat.,"After watching ""Zero Dark Thirty"" you and I can respect the CIA and Navy seals and U.S. military for all they do it's one dangerous job. And every American knows of the harrowing real life story of the manhunt for Osama Bin Laden a decade long one that when finally the man was destroyed relieved everyone. This picture directed by Kathryn Bigelow(""The Hurt Locker"") is long and a drawn out telling of the journey and years of CIA work from 2001 till 2011 when Osama was brought down. And somewhat raw and grueling is the interrogation scenes of torture techniques used as this picture displayed them in a brutal manner. It's one lead, one tip, one statement after another combined with the best camera and military survey equipment that the federal government has that leads slowly, but surely to the downfall of the evil radical. This film is one massive behind the scenes journey of top notch secretive work it's suspenseful and nerve binding. And shining thru it all is the bright little lady working undercover with the CIA it's Maya(in a very blunt and fearless performance from Jessica Chastain). Overall ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is one film that pays tribute to the unsung people as it highlights the little behind the scenes things are important as all of it leads to freedom and justice for all Americans.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Zero Dark Thirty: Starting Off the New Year With a Bang!,"Zero Dark Thirty follows a C.I.A. operative's ten year man hunt of Osama bin Laden, former leader of the terrorist organization al-Qaeda, and how his death at the hands of Navy S.E.A.L. team six came into fruition.The film is told in chapters in which there is a heavy amount of dialogue that is all building up to the eventual assembly of one of the biggest moments in American Military history. For the first hour and forty five minutes of the film, the pace is very well maintained, incorporating a lot of dialogue with several small action scenes mixed in to keep the audience on the edge of your seat. However, the story really begins to slow down as the film reaches its climax and this may be the films biggest downfall. Similar to Django Unchained and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the film could probably be cut down by at least ten to fifteen minutes.Zero Dark Thirty also features a terrific cast, highlighted by Jessica Chastain's performance as Maya, for which she won a Golden Globe award this past Sunday. The film also includes performances by Jason Clarke, Mark Strong, Joel Edgerton, Chris Pratt, James Gandolfini, and Kyle Chandler. All the film's performances are outstanding and people should go and check out the film just for the acting alone.With a good story and excellent performances, Zero Dark Thirty is another great film being released just in time for the Academy Awards season. I would highly recommend going to the theatre and checking this one out.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Cohesive narrative with terrific acting a bit long and episodic but mostly worth it,"Jessica Chastain gives a magnificent and unforgettable performance as the obsessed CIA Agent Maya. As a rule, I do not care for long movies and I found Bigelow's Hurt Locker slow and unsatisfying even though much shorter than ZDT. However, even though this is more character study than action, I only looked at my watch once, The tale is told in rather episodic fashion but the episodes are gripping - especially the two surrounding Jenifer Ehle who was terrific. The length of the film seems paced to make us feel the frustration and endless desperation ans single-mindedness experienced by Maya. Kyle Chandler is well cast as her bureaucratic boss who is done in by her over-zealous maneuvers. The movie depicts Maya as a flawed heroine. It also shows the rather brutal assault on the Bin Laden house where the wives are fair game to be shot at blindly - the end of getting Bin Laden justifying the means.An aside, I was as against the wars then as I am now and my feelings about the techniques used NOT being justified by 9/11 are the polar opposite of Maya's. But in telling her story, I don't believe this movie chronicling her exhausting and obsessive pursuit of Bin Laden glorifies the American war efforts. I think it tells the story objectively showing why the Americans were so unpopular and accurately depicting the intelligence-in-the field process. In now way do I see this as the propaganda movie others here reported - not at all. I just experienced a well-told and well-acted series of failed operations ultimately resulting in the successful killing of Bin Laden but at considerable costs of lives, money, and international goodwill. The mix of emotions depicted at the end underscores the ambiguity.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Not terrible, just boring and predictable","Maybe my expectations were too high or I REALLY wanted another ""Hurt Locker"". It is also likely that it was just too soon to make this movie. The real events are so current and well known for a feature film. Looking back on it now, I'm not surprised they ended up with something resembling bad TV documentary. Just like some TV shows, I remember thinking all though the film, ""something interesting is going to happen"". Nothing ever did and in the end I was offended more than anything else. If this story is trying to be faithful to actual events, then there really wasn't enough material for them to begin with. Which is why I suspect writers REALLY had to try and insert some drama and human interest into this script. It all came off as forced and unbelievable to me. By the time the actual raid was presented it was massively anticlimactic for me (and I suspect for most viewers. I mean unless you live on the moon, you pretty much know everything that is going to happen in the last few minutes of the film don't you)? So... I would recommend you skip this unless maybe you're stuck in a hospital bed for the evening and you've already seen every other show that is available. (i.e. I can't understand any reviews that praise this film).",6.0,Anonymous,History

Another big blow from the dynamic duo,"The story spans from the tragic 911 incident to the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011. Jessica Chastain, stiffly, plays the protagonist's role as a young CIA Agent Maya whose deep determination and an eight-year endless efforts lead her to the trace of bin Laden for hunt. Through slow detailed process, the plot grows to its peak gradually and engulfs enough tension during the Operation Neptune Spear to spear bin Laden. The dynamic duo--Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal--once again deal with a powerful, complicated plot to generate an extra-ordinary creation. An impressive blend of Bigelow's well-detailed direction and Mark's intelligent script___",8.0,Anonymous,History
a good film in terms of essentials but I don't understand the fuss,"A very good film but surprisingly unsatisfying even for a viewer who loves seeing commando types running around in combat gear, with throat mics and guns. The scene at the end, in the compound was the best bit - and very tense - but the rest was not ... something. A bit ""meh!"" I don't see what all the fuss was about in terms of awards. The Direction (Bigelow) was excellent, faultless really, but I think the screenplay had something lacking. It wasn't memorable or gripping enough generally. I think that the characters were too inhuman and too shallow, they didn't really relate to the viewer (or vice versa) and I didn't much care for anyone to particularly care what happened to them. Didn't want any of the ""goodies"" to die, wanted Bin Laden to be found but had seen the footage/reenactments in so many other programs that it was a bit old and unoriginal.A good film, to be sure, but not brilliant, and somewhat empty and unsatisfying. Well filmed though and acted, but I feel the actors were not utilised enough in terms of scope of personality.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A paean to American exceptionalism,"Torturing detainees is depicted as ""day-to-day tradecraft"" in Kathryn Bigelow's thriller Zero Dark Thirty, a controversial account of the ten-year campaign to hunt down and kill Osama bin Laden, whom it is widely agreed was responsible for the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001. Jessica Chastain stars as Maya, a strong and self-assured young CIA agent who has dedicated her professional life to the capture of bin Laden. Maya has no back story and is basically a cipher but is depicted as a goal-oriented, independent woman not defined by any romantic relationship but only by her single-minded purpose.Like Argo, the film is a paean to American exceptionalism and the U.S. intelligence agencies are the heroes. As director Kathryn Bigelow has stated, the movie is about ""the unsung heroes of the intelligence community, those who work in the shadows."" According to Canadian investigative journalist, William Marsden, to obtain information, ""the White House, the CIA and the U.S. Defense Department all worked closely with the filmmakers by granting them unprecedented access to classified information so that they could come out with an authentic film."" Unsurprisingly, Ms. Bigelow stands by her screenwriter Mark Boal's interviews with CIA operatives, saying that ""I feel very confident with his reporting, very confident with my handling of his reporting.""It is the CIA, of course, that has stood by the use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques,"" a euphemism for torture. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee, however, ""The CIA did not first learn about the existence or the identity of the Osama Bin Laden courier from CIA detainees subject to coercive interrogation techniques, but through means unrelated to the CIA detention and interrogation program."" In reply, Boal has stated that the information in question was garnered not during an interrogation but calmly over lunch after the torture had stopped, a response that can only be called disingenuous.The film begins with a blank screen as we hear the voices and the cries of those trapped in the World Trade Center on 9/11. The scene then shifts to a CIA ""black site"" in Pakistan where CIA agent Dan (Jason Clarke) is subjecting an al Qaeda operative Ammar (Reda Kateb) to humiliating techniques designed to break him and give Dan the information he needs. What is disturbing about the sequence is not only the ugliness of the techniques that fail to extract information, but the fact that the film celebrates the kind of by-the-book professionalism that goes about doing the dirty jobs without any recognizable human emotion.Tied to the ceiling with ropes, compelled to wear a dog collar and crawl around on all fours, deprived of sleep by an onslaught of rock music, waterboarded, and locked in a wooden crate, the prisoner is told by the interrogator that ""This is what defeat looks like."" Fighting organization inertia, Maya tries to convince agency officials that bin Laden can be found by discovering the courier who helps deliver his messages to al Qaeda. The search to find the mystery courier is an eight-year project that involves enhanced interrogation techniques, surveillance, and ""boots-on-the-ground"" detective work.The determination of the courier's identity eventually leads Maya to discover a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where she is one hundred percent convinced bin Laden is hiding, though her colleagues require much convincing. In a riveting concluding sequence done with extraordinary realism, the film dramatizes the operation known as Neptune's Spear conducted that took place on the night of May 1, 2011 in which a Navy SEAL team perfectly executes a raid on bin Laden's compound and kills the number one al Qaeda leader.The raid begins in eerie silence as Black hawk helicopters cross the mountains from Afghanistan to Pakistan in the middle of the night. Bigelow not only shows the ""Geronimo"" moment but takes us through a room-by-room killing field. While questions have been raised about what really unfolded that night, no questions are asked in the film and the subject of whether capture was ever an option is not considered.To the director's credit, there is no American triumphalism at the end, only one of the characters sitting alone in tears, perhaps lamenting for all of us whether in the process of killing bin Laden or the use of drones to assassinate American citizens suspected of terrorism, we may have undermined the most important moral and legal values of our society, the same ones that Islamic Fundamentalists have fought against for years, the determination of guilt or innocence in a court of law. If Zero Dark Thirty can remind people of this basic incongruity, it will have served a very useful purpose.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Ambitious,"Zero Dark Thirty is an ambitious film that aims to deliver a gritty, behind-the-scenes look at the decade-long hunt for the notorious terrorist. The film boasts a meticulous approach to its subject matter, capturing the intensity and high stakes of the operation. The strengths of Zero Dark Thirty lie in its ability to create a palpable sense of tension. The film's depiction of real-world events is thorough, and the raid sequence in the final act is undeniably gripping. It's a well-crafted piece of cinema that excels in building suspense and immersing the audience in the complex world of counter-terrorism. The production design, from the set pieces to the costuming, lends an air of authenticity that helps ground the story.However, despite these strengths, Zero Dark Thirty is not without its issues. The film's pacing is uneven, with long stretches that can feel sluggish and overly detailed. The first half, in particular, is bogged down by an excessive focus on procedural minutiae, which, while accurate, can be tedious for viewers not already invested in the intricacies of intelligence work. This leads to a narrative that sometimes feels more like a detailed report than a compelling story.Moreover, the character development leaves much to be desired. Maya, as portrayed by Chastain, is compelling but somewhat one-dimensional. Her obsession with the mission, while central to the plot, is portrayed with little depth beyond her determination and occasional emotional outbursts. The film also doesn't fully explore the broader implications of the mission, such as its ethical or moral dimensions, which could have added significant depth and context.In the end, Zero Dark Thirty is a film that delivers a powerful climax and showcases strong performances and technical craftsmanship. However, its uneven pacing, limited character exploration, and controversial approach to certain topics prevent it from being as impactful as it could have been. While it's an engaging watch for those interested in the subject matter, it falls short of being a fully satisfying or comprehensive portrayal of the events it seeks to depict.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Terrible Attempt at a Film. Just....terrible.,"I gave this movie a 1 simply because kudos to people who are able to bring many other people together and make a film come to life. That is the only kudos I give for this film.Kathryn Bigelow obviously thought, since catching OBL was such an important event, everyone will simply watch whatever I film and be engaged because I say so. Wrong.I keep thinking about what I liked about this mess but I really didn't like much of anything. I care about no-one. Big mistake. I have to care about someone if I'm going to sit through drivel.Chastain is driven to catch Bin-Laden.Maya is one terribly written hollow character who mouths off to her superiors cause she's gonna find OBL. Very realistic. WHY IS SHE DRIVEN? Oh, right, no one tells us anything about why - they just assume because we hear 1 minute of trade center phone calls in the opening we're ready to go on a ride and get behind this heroin in her quest to catch Bin-Laden.NOPE. SORRY. Not enough for me. Oh wait, perhaps she's driven because her friends (that I never picked up at all that this woman had ANY friends whatsoever) had died trying to catch him. Nope. We never learn anything about this character to care at all. All we hear are 50 names no audience will ever remember of who she's trying to follow. TOO BUSY TO LEARN ABOUT MAIN CHARACTER. Keep FILMING! Some movies can do talking heads very well. But not this one. Not one bit.So remember when I said I care about no one in the entire film? Wait. I take that back. I cared more for the guy on the seal team who asks Maya ""Are you sure about this intel, cause we lost some guys on another mission trying to catch OBL."" That guy I care about - too bad he had 5 minutes of screen time and the rest went to Maya the mouth.Mark Strong's intense entrance as a director in the CIA couldn't even save this pile.Poorly acted.

It won't make you less human or extraordinarily evil.

"Despite all the bad publicity and the grousing, I thought this was brilliant filmmaking","I resisted seeing this film for several political reasons. In particular I thought it would be a smear campaign and the worst kind of one-sided propaganda. But despite all the 'mistakes' pointed out in the IMDb, most of which I am not capable of picking up on not being from the Middle East, I was very impressed. As filmmaking, it's hard to fault on almost any level.Surprisingly, Chastain is not glamorized or even unduly prettified in this film. I didn't expect that at all. Instead she comes across as the hard-working girl next door. And the Pakistanis and Taliban, or Al Qaeda, are not unduly demonized either. Instead they seem more like real people you can actually believe exist, though I imagine the real parties would be far more exacting in their verbal assaults.Though I didn't particularly like The Hurt Locker, I do like this film and have to admit that Bigelow shows enormous talent in putting this story on the screen. You would not think she would have as savvy an understanding of this subject matter as she does, being a woman.

Pretty good film,"This was a pretty good film. While everyone liked the raid in Abbottabad, I found the buildup, the chase, to be very entertaining. Kudos to Jessica Chastain, with whom I was unfamiliar. There is a lot of comment about the portrayal of ""torture"" leading to leads on bin Laden, and terrorist attacks in general. I use the scare quotes to differentiate the techniques that the CIA used from real torture, such as that practiced by, say, Arab despots, or American Indian tribes in the 18th and 19th centuries. People say that torture will not get you real information, but they do not come to it cold. They extract information that can be checked, or that they already know, in order to judge the veracity of the terrorist in question. As it happened, most of the detainees had a mindset that they must resist up to a point, but beyond that, they generally sang. As for the moral aspect, this was strictly done to gain information, and was not punitive in nature. Anyway, the film is worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Coild War Thriller Transposed to the 9/11 Era,"ZERO DARK THIRTY is a very well-made film; cleverly photographed, well told, with a stunning central performance from Jessica Chastain as a CIA operative possessing both the determination and the sheer persistence to fulfill her quest to catch Osama Bin Laden. The job is not always successful - along the way she loses colleagues and friends, the victims of terrorist bombs and/or unexpected attacks. Nor does she obtain full co-operation from her (mostly male) superiors, who seem more concerned with feathering their own reputational nests rather than accomplishing the job in hand. However, I do have to admit that the film's structure - the us-versus-them notion, with numerous sequences showing the CIA operatives tracking their prey, as well as spying on one another - is a familiar one, dating from the Cold War films of the Sixties and early Seventies. Only this time the enemies are not the Soviets, but those working for Al-Quaeda. Other clichés also prevail, including the passing of secrets in dark places, the use of extended long shots following characters walking along corridors, and the final sequence consisting of an extended raid on the Bin Laden lair. Nonetheless the film is quite entertaining, if somewhat lengthy.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Meh.,"From what I had heard about the movie, the main problem was that the movie tells the story from a strongly pro-American side. Though this is largely true, I think the actual problem is that the characters weren't particularly likable. Jason Clarke is charismatic and you start getting involved, but then he largely disappears; Jessica Chastain has her moments, but also largely fell flat, especially in scenes where the obvious implication was ""this is a heavy emotional scene"", I wasn't feeling it. Really, none of the characters, with the exception of Reda Kateb and Jason Clarke's short tenures, are particularly compelling. There was surprisingly little drama, action, or thrills to help ease the burden of poor character development and dialog.

Simply great.,"""Zero Dark Thirty"" lies between art and entertainment, realism and spectacle, effectively intertwining journalism and drama--resulting in a riveting film with provocative deliberations with reflection. As a cinematic experience, the film can be an undoubtedly punishing experience at times, given that U.S.-sanctioned torture figures prominently here, and has been flirting with controversy even before the film's release. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" reunites the Oscar winning team of director-producer Kathryn Bigelow and writer/producer Mark Boal ""The Hurt Locker"" (2008) for the story of history's greatest manhunt for the world's most dangerous man.Maya (Jessica Chastain) is a CIA operative and her only objective is the unrelenting pursuit of leads to uncover the whereabouts of Al Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Maya is a lone wolf-- a CIA agent who sticks to her convictions that bin Laden is not hiding out in caves in Afghanistan, but is likely living in relatively open sight. Based on true events, and from firsthand accounts by the CIA agents involved, the movie sets itself up very much like a docudrama. Characterization is passed over and the viewer forced to merely follow along procedurally with the characters; namely, Jessica Chastain's Maya. She is the anchor of the entire film, the one person you are given to carry you through the story, but if you are looking for a background on her you won't find it here. There are no secondary story lines here, this is strictly how Maya and her colleagues working tirelessly and continuously to find Osama Bin Laden.We watch her evolution from that first torture scene, from a smart-suited observer and wet around the ears, to several years later into her tenure in Pakistan, where she now leads the interrogation and taps a strong-arm to do the punching for her. The movie turns into the ultimate procedural, in which computer work, matching photographs, and one seeming irrelevancy after another in an old interrogation video lead Maya to a man known as Abu Ahmed, who, at regular intervals, drives a white S.U.V. from Peshawar to a house in Abbottabad. It's takes an half an hour before we first hear a name we recognize, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, the trusted bin Laden courier who will eventually lead the CIA to their mark. Though at this point in the film, victory is still years away. Over the course of a decade, Maya finds promising leads that turn into dead ends, and then unpromising little tidbits that turn into even better leads. It's imprecise work that requires meticulous attention to detail and not much of a private life.Progress is slow in ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" but the flow of information is fast and continuous, and the movie doesn't wait for you to catch up. There are more than 100 speaking parts--fellow analysts, CIA chiefs, national security advisers, and SEAL team members, many of them played by familiar faces. Characters enter for a scene or two, and just as quickly disappearing--sometimes before we have had a chance to register who they really are. Sometimes Bigelow don't even tell us the names, because she puts enough trust in the audience to assume we'll have a working knowledge of who the major players are. The coldness in tone changes drastically during the final act, when Bin Laden's compound is breached. Suddenly a wealth of emotions hits you, your gaze is unwavering, and the suspense is overwhelming. Even knowing how the story ends, it doesn't change the immense power of the final minutes.""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a film that most Americans will no doubt embrace their patriotism enthusiastically, while others might have misgivings about the use of torture on detainees. But the film's depiction of such torture doesn't condone it; it's a record of it, as part of the narrative jigsaw drawn from those who were involved. Jessica Chastain delivers an Oscar worthy performance-powerfully and defiantly standing own her own, and never backing down despite years of exasperating obstacles. An absorbing richly textured portrayal of a dark, pivotal chapter in American history that forever changed our lives.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Kathryn Bigalow and Crew never fail to deliver.,"Just watched Zero Dark Thirty. I was not disappointed. Kathryn Bigalow and team never fails to deliver cinema masterpieces, that not only intrigue but unnerve and enliven one's mind. For years Osama Bin Laden had evaded capture and had left a trail of utter devastation in his path. Zero Dark Thirty superbly portrays the work of those that eventually led to the dramatic demise of one of the worlds wanted men. Both technically and in plot delivery there are in my opinion very few flaws with this film. its not something that would suit Saturday night, family viewing, because there are numerous scenes that are somewhat disturbing.I look forward to plenty more offerings from Bigalow, a very inspiring filmmaker who deserves every ounce of recognition. In the similar words of Simon Cowell, Zero Dark Thirty 100% yes!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Matter-of-factly and fairly unpolitical,"Zero Dark Thirty is a matter-of-factly and fairly unpolitical account of the capture and assassination of Osama Bin Laden, and the long and largely futile CIA investigation leading up to it. As directed by Academy Award winning director Kathryn Bigelow, who won her Oscar three years ago for another Middle East based war/conflict film, The Hurt Locker, the film's objective is to provide an in-depth portrayal of War on Terror investigation tactics and methods, and to show how people have suffered on both sides of the axis - without passing judgement. It succeeds to a large degree. Zero Dark Thirty is far more detailed and comes off as better researched than The Hurt Locker, and even though all the principal characters are still inveterate patriots operating on an ""eye-for-an-eye"" level, the protagonist is far more interesting here than Jeremy Renner's character in The Hurt Locker. One of the reasons for this is that Jessica Chastain is such a talented actress, another that her character Maya is a woman in a man's world. And a bad-ass woman of true Cameron/Bigelow/Hamilton quality at that. Good thing she's got Chastain's sensibility to balance it out.The denouement is make-or-break for a historical account such as this, and luckily it is very tactfully executed, standing firmly as the film's thematic and narrative climax, elevating an otherwise somewhat unfulfilled experience. Because although Zero Dark Thirty is at times an effective, action-driven thriller, as a drama it is too often unfocused and emotionally drained. It may not simplify the political aspects or the course of events depicted, but it simplifies human beings and takes a clinical approach which reduces the overall impact of the film. In this respect, the film bears close resemblance with The Hurt Locker. And while I'm not going to pan Kathryn Bigelow's talents as a filmmaker completely, or make an observation such as that she's proof that when a woman is able to elbow her way to the top of the traditionalistic Hollywood ladder, this will probably be a woman whose main interests/characteristics are not the typically female, I will say that with her past two films, Bigelow has probably demonstrated just how much she can - and cannot - do as a director. And although both these films have been widely acclaimed, for me they're a few steps away from great filmmaking.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Catch him if she can,"A lot has been made of this movie. Some say it is not as realistic, some criticize it for being either pro or Anti Obama. But that is not what Bigelow went out to make. She was fascinated by everything about OBL. If and how accurate her depiction is, of how exactly that came to happen is another story. But she does not pull any stops and she does not tell people how to feel about certain things. Right from the get go, we get a scene of torture (which made some people leave cinemas around the world, I guess because they didn't expect a depiction like that), which shows us that she wants to keep it real.Of course I can understand that some are not happy with Chastains character. She is driven without apparent motivation. But that is how some people work. They let their work consume their lives. There are not really characters you can cling onto, another thing I can understand as criticism. What you can't fault the movie with though, is not caring or not being professional. The big theme is OBL, that doesn't mean that other things will be left out, but it does mean, that it is the goal it works forward to. If you're willing to accept that, you might be able to watch it and not be disappointed",8.0,Anonymous,History

Boal's script, however, is so excruciatingly boring that this one is painful to sit through. Bigelow does not help matters with her drab direction.

~Pseudo-documentary-like-thriller~,"""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a pseudo-documentary-like-thriller revealed a true story that we all know, but didn't surprise us at all. People are hungry these days. Hungry on more information about ""what's happening behind capturing Osama"", unfortunately ZDT didn't satisfy us in this way.In the start we can see a very nice modern style Shaky-cam that gives us a pretty good feeling of a documentary itself, until the moment when one realizes that he is in the middle of the cruel tortures of an Iranian prisoner that last horrible 15 minutes! Now let's talk about our main character - Maya. It's woman-centric film, where all story is spinning around her as a CIA operative and her thoughts, and ideas. What I liked in Jessica Chastaine's acting is that we can see full transformation of character starting from her firs interrogation of prisoners following the Al Queda attacks against the U.S. on the 11th September till the last moment when they caught Ben Laden in his large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. She starts as an indecisive and perplexed girl, and then going all the way of becoming a neurotic, assertive ""Iron Lady"", who didn't have private life, lost her friends, but would not give up on an idea of capturing and killing Osama.Perhaps in future in could be shown as a fine documentary in schools and colleges, but for average ""hungered audience"" we need more.",6.0,Anonymous,History
very good,"This film is a fictionalized account of the ten-year hunt to kill Osama bin Laden.This film has a strong edge to it. Much of its grit is in the deliberate deglamourization of the settings. They often look bleak yet considering the real-life locales, it would have been superficial to make them more attractive as is often done in similar films.Director Kathryn Bigelow does a great job in doing the nearly impossible - something Ben Affleck also did with ""Argo"" - that is to create a feeling of tension and suspense even when the audience already knows the final outcome. As the film is more than two and a half hours, this is not an easy task.The film begins to lag a bit in the midway point. However, during the last half hour, the grand event shows the build-up was well worth it. The darkness of the photography in the night-time operation creates a very unique impact. Also, with a fine lead performance by Jessica Chastain as a CIA officer, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" ends up as one of the best films of 2012.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Thriller tartare,"The hunt for Osama bin Laden was an excruciating one, especially by American government agencies. Countless people, both at home and abroad, lost their lives and time fighting and searching for the man, and in a small town in Pakistan, 2011, the search came to a blistering end.Kathryn Bigelow's docudrama ""Zero Dark Thirty"" recreates the tense events leading up to that day. Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal sidesteps the drama and goes straight for the jugular, a controversial decision given the attention by the masses towards the plot material.I am not here to divulge into political issues that may or may not have been brought up in the film. I am merely judging the film in terms of its craftsmanship as a thriller. And to that, I say, Bigelow has crafted a superb thriller; raw in suspense and crackling with tension and paranoia, not unlike ""The Hurt Locker"".This is not an action movie although there are good scenes which suggest it. Bigelow sheds the genre conventions down to basics to show the journey without any delay. The film is, stripped-to-the-bone, a thriller set on a slow burn, opening with brutal torture scenes, followed by investigative/procedural dramatics for the first half. In the second half, Bigelow purposely left the stove running to a boil, culminating in a surprisingly nail-biting climax.Characters come and go as the plot requires it, but Jessica Chastain's character remains the core of this movie, as she determinedly buries herself in her job to capture the most notorious man on Earth. At the end of it all, you might be putting yourself in her shoes: is it all worth it?",7.0,Anonymous,History
A good depiction that builds up nicely,I enjoyed how it started out with not telling us much about whats known about him and instead we slowly gather the info alongside the main character. So it feels kinda satisfying at the end of the movie when they eventually complete the mission.It does a very good job with building up the story and connecting it to the final event which is a really cool home operation.A good depiction of the real events that led to the killing of Usama Bin Laden.,8.0,Anonymous,History
addressing the controversy,"When Kathryn Bigelow's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" got released, it drew controversy for what was seen as an endorsement of torture. It should be noted that the movie does depict torture committed by the CIA. However, the torture takes place years before there are any leads, so it doesn't appear that the torture leads to Osama bin Laden's capture and subsequent execution. As can be expected, the actual mission is the most intense sequence. We can debate whether or not it was a good idea to kill the world's most wanted man as opposed to sending him to the Hague, but what's done is done. Jessica Chastain is particularly intense as the CIA agent whose dogged determination eventually leads to the capture. All in all, I thought that it was a good movie. Better than ""Argo"", although not the year's best movie.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A reasonable portrayal of modern day espionage,"In case you don't know... Zero Dark Thirty is about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden, after the 9/11 attacks on America. Maybe, over the years, we've been spoiled by James Bond into thinking that all spying involves gadgets and car chases. However, in reality, most spying is done from behind desks and listening. And, yes, that's certainly a bit boring in some people's eyes.However, that could be seen - by some - as a failing of the film. It's about two and a half hours long and a lot of it is spent in offices watching people in suits arguing about budgets and how to spend them (hardly what we'd expect from superspies!). So, maybe if you're intending watching this, you should know that it's not 'all action.' Plus there is a fair bit of human torture during the first half, so, if you don't have a strong stomach, you may not want to see how interrogations are taking place.But, it does chronicle the hunt for the world's most wanted man pretty well. Even though (assuming you've watched the news) you probably know then ending, the final showdown is extremely tense and well filmed.Plus there should be a special mention to Jessica Chastain who completely owns every scene that she's in. In fact... her performance is so strong that she effectively eclipses every other actor in this film, leaving everyone who isn't her as little more than an extra! So, if you're interested in the subject matter, then this really is the film to watch on the hunt for Bin Laden - certainly worth a watch (although expect a 'slow burner').http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8.0,Anonymous,History
A typical Awesome American thriller !,"If you are a fan of movies like Argo, Hurt Locker, 13 Hours, Black Hawk Down or Sicario, this movie is definitely not the one to be missed.While one may argue whether or not this movie is close to the truth, this movie surely doesn't disappoint as a film on its own even if the entire narrative is fictionalized. The background score adds power to the seriousness and covertness to the entire operation. The direction by Kathryn Bigelow is simply splendid, just like her previous academy award-winning venture 'Hurt Locker'. Jessica Chastain carries out the role of the CIA operative with the right mix of subtleness and conviction to nail her target, an enemy who has been elusive to the world for more than a decade. The climax operation in the dark was the high point of the entire buildup and the suspense doesn't disappoint even a bit even when one is aware of the eventual end.A highly recommended movie as a patient-watch, with some pieces of good action here and there but brilliant cinematography & direction all throughout the film.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"""War means fighting, and fighting means killing.""","In the years after the 9-11 attacked intense controversy over use of torture arose in the US. So intense that Hollywood made numerous films that passionately condemned the Bush Administration for it's use of torture.""We don't do these things."" ""Torture is not how we fight wars.""No, we fight wars by obliterating entire cities by firebombing. (Firebombing is the deliberately mixing incendiary and high explosive bombs to create a firestorm.).When Hollywood depicts the Second World War there is little ambiguity expressed about the means used to fight and win that war. Means that were and are war crimes. By any measure FDR was a war criminal for firebombing cities just as much as Bush was for authorizing torture.Once we acknowledge the fact that the US *does* fight wars dirty we then understand how it is that the US came to use ineffective and brutal methods as depicted in Zero Dark Thirty. Means that disturb any person with a conscious.The film itself is a clinical(inasmuch as any dramatic presentation can be) depiction of events from the War on Terror that led up to the killing of Osama Bin Laden. It's controversial because it doesn't explicitly condemn torture as other films have done. But it does explicitly depict torture which is for me, more effective in denouncing torture than any moralizing speech by a character.Whenever a war is fought humans lose a bit of their humanity. It cannot be helped as the nature of war is to do things that are anathema to the set of moral principles that gird modern civilizations. Zero Dark Thirty shows is the darkness of the heat of man. It is a necessary and powerful movie that challenges us to think more about war and what it does to the human soul.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Its comparable to United 93 in this way.As such the characters are not really developed at all. Which actually makes more sense for this type of film.Its not about the Seal Team. Its not really about Maya. Its not about the suits in Washington.Its about the process. The film is about the manhunt for Osama Bin Laden, and the events that lead up to his assassination. Pretty straightforward.This film does a good job of not overdramatizing everything (at least, not TOO MUCH) Understandably, some people will be bored.It has flaws, for sure.

Possibly the finest achievement of the decade.,"Three years after Kathryn Bigelow, after a relatively quiet few-decade-long film directing career, really showed what she was capable of with the Iraq war masterpiece The Hurt Locker, she comes with a movie far more ambitious, and also quite a bit more controversial, about the decade long search for Osama Bin Laden starting from 9/11, called Zero Dark Thirty. It absolutely lives up to, if not surpasses, her previous Oscar winning effort.Bigelow's passion for this subject is in just about every shot, with immense detail, cold bluntness, and enough humanity to keep it from being too oppressing. Actually for a two and a half hour film it's quite efficient filmmaking, jam-packed with numerous interrogations and investigation tactics (the torture stuff that has garnered controversy is only a very small part of that) shaking real life terrorist attacks, and political wrangling, yet it's never confused or disjointed. Even towards the end with the recreations of the raid on the compound in Pakistan done very deliberately, the pacing is never betrayed, maintaining consistent movement and direction; it's a scene that plays out as much mystery as suspense as the seal team goes from room to room blowing out locked doors and not knowing for certain if the main target is there.The movie's structure, with one main character, Maya a member of the CIA played brilliantly by Jessica Chastain, taking a part in virtually every aspect of this manhunt, with other people revolving in their various tasks around her, was the perfect choice. If one person really did have this much impact on the manhunt we'll probably never know for sure, but in this film it's played out believably and compellingly, and though no one can match her neither is anyone else insignificant to how it plays out. Characters with only a few scenes have noticeable impacts. But with Maya is the emotion, determination, the sassiness and intelligence of a woman who evolves in nuanced but never uninteresting ways.Zero Dark Thirty is an incredible achievement, and in my mind candidate for best film made so far this decade. It has brought about an important debate, but more significantly it covers ten years of the war on terror in prime fashion. Bigelow plays for high realism but she also knows how to create great drama by stretching but never breaking those confines. Every scene belongs for a purpose and never does it feel like one is missing; that in itself is an incredible achievement. Credit her, the cast, and, not to forget, the great script by Mark Boal.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Boring and lackluster,"Wow, the trailer made this film look so exciting and interesting. The final product however, is neither. The 2 hours leading up to the invasion of Bin Laden's fortress, are silly, and surprisingly un-engaging. Silly characters, having silly conversations about unrelated topics, most of them women for some reason. Jessica Chastain, who is grossly miscast here, is hunting Bin Laden with a passion, for no apparent reason however. She behaves as if she has been personally gang raped by AL Queada, the way she obssesses over his capture. The final scenes, which should have been intense and thrilling, came across as a bad ""Rambo"" film, one where we care little about the end result. The way that the US troops busted into that compound and just began shooting everyone in sight, was disgraceful, and does nothing to change the negative opinion that much of the World has of America. I doubt that this film would have gotten much attention at all, if director Kathryn Bigelow hadn't won her Oscar, and if the subject matter was not so volatile. I'm quite surprised that a subject so fascinating was turned into such a boring film. This is one to skip in the theater.

Catch him when you can,"Zero Dark Thirty follows the story of the team of people trying to track down Osama Bin Laden after the September 11 attacks.

The film to me felt as if it asked the questions of what is right and wrong without putting its self as an anti-war film or 24 like where you should be able to do anything if it will protect your country no matter the moral consequences. At the heart of this film is an outstanding performance from Jessica Chastain who has been deservedly getting award admiration for her role but I found Jason Clarkes performance to be the standout subtly showing the toils his actions are having on him.

"Boal and Bigelow do it again, now adding Chastain in their brilliance!","Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow and Oscar-winning screenwriter Mark Boal take their newest effort, Zero Dark Thirty, to places I couldn't have imagined.

Zero Dark Thirty hooks you from minute one and just DOESN'T. LET. GO. It's one of the best pictures of the year!Starring Jessica Chastain as the beautiful and insightful Maya, she smoothly yet fiercely pulls you through the film delivering her best performance of her career so far. The film begins and ends with her and in the final scene, the Oscar mouths will be drooling. Chastain inhabits and constructs a character from scratch, inserting ticks and beats that only sweetens the execution. It's one of the year's best performances. Point blank.Accompanying her is the talented Jason Clarke, who's scene-stealing and at times comedic turn level out a very emotionally and demanding film. Kyle Chandler and Mark Strong make strong impressions in their minimal screen time and give even more evidence that Zero Dark Thirty is one of the best cast ensembles this year.The true star of the film is Mark Boal whose research, detail, and magnetic dialogue stands as the writer's finest work. The film creates such inner, moral dilemma and this is coming from someone who saw the World Trade Center fall at the tender age of 17. I witnessed evil that day and even with that, the film makes me ashamed to be an American. Revenge can run deep but what we witness in the film, is not revenge. You can't fight fire with fire. It's a dilemma Boal puts forth and one that will follow the viewer long after the film's end. It's pulse- pounding filmmaking and first-rate writing that should be studied for years to come. Bigelow's signature style doesn't come into full effect until the final thirty minutes but it will blow your socks off. The raid on the compound showcases heavenly camera work from Greig Fraser and commanding and sharp editing from Dylan Tichenor and William Goldenberg, two near sure-fire nominees for the Academy Awards. A well- placed Alexandre Desplat score only adds to the marvel of those final moments.Zero Dark Thirty is the best political thriller this decade. Mark my words.

But to claim that this is cinematography, please believe me I registered specifically to write this review and inform how silly, dull and senseless this motion picture is (I'm not calling it a movie).Sometimes you look around you and you say, OK, I can keep my opinion to myself, it is a subjective matter. Not in this case. There is no political correctness in the world to give justice to anything in this piece of work. Is it really complete? Has it been reviewed? Did someone other than the person who has to have something out there by a given date or their job is on the line agree to it?It's like the sort of rubbish one comes up with at first shot, but people then polish and review it, hire professionals and keep working on it until it becomes decent enough to put out there for the public without collecting all the rotten tomatoes harvests from now till Kingdom Come.

Splendid Film,"Kathryn Bigelow is a brilliant director whose first work I enjoyed was Keanu Reeves film Point Break.Zero Dark Thirty is a great movie and involves the Audience at many levels.Jessica Chastain-- whom I had never seen in a film-- reminds me of a young Susan Hayward viz sexy, alluring, feminine, tough and a brilliant actress. Jessica Chastain's nomination for an Oscar is well deserved. With proper career guidance Chastain could be a leading Lady star for years.As an Army Veteran myself I am very sensitive to the way the Armed Forces are portrayed in films and I applaud Ms. Bigelow for her direction of this film and the respect shown our valiant troops.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Wintess The Greatest Manhunt In History.,"Ever since I first saw the trailer for Zero Dark Thirty I knew that I would want to see it and with all the Oscar buzz I made time to watch this film and it certainly didn't disappoint.The main thing I loved about this film was the intensity that it built up especially toward the end and the fact that you feel every bit of emotion Maya, played brilliantly by Jessica Chastain and the rest of her team are feeling. While the entire movie is centered around Maya, the supporting cast does very well with their time on screen as well. The reason Jessica Chastain's performance as Maya is being praised is because of her sheer determination and confidence but yet subtlety to find and kill Al Qaeda terrorist - Osama Bin Laden, every ounce of frustration, hope, disappointment is showcased brilliantly.The film's director, Oscar winner, Kathryn Bigelow has done as exceptional job with this film. The criticizing of the torture scenes is not necessary as they give a greater sense of reality to the film as it not a typical glamorous and polished Hollywood film. I would say this is more of a time line/sequenced film as it takes you through the efforts of the people who have been hunting Bin Laden however that doesn't mean there is no plot.The last hour of the film is by far the most suspenseful and I was highly impressed with the raw feel of this entire film.Is this film Oscar worthy? Yes! I would highly recommend this movie, make some time and go witness ""The Greatest Manhunt of History.""",8.0,Anonymous,History
Absolutely brilliant,"Films like this can be a tricky thing to nail; portray events in too gung-ho a manner, you run the risk of being accused of over-patriotism, conversely, if you depict things in an opposing light, you could be criticised of condemnation. 'Zero Dark Thirty' is a film which walks a narrow tightrope, but manages to do so with expertise so well-handled that it appears effortless. Similarly the film never feels like a documentary, an impressive feat considering that it could easily become a wearying succession of facts. One of the best things about it is that personalises the hunt for bin Laden by focusing on the central character of Maya, played by Jessica Chastain and makes her pursuit to find him an intense and gripping obsession.We first meet Maya in 2003, in a 'black site' as she watches fellow CIA officer Dan (Jason Clarke) interrogate a detainee over suspicion that he has links to Saudi terrorists. As he subjects the prisoner to waterboarding and tortuous humiliation, we see Maya flinch in the corner at the very sight of it, but by the time the credits roll she is a completely different character. 'History's greatest manhunt for the world's most dangerous man' as the poster put, changes her deeply, as she goes from being a young woman uncertain how to act in the situation she's landed in to being a strong-willed officer passionately and unhealthily driven by her desire to find this man. Significantly, she is not your conventional movie heroine; there is no speech concerned with fighting for your country and little backstory to suggest she has a personal connection to 9/11 or the terrorist attacks, a la the death of a loved one, all we get is ""a lot of my friends have died for this; I believe I was spared to finish the job."" The cloaked-in-secrecy stance with which director Kathryn Bigelow and writer/producer Mark Boal approach the film's characters works in its favour, helping to firmly ground them in reality.The first act or so of 'Zero Dark Thirty' is rather murky and unclear; people talk about other people who may or may not have information concerning the matters at hand. Yet, this was probably a conscious decision because as the story develops, it becomes increasingly clearer and more focused as it hurtles towards a quite literally breathtaking finale. Bigelow is a filmmaker who has become renowned (and also dismissed by some female critics) for her skillful handle of action scenes and the eventual raid that unfolds in the film's final act is nothing short of incredible. It is a taut and properly white knuckle sequence that combines third-person combat with the first-person view from the infrared night vision; but don't think that it plays out like a video game, instead it feels brilliantly cinematic. However, the best thing about this climax (and possibly the entire film) is that you are always captivated, as one reviewer so rightly said: ""The sign of a good movie is one that keeps you gripped even when you already know the outcome.""This is aided by a consistently strong cast. Jessica Chastain who has had major roles in twelve films in the past two years, has delivered what I feel is her strongest performance yet. It is a superb piece of acting that is exemplified by her character's fascinating arc from idealism to cold emptiness. Chastain is notably supported by an impressive Jason Clarke, an actor with a great screen presence and a natural Jennifer Ehle as a fellow officer and friend of Maya's; while Mark Strong leaves a firm impact upon the viewer during his first scene where erupts in a CIA meeting.'Zero Dark Thirty' is not a warm film and this may prove problematic for some; it is cold and none of its characters could said to be likable, but despite the fact that you don't exactly for root for Maya, you are still engrossed in her journey. There are moments of character, but effectively reflecting its central figure, this is a film primarily concerned with one objective. The good guys aren't really 'good' in the truest sense; they're morally ambiguous people engaged in complicated and ultimately dirty work. And as for all the ongoing controversy surrounding, amongst other aspects, the torture scenes, I believe that the film takes neither a pro- nor an anti-torture stance, instead questioning the effectiveness of such an action.This film blew me away. I wasn't the biggest fan of 'The Hurt Locker', finding it to be quite good, but no masterwork. The same cannot be said for Bigelow's latest, as this an expertly orchestrated and incredibly tense piece of work that requires one hundred percent of your attention one hundred of the time and rewards you for doing so. Kathryn Bigelow, snubbed by the Academy this year, is one of the most talented directors around today and with 'Zero Dark Thirty' she has delivered an astounding, exceptional piece of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The best film of 2012 so far...,"A sign of a good film is if it can put you on the edge of your seat, nervously awaiting what happens next. A sign of a great film is when it can do all of those things even though you know the outcome. Unless you've been living in a cave (or a small country mansion in Pakistan) you're probably aware that Osama Bin Laden, the effective 'poster boy' of international terrorism and the al-Qaeda, was found and killed by a group of US Navy SEALs almost two years ago. Zero Dark Thirty documents the hunt over a 10 year period, beginning with a sound collage of phone calls during the 9/11 terrorist attack. This opening pretty much sets you up for the kind of film this is; dark, menacing and uncomfortable.I was a little skeptical going into this film, fairly certain that it would patriotically wave the flag for the USA and shove down our throats how 'great' they are as a nation. However, it's surprising how unpatriotic the movie is. Maya, portrayed astoundingly by Jessica Chastain, is almost a CIA-prodigy who becomes obsessive about the capture of OBL. She starts out as a fresh-faced new recruit in the US Embassy in Pakistan, initially overwhelmed by the brutality of torture, and gradually morphs into a reclusive and obsessive key-player in the manhunt. Chastain is incredible, being both cold and unlikeable while at the same time being human enough for the audience to still invest in her character. It is a remarkable performance matched by the stellar supporting cast. However, this is very much Maya's show, sometimes feeling more like a study of a workaholic than a docu-drama.Conversely, when the big guns come out, they certainly come out. For the majority of its two and a half hour running time, most of the action comes from the offices and workspaces of the US Embassy or the CIA, that is not to say that there aren't isolated scenes of explosive action, but they are certainly secondary to the drama. However, this being a picture about a manhunt, the final 30-40 minutes is some of the most gripping and exciting cinema that I've seen in a while. Again, it's a credit to the filmmakers for taking a story we know well and making it into something that still takes us by surprise.Perhaps the biggest snub of the Academy Awards this year was the lack of a nomination for Kathryn Bigelow, which probably has something to do with the difficult politics and subsequent controversy surrounding the picture. Her nomination would have been one of the most deserving, as the film's power and effect is almost single-handedly down to her direction.In turns thoughtful, exciting and shocking, Zero Dark Thirty is the best film I've seen so far this year.

"Methodical, uncomfortable, but never boring","If you were thinking that two years is a bit soon to be making a film about the assassination of Osama Bin Laden, I have news for you: the film has actually been in production since 2009, two years before Bin Laden was killed.Mark Boal won many accolades for the accuracy he brought to the screenplay of The Hurt Locker, and after he and director Kathryn Bigelow scored big wins at the 2009 Oscars they planned to work together on a follow up. At that time, Boal, through his military contacts, was following a Navy SEAL team's operations. As luck would have it that SEAL team ended up being involved on the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden. Within two days of the assassination, Bigelow announced they were re-working Boal's Black Ops script into the film that is now Zero Dark Thirty.So, how does a ""based on true events"" story turn out when the events and the film production ran parallel? Actually, quite well. The film, which is up for 5 Oscars including Best Picture, is a string of events filmed in the still-popular hand-held fashion that the Jason Bourne series used to excess. It is one third torture and interrogation, one third spy bureaucracy, and one third Call of Duty.Central to the CIA investigation is Maya (Jessica Chastain) and her evolution from naive young agent to heavily-disguised operative. If this film wins anything at the February 24 ceremony it will be for Chastain's performance. She has given several great performances in ensembles over the last few years with The Help being a standout, but in Zero Dark Thirty she stands above a cast that includes a dozen recognizable faces including James Gandolfini. As the investigation drags on, her patience thins, and Chastain turns into the female equivalent of Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood. To put it simply, she is the strongest female lead Hollywood has put out in a long time.As the story progresses through the many terrorist attacks that have occurred in the past decade the tension continues to mount, and Bigelow succeeds in the same way Ben Affleck did in Argo, or Ron Howard did in Apollo 13. Even though everyone knows how the story ends, tension and suspense build out of the relationship that is built between the audience and the characters. It is a terrific feat of visual storytelling and performance that makes this a highly recommended film. And it's ""history"" is a perfect topic for post-viewing debate.http://charlieposts.blogspot.ca/2013/01/zero-dark-thirty.html",8.0,Anonymous,History
Wonderful film depicting the perseverance and dedication of the 'sisterhood' of CIA.,"Kudos to Kathryn Bigelow and the entire crew of ZDT for making such a sticky and sensitive film. Though I happen to watch the movie only recently. And I watched it several times because it gave so many visual depiction of incidents which we have only heard so far.Sticky, because it has depicted a fragment of different operations conducted by US intelligentsia (read CIA) for over a decade. Sensitive, because, as the so called closest ally of US to fight against terrorism, Pakistan have double-crossed all along.Cinematically, I found the movie lived up to the expectation. I have read several adverse and annoyed comments against the film. I was amused to read those.Few of the reasons for their comments are; 1. those who diabolically hate US, 2. those who belong to the same 'Ummah' of OBL, 3. those who do not know anything about the religion of this sect, 4, and lastly, those who do not know how the act of terrorism came in to being since early 7th century AD. And still people wonder, why Maya weeped in the end!",9.0,Anonymous,History
A must watch,"Here's Bigelow's best work here, though I haven't seen The Hurt Locker. She's outdone herself, and she should be proud, of this fine achievement. I love Bigelow's films, yes even Near Dark and the cop thriller surprise, Blue Steel, though admittedly Point Break's my favourite, closely followed by Strange Days. What we have here, is an interestingly told story, that chronicles the crucially important bits of information that finally led to the capture of the most wanted man in the world. We recount a couple of dates of other tragic events in the space of that near ten years, including the London Bombings in July of 2005, plus a couple of other bombings, one I never saw coming, that took the life of a woman CIA operative, funnily enough, the day after David Hick's release. I must say Chastain's performance bloody impressed the hell out of me. She stole the show, yet I liked Jason Clarke, a master of the American accent (hard to believe he's a true blue Aussie) as an anti terrorist extractor, who in the first powerful twenty minutes or so, beats an Alkida figure, using a couple of torture tactics on him, while Chastain uncomfortably watches him. When alone when the prisoner, she gives him a simple piece of advice. I would of like to see more of Clarke in this film, as he comes in and out a few times later. The middle east is a truly scary place, and to have this wary environment, a truly uncomfortable atmosphere for and an over two a half hour drama, I'll take off my hat to Bigelow for being brave. Even the setting of the Marriott restaurant, just before it's rubble, or that car shop in Kuwait- they actually have a city, makes you uneasy. And this is a bravely made made. Then comes that date May, 1, 2011. The whole exercise, where they suited up, boarded the helicopter, and assailed that fortress, scouring the place before finally hitting that particular room, and exterminating the number one enemy, was unrushed and told in meticulous detail. A ten out of ten job. A truly hairy part of the film. When they hit Bin Laden, I must of missed something, cause then it was all over, the deceased taken back in a body bag for absolute confirmation, unless it was the shot of a guy who looked younger though. I just missed something. Just don't miss this.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Thought-provoking; predictable reaction from critics,"Just saw the DVD again tonight after a year. Remarkably well-made and from what I've read, surprisingly close to the truth, unlike anything made by, say, Oliver Stone.The critics seem to be of two camps. One just thinks the USA is evil and therefore dumps on this successful campaign.The others seem to think the characters ""need more development,"" as though this would have been better had they left out some of the dust and added a romantic liaison and a bit of skin.In other words, many critics wanted a Hollywood movie with Hollywood sensibilities and Hollywood politics. I am profoundly glad this movie escaped that treatment. If you want a Hollywood movie that got the official White House imprimatur, there's another movie for that. Lots of inaccuracies in that one, but, hey, Hollywood.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A bit long but very well done,"Maintain suspense when everyone knows what happened. That was Bigelow's job. She did this, I think, by concentrating on the intelligence chase that led to the location of Bin Laden. The actual shooting of Bin Laden (not a spoiler unless you've been living in a cave) was almost anticlimactic. Thank you, Bigelow, for not doing it in multiple angles in slow motion. Gimmicks would have detracted from the film. The real suspense was also in the chase, and more than a few people died in gathering the intelligence. The torture scenes are brutal. There is little gore but plenty of violence. Bigelow does a good job of making the raid suspenseful despite us knowing the ending. The middle of the film seemed to drag a bit though the beginning and end moved along nicely. The movie crew built stealth helicopters from scratch based on conjecture. They looked very plausible. The DVD has an extra feature called ""Geared Up"" that is quite interesting.The cast was top notch. Chastain took on her role completely. She becomes a portrait of obsession, singularly dedicated to getting Bin Laden. Jason Clarke is also a stand-out as Chastain's fellow spook. Joel Edgerton (""The Thing"" prequel--yay) leads the Seal Team that ended the long quest for payback.",8.0,Anonymous,History
It's a film and a very good one. Get over it.,"If you're like me I read the reviews and can clearly see this film has polarised opinions like no other. Is it a 10? No, ridiculous. Is it a 0 or a 1? No, even more ridiculous. This is not one of the best films ever made but the scenes and meandering story are enough to keep you engrossed for most of the film. The ending was the worst thing about it (Jessica chastain fine actress crying convincingly) as I expected at least 5-10 minutes of what happened to the various individuals and scenes after the raid depicting the after-effects of Osama Bin Laden's death.People seem to have taken this very seriously or personally. It's not propaganda, it's an action/drama film! Get over it...torture porn...there are far more horror films out there that are torture porn (Saw, Hostel etc...)!This at its purest is a very good film about a hunt for a sadistic killer and terrorist and the admittedly terrible fall out that such a hunt brings. The 0/1 reviews are insulting - grow up - this film is not about politics and it's certainly not a piece of propaganda.

Thorough and intelligent,"The title Zero Dark Thirty, referring in military-speak to the 12:30 am time in which American forces broke into a compound in Abbottabad and killed Osama bin Laden, is suitably apt for a film that puts procedural above all else. It's the lack of emotion and absence of any real identifiable character development that makes Kathryn Bigelow's thriller all the more absorbing, rushing from shouty suits in offices to dusty interrogation rooms, refusing to skip any details that led to the death of America's greatest ever enemy. Unless you've been locked in a basement for the past two or so years, you will be well aware of what happens at the climax, but it's what led to the news story that is so interesting, given that the events have been relatively hidden or unknown to the public.Young, green CIA officer Maya (Jessica Chastain) arrives in Pakistan, assigned to work with fellow officer Dan (Jason Clarke), who is in the middle of an interrogation with Ammar al-Baluchi, a suspect in the 9/11 attacks. After days (possibly weeks) of waterboarding and humiliation, al-Baluchi gives up the name of Abu Ahmed, who he identifies as bin Laden's personal courier. When Dan is reassigned and with the practise of torture becoming political taboo, Maya finds herself working on hunches and scraps trying to track down the mysterious Abu Ahmed, who many claim to be dead. But after a fellow analyst finds new information, Maya is led to a large compound in Pakistan, and prepares for a Navy SEAL-led infiltration.For such a cold film, there is always the danger of losing the audience in the sheer frankness of it all. The saving grace is undoubtedly Chastain, Oscar-nominated for her steely portrayal of a woman whose obsession borders on dangerous. She shows relatively little emotion, even when exposed to Dan's brutal torture routines, and the film rarely shows her out of her work-place. There is no man in her life, thankfully, and will gladly step over someone if she thought it would bring her closer to her target. But, like Jeremy Renner's William James in The Hurt Locker (2009), she is the perfect tool for the job. Not necessarily likable, but fit for her purpose. She is a modern action hero, using words and persistence over machine guns and body paint.Like the work of Paul Greengrass, Bigelow manages to make an action thriller routed in reality, making as much out of a phone call as a gun fight. And it's the interactions of the hierarchy and the political manoeuvring that keep the film moving, highlighting the possible repercussions, politically, socially and ethically, of every minute decision. But when the real action does come, it doesn't disappoint, as a team of grunts (amongst them Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt) storm bin Laden's compound in almost permanent night-vision mode. It's captured in all it's confusion, as unsuspecting heads pop out of doors and bullets are fired at unseen targets. The film could have been a sickening exercise in puffy-chested patriotism, but in Bigelow's - and screenwriter Mark Boal's - hands, it is thorough and intelligent, harking back to the 1970's when topical film-making was still important.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,History

Unbearable. Slow. Waste of Time.,"As soon as news got out that they're making a film based around the hunt for the person of interest for 911, I took interest in this film to learn more about the underlying events. What a disappointment.The movie was extremely slow and uninteresting. Don't get me wrong - I didn't come into this expecting full blown action film but at least an interesting plot.First, I couldn't understand what the characters are saying the majority of the times because they mumble and use specialty words on top of unfamiliar foreign names which subtitles would've been greatly helpful. Second, there was a lack of character development that we simply cannot relate or even sympathize with. Honestly, I find the main focused character, Maya, to be highly unlikable and annoying. Yes she has determination and this is what she's worked on her entire life; but she lacks emotions and when she does show emotions, she borderlines psychopathic b*tch.Many people commented on the torture scenes but that didn't bother me - what bothered me was how this film WAS torture.The entire direction and story line of the movie was so dull that I was baffled at the 95 it had scored on Metacritic. And on top of that, Oscar nomination? Really?I wish they would have just made an actual documentary based around real people who were involved in it instead.

The Cost of Freedom,""" The bin Laden operation was a landmark achievement by our country, by our military, by our Intelligence Community, and by our Agency, "" - Acting Director of the CIA, Michael MorellFilms that claim to be based on a true story have a tendency to be hyperbolic and are usually far from the truth they claim to purport. Zero Dark Thirty has gained that infamous reputation in some circles. After rave reviews from critics and winning its share of awards, there has suddenly been a backlash of sorts against this film since its wider release throughout the country this month. Some governmental officials and lawmakers are demanding an inquiry into the facts leading to this docudrama about the subsequent manhunt for Osama bin Ladin. Kathryn Bigalow's controversial film has certainly struck a nerve with this emotional topic and America's methods to eradicate its number one enemy. In trying to connect the facts of this historic mission, Bigalow has also created a cinematic masterpiece, a thought-provoking and thrilling insider's look into the exhausting investigation that brought about this terrorist's death and, with it, some initial closure to the 9/11 tragedy. Revenge is said to be sweet, but this film shows the bitter aftertaste of freedom as well. And as for victory, at what cost?After 10 years from the collapse of the World Trade Center and the senseless loss of human lives, questions still need to be asked: Are we too close to this political mass murder to create an objective analysis of this event? Do we, as a country, fear the truth about our actions and those of our enemies? Can this or any film be therapeutic to our national healing, or is it all too soon? If not, then when? Zero Dark Thirty dares to explore these inquiries and shed some light on the actual mission.The title Zero Dark Thirty means an unspecific time between midnight and dawn, which were the estimated military time of the raid on bin Laden's secret headquarters. The film begins with a black screen. The sounds of that fateful Tuesday in September over a decade ago are heard. The pain, the chaos, and the cries of those innocent victims resonates. Without any visual support, the frightening images are fully realized, scarred in our memory. It is a devastating beginning that will lead to the film's devastating end. ( Kudos to Paul N.J. Ottosson's for his remarkable sound editing work. )The film uses fictitious characters to tell its tale, but is remarkable in its honest and detailed approach to its subject. The CIA agents are shown to be dedicated workers trying to piece together any clue to bin Laden's whereabouts, particularly one female agent named Maya ( the talented Jessica Chastain in another excellent performance ). Her obsession and tenaciousness bring her closer to solving this mystery. But it is this woman working in a man's world that helps to make the film even more complex and riveting, as she tries to excise anything in the way of her pursuit.It is apparent that Zero Dark Thirty was heavily researched and Mark Boal's compelling screenplay is a remarkable piece of concise writing mixed with factual data. The time-line of events compresses years of investigative fact-finding by the CIA with other al-Qaeda terrorist attacks globally. While initially the film takes its time to build and connect these story lines, causing the film to seem slow-moving, Boal then shrewdly focuses more on the historic events and less on the individual characters, except for our heroine who serves as the emotional center. This gives a more natural and realistic undercurrent, a gritty and raw sense of foreboding.Bigalow's direction is flawless. The film is concise and gripping throughout. The action sequences build tension so well and lay the groundwork for the film's memorable Navy Seals' climactic invasion, done in all of its green night vision glory. ( The editing by Dylan Tichenor and William Goldenberg and the photography by Greig Fraser in this set piece are exceptional. )But perhaps the most controversial element of the film is in the beginning section of the film ( the Bush years ) when Bigalow doesn't shy away from the darker side of the investigation. Her ability to include the torture and the humiliation of prisoners as just one means to gain information for bin Laden's capture is on full display ( and probably was much worse than depicted on the screen ). It was an undeniable part of the logistics that led to bin Laden's demise. Still, these sessions are relentless and make for uncomfortable but necessary viewing for all serious moviegoers. ( And it is in these horrific scenes that our government leaders doth protest too much. Like it or not, violent interrogation methods played a pivotal role to the success of this mission, contrary to American government claims that the U.S. does not sanctioned such immoral tactics as water-boarding. ) Yes, war is hell and you are caught in all of its ugliness and horror. That is what makes Zero Dark Thirty such an important and courageous example of superior filmmaking.Zero Dark Thirty recounts the hunt for an extremist, but it also probes the ethics of war and all of the innocent and guilty casualties it leaves in its wake. From its opening sounds of horror to its concluding blood-soaked images, this important film comes full circle. This is a film not to be missed.

Casey's Movie Mania: ZERO DARK THIRTY (2012),"Back in 2009, director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal made a low-budget Iraqi War thriller about military bomb squad called THE HURT LOCKER -- a little movie that nobody would have thought that it subsequently gained a lot of critics' attention and eventually surprised its way to the Oscar to win the Best Picture and Best Director awards. No doubt the movie was technically well-made, with a breakout performance by then-unknown Jeremy Renner. But personally, I thought the overall movie was overrated and didn't exactly deserved all the big awards recognition. Three years later, Bigelow and Boal returns for another military-themed drama, and this time they worked with a bigger canvas called ZERO DARK THIRTY -- an intense procedural drama about the decade-long manhunt of Osama bin Laden, the notorious al-Qaeda leader responsible for the 9/11 attack. This is a meticulously-detailed motion picture unlike anything Bigelow has done before -- meaning her signature trademark of slow-motion montage is nowhere to be seen. It's a radical departure from her usual filmmaking style, which might alienated her die-hard fans but rest assured that ZERO DARK THIRTY is a mesmerizing and near-perfect cinematic experience ever made for a movie that is heavy on dialogue and light on action.Before a single image is shown, the movie opens with a brief, yet chilling prologue where actual voice recordings are heard from 9/11 victims seeking help while stranded in the World Trade Center. Then the movie jumps two years later at an undisclosed Black Site and we are introduced to a young CIA analyst Maya (Jessica Chastain) who is experiencing her first military interrogation between no-nonsense partner Dan (Jason Clarke) and an al-Qaeda member (Reda Kateb). Throughout the interrogation process, Dan threatened, humiliated and waterboarded the al-Qaeda member in hope to obtain vital information. It took Dan and his fellow officers several times to torture him in various ways possible until he finally gives in and mention out a name -- Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. As it turns out, the name of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti is a so-called courier working for Osama bin Laden. Using him as the next jumping point to further out for the investigation, Maya and her team goes all out to locate his whereabouts on a decade-long wild goose chase filled with false leads, near-death experience, dangerous setbacks and eventually -- an unexpected breakthrough where bin Laden's secret compound is found and then raided on May 2, 2011.At the time of this writing, ZERO DARK THIRTY had recently won Jessica Chastain the Best Actress Golden Globe award and secured 5 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Screenplay (until now, I still couldn't get over the fact that Bigelow herself got snubbed for Best Director nomination). The movie is also not without its fair share of controversy -- acting CIA director Michael Morell has issued a statement that the movie ""is a dramatization and is not historically accurate"" and clarified that the torture method used in the movie is said to be false.Whether the movie is historically accurate or not, one couldn't deny the fact that ZERO DARK THIRTY remains a compelling piece of work. Bigelow's direction is particularly masterful, while Boal's well-calculated screenplay is top-notch that the movie's 157-minute running time feels like a breeze. That kind of achievements are worth noting for, considering Bigelow is mostly known for her visual rather than narrative style. And yet, she manages to defy all odds to accomplish something different so well from her usual norm.The acting ensemble are first-rate, but it was Jessica Chastain who truly steals the show. As the relentless CIA analyst Maya who refuses to quit in order to track down bin Laden's hideout, she certainly gives a ferociously enthusiastic performance here. This is her finest role so far. Supporting roles, including Jason Clarke and especially Jennifer Ehle who plays Maya's colleague, Jessica -- are all equally captivating as well.No doubt Bigelow and her team has succeeded on keeping the viewers glued to their seats with one engaging scenario after another, while clever enough not to leave any excess baggage for subplots or unnecessary characters acted as fillers.And then comes the crucial third-act in the final raid scene. Technically speaking, the re-construction of the raid on bin Laden's compound is meticulously researched while Bigelow's choice of hand-held camera, naturalistic lighting and impeccable sound design truly evokes ""you-are-there""-kind of cinematic realism. However, the supposedly exciting raid scene turns out to be strangely anticlimactic. Perhaps it's that slight misguided direction by Bigelow who made the scene rather too clinical for its own good.The final scene is what preventing the movie from achieving a five-star rating. Minor flaw aside, ZERO DARK THIRTY is one of the best movies ever made in 2012.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Documentary flavour - deserves to win awards,"Considering we already know how this story will end, it's amazing how suspenseful Kathryn Bigelow makes it. The assault by US Navy SEALs on the bin Laden compound in the final half-hour is nerve-shredding. This scene - indeed, most of the movie - is shot like a documentary; you feel as if you are eavesdropping on the CIA in 'real time'. None of the characters is given a back story: we are only interested in their role in the war against al-Qaeda.Apart from some off-duty drinking with her colleagues we only ever see Maya sitting in uncomfortably on interrogations or doggedly sifting through photos and intelligence snippets. But Jessica Chastain is as every bit as mesmerising as Claire Danes in HOMELAND without any of Carrie Matthison's emotional and psychiatric baggage. Chastain - and Bigelow - definitely deserve the awards they've been nominated for.A few familiar faces from both sides of the Atlantic turn up in supporting roles. Jennifer Ehle is excellent as one of Maya's colleagues. James Gandolfini (looking like J. Edgar Hoover) plays the CIA Director with a PA played by Britain's TV favourite John Barrowman.2013 has got off to a strong start, cinematically speaking. ZERO DARK THIRTY is the pick of the bunch so far.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"very over-hyped, doesn't deserve the accolades","other reviews i have read have stated that argo was better. it is.the acting, particularly that of the lead, in this steaming pile that has been nominated for so many awards is terrible at best.i tried to pay attention to the details while watching this, taking into account all of the press coverage that the film received - you know, all that crap about torture and blah blah blah. i really didn't find anything about this film to be ""great"". not the acting, not the writing, not the cinematography, not the cast, not the soundtrack. nothing.it's pretty obvious that typical Hollywood types want to latch onto this and shower it with praise, when there are better films that deserve the attention.frankly speaking, i've taken dumps that were more enjoyable.i can only hope that this ends up on DVD sooner than later, so as none of you have to suffer the 14$ admittance fee to lose the 2.5 hours of your life this movie just cost me.save your time and your $, and wait until you can get it at a red box or something.indeed, argo was much better.",5.0,Anonymous,History
A brilliant documentary style narrative,"I'm mystified by the criticisms of this movie. It's not a movie about ""relationships"" and hence not subject to a lot of character development. Nor is it a fictional action movie, where every plot twist has to be exciting and dramatic. It is a documentary style narrative - with some poetic license - outlining the main events which led to locating and killing Bin Laden.I found the movie both realistic and compelling. Though I suspect the main character, Maya, played flawlessly by Jessica Chastain, is a composite of a number of characters, revolving the main plot sequences around her brings a sense of unity to the movie as well as putting a human face on it. And there is in fact subtle character development, mostly in Maya's developing relationships with her CIA chief, and with her cohorts, Dan and Jessica. Without giving the plot away, the story line involving Jessica has a particular and lasting impact on Maya.The raid scene is so realistic, I still don't know how they did it. Obviously, there are actual shots from the air of the compound mixed in with an incredibly authentic set. The raid takes longer than one would think, with the time line shorter, increasing the sense of dramatic urgency.This is the type of movie where, at the end, you feel like kissing both Maya and the American soil, while chanting U.S.A.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Impressive re-creation of recent history,"""Zero Dark Thirty"" chronicles one of the greatest successful manhunts of all time - the one that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan on May 1, 2011. With a screenplay by Mark Boal and direction by Kathryn Bigelow, the movie provides a methodical, step-by-step re- enactment of the decade-long hunt as seen through the eyes of Maya Lambert, a fictional CIA analyst who is actually a composite of several female analysts who played key roles in locating the ever-elusive al Qaeda leader.Much has been made of the fact that the movie seemingly endorses the view that the use of torture led to the discovery of bin Laden's whereabouts. This assertion caused such a controversy at the time of the movie's release that many felt it ultimately hurt its chances of walking home with the Best Picture Oscar that year. In all fairness to the movie makers, however, the film actually doesn't seem to be making that case, since the scenes early on depicting torture all lead to eventual dead ends, while the piece of information that initially sets the investigators onto the right path clearly comes much later, after torture is no longer being used as a tactic. Yet, had the filmmakers NOT shown torture being used in the early stretches of the film - which take place not too long after 9/11 - they would not have been truthful to the times in which the story is set.But it is as a drama that we must ultimately judge ""Zero Dark Thirty"" - and, in that respect, the news is mainly positive. The movie stays intensely focused on the matter at hand, not allowing itself to get distracted by side forays into too many irrelevant factors or overly- detailed character back stories. Yet, while this is generally a virtue, it does result in a certain weakness as well, mainly, a lack of depth in the characters, particularly the main one. One need only compare ""Zero Dark Thirty"" to something like Showtime's ""Homeland"" to see the advantages the long-form format has over the short-form when dealing with subjects as complex as this one. And one need only compare ZDT's Maya with ""Homeland""s Carrie (Claire Danes) to see how much more fully developed the latter is as a character. Maya is allowed to register fear, anger, frustration, determination, disappointment, etc., but we never feel that we really get to know her as a person. For one thing, we never see her in a single relationship with anyone other than her colleagues (or even hear of one mentioned, come to think of it), even though the movie spans nearly a decade.That being said, the movie does convey, through Jessica Chastain's riveting performance, the very real toll exacted on individuals who dedicate their lives to a dogged pursuit of terrorists and who feel heavily the burden of heading off any attacks in the future. Perhaps the lack of any reference to Maya's personal life is an implicit acknowledgment of that fact. Regardless, Chastain provides so luminous a beacon for us to follow along the journey that we can't help but connect with the pursuit on a deeply human level.Chastain gets strong support from Jason Clark, Kyle Chandler, Jennifer Ehle, James Gandolfini and Chris Pratt (""Everwood,"" ""Parks and Recreation"") in the atypical role (for him) of a heroic Navy Seal.In fact, the movie's meticulous re-enactment of the Navy Seals' successful raid on the Abbottabad compound is alone worth the price of admission. It really does make us feel as if we were a part of history.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Kathryn Bigelow Adapts Modern History's Greatest Manhunt Into A Crackerjack Thriller!,"Never before has the war-on-terror been shot with such a cold dose of reality. As entertainment, Kathryn Bigelow's engrossing and symbolically astute Zero Dark Thirty is a great accomplishment - a somber, black-winged benediction for what we might count as a lost decade. It depicts the long-lasting struggle of terrorism with immense veracity - the greatest manhunt in modern history playing catalyst to a gripping tale of obsession both dark and dangerous.With Zero Dark Thirty, director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal present a different kind of espionage environment - one that follows a fictionalized CIA operative Maya (Jessica Chastain) recruited specifically to ferret out the architect of the 9/11 attacks – Osama Bin Laden. It's one filled with paper work, meetings, and sifting through a never ending stream of intelligence. But it's also one where the stakes are always high, danger is found at every turn, where a hunch can lead to a breakthrough and misinformation can lead to wasted years of chasing ghosts. Through Maya we share the successes and frustrations of tracking down the head of a snake so twisted and slippery it's of no wonder that it took over a decade to get a strangle hold on him. Yet Maya represents more than the CIA, she is America herself: wounded, driven and in conflict on how to move on after killing the bogeyman that haunted their nightmares for too long.Kathryn Bigelow takes the procedural model and brushes away every unnecessary detail - rarely glorifying and never dumbing down or 'Hollywoodizing' important tidbits of the plot to get a rise out of the audience – leaving behind a potent film that never feels bogged down by its own complexity. Even though the outcome is common public knowledge, we are enthralled by the way the story is spooled out. Even at a runtime of three hours, Bigelow displays an uncanny sense of pacing and rhythm, tightly cutting back and forth between Maya's exhausting hunt for bin Laden and her constant inner-struggle to never give up, even when faced with a complete dead end that promises her nothing. All this leads up to the film's most audacious set-piece, an almost unbearably tense, moment by-moment re-creation of the raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. But Bigelow is careful not to exploit the cathartic potential of the raid, and the movie ends on a note that's wonderfully dissonant with the expectations of an action movie crowd.Maya is a tough cookie, but by casting the pale, red-haired, rather waifish Jessica Chastain, the director makes the unstressed point that strong women sometimes come in deceptively frail packages. She plays Maya with stone-cold intensity, fuelled by anger directed towards a target so elusive that he is more a phantom than a terrorist leader. Zero Dark Thirty rests on Chastain's shoulders, but she's always interacting with strong talent and that only helps to keep the film level and never without a pulse.Zero Dark Thirty remains an immaculately put together work of art that deserves all the attention it was given.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Unsung Heroes is Bigelow and Boal!,"A tit-for-tat vengeance it ostensibly acclaims, ZERO DARK THIRTY is a gritty, hard-boiled account of our anti-heroine Maya's relentless pursuit of Usama Bin Laden, and the most precious calibre of Kathryn Bigelow's latest film (after her precedent Oscar champion THE HURT LOCKER 2008, 8/10) is it soberly obviates any hyperbole which is attendant with its sensational thematic source.The film centers closely on Maya's perspective (excludes the last 30-minutes of re-enactment of the actual raid), the camera prowls around her, sifts meticulously her reflexes towards the mires she is engulfed with, meanwhile, Kathryn adopts a much daring path to categorically circumvents Maya's personal life and background foils, which inevitably will cause some unbecoming distance towards its core audience, but it does enhance a tincture of ceremonial sacrifice in her devotion, a fatalism glory in her trials and tribulations which can empathize in any other individual's own track of life.Standing firmly as an apolitical film fanatic, I could stay unruffled with its vexing ""torture"" controversy because as it is mentioned in the film, ""it is just biology"", the truth lies unscathed here and there no matter how we try to whitewash it, and it is extremely feasible to exert the extreme action under the extreme circumstances, the film really has some guts in not hedge the issue and instead, it emboldens us to question ourselves to face the darkest side of our humanity, Maya's gradual stolidness towards torture could be applied to anyone if facing a similar situation (there are profuse nefarious activities happening everyday everywhere). So a film should not be punished to reveal the "" inconvenient truth"" which slams the hypocrisy of the ruling class, it is foreseeable that not everyone would be happy with the film, but what is the most quintessential conviction is that this sort of film should own its voice and place in the market and earn its appeal.Kathryn recruited most of her THE HURT LOCKER crew in this film, so the dusty texture, erratic camera-work, superb sound effect and visual blast are viscerally cogent. Jessica Chastain, whose excellency I may not repeat here, but her flair of arresting attention is inscrutably immense, even as plain as simple contemplation, she would blow you away. Her illustrious future is clearly beckoning and Meryl Streep can feel a sense of relief since finally there is someone who can suit her shoes, interestingly, it is the very much underused and under-appreciated actress Jennifer Ehle who resembles a staggering young Meryl Streep countenance in the film, and among a dozen of male ancillary roles, Jason Clarke should be honorably mentioned albeit his screen-time diminution in the latter half of the film does leave his Oscar-chance awry.The film altogether is more like a phlegmatic rumination of a persistence of what we believe than a panegyric for unsung heroes, it establishes its unyielding stance out of a presumed HOMELAND-esque political thriller pattern, personally it is that kind of film I admire more than I enjoy, and Ms. Bigelow and the screenwriter Mark Boal are the unsung heroes here.",8.0,Anonymous,History
best advice - show up an hour late,"I believe this film is based on the classic made for Lifetime channel movie, ""Girl With a Hunch.""If you want the truth about these events you won't get it by sitting in the theater for 3 hours.This film isn't really about the hunt for Bin Laden, or as they refer to him in the film, UBL?! It's a twisted pseudo-feminist movie about how women can do some things better than men. Maybe, but this film doesn't lend too much substance to that argument. It shows that a women has to treat everyone like garbage to succeed in a man's world.Very poor screenplay - very poor direction - not fact based - just made up clichéd B movie dialog.",1.0,Anonymous,History
It's like Homeland was made into a movie,"Kathryn Bigelow again tries to depict the realities of modern warfare against terrorism with this film that looks remarkably like a movie adaptation of Homeland. The same feisty female CIA agent that is ""her against the world"", the same obsession with her target, the same great cast placed in somewhat insignificant roles to make her shine in her role. Is it something more than that, though? Barely.On the other hand it is difficult to tell this story and also make it interesting without forgoing some of the realities in it. CIA work is a thorough, heart wrenching and, most of the time, boring job. The movie is likewise in its depictions of torture in the hands of Americans, numerous bureaucratic obstacles before action is even considered and the many discussions. As an idea, the operation for the capture or killing of UBL was not started for more than 100 days from the moment they suspected where he was.Bigelow does well to not go into a political direction or another. You don't feel the movie accusatory against the War against Terror, nor do you feel it apologetic towards the less politically correct actions of Americans in the conflict. It feels real and I certainly hope it is based on facts. That's why this is not a very dramatic movie, nor has it a lot of military action, it is almost a documentary.Bottom line: As a depiction of facts, a great job; as a movie, a little boring. And I also don't know about the veracity of the information Bigelow received as source material.As for what happened in the film, the operation itself felt weird to me. They go there to kill bin Laden. Just kill him. Not detain, not prosecute, not torture and interrogate. Bin Laden himself, in the midst of an obvious American attack, doesn't blow up the entire compound, or at least himself, he just sits tight and waits for it all to end. He could have just hidden somewhere in a compartment and the Americans would never have had the time to do a proper search. None of that happened.One phrase in the film also left me wondering. Apparently, the reasoning behind sending the team in the house in the first place was to ascertain that bin Laden really was there. Otherwise they would have just thrown in a bomb. Really? Is that justice? It's seems like American Fatwa to me. And this is the most terrifying thing to me, how a few bombs and terror threats have sand blasted away the patina of civilization from the American behavior and showed the angry, barbaric desire to dehumanize and destroy their enemy, just like the people they are fighting. I think that is the meaning of the last scene: the girl, having reached her target, cries for her own lost humanity.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Fascinating insight,"Zero Dark Thirty was originally supposed to be about the unsuccessful decade-long manhunt for Osama Bin Laden. That would've been OK. But on May 2 2011, when the world was celebrating, I can guarantee the filmmakers of Zero Dark Thirty were celebrating twice as hard. They'd just had their film completely rewritten in the space of half an hour. Now with a much more satisfying synopsis and a subject the world would be fascinated to see a re-enactment of, they were onto something special. The film is basically a two hour build-up to the main event, the assassination of Osama Bin Laden. But it's also more than that. There's some intriguing insight given into what went down over the course of ten years and it has caused a lot of controversy, but no one can deny that it's a very well made film.Kathryn Bigelow is making a big name for herself in Hollywood these days. Her last film was 2008's Academy Award's Best Picture winner 'The Hurt Locker' and now she's followed it up with another Best Picture nominated film. There's nothing feminine about her directing style. It's just as hard-hitting, and at times brutal, as any male director in Hollywood and occasionally even more so. The torture scenes in Zero Dark Thirty, while not taken too far, are realistic and effective. They serve their purpose well. If Bigelow can follow this up with a third success in a row then her name might just start to be mentioned alongside the greats. I'm sure a lot of people will be keeping a close eye on what she chooses to explore next.Jessica Chastain has been nominated for another Best Actress award this year at the Oscars for Zero Dark Thirty and is even in contention to win the award. I didn't think she was anything on the likes of Emmanuelle Riva personally, but I do think she's in golden form at the moment (much like Bigelow) and it won't be long before she wins herself a much deserved Oscar. As far as liking the film goes I'd suggest it's about as simple as this: if the concept of the assassination of Osama Bin Laden interests you, you'll like the film. If it doesn't, you won't. It was a touch long for my liking and I feel it could've had 15 minutes shaved off it to appeal to an ever wider audience who might not have the patience of others. Overall though an effective, engaging and fascinating piece of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A masterpiece by a perfectionist!!,"Sometimes a movie should be watched without too much emphasis on the authenticity of the facts. Zero Dark Thirty is an attempt to showcase (even though it may not be entirely true) the biggest manhunt in history. Director Bigelow does more than justice to a impeccable script by keeping it as close to reality as she can. Maya (Chastain) has been spectacular in the entire movie, be it the initial timid looking fresh recruit or the bold and dynamic agent taking on superiors in making decisions that are though to have a consensus upon. The rest of the star cast have been outstanding too. Some may complain that the movie is slow or could have been shorter, but I believe, the scenes have been so meticulously shot that one can feel the plethora of emotions each character is going through. The movie's editing is perfect and the background score adds on to its intensity. Overall, Zero Dark Thirty is masterpiece and a perfect follow up to The Hurt Locker. Well done Bigelow!!!",9.0,Anonymous,History

Movies based on actual events pose a general problem as to never really giving how much of the movie is ""factual"" vs simply created for entertainment purposes. Indeed as others have criticized, there was a lack of character development. We only see characters from point A to point B without really knowing anything about them. So one can't exactly develop the character further. The movie is somewhat thought provoking in the sense of morality and justification.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"A raw , tight , gripping intense military drama that is definitely worth a watch if you want to know the reality","September 9/11 terrorist attacks are still fresh in our mind and Osama Bin Laden may be most horrifying figure who had impounding affect on every American citizen. If you are interested in knowing about the investigation carried out by CIA to hunt down Laden , Zero Dark Thirty is the Bible for you.Zero Dark Thirty gives you a detailed description of events that took place post 9/11 attacks , the sacrifices made by soldiers , the operations carried out by CIA to hunt down the world's most dreaded man.From the director of ""The Hurt Locker"" , Kathryn Bigelow gives you yet another shocking world of reality. The detailed level description of the operation and investigation carried out by CIA has been depicted appropriately. Hats off to Bigelow for handling such a sensitive subject with aplomb. It would take have taken lot of guts to direct such a bold and challenging subject. Once you are into the film , couple of scenes will have nail-biting affect and will send a chill running down your spine. The opening torture scene, the interrogation scene , bomb blast during dinner at the hotel , the suicide bombing and the climax scene where they finally hunt down Laden will surely have profound affect shocking you instantly. Writer Mark Boal( also wrote The Hurt Locker) has done a great job. On flypside , the climax could be more impacting where they kill Laden. Screenplay is tight holding your attention. Cinematography is spellbinding. Art Direction is superb. Dialogues are gritty. Performance wise , Jessica Chastain gives her best performance as Maya. She delivers a knock-out performance emoting through her eyes initially and fiery dialogues later. Mark Strong and Jason Clarke gives a lending support to the performance.A raw , tight , gripping intense drama that is definitely worth a watch if you want to know the reality.

Bigelow and Boal know their War movies,"¨I'm going to smoke everyone involved in the op and then I'm going to kill Osama bin Laden.¨The passion, determination, and single-minded pursuit of a female CIA operative to hunt down and kill Osama bin Laden was the film that the Academy Award winning writer and director decided to pursue after their success in The Hurt Locker. Zero Dark Thirty is so intense and suspenseful that you just want Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal to continue working together forever. They make other modern war films look really bad when held up to the standards of their recent work together. Bigelow has developed such a craft and expertise as a filmmaker that during some moments of the film (especially the final 25 minute raid) you feel like you are watching a documentary of actual footage of the manhunt instead of a fictional film. She is as passionate about her work as her lead character is obsessed with hunting down this man. We can't argue that Bigelow benefits from Boal's extraordinary script, which manages to reduce a decade long hunt into 150 minutes of detailed procedural work without taking political sides or focusing on revenge nonsense. It just takes such a realist approach that you never feel manipulated by Bigelow which would have been easy to do considering the subject matter. This is in my opinion the best film dealing with pos 9-11 events thanks to Bigelow's ability to remain emotionally detached and focus on her craft. Under the weight of the heavy subject matter, she somehow manages to make this film more about a character study than an actual manhunt. There is really one main character in this film as the rest of characters come and go, and without delving into her past and focusing on the decade long pursuit of bin Laden the story centers around her, and it is a very interesting psychological study of what motivates her. Jessica Chastain is just so fascinating in this film, that she single handedly carries this movie and gives the best performance of her career.The film opens in black with several voiceovers of calls from the World Trade center during the 9-11 attacks. It is a very emotional opening scene as we later are introduced to the main character, Maya (Jessica Chastain), who has been sent to Pakistan by the CIA to hunt down bin Laden. The first place we see her is in an interrogation room where her partner Dan (Jason Clarke) is torturing a terrorist prisoner in order to find information of the whereabouts of bin Laden. Maya isn't amused by the torture that is going on and doesn't participate, but she is willing to accept any means necessary in order to unlock the truth and hunt down the man she's obsessed with finding. Of all the prisoners they have interrogated there seems to be one man that is mentioned by everyone: Abu Ahmed. Maya is convinced that this man is bin Laden's personal courier and that if she can locate him then she will locate his leader. Her boss, Joseph Bradley (Kyle Chandler) isn't convinced about this theory, but Maya is determined to pursue this lead. The entire film is a very detailed procedural drama of how Maya follows one lead after another (with several false and disappointing leads along the way) until she is able to locate the whereabouts of bin Laden. Her next mission is to convince the authorities that bin Laden is actually hidden in that complex without having definite proof, but her certainty ends up convincing the leaders to send the US Navy SEALS team led by Patrick (Joel Edgerton) to attack the compound and kill bin Laden.There were a great amount of talented actors cast in this film such as James Gandolfini, Mark Strong, Edgar Ramirez, Mark Duplass, Frank Grillo, and Chris Platt, but they had very few scenes and the entire film centered on Jessica Chastain. She deserves an Oscar for her performance here, and Mark Boal deserves one for Best Screenplay. The entire film is a character study on Maya as her entire life revolves around catching this man. We see it in her eyes from the very opening scene to the very end where instead of experiencing joy for the success she had, all we can see is a sigh of relief. What comes next for Maya? She doesn't even know as she was so focused and determined on one thing only. I love Bigelow's style and how she downsizes the entire war and centers everything on one central character. Just like she did in The Hurt Locker where the focus is on Renner's character and how the adrenaline of war has become an addiction for him; now the focus is on Chastain who is very driven and obsessed with accomplishing her goal. There is not anything else on her mind; it's as if she lives for one specific purpose. In the end you don't know if you should cheer for her or feel sorry that her work is done. In a way I felt Bigelow's approach to the events that led to bin Laden's death to be very powerful; and it has raised a lot of discussions about torture, but that is exactly what a great film should do: bring up conversations and make us question things at times. After a decade long manhunt, was it really a triumph to kill bin Laden? Was it worth a celebration? Does the end justify the means? Without taking sides Bigelow makes us think about these issues and that is what good movies do for the viewers.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,History
Sick propaganda for a political fiction,"I won't address the many aesthetic flaws in this film amply recounted in the many 1-star reviews below, but will focus on the content over the form, and how it made me sick:I'm sure Ms. Bigelow thought she was making a heroic film about American spooks and servicemen seeking justice for 9/11, but it's a symptom of American ""exceptionalism"" and lack of self-consciousness that the ""heroes"" of this saga were distinctly unsympathetic and their methods repulsive -- as another reviewer and a friend of mine stated, they were actually cheering for al-Qaeda by mid way through film.The first third virtually revels in the torture scenes with not a shred of self doubt or moral scruple, and later we have a CIA agent whining about ""losing the detainee program"" -- the script might as well have been penned at Langley by CIA hacks as justification for their crimes. As we now know from the more or less redacted Senate hearings into this despicable episode, virtually no actionable intelligence was obtained from all the water boarding and other repulsive abuses at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo and the many black sites. But according to Zero Dark Thirty, waterboarding was crucial to our never-ending counterterrorism campaign.The Abbottabab raid depicts innocent women and men being mowed down by the SEALs, and the denouement is the implausibly hyperbolic lead character finally peering into a body bag to view her trophy -- I was left with a feeling of disgust. This was truly an UGLY film, it was definitely propagandistic, and this is the face America now proudly and shamelessly shows to the world, garlanded with a bevy of award nominations.For the naive simpletons out there (about 60-70% of the American populace), even renowned journalist Seymour Hersh believes the official account of the bin Laden raid was a complete fiction. They dumped the body in the ocean and we can't even see the photos of bin Laden's corpse because it would be too offensive to Muslims? If you believe that, you're already a mindless drone living in Orwell's dystopic USA. Hollywood has merged with Washington, and this film was a bad pseudo-documentary about a political fiction hatched to continue fueling the bogus ""War on Terror"" that was spawned by another complete fiction -- 9/11 itself.",2.0,Anonymous,History
A tense and gritty procedural telling of the world's greatest manhunt,"As Americans, we had never been so fixated on killing a single individual as we were Osama bin Laden, the brain behind Al Qaeda and dubbed architect of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" the story of this 10-year manhunt, leaves out that social and political narrative, opting instead to capture the CIA's operation to find and kill bin Laden from a purely procedural perspective.Director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal's tense yet human-focused style translates right over from their Oscar-winning effort ""The Hurt Locker"" to this film, which could find itself with a similar amount of accolades — if it doesn't drown in controversy first.Its depiction of torture scenes toward the beginning aside, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" conveys the CIA and main character Maya's (Jessica Chastain) fixation on doing whatever it took to find bin Laden. It never stops to ask why, opting to use its opening minutes to play 9-1-1 calls from Sep. 11 over a black screen and get at our emotions rather than our rationale. It's an effective technique, though the engrossing espionage plot blots out any emotional elements to the film until the very end.The factually ambiguous Maya is an intriguing creation. She evolves very gradually over the film's lengthy run time from a woman whom we presume to be in over her head to the only person with the stones to do what it takes to succeed. It's as though Boal and Bigelow wanted to play with our assumptions about what a pretty redhead is or isn't capable of and then ratchet her character up into this fiercely strong female character who can't be labeled a dominatrix. Chastain brilliantly plays it very cool for much of the film and only turns up the dial in rhythm with the height of the stakes.""Zero Dark Thirty"" puts you in the trenches with the CIA in the way that Boal writes his script, as compared to ""Argo,"" which plays a tad more to the audience by explaining scenarios clearer and being especially wry. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" offers a handful of laughs, but it's grittier and much more procedural in nature. Unlike fictional thrillers involving the CIA and other secret operations, it does not glamorize any part of the process and the script refuses to wedge exciting action sequences into the film to break up the pacing to appease viewers with shorter attention spans.We don't get a whole lot more than plot, so Chastain and actors Jason Clarke, Jennifer Ehle, Joel Edgerton, Kyle Chandler and Chris Pratt have to find openings to deliver character-telling moments to keep everyone human. Chastain puts on a straight face, but you sense her emotional roller coaster throughout. The others don't get as many opportunities, but Bigelow has this incredible gift to turn them into more than guys wearing suits or military fatigues.Bigelow constantly keeps her movie interesting and ""Zero Dark Thirty"" boasts exceptional editing. It's easy to tell when something bad is going to happen because the tone of the film shifts so drastically, but the payoff of these climactic moments is always satisfying. The final scene, the raid on the compound where bin Laden was found is completely silent and utterly captivating, proving the how is as much if not more important than the end result (considering we all know what it is).Much has been made about the film's stance on torture, namely it depicts enhanced interrogation techniques and pivotal to the discovery of the information that ultimately led to bin Laden's location. The graphic nature of these scenes will definitely be a matter of taste, but as to whether the movie glorifies torture — that's stickier territory. It definitely suggests a certain degree of necessity in using harsh tactics in order for the CIA to get the information it needed, which is an issue of fact vs. Hollywood dramatization, but it doesn't by any means milk the torture scenes for entertainment purposes.If I had to guess, Boal and Bigelow wanted to convey how even the most horrific tactics were utilized to achieve the end goal of finding bin Laden, that there was a certain desperation and not much consideration for the ethics. The film takes nary a moment to consider the moral question of interrogation techniques, predominantly because it's not a film about whether torture in this situation is ethical. It doesn't depict characters relishing in torture, but characters who feel as though they have no other choice.""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a black ops thriller without the glitz of fancy technology, chase sequences in exotic locations and highly skilled super spies. It captures the steadfast effort of the CIA and the chances it took in order to even be in the position to attempt an operation on the bin Laden compound. It takes dramatic liberties to be sure, but it relies on just great filmmaking technique to rivet and captivate.With such a timely subject and being the center of so much controversy (beyond the torture and also into how much the government cooperates with Hollywood), ""Zero Dark Thirty"" opts not to make any statements, political, thematic or otherwise. It consequently lacks the other facets we attribute to great movies, but what it does well it executes in consummate fashion.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The defining movie of this decade,"This is perhaps the first review I've written on IMDb for a movie. With all the controversy, people should understand that this movie is as important to movies of this decade as The Wire is to TV shows. I'm sure I will be re-watching The Wire 10 or 20 years from now. Similarly, I am sure that people will re-watch Zero Dark Thirty to understand the hunt for Bin Laden. This movie is better than The Wire in one important way because ZDT brings up many questions without giving clear answers (OTOH, Wire is obviously liberal leaning).I thought the movie was appropriately paced. We get a good sense of the noise (and occasional personal danger) that the CIA analysts had to penetrate through and how difficult this task is. The opening shot forebodes this movie well: you see Maya flinch a little at the horror of what she's witnessing in the opening scene but she steels herself to continue on. In the midst of the hunt, no one stops to discuss morality. The final scene when Maya finally shows some human emotion, we feel compelled to ask, ""Was it worth it?""",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Great Film For Our Times,"As the hunt for Osama bin Laden wore on President George W Bush was prompted in frustration to say that he didn't know where bin Laden was and he didn't give him much thought anymore. Far from Washington press conferences CIA agents were still thinking about the al Qaeda leader and engaged in the day to day drudgery that dominates intelligence work. ZERO DARK THIRTY is the story of one such agent, Maya (Jessica Chastain)a woman of dogged determination who's prone to butt heads with higher-ups inclined to weigh the politics of every decision. When we first see Maya she is functioning within an interrogation unit trying to extract information from suspected terrorists. These scenes shot in Jordanian prisons are intensely realistic and the source of most of the criticism the film has received. Director Kathryn Bigelow is not an advocate for torture. She is simply painting the picture as it occurred. Her approach is documentarian and she and screenwriter Mark Boal meticulously and clinically depict the events of one of history's greatest manhunts. Chastain exhibits great strength and vulnerability in her role. She is a warrior on the front lines in this 21st century war. Political and ethical questions are for another day, her task is clear. I love the way ZERO DARK THIRTY doesn't' try to be Rambo, in fact it's the anti-Rambo which may be disturbing to moviegoers who want to see some heroic national crusade portrayed gloriously with all flags flying. There's a sadness here, a sense that we have made a trade-off one which diminishes us all. As a movie Bigelow, Boal and Chastain have created an unceasingly suspenseful film as historical document which held me in its grip.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Another Bigelow Triumph,"So, I realise I'm late to the party in regards to this film but better late than never, right?On the surface of it, you can be forgiven for automatically comparing Zero Dark Thirty to Bigelow's other 'war' film, The Hurt Locker; you could be forgiven but you would be entirely wrong! The two films are completely different yet both are equally compelling, just for contrasting reasons.The movie starts with audio only; calls between victims and the emergency services during the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. It's heartbreaking and horrifying without actually showing you anything. From here we jump two years and we are introduced to Jessica Chastain's character, Maya. Bigelow and writer, Mark Boal, give the audience a strong female character; a single minded woman who stops at nothing until she gets what she wants. Chastain's portrayal is a marvel; from her first 'interrogation' to the final moments, Maya's growth as a character, in strength and resolve, is utterly convincing. The only downside is that the audience never gets beneath the surface. Bigelow sacrifices who Maya is for what she does. However Jessica Chastain is so powerful in her role that the viewer will follow her story anyway without question.The death of Bin Laden is almost always told as the story of the brave men who stormed his compound, yet we don't get to meet this group until two hours into the film. This film isn't about these people, it's about what went on behind the scenes to allow such a mission to take place; the many layers of bureaucracy and years of research Maya and company endure just to get a meeting with the Director of the C.I.A (played by James Gandolfini).Some of the torture scenes make for uncomfortable viewing no matter what your opinion of it's usage. Bigelow pulls no punches in her direction and creates a visually beautiful film amid harsh environments. The final half hour of the film, the storming of Bin Laden's refuge which is shot almost in real time, is fascinating as the director switches between night vision goggles and the drab natural light of the compound, drawing the audience in and creating a tense final scene (despite the fact that we all know the ending of this story).",9.0,Anonymous,History
Superb,"Its not a typical action movie. Though it could easily could have been one, with lot of scope for action. But the way its presented. absolutely mind numbing.Stunning. Definitely qualifies for repeat viewing. Though i had not much liked the hurt locker, this one is superb. It would have been very tempting to have added usual spices to cater to general peoples taste but it would have lost its impact. And what an impact. So much goes behind to set a thing right. America has shown just that to the world.Do not watch it anyway else than on big screen.it deserves an Oscar and will get it.what an effort.the climax is how a climax should be, pulsating.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Thrilling and Extremely Convincingly Real.,"Zero Dark Thirty: 8.5/10Intense, Thriling, Convincingly Real and aided by brilliant acting by Jessica Chastain and co, Zero Dark Thirty shows the assassination of Osama Bin Laden extremely well and convincingly and is embolised through the tough acting by Chastain and the rest of the crew and some brilliant and convincing presentation by Kathryn Bieglow who keeps on making movies related to war and crime superbly.The Story which is based on true events of the assassination of Osama Bin Laden and the screenplay written by Mark Boel is based on CIA's hunt of finding out where Bin Laden is hiding out after the 9/11 attacks and shows the life of Maya(Chastain) who is a extremely capable CIA agent who is sent to help out in finding Bin Laden, and how she gets adamant of finding him and bravely goes through much risks and hard-times to finally get a source of where he is and must prove it to the high officials that he is in a location and they should assassinate him.Jessica Chastain is basically the only ''lead'' character in this movie as the fearless Maya who is adamant and obsessed to find and kill Bin Laden and she does this role superbly, and considering that she is in the pressure of delivering most of the acting goods, she does an extremely convincing job and probably deserves the awards she is receiving for this performance which is probably her best so far. Joel Edgerton is a really talented and underrated actor i believe and he does another fine performance as Patrick(Squadron Team Leader) who must take his team to assassinate Bin Laden, and though he does'nt have much screen time, he does greatly in whatever screen time he gets. Jeremy Strong and Jason Clarke do their bits superbly to make the acting in this movie look really realistic to what happened.Kathryn Bigelow has done another extremely super job in making a film based on really controversial events and I don't think many imagined the movie to be made so quickly after the real events and she took a bold decision in making this but it paid of really well as she made a really convincing movie explaining the audience of what actually happened before and during the assassination. Although she gets a bit desperate in explaining extremely thoroughly at times but apart from that she has done a brilliant job in all parts of the film and really helped Chastain and other deliver there performances greatly and she has made another great film.The Story is quite precise and explains to the audience of what happened during and before the actual assassination happened and although it is quite convincing, one begins to feel that its a bit over-stretched and at times could have been cut short a bit, but apart from that screenwriter Mark Boel has done a great job with the dialogues and script of the film and has done a convincing job in showing this story well, and the story's backed up superbly by Bigelow and the rest of the crew. The Editing of the film is quite superb as the scenes of the film are synchronised superbly and the editing makes it tough to predict it.The Cinematography of the film is quite fitting to the film and some of the scenes shown in Iraq and Pakistan are brilliant and dark at the same time and cinematographer Greig Fraser has done a really fine job with it. The Background music of the movie is extremely fitting to the scenes and its haunting and dark and as good as it can get for this type of movies and Alexandre Desplat keeps on delivering remarkable scores for each movie he decides to go with, he is really talented in delivering the backgound music of a film.Finally, Although this was'nt as good as i thought it would, its extremely close to it and Bigelow has made another brilliant movie which keeps you thrilled and guessing all the time and at the end you're quite convinced of what happened during or before Osama Bin Laden's assassination.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great searching-for-someone thriller. Especially picks up during last hour,"I read that the original script was written about the decade long search and failed manhunt of Osama Bin Laden but was completely re- written months before filming began once American forces had found and killed him. In hindsight, this is really lucky because I felt the film really picked up pace once the Pakistan fortress was introduced and especially during the half hour long night raid. Jessica Chastain gives another great performance as the strong and smart CIA operative who's ten year work was the backbone of finally hunting down the worlds most wanted man. Other roles are played well enough but it really rests on Chastain's shoulders. The movie was released at the perfect time following the true events that took place. I'm glad that they didn't release this a year earlier or I feel it would have felt unfinished ala Zodiac.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Torture Porn Propaganda,"This movie is sold as a ""true story"" to the ignorant masses. it is anything but, it is simply pure fantasy designed to sexualise torture and make a case as to why torture should be legal. It is a movie entirely funded by the military industrial complex who, no doubt, have used hundreds of shills to give this movie a far higher rating than it deserves.Osama was NOT found thanks to intelligence gained from torture, this is a complete fabrication designed to brainwash you into thinking how the military industrial complex would like you to think.Its makers should be charged like the pro Nazi propagandists were after the second world war.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Zero Dark Thirty review,"This is as real as it gets, for a Hollywood picture anyway. This film chronicles the decade-long search for the notorious Osama Bin Laden, and his ultimate demise, thanks to the dedicated actions of U.S. intelligence and soldiers. Most of this film is built on a realistic portrayal of intel gathering and the actual operation; if such things interest you, then this film should be right up your alley. Most of it is a grim, brooding, realistic drama that emphasizes the danger, the political nuances, and the moral ambiguity of the entire operation. There is action toward the end, but it's a pretty straightforward affair. There are a few ugly scenes as well: the torture scenes in the film's beginning won't sit well with everybody, and it has caused some controversy. Whether you condone or condemn everything in the film, these are things that actually happened, and the film presents them without condoning or condemning.All of this is shown through the vantage point of a character named Maya, who serves to fulfill multiple roles in multiple levels of the operation, allowing us to see the whole thing unfold from the bottom up. It's a bit of a stretch to believe that Maya could act in all the roles she's given, but as a composite character, she serves the narrative's purpose really well. What really helps will be the film's pathos; it's hard not to admire Maya as a character, who shows decent development, and proves to be a thrill to watch with her aggressive dedication and shrewdness. As far as the plot itself goes, it's a straightforward affair, but it seems to adhere to real-life events really well. Some specific scenes might deviate from reality (the actual raid was much shorter and quieter than what's on film).This film uses some rough-around-the-edges photography. Editing is good; the way it manipulates sound recordings reminded me a lot of a George Lucas film. Acting is generally good, but Jessica Chastain steals the show throughout with her perfectly nuanced performance. Writing is okay. This production uses real-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music is pretty moody.Recommended.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)",9.0,Anonymous,History
Triumphant victory!!,"After the events of September 11th, 2001 America was forever changed. Zero Dark Thirty chronicles the decade long fight with al-Qaeda and hunt for the al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. Finalizing on a dark night in May 2011 when the Navy S. E. A. L.s Team 6 breeched bin Laden's compound in Pakistan and killed the leader of al-Qaeda in an effort to end the war on terror.Very gripping and thrilling from the very first moments of the film. With the subject matter of the film its almost impossible as a viewer to not be on the edge of your seat as monumental of an event as this was. Definitely not for the faint of heart as you really start to learn of how brutal some of the military procedures needed to be in order to catch and eliminate the most illustrious terrorist leader our history has ever known. This film chronicalizes the hunt for Osama bin Laden with a beautiful attention to detail. The cast was awesome all around and the acting by all was fantastic. Again I must reiterate this film not being for the faint of heart, the film is centered around a tremendous amount of death on both sides. This film quite literally punches you in the face from start to finish but totally ends in complete satisfaction.",9.0,Anonymous,History
