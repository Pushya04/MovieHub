One of the best films ever made.,"Luke Skywalker goes in search of Jedi Master Yoda, to begin his Jedi training, meanwhile his friends and fellow band of rebels are pursued by The Empire's forces.How on Earth was it possible to match, if not surpass Episode IV, it seems unfathomable, well that's exactly what they did with this remarkable movie, and whilst I personally rank the films on par with one another, I get why some favour this one. For me, the first came out of nowhere, whereas for this second one, expectations would have been incredibly high.A superb storyline, breathtaking visuals, first class acting, and Yoda, what more could anyone possibly want or need from a movie, it's a bold claim, but I would genuinely say this is one of the greatest films of all time.The sets are unbelievable, you can really tell that for those involved this was definitely a labour of love, everything was precise and on point.It's worth a 10/10 for Yoda alone, I adore his and Luke's scenes together. The wonderful voice of Frank Oz adds a great deal, it really does help to make Yoda such an amazing, funny, smart and curious character.Let's be honest, films don't get much better than this, it really is a masterpiece.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I enjoy this one more than A New Hope,"So much amazing action and beautiful cinematography makes for such an enlightening experience! In The Empire Strikes Back you know who everyone is which is great plus Yoda is introduced! I love this movie the music is soothing, there's romance, more of Darth Vader, and introduces Emperor Palpatine what more can you ask for? A lot to relish and get excited about; it's such a classic gem.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Excellent timeless classic, the best sequel of all time!","Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. It's great because Darth Vader and the Empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the Force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as George Lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga.The plot is actually more a rescue mission that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is coming to rescue his friends Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca are captured on a planet Bespin in Cloud City from villainous Darth Vader. Han Solo's friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) set the up and with Darth Vader he set a trap for Luke. Also Luke studied the Force under Jedi Master Yoda to become a full Jedi Knight but in the end he must confront Darth Vader (David Prowse) by him self. The origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled.Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980 it is directed by Irvin Kershner this time and not George Lucas. Because George Lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. Getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in Orange County, California, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct Empire Strikes Back. So his first choice was Irvin Kershner, who was a professor at UC in the UC film school, that George attended too and he always liked Irvin Kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time Irvin Kershner didn't want to do it, so George called Irvin's agent and his agent said to Irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. This stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! I love John Williams score still the same, but I think John Williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion.Things that I love in this film: I love the battle with Rebels fighting with the Imperial AT-AT walkers on the ice world of Hoth. That is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. The Imperial AT-AT walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects.I love that the origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled, that Luke is the son of Darth Vader, who is actually Anakin Skywalker, before he become Darth Vader and went to the dark site.For the first time ever, we see an Emperor in a Hologram talking to Darth Vader.The Falcon with Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster.Luke faces with Darth Vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. The lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between Luke and Darth Vader was excellent and it was epic.The training sequence with Luke and master Yoda were excellent and epic.A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are my favorite films in series, that are in the franchise, this film get's a perfect 10 score for been the best sci-fi adventure sequel of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best film in the original trilogy.,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action.  It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development.  The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film.  The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series.  This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional.  This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Darker and better than ""New hope""","So, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a sequel to the previous part. After the release of the first episode, the budget, the fans appeared, and, accordingly, the quality improved!The fifth episode is the darkest and even the best in the original trilogy (in my personal opinion), and for many in the entire franchise.Here we will hear the famous Imperial March for the first time, learn all the greatness of the Empire under the leadership of Vader, as well as the formation of Luke as a Jedi.New characters have added color to the franchise, some have already become iconic and famous among many (the same Boba Fett).This fascinating story will feature plot twists (for sure many people understood what I was talking about) and a very addictive atmosphere of horror.As a result, this is what the fans needed - a successful sequel. And, of course, you need to look at it, it's a classic after all.My Rating : 10/10 (one of the best films)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Greatest Movie Ever,"This film changed the game forever. The people behind the scenes took an exciting science fiction adventure film with a happy tone where the heroes have a happy tone throughout and throwing that on its side. Throughout the film the rebels are in a constant rush and panic, pushing the viewers to the edge of their seat wondering if the heroes would make it to the end okay. This is done brilliantly by splitting up the heroes putting them in a worried state for one another. As well as that the rebels are all tested as they go through their own personal trails and try to find their way through.
Even though this might put you on a constant worry for the characters the movie is paced perfectly with breathers and amazing storytelling by the characters to fill in anything we need answers for.
That is just the story, the film also has gorgeous cinematography, going from the AT-ATs on Hoth, to the Imperial pursuit of the Falcon through the asteroid field, all the way down to the beautiful shots of the final battle in Cloud city. Even though we as viewers are worried for the rebels, the imagery is jaw dropping. 
The imagery is further enhanced by the most popular score of all time, John Williams delivers his best work ever as it has stuck with people their entire lives and is recognizable by even those who haven't seen the film. 
The film was released in 1980 and all of the set design and special effects still hold up to this day as they are just as convincing now as it was apon first watch for everyone in the past 38 years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the best,"I cannot believe some people out there didn't like this film, yet claim to have enjoyed Episode One. No comparison whatsoever. ""The Empire Strike Back"" is George Lucas' best contribution to human history, and it will be remembered long after most other science fiction films have gone the way of the Do-Do Bird. The optical effects still stand the test of time, and the acting is superb. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher are all better than they we in the original Star Wars, having fully developed and grown into their characters, and the story just keeps going and going, from asteroid fields to swamp planets to cities in the sky, everything in this film works. So ignore anyone who claims to dislike it, and see it for yourself if you haven't already done so. 20 out of 10!!Oh, and Han Solo shot first! =)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's NOT the darkest of the trilogy - it's the most mature,"`It avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending,' says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.'  I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me.  I'm therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending.  Obviously, I can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens.  If you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film.  Stop reading now.After the surprise attack on the rebel base, Luke Skywalker splits with Han, Leia, et al.  Han's party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of Luke watching the Falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while Luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with Yoda.The training scenes are many and Yoda talks a great deal of rubbish.  But somehow it doesn't matter.  The film is ambivalent in its attitude towards Yoda, anyway.  Our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of Han, Leia and the adolescent Luke.  The main story concerns the understanding that builds between Han and Leia.  In the end they are honest with one another; and if Han's being frozen and shipped back to Tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it's the price to pay.  It was very important NOT to end with the dashing rescue that opens `Return of the Jedi', which would be dramatically beside the point.  Instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur.  That's enough.As for Luke: he abandons Yoda to rescue Han and Leia, and achieves NOTHING WHATEVER.  This was my favourite touch.  All five Jedis - Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong.  The film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical Force.  Luke's human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not.When George Lucas gave his Star Wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes.  You'll notice he made precious few changes to episode V.  There just wasn't room. He added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the Special Edition is virtually identical to the original edition.  Since Lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction.  It's also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first Star Wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Star Wars FILM,"After the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance has been hounded by the Empire. Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo are with the Rebel forces on the secret base on the planet Hoth. Darth Vader locates the base driving the rebels on the run. Leia, Chewie, and Han with C-3PO escape on the Millennium Falcon eventually ending up in Lando Calrissian's Cloud City. Meanwhile, Luke goes to the Dagobah system and finds Jedi Master Yoda.There are superior popcorn movies in the Star Wars franchise although there is plenty of eye-popping action in this one. This is the best overall film in the series. The dialog is snappier. The combative romance between Leia and Han is the best. Everything looks great. It introduces Yoda and Lando. There are great legendary twists. It is a Star Wars movie for film fans. Even the Special Edition is the best of the original trio. There may be one or two stiff additions but most of them actually help. There are so many incredible moments in this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Even though he wasn't at the director's helm this time, George Lucas has done it again.","In a film like The Empire Strikes Back, especially a few years on the heels of such a mind-bogglingly great film like the original Star Wars, there is something that comes immediately to mind that would at first seem to count against the film, but instead only winds up increasing the respect that it commands. In the 1977 Star Wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. Obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like I said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as Obi Wan's description of The Force to Luke. In The Empire Strike Back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained.At first, this would almost seem to be a way to save money to get more information across to the audience without having to actually put it on screen, but this is really an ingenious way of furthering the story. The very fact that we are so willing to read all this information and forgive our inability to actually see it is a testament to the quality of the series, even at this early stage in its presentation, and we know the story so well from the first film that we are glad to see such a large change in what's happening in the films, not for a second lamenting the fact that we have obviously missed so much action. And besides that, if and when George Lucas runs out of new prequels to release, and maybe if he someday begins to run low on how many hundreds of millions of dollars he has, he could go right back and make these in-between scenes into full length films. What would he call these, if he did that? Introquels? Who cares! The names themselves would be interesting enough, and if you go back and read the stuff that introduces this film, it's obvious that there's an entire film there just waiting to be made. I guess the question of actors would be a formidable one, though.The Empire Strikes Back is the film where we are first introduced to the great Jedi master Yoda (`Away put your weapon!'), as well as some of the most thrilling battle sequences of the entire Star Wars series, and that includes the prequels. The battle scene where the rebels fight the Imperial Walkers on the ice planet is an incredibly well-made battle scene, not only in the way that it was put together so convincingly using models, but that the machines themselves are so creatively made. Indeed, the Imperial Walkers are some of the most recognizable machines from the entire Star Wars saga, right up there with the Millennium Falcon and the Death Star.I have just watched this film again, having already seen Episode I and Episode II, and not having seen any of the original Star Wars films for maybe 10 years (except for the original 1977 Star Wars, which I saw and reviewed a few days ago - and these aren't even the Special Edition versions!). When I first saw Yoda when watching The Empire Strikes Back again, I was really struck by how different he looked from in the newer movies. Obviously, he's completely computer generated in the new films, but here in Episode V he looks like a muppet! Even so, I would like to express my opinion that Yoda is more realistic and more interesting here as a puppet than in the newer films as a computer generated image. At least here in the older films you know that he's actually THERE, and that he's not just added into the film later.Oh yeah, speaking of Yoda, can I just complain for a minute? What the hell was up with the Jedi training? Yes, I realize that I'm just a lowly IMDb reviewer, while The Empire Strikes Back is a part of the greatest science fiction series of all time, but would it have killed George Lucas to write in a little more creative training for Luke? The thing that struck me first about the Star Wars films when I first started watching them was how incredibly imaginative they were, but then Luke started his training. You know, when I was in high school I played football. I was a wide receiver/tight end and I hardly ever got to play because I was too tall and too skinny, but part of my workout was to carry the linemen up and down the stairs to the weight room. Some of these guys weighed 100 pounds more than me, and I still almost never saw the field, and here's Luke Skywalker. He carries Yoda around this boggy swamp and he gets to be a Jedi! What the hell!There is also the addition of a surprisingly fitting love story. First of all, anyone who has ever read my review of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie will know that I am not the biggest fan of cramming a love story into a movie where it doesn't belong. I can't seem to write anything about Bruckheimer movies without complaining about the idiot love story, and now it's even worse because here's this movie that was made so long before, from which Bruckheimer could obviously have at least learned a LITTLE bit about how to do it right. Han Solo and Princess Leia maintain the personalities that they developed in the first Star Wars film and there is now a sort of love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. This romantic subplot is characterized perfectly in the scene just before Solo is carbon frozen, when Leia risks approaching a cheesy romantic moment by saying `I love you' just before Han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, `I know.' Han Solo. Smart-ass to the last drop.Before I end I would like to point out that the goofs that can be found on the IMDb for this film are some of the most blatant that I've ever seen in a film. The scene where you can see someone giving a woman at the tactical maps a cue to deliver her lines is amazingly obvious, and some of the other ones, such as the stage hand swinging the light saber prop briefly into view as he switches it for an `off' prop with Luke just after he knocks Darth Vader over backwards, are just as much fun to look for. I have one question about the goofs, though. There's one where Luke looks off into the fog just after R2-D2 is eaten by the sea monster, and you can CLEARLY see a person running to the right a little ways off in the fog. Is that meant to be Luke? It seems that it's supposed to be him running in his search for R2, because you can even hear the FOOTSTEPS of the person running. I can't even IMAGINE how they could have missed THAT!!It is, however, a testament to the quality of a film when such tremendous oversights in editing do nothing to take away from the overall quality of the film. The Empire Strikes Back remains an extremely powerful and well-made installment in the Star Wars series, not taking even a single step backwards in the sheer breathtaking adventure of the original film. It's not often that a film as good as Star Wars can be released and then followed up with a sequel that is just as great, as is clearly the case here. Star Wars was a gigantic film upon its release, and with The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas has begun the formation of one of the greatest film series' in cinematic history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Perfect Star Wars Film in an Imperfect Saga,"The Empire Strikes Back brings the viewer further into the galaxy of Star Wars. Following the events of Episode IV: A New Hope, this darker chapter brings newer characters and adventures to the table. We learn more about who we have already come to love in the previous installment and we are able to enjoy a much more well-rounded and fleshed out idea of what Lucas' galaxy far far away should look and feel like. Harrison Ford's portrayal of Han Solo steals the show alongside his companion Chewbacca, played by the late Peter Mayhew. Mark Hamill really ups his game with Luke, making him into a less adolescent and sheltered farm kid, he's learning more about his past and the life he never knew. Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa is the perfect mixture of sass and whit as she shows us that not all space royalty is uppity and useless. Billy Dee Williams knocks it out of the park with his performance as the suave and charismatic Lando Calrissian. With the success of A New Hope, this movie boasts and impressive budget increase. This is shown in the care and detail taken into consideration when seeing all of the creatures and vehicles shown throughout the film. Simply put, this movie CARES. The people involved put forth their best work to bring what the world needed in a constant rotation of mundane and bad sci-fi action flicks coming out around the same time.

An Original Blockbuster,"The second installment of the original Star Wars trilogy benefits from coming from a time when there were very few films that could be called that. If it was made and released now it would be lost in a sea of big budget battles of good and evil aimed at making big money for a week or two and then disappearing.Thankfully it's from a time when it became one of the biggest films of the year or even the decade and it went on to inspire what the film industry is today. Without Star Wars and its army of nerds leading the way, there is no Marvel attempt to take over films and no comic-con and you would be looking at a very different world.This film has great moment and legendary quotes or misquotes and of course it has its flaws but what blockbuster doesn't and in the end it is a Star Wars film so it's worth watching.Featured on Episode 69 of The Emerald Reprobates Podcast.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not only one of the most overrated Star Wars films, but one of the most overrated films of all time period.","Seriously. The Robot Chicken specials are much more entertaining to watch than this ""Star Wars"" film.I just watched this film all the way through not to long ago and I was shocked at how boring and forgettable this episode was. I can't believe people still really think this film represents Star Wars at it's peak when The Phantom Menace exists. The only truly classic thing to come out of this film is The Imperial March is an iconic score and deserves all the praise it gets. But other than that? There is isn't anything that I can truly call great in this film.I'm sure this film was amazing for it's time and me not even being alive in 1980 is probably one of the biggest reasons why I don't understand the so called ""pure genius"" of this film, but there is no doubt in my mind that it has greatly suffered the Seinfeld effect and is something you had to actually be around for understand what all the hype is about for this so called ""excellent"" and ""amazing"" sequel.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"All the fun of the original with a much better, darker plot","The Rebellion has struck an important blow to the power of the Empire by destroying it's Death Star, however the power of the Dark Side of the Force remains strong and continues to hunt the rebellion.  While the Rebellion base on Hoth is under treat, Luke has gone to a distant swamp planet to receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda.  However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large.Following Star Wars was never going to be easy but this is actually better. Empire retains the same characters and the same sense of fun that the first had  the battle on Hoth is just one of THE moments of the series.  However what gets added to that is a much darker strand.  The Empire is not beaten by the destruction of one ship  it's power is barely dented in fact.  This sees some startling revelations (I won't spoil it in case you've been living under a rock!) but also sees significant blows to the rebellion.  In fact the ending of this film could not be more different from the end of Star Wars.Like the recent episode two this follows two strands  the more pedestrian scenes with Luke and Yoda and the more action based scenes with Han and company.  The scenes with Yoda add depth to the film and hint at the truth. Meanwhile the other half is a lot more action orientated and has comedy and good new characters such as Bobba Fett.  The two work well together and come together well for a great finale.  The addition of a dark strand to the film makes it all the better as it can be enjoyed as a story and not just a fun sci-fi film with good effects.The characters are better here than the first.  The strong characters from the first (Han, C3P0 et al) are all still good here.  However we also get a much more interesting version of Luke as he continues his journey into becoming a full Jedi.  Yoda is a good addition (despite sounding like Fozzie Bear!) and Darth Vader becomes a lot more than just a good villain  we learn his past, a revelation then, but a thing of common knowledge now.Overall this is as good as Star Wars at it's heart, but the darker nature of the film makes it much better.  Where the first one was a victorious uprising this is, as the title suggests, the time in history where the Empire strikes back against the uprising.  All the music, characters and things that make Star Wars Star Wars are here and it's simply one of the best of the series to date.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,"An excellent sequel to Star Wars, this is easily the darkest and most serious out of all the Star Wars films, at least until Revenge of the Sith comes out. This movie benefits from the introduction of Yoda, a diminutive yet wise Jedi master who helps Luke prepare for his showdown with Darth Vader. It also introduces Lando Calrissian, Han's old gambling and smuggling buddy played very well by Billy Dee Williams. Empire is more character driven than the original and relies more on comic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard with the humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well. Despite all of this I can't really say that I enjoyed Empire more than the original. The original Star Wars has a certain charm to it that none of the sequels (or prequels) have captured. I'd say that it is at least on par with the original though and is a fitting follow up in what is probably the greatest series of movies in the history of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Manages to be even better than New Hope, and that was just as brilliant","The original trilogy of Star Wars contain three films, all of which are sophisticated, imaginative and enormous fun. I feared it wouldn't be my thing, but it was exactly that. I loved the original trilogy for all those reasons. Empire Strikes Back maintains all the fun of its predecessor, while even darker and more mature. Visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke, and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda. Chewabacca is hilarious, and Darth Vader is a fantastic villain, especially when voiced so magnificently by James Earl Jones. All in all, a perfect successor to an already brilliant first film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My 8th favorite film of all time!,"This is my favorite of the classic Star Wars trilogy! It is the most suspenseful of the three and, as great as the other two are, they don't flow like this one does. This one explores the relationships instead of just action sequences (which are good in all three, though). The romance between Han and Leia and the one between Luke and Yoda, for example.

This is among the all time great science fiction movies that is an absolute must see,"The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched again on Disney+. The storyline picks up where Star Wars left off with the rebellion building their army and the evil Empire rebounding from losing the Death Star. Luke will try to master the powers of the force by searching for a new Jedi to train him; meanwhile, as he digs into his past he discovers more about how he became a Jedi to begin with.This movie is directed by Irvin Kershner (Robocop 2) and stars Mark Hamill (Sushi Girl), Harrison Ford (Clear and Present Danger), Carrie Fisher (Sorority Row), Billy Dee Williams (Nighthawks) and James Earl Jones (Coming to America).The Empire Strikes Back was always one of my favorites in the original trilogy. The opening yeti scene was fantastic and a great way tp start the film. The Princess and Hans scenes were hilarious and the banter makes you laugh no matter how many times you've seen it. Yoda is a legendary character introduced in this film and the Hans stasis scene is always sad. The final Luke vs Vader scene is also legendary and fun to watch unfold.Overall this is among the all time great science fiction movies that is an absolute must see.

Nostalgia!,"The only reason this film has such high marks is because people have grown up on 'Star Wars'. A simple story and impressive special effects for its time seems to have had an amazing impact in its day (which is long before mine) but should in hindsight be seen in a new light. It is no coincidence that the new Star Wars films receive such low marks (even though much of the acting and special effects are better) because they can't live up to those old childhood memories. Lucas wasn't even that original, given that Star Trek (and many other science fiction films) came before this. The Star Wars films pass for their special effects and level of entertainment but are clearly over-hyped and definitely overrated..",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A worthy second (or 5th??) Star Wars installment, might be the best of the bunch.","My five children were all pre-teens when 'The Empire Strikes Back' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.It is fruitless trying to argue 'which is best' in a trilogy, because the first one, in this case 'Star Wars', starts it all and has to be the 'father'. However, an argument can be made that 'The Empire Strikes Back' (now on DVD called Episode V) is overall a better-made movie which has more excitement, and grabs your imagination,than the other two original installments (now called parts IV and VI). The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track.My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best movies of all!,"The sequel to Star Wars is argueably the best of all the Star Wars films.This is much darker than the 1st one.Look for the Super Star Destroyer,it is a awesome ship.Boba Fett makes his fist appearence here.The chase scene the M.Falcon is being chased down by the Star Destroyers and Tie Fighters is really a cool scene.I f you like the 1st Star Wars then you will love this one!Note: The special edition has added scenes,special effects,sounds,and creatures.

Fantastic Sequel,"The rebels' new base is hidden in the icy planet Hoth and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) commands a unit with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). During the investigation of a meteor crash, Luke is wounded and captured by a creature but succeeds to escape. While dying on the snow, he has a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi telling him to go to the Dagobah system to be trained by the Jedi Master Yoda. Later he is saved by Han and they are rescued in the morning by the rebels. Meanwhile Darth Vader (David Prowse) sends probe droids through the galaxy to find the location of the base. The rebels are located and they need to leave the planet under the attack of the Imperial Fleet. However Luke heads to Dagobah to find Yoda while Leia, Han, Chewbacca and C-3PO travel to the planet Bespin to meet his friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and repair the Millennium Falcon. However, they are betrayed by Lando and captured by Darth Vader. Meanwhile Luke has a premonition with his friends in danger and he decides to interrupt his training with Yoda to save them, despite the warning of Obi-Wan and Yoda. Will Luke be ready to face Darth Vader and save his friends?""The Empire Strikes Back"", later retitled ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is a fantastic sequel of Star Wars, with a great story. The plot has adventure, romance, comedy and betrayal and is engaging until the very end. The characters now are more experienced and bonded. The mannerisms of C-3PO recalls Dr. Smith, from ""Lost in Space"". This is the type of sequel that keeps the high quality of the original film. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Império Contra-Ataca"" (""The Empire Strikes Back"")",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My Favourite Film Ever,"So my next step in watching Star Wars films is the 2nd film released The Empire Strikes Back and I'm going to spoil the review for anybody watching this is my favourite film I have ever seen so expect me to be very positive about this film. The premise of the film sees Luke Skywalker travel to the planet Dagobah and learn from a Jedi Master in order to improve his skills, while Leia, Han, Chewbacca & C-3PO are on the run from The Empire with Darth Vader in charge of everything.Main Character
There is sometimes some criticism of Mark Hamill's performance in the first two Star Wars films because he does complain and wine quite a bit. However, I think this helps make this character feel interesting to me, the other two jedi's we meet in the first two films in Obi-Wan & Yoda are very wise and all knowing so easy to respect but hard to relate to. Luke is us the audience, we don't understand the teachings of the Jedi and we get frustrated easily, Luke makes mistakes as a character which makes him easier to root for as he feels very human compared to these other characters who feel like gods. This film does a great job in making Luke flawed but also making us care about him and want to see him succeed in his mission despite these flaws.Supporting Characters
As mentioned in my previous review Harrison Ford as Han Solo & Carrie Fish as Leia are brilliant supporting characters and they are great in this film together. They have so much charisma and there chemistry together is off the charts (probably due to real life chemistry), they have some of the most iconic scenes in film history together in this film and there romance really evolves in the film and feels very natural and appropriate for the two characters on screen. Now onto possibly the star of the show the character of Darth Vader, in A New Hope we are given a brief introduction to Vader but in this film he is centre stage and he is the embodiment of pure evil in this film. He is menacing and you are scared of his power as we aren't really shown that in the previous film, he is very commanding and you learn more about his character that makes him even more interesting then he was in the previous film. Frank Oz voices Yoda in the film and he was a great addition to the film, you can really see how wise Yoda is as a character and I really liked his dynamic with Luke in the film as you see two people pretty much at different points of life and how they treat things which leads to them clashing. Billy Dee Williams plays Lando Carrissian, a smuggler that are heroes meet and he also has loads of charisma and charm to him even though you can tell he maybe isn't as honest as he lets on and like Han from the previosu film he has his own motivations to help the team.Story
This film takes risks with its story by splitting the characters up into two different storylines but it really pays off. You have the slower but really interesting personal story with Luke & Yoda and you have the faster more exciting romantic story involving Han & Leia. They both mesh incredibly well and they both give an audience member different things to enjoy and it allows the pacing to feel perfect and well done. Obviously this film has some twists in it that are very well known but I wn't mention them specifically in case there is somebody who doesn't know about it, but it is all handled perfectly and really adds drama to this film but also the future films aswell that was pretty revolutionary at the time and even holds up now even though I know the twists.Script
The script for this film is so well written, the dialogue makes the characters feel so real and the drama is amped up in this one to truly make you care about the characters and the plight that they are in. The humour is good too especially with Han & Leia as it fits there characters perfectly and feels right for them and their romance. Also the twists are perfectly handled and written brilliantly to allow you to really sink them in and understand them.Style
This film's style is darker then A New Hope but it feels right as the heroes are plunged into a darker story and as the title of the film suggests the villains are all over them from very early on. In terms of action scenes The Battle of Hoth at the beginning of the film is one of my favourite battles not just in Star Wars history but in film history. Also the lightsaber battle between Vader & Luke is faster and just as personal as the one between Vader & Obi-Wan making it more exciting and a much better watch. Also John Williams score is even better in this film and really adds to the suspense and the darker story that is being told. I should also mention that I watched the newer Blu Ray version but unlike A New Hope the changes are very small and I actually thought they were fine and didn't change the film one bit.Overall
Overall, I literally struggle to find any faults with this movie. It is the perfect middle part of a trilogy and should be watched as that so watch A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back & Return Of The Jedi in a short time frame to truly appreciate the development of the characters and the story. With this being my favourite film of all time I heavily recommend this film and the other two films in the trilogy.Rating - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Even better than the first one!,"Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) face attack by the Imperial forces and its AT-AT walkers on the ice planet Hoth. While Han and Leia escape in the Millennium Falcon, Luke travels to Dagobah in search of Yoda. Only with the Jedi master's help will Luke survive when the dark side of the Force beckons him into the ultimate duel with Darth Vader (David Prowse).This has to be my favourite Star Wars movie out of them all! This movie does everything way better than the first with great character Development will all characters and the introduction of 2 new characters, a smuggler from Hans past and a badass bounty hunter. The most has great special effects and a great musical score by John Williams again! The sets are so good to look at and the characters are so much more likeable in this movie!The movie also becomes way more darker than the last one.Mark Hamill does a way better job playing Luke even becoming more likeable. Carrie Fisher is still the likeable princess from the first one. Harrison Ford is still as likeable from the first one and him and Leia relationship is way more drawn out. Chewbacca is hilarious in this movie. Billy Dee Williams is a welcomed addition to this movie! James Earl Jones is menacing Vader!Overall this is the best Star Wars movie to date!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
How do you review a cultural icon?,"This film as well as A New Hope has put me in a very very strange predicament. How exactly does one evaluate a film in which one knows the entire plot a priori, to no fault of the film. As well as a film with astounding visuals at the time, but very poorly aged visuals and shot selection today. Such is my problem with star wars as a franchise. So considering the circumstances, let me shortly say the following.Star Wars is an excellent intellectual property based on an excessively cheesy movie franchise. I feel similarly to the star wars franchise as I do the Marvel cinematic universe. They are a set of fun and entertaining family movies that can make your imagination go absolutely wild. I know I'm not alone in pretending that I was a Jedi or a Superhero when I was young. What the franchise is not is any sort of art film or strong statement about anything. It is pure fun, but perhaps better left in nostalgia than a film to come back to. As the weight of the visual technology fades, it is hard for me to justify that the average storytelling and wonderful soundtrack are enough to carry it.Conclusion: wonderful IP and universe, very cheesy film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Outstanding follow up.,"Congratulations have to go to line producer Gary Kurtz and director Irvin Kershner in pushing the production to out-perform A New Hope, even though the consequence was a film that came in massively over budget, and almost cost Lucas his hard fought independence from the Hollywood system.The plot moves quickly, from an interesting script by Leigh Bracket and Larry Kasdan, focusing on exploring two key relationships. The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.What makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill's interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor.Technically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience.Editing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky's photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway.ILM's visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following: Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along.Again, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his on–set work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt's sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.However, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure/fantasy films ever made.Congratulations to Mr Lucas for delivering a remarkable sequel, but also to Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner for having the courage to push everyone out of their comfort zones so as to reach this level of excellence.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Who's Your Daddy?,"After being abruptly evicted from his Death Star digs, Darth Vader seeks out the young rebel warrior responsible, Luke Skywalker. He has plans for the boy. Skywalker, meanwhile, leaves his friends in the middle of an Imperial invasion for a crash course in Jedi Knighthood amid a desolate swampworld with only a faultfinding green gnome for company. Can Luke complete his training before Darth reels him in?Well, no, actually. That's not the only way this middle installment of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy leaves things on a decidedly more discordant note than the previous, joyous ""Star Wars."" People call this the darkest of the original three films because it is, but ""Empire"" is the only one with an adult orientation. The characters are deepened, and our investment in them from the first film challenged by events that leave them exposed to the sort of cruelties we wrongly assumed them safe from.George Lucas deserves major praise for putting such a film together, using his well-earned profits from the first film. In essence, he was literally giving the fans back some dividends for their box office proceeds. He also took chances in terms of leaving them less happy this time, knowing the emotional payoff would have to come a film later.""Empire Strikes Back"" is thus a richer film than ""Star Wars"" emotionally, and in other ways, too. Instead of confining most of the action to the desert planet Tatoonie, the action bounces around from an ice planet to a swamp planet to the most marvelous creation of all, a city hovering high in the clouds of a gas giant, where the action culminates.Lucas adds some interesting new characters, particularly Yoda, the swamp creature Luke goes to for help, who articulates much of the philosophy and provides much of the fun in this film as voiced by Frank Oz, the guy behind (or under) Miss Piggy and later, a talented director in his own right.There's also Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, the operator of Cloud City who provides much of the needed moral shading in the film as the stars from the previous movie are all full-blown heroes now. Williams has fun schmoozing up Leia and trying to find his feet as his slick machinations leave him in ever-hotter water.The best performance in this film is Mark Hamill's as Luke. Hamill had to work harder here than he did in ""Star Wars,"" sharing all his big scenes with a Muppet and a guy with a bucket on his head. But Hamill finds the essence of a character more interesting than the naive farmboy we saw in the first film, playing Luke as confused, fearful, impetuous, and flawed in a way that makes him more likable, rather than less so. How Hamill never hit it big after his great work here is an injustice on par with Cleavon Little's lack of work after ""Blazing Saddles.""What else about this is great? The score by John Williams, introducing the recognizable ""Imperial March"" theme music as well as some rousing material during the final confrontation between Luke and Darth. The interaction between Vader and his subordinates is chokingly funny, in a way that only adds to the suspense and dread. The opening battle around the ice planet is marvelously intense, especially as witnessed from the cockpits of Rebel fighters taking on thickly-armored Imperial walkers.The returning cast except for Hamill doesn't seem as sharp this time, especially Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, so charming in ""Star Wars,"" gaunt and miserable here. Much of the whole middle section of the film is draggy and woolly, like the various silly ways the Millennium Falcon escapes Imperial pursuit and the scene in the ""cave"" that goes on much longer than it should. Even Luke's scenes with Yoda become slow and tedious with multiple viewings.The enthusiasm that makes ""Empire Strikes Back"" so beloved today is understandable. It turned ""Star Wars"" from a great film into an enjoyable franchise. But it doesn't really have the same stand-alone quality ""Star Wars"" has, needing both that earlier film and the later ""Return Of The Jedi"" to make it as great as it is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best of the original trilogy,"Empire Strikes Back is by far the best of the original trilogy. I'm sure there were plot twists before 1980, but this movie has to go down in history as the best and biggest plot twist ever with just 3 words: ""I'm your father"".Everything about this movie is better than A New Hope (and A New Hope was a 9/10 for me) including: the lightsaber battle, the special effects (which still hold up to an extent to this day), Yoda, a deeper dive into the universe through character and creature introductions, and of course more of Darth Vader. The lines quoted by Yoda throughout his sequenes are some of the best known movie quotes of all time as well. John Williams continues to deliver with his score and character themes too.

Easily One of the Best Films Ever Made,"This film is as Star Wars as Star Wars gets in that it is one of if not the best story told in the franchise. Empire Strikes Back takes everything that was good about A New Hope and just completely expands upon it. It is arguably the greatest sequel in cinematic history.Each character is given more emotional depth including Luke, Leia, Han, and even Vader this time. A New Hope is a fun movie, this movie feels more like an emotional experience in comparison. This is the first film in which the Imperial March, one of the best songs created for a movie ever is heard. Also, this movie contains probably the most shocking reveal in all of cinematic history.The sets are more grand, the effects are more spectacular, and the music is absolutely some of the best in all of Star Wars. The film sets genuinely feel completely real. From Hoth to Dagobah to Bespin the locations in this film are so incredibly detailed and well made. Dagobah especially feels like a completely different planet. None of the sets even feel like sets. They feel like real places. Also the special effects are marvelous especially for its time. The asteroid belt scene in particular is not only breathtaking to see but the music mixed in as well makes it so much fun to watch.Which brings me to the action. Much more fun and much more grand in comparison to A New Hope. The opening Hoth battle is such a great scene not only because of the special effects and the captivating action but also because of the stakes. The fact that we are following all the characters and they are all doing something makes it feel like they are actually in trouble and it makes for an engrossing scene. The fight with Luke and Vader is also a great action scene. The scene where Luke is looking for his friends and runs into Vader. The lack of music, the choreography, and all the colors work together to tell the story. One of the best set ups to a fight, like ever. The fight itself is very emotional for both characters which leads up to the big reveal at the end. Luke willingly chose death over joining Vader. It's a cliffhanger, literally.I feel like the Yoda stuff is shorter than it should be. Don't get me wrong I think the training scenes with Yoda on Dagobah are great. But, it feels too short and almost underwhelming. It starts off very funny when we meet Yoda, I love that scene after Luke crashes. I also think the dialogue between Yoda and Luke as well as Yoda and Ben is really well written. Yoda feels like a goofball at first, but quickly begins to come out as a genuine and wise character. All of those scenes are extremely quotable as well like Yoda says some really smart things. In the end it feels like Lukes training is extremely rushed and I understand it's because he chose to leave, but still I would have liked to see more. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate the scenes we did get. The tie fighter scene is awesome and I think about Yoda's quotes to Luke on a daily basis.Overall, The Empire Strikes Back is honestly a masterpiece of cinema. It is one of the best movies ever made without a doubt. The characters all have so much more depth to them. It completely steps it up in comparison to A New Hope. In terms of the character development, special effects, script, and execution. There is never a dull moment, and it is filled with iconic moments. The whole third act is so emotionally powerful. The scene where they lose Han, and then the Vader and Luke scene afterwards. Such well shot, emotional and beautifully filmed scenes. It ends with one of the best cliffhangers ever. Everyone is on a low note, and no one knows what's gonna happen next. The Empire Strikes Back is nothing shy of a masterpiece. *chefs kiss*I like New Hope better because it's much more simple and fun. Revenge of the Sith is my favorite, easily.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Why can't they make them like this any more?,"From it's opening scenes on the bleak ice-ball that is the planet Hoth, to its exciting finale on the cloud city of Bespin, The Empire Strikes back is a worthy sequel to the magnificent Star Wars. Taking over the directorial reins from George Lucas, Irvin Kershner steers the movie into darker territory to deliver a more mature movie than its predecessor.The Empire is still licking its wounds after the destruction of the Death Star, and evil Darth Vader is intent on finding the rebels responsible for destroying his new toy. Luke's aim, meanwhile, is to become a fully fledged Jedi knight, whilst Han sets himself a more difficult target: he plans on getting into Leia's knickers.With more incredible FX packed action scenes than you can shake a light-sabre at (highlights include the fantastic battle on Hoth, a chase scene through an asteroid field, and the Luke/Darth light-sabre duel), and THAT moment where we learn the truth about Luke's father, it's no surprise to find that this episode is often said to be the best of the series.

Entertaining,"Back in 1977 I really enjoyed the first film in the franchise, but the hype was so enormous when this came out I decided to avoid it for a bit. I finally caught up with it in 1997 by which time Time had sadly caught up with it too and wreaked its usual damage. Then it was a case of Roll Over Harryhausen, tell Jim Henson the news.Story has imaginative intergalactic politics and battles amidst a plethora of gormless soap and stereotypes. To a kid it would be marvellous stuff to watch and as an adult to revel in through rose-tinted glasses, but coming at it as an adult I see it through the Empire's, sorry, Emperor's New Clothes and in the Altogether. It's relentlessly inventive but not in my top 1000 films of all time. Favourite bits: Luke yakking to Kermit about the Force; the flying city where expense or common sense is no object; the love affair between the Princess and the Scoundrel; the remarkably obvious pay-off, hyped at the time as something groundbreaking.The first cut is nearly always the deepest - long live the brash first film, this sequel is entertaining and nonsensical, an eminent time-passer. The first was a monument to Luck, the second a monument to Hype; I love fantasy movies of all eras and genres but mainly those not surrounded by heaps of hype swallowed by millions of people, it's a real barrier to my complete enjoyment of anything. This is a watchable movie but only a must-watch movie to see for what digital cgi cartoonery has done to the movies, and to us.

Star rating: 2 out of 5,"Star Wars - Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, rather suffers from 'middle child' syndrome.  Being the second of the original trilogy it has neither the fresh appeal of originality that marked its predecessor, nor is it required to reach any conclusions.  The result is a film with decidedly minimalist plot development.  The Empire is still hunting down the Rebel Alliance, Luke Skywalker is still training to be a Jedi knight, and. . . . .. . . . . well, that's pretty much it.  Instead of a solid storyline, the viewer is treated to 122 minutes of cobbled-together battle sequences (although watch for the impressive Imperial walker troop carriers, which resemble out-sized armoured elephants).The characters however, have developed considerably since the first film - it's nice to see loyal Chewbacca show a sense of humour.  The sexual tension between Princess Leia and Han Solo is palpable. . . . . . . . . . until they kiss (which looks about as exciting as snogging a shoe).  In a clever twist, Yoda the Jedi Master is not a Hercules-type warrior, but a wizened green dwarf; the characterisation would have worked even better had he not had a voice a-la-Sesame Street.In the Special Edition of Episode IV, A New Hope, there is an obvious and uncomfortable chasm between those scenes which have been unaltered since they were shot in 1977 and those that were digitally re-mastered and altered 20 years later.  Fortunately the same is not the case in Episode V.  But why was it necessary to darken the picture contrast so drastically?For fanatics The Empire Strikes Back is of course an integral component of the Star Wars dynasty.  Viewers with a more casual interest in the story could probably get away with skipping this installment altogether.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Iconic,"By far my favorite Star Wars movie. Contains the iconic parts of the saga, for example the reveal of Darth Vader. The settings for the entire movie are outstanding from Hoth to Cloud City. As always the score from John Williams was on point more so than ever in my opinion. The movie is set between episodes 4 and 6 doing a perfect job of not only carrying through the success of the first movie and surpassing it in my opinion but also does an amazing job of setting up episode 6 to conclude the trilogy without leaving an annoying cliffhanger at the last minute. The characters really establish themselves with more famous moments such as Han Solo's ""I know"" line towards the end of the movie and we get to see Luke's agony as he hangs from cloud city.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Slightly better than the Original,"The first Star Wars movie, is a Sci-fi and cinematic masterpiece. But where Star Wars capitalized, Empire Strikes Back took it to the next level.Here's what I think of the movie:Story - I'm pretty sure we all know the story of Star Wars. A Galactic Empire is empowering the galaxy, and a Rebel Alliance tries to stop it. Today, it's sort of a cliché plot but back then, it was imagination skyrocketing into the heavens. Now, thats the plot of Star Wars. The story spans from a battle on the frigid planet of Hoth, to a space dogfight in an asteroid field, to Cloud City where the greatest plot twist in the history of cinema, is reveled. The film ends on a cliffhanger which leads to Return of the Jedi. I'm not going to spoil it, but I don't think I would need to because I'm willing to bet that about 99.99% of people have already seen this movie anyway(to that .01%, where the hell have you been?).-Rating 10/10Characters - The characters from the original movie are back, including Luke, Han, Leia, C3P0 and R2D2, and of course, Darth Vader. But the films also introduces some new characters as well, including Lando, The Emperor, Boba Fett, and Yoda. The Emperor doesn't really play a big part in the movie(I think he only has like, 10 lines) and Boba's name is never really mentioned. However, Yoda plays a big part by teaching Luke the ways of the force, and Lando, who is Han's old pal, plays a big part by betraying our heroes and giving them to Vader. Of course, he's still a good guy, he had to hand them over. Overall, I'd say the characters are still great.Rating 10/10Visuals - This was back when Star Wars movies didn't rape the fabric of CGI. So what you see in the movie were real things. The Walkers, asteroids, X-Wings, Tie Fighters, everything. The original Star Wars set the standards for Special Effects with the light sabers, Death Stars blowing up and everything. Empire Strikes Back isn't any different. The Effects are still awesome and look great.-Rating 10/10Music - The Star Wars theme is (of course) still here and it's one of the most recognized themes in cinema. You only need to hear a second of the Star Wars theme, and you'll know what it is. Like any other Star Wars film, the music is composed by John Williams, so everything is played by an orchestra. Even though it's great the here the Star Wars theme in all it's nostalgic glory, the music thats played is still just as great.-Rating 10/10Overall - Empire Strikes back is my favorite Star Wars film and is one of my favorite movies. If I had to make a Top 10 list of my favorite movies, about 15 movies would be tied for the #1 spot, and this would be one of them.

Best.Movie.Ever,"Wow, what a film, I never knew that I could love a film soooo much in my life, but here it is, my favourite film of all time, the one that made me love Star Wars. First of all, the acting in this film is amazing, People who watched the film didn't know that actually most of Harrison Ford's lines were improvised, which is awesome. Carrie Fisher as Leia was great, especially when she talks to Ford, Frank Oz as Yoda is great, way better than CGI Yoda from the prequels. Luke as the hero was great, but I like how they show Luke as the hero, but he still loses, which brings me to Darth Vader. He is by far one of the best villains of all movie history, he is menacing, mysterious, then when he tells Luke, ""I am your father"", that completely changes how we first watched A New Hope. Effects are good for that time, also two others characters that I need to mention are Boba Fett and Lando Calrissian, these two characters really showed me that this is such a great movie franchise, Lando with huge charisma, and Boba being silent badass, so out of ten I would give this incredible movie a 10/10.

The Son,"The SonI am convinced that movies are about other movies more than life. The original ""Star Wars"" was a success in my opinion because it had three things: a collection of images from other films, distinctly referencing them. Some were film- schoolish like the Kurosawa quotes. But most were like what Kurosawa himself referenced: already deeply embedded visual touchstones, not having lost their power in becoming clichés. These were collected in one large form, the Flash Gordan form let's call it, which all of us slightly knew. It could be recalled with enough familiarity to register but not enough to set expectations, so Lucas could fill the bucket with whatever he found and liked. a notion of a complete, understandable cosmology. Its the noir notion that laws of the universe exist and cannot be seen, and if they could they wouldn't be comprehensible. This notion is deep in film, so deep that when a movie comes along that posits a cosmology that is whole, and revealable, it shocks. What that movie did was give us enough of a glimpse into this to believe that we could understand the world, at least THIS world of the ""galaxy far away."" Remember when that original came out? The images were impressible, but what people talked about wasn't what they saw, but about how the world worked. It settled first in an ersatz religion among geeky kids and now has been swallowed by the ""simple"" US religions, and its presidential representative. the notion of a quest. Its an old form, but cast in the above noted situation, it takes new power. The traditional form, the Goethe-Lytton form was there to remind and reveal mysteries. Here it is clearer, to explain. There was a lowbrow professor at the time of a women's college that a TeeVee interviewer made popular. It was sort of a metaquest. This simple man said that we could actually understand the nature of trying to understand nature. It was a lucky break for Lucas, because it meshed with this shocking notion of a grand cosmology that we know our hero (check out the name: ""sky walker"") will grasp, master and show us.That was the first film. A huge success, just huge. It did change many things, but from my perspective the key thing was how it reset that great American invention of noir, as important as jazz, and liberty which form a sort of trilogy of contradictory, three-way tension.Okay. Now the second big Ted idea, the necessity for the equal size of steps in abstraction when you have two steps. It seems this is hardwired in the brain, a sort of human quantum mechanics. If you look back along the abstraction, say a cartoon in a cartoon, the distance between the two will be precisely the same as the surrounding cartoon.So, when they made the second Star Wars movie, they could reference the previous one in the way that it referenced its cinematic background. It had a writer in Kasden who knew how to do this. And it had a director in Lucas' film school teacher who did also. Neither had a huge hit other than this because it was such a cool setup, having such a thing to build on.You'll read lots about trying to humanize, and how faces were used. But all that is simply in the service of abstracting closer to us from the original, in equal portion. This is the son. Why did the franchise fail after this? Because there was no step left to abstract to and maintain the brand.(This comment is a replacement of one deleted for unknown reasons. This was requested by a reader.)Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not as good,"My preference goes Return of the Jedi, A new Hope, then this one. I found the characters had better chemistry and the dialogue seemed more natural in the films of 77,83. This one I know the director was attempting to humanize the characters but thought the dialogue was forced and it lacked chemistry.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
still the best star wars movie ever made,"And one of the best movies in general, it's better than a new hope in every way possible and it's one of the strongest sequels in the cinema.the scenes with luke and yoda are some of the best in the saga and yoda's way of teaching luke is really beautiful, it's as much as a master apprentice as it can get.and my god that third act is just iconic and the ending is so magical, peaceful and sad at the same time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Revenge is Sweet,"This, is one of those times where it's great when the bad guys win. I had grown up watching old westerns and kiddie movies, where it was all good guys win at the end.

Even better directing, it's the greatest space movie pretty much ever made.It's only better because ""Star Wars"" set this one up perfectly. And it allowed a suspenseful ""Return of the Jedi"", which needed all it could get, because it was the worst of the Original's, but still pretty darn good. Overall even though it was made in the 80's it was still captivating to a boy used to computer graphics. The absolute best part was the final lightsaber battle between Vader and Luke where... well, I won't spoil it for those who haven't heard the line.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

What is going on inside that man.. ""A modern age Genius"". How does he come up with all that weird but super-cool stuff! And John Williams music..!! The themes and their crafted development to the story context.. wow.. Why he didn't get the academy award, still remains one of the biggest mysteries to me, up to this day..

"Action, Adventure, But Lack Of ""Epic""","In terms of action and adventure, ""Empire Strikes Back"" is a rousing success. There are enough space flights, phaser blasts, and lightsaber wielding to satisfy the visual effects junkies. The only thing missing, however, is that ""sense of something epic"" inherent in its original predecessor.In ""Episode V"", as it has come to be known, the rebels are still being pursued by the Empire, this time on the ice planet Hot. The first half of the film focuses on those battles, primarily featuring Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). A new character in Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is also introduced, though his loyalties are very much in question. The second half deals more with Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) beginning steps to becoming a Jedi. After the death (in Part IV) of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke goes to continue his training with Yoda, an enigmatic little green character seemingly older than time itself. The film's climax brings forth the long-awaited meeting of Luke and Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones), as well as a startling (if now clichéd) revelation that sets the stage for the final chapter.Though a good movie in its own right, I always felt as if this one lagged behind the original in certain key areas. A recent watching confirmed this. I think the ""trouble"" stems from the fact that ""Empire"" is much more of an action film than a drama. Whereas ""New Hope"" was so incredibly genre-diverse, ""Empire"" takes that same cast of characters and instead relies a bit too much on laser blasts and space maneuvers. It doesn't help that certain scenes (inside the ""asteroid""; Lando's scenes) just feel a little draggy...like filler.Overall, though, this is still a very watchable film that keeps the main storyline pushing forward. For special effects or action/adventure buffs, this one will stand out. For others, it may fall just a tick behind the original.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Overrated,"I decided to watch this trilogy with a completely open mind to see what the fuss was all about. I was rather embarrassed by the fact that I had never seen any of these movies which were heralded as great cinematic classics. Instead of the masterpiece I was promised however , I was left with a great mediocrity. The characters were barely 2 dimensional , the plot was riddled with holes and horribly rushed and the dialogue was cheesy . Episode V was perhaps the least painful to watch but still isn't close to being good. I don't know if it's a case of a movie aging very badly but I can't for the life of me understand the allure of it. To each their own , I guess.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Definitely one of the greatest movies of all time,"It's really sad to see what star wars has become these days..unoriginal, uninspiring, lacking passion..I can go on and on and on but I just don't have the stomach for it anymore..but this movie right here, star wars empire strikes back, is just so masterfully inspiring and masterfully done. The fact that George Lucas did this movie on his own with his own money should tell you everything you need to know about how amazingly tenacious he is, not only that, he brought the characters to life..making them memorable, believable and most importantly relatable. Yes it's an old movie, yes it feels out dated...but trust me, if you look really past that and focus on its level of storytelling and the amazing writing of the story, you will understand why this movie has a rating of 8.7...most movies today and even in the last decade haven't even gotten close to that. Give it a shot...you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Big Improvement Over The First Star Wars,"Although called ""Episode V,"" this was second movie in the Star Wars 6-part installment and I've always thought one of the better entries in the series.If you watch the first Star Wars and then this one, you'll immediately see a vast improvement in the special-effects department. There is a much more polished look to this one, and improved sound In fact, the DVD transfer is outstanding considering the age of this film.While the first Star Wars was a bit subdued, this one picks up the action right from the start, although lulls are really appreciated because the first 40 minutes are pretty hectic. The most notable of those scenes are the gigantic robots which were awesome when this film first came out, and are still pretty good. The movie calms down after that opening land war but retains the viewer's interest with other things.The second half of the movie features two stories going on at once: the battle in space with most of the cast involved, and ""Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a swampland involved in his training sessions with the Master Yoda.Some of the movie's dialog is still corny, especially between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with their love-hate relationship, but it's not overdone. What is overdone is constant bleating noises emanating from ""Chewbacca,"" the wookie. That sheep-in-heat noise can get annoying after awhile. The ""Rambo"" action continues as it did in the first film, with the villains firing everything at our heroes and never hitting them. Ludicrous, but part of the deal. Those things you just put up with as the film, overall, delivers another interesting adventure, far more than the first Star Wars and leading up to the next one, which was even better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

One for the ages,"As great as the original Star Wars may be, The Empire Strikes Back remains the best film in the series. As the years pass, the real achievement of Empire only grows. While the original film has grown somewhat dated in appearance, and Return of the Jedi feels a bit silly now, Empire has maintained remarkable staying power. The effects in the film feel as fresh now as they did in 1980, and as importantly the story and tone of the film still hold an ominous feel and lend the series the grandeur that made it so lasting. Without Empire, Star Wars would have been remembered but not nearly in the same way. Everything that was begun in Star Wars was expanded and improved upon here, right down to the score Remember, this was the movie that introduced the now-famous and ridiculously overplayed Imperial March composed by John Williams. And virtually every scene is now iconic--the Imperial Walkers in the snow, Luke's training in the swamp, the asteroid field chase of the Millennium Falcon, the Cloud City, Luke's lightsaber battle with Vader. When I think of ""Star Wars"", most of the images that come to mind first are from Empire. The colors and textures of the film are so sharp and rich.A truly majestic film. One of the great visual statements in the history of movies, and one of the most successful realizations of a movie vision we will ever see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
10/10 Masterpiece of Cinema,"The Empire Strikes Back is a sequel that matures itself from its very family friendly predecessor while still being a good film for children, it is a classic of cinema and defines sequels, it manages to outdo the film that changed the way films are made and defined the science fiction genre. It creates mature feelings that may go over younger viewers heads with a dreadful feeling as if they have no hope while still maintaining a hopeful feeling of rebellion. The Empire Strikes Back is the 3rd greatest film in my opinion and is a must watch film for anyone. The literal Definition of Absolute perfection of cinema.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Difficult to see all the fuss and love nowadays as much as those present for its inauguration did.,"Good lord, what spell does George Lucas have everyone under? This is one of the highest ranked films on the website; it's regarded as one of the greatest sequels of all time; it's on most lists entitled the 'greatest motions pictures' of the respective genre; it's a film nearly everyone likes - and yet it failed, for me, to do any of these things justice upon recently seeing it for the first time. Perhaps you had to be there; to see it on opening night at a time when there was no such thing as the Internet on which you could download and/or watch special teasers or trailers; at a time when the studio were not able to give you the first five minutes as an appetiser to get you to see it; at a time when the only manner in which you could discuss the up and coming franchise episodes were face-to-face and not on message boards. Although it's too bad it isn't more like that nowadays.Maybe it's futile criticising it now, but at the end of the day, it's still just a film. Perhaps you really did have to be there on opening night with no knowledge of what awaited you, preparing yourself to be propelled into a world of monsters, space travel and aliens as you left your brain at the door. But I do think most people rate the film based on childhood experiences more than the film itself  they don't ask themselves the question 'How good was the film?', they ask themselves 'How happy was I as a kid when I first saw this?'.For the record, I liked the previous episode. I thought it was good fun and relatively light-hearted with a sense of vision going for it throughout. You really believed Lucas had an idea and desperately wanted to follow through on his vision. This twinned with the scope of ideas to do with space travel and the structuring of space stations, look of attire and general mise-en-scene enforces the evidence Lucas loved an idea to the point it was an obsession, an obsession he let everyone else into and love in equal measure.Alas, Episode V entitled 'The Empire Strikes Back' from 1980 is actually quite silly and removes any feeling or excitement the prior episode may have instilled into one. Its overall idea is that the young and upcoming hero in Luke Skywalker (Hamill) is to go off and train to take his skills to the next level and become a Jedi whilst friends Han Solo (Ford) and co. are chased down by the evil forces led by Darth Vader (Prowse/Jones).'Fine' you think, this may well be more interesting now that the introductions and general establishment of good versus evil has been dealt with; there also seems to be a self discovery journey going on. But if anything, the film is less interesting than the first one, particularly after about an hour after which it transcends into a bunch of slightly interesting scenes set on space ships and odd jungle infested planets. Once all that has happened, Vader gets some hired guns to find the rebels and more stuff happens that just has you passively sit there and watch it all unfold.Maybe it's that I cannot just let myself go, but I had no problem with the 1st and 4th episodes in terms of narrative, which were actually quite interesting as this broad and quite epic setting was used to transfer good and evil across a galaxy. In this one, there doesn't feel like anything at stake. The film's protagonist Luke is safe and sound on a jungle planet with Yoda, being taught what he needs to know, so he's fine, whereas Solo and co. are hopping around trying to dodge the forces of evil and the problem is you never feel any connection to them. Why should you feel any towards an annoying, big, hairy creature; daft comic relief robots and an underdeveloped, expressionless and somewhat empty headed woman who goes by the name Leia (Fisher).But these things are the bigger picture. The film has all number of frustrations going on at spaced intervals. Of course, Solo and co. never get hit by any of the laser beams and they can hide in that meteor storm nice and easily but again, criticising it seems futile. One thing I noticed on several occasions was that everyone in the Millennium Falcon kept talking over each other, which also annoyed me and the heavy handed catalyst which pushes Luke off into his training with Yoda is a near death experience on ice planet Hoth, during which he nearly freezes to death amongst being eaten.Towards the end of the film, Luke will be having a showdown with Vader after which a famous line is uttered. All well and good but Luke doesn't go down into the bowels to fight Vader because it's the realistic choice, he goes down there because we want him to  we want him to fight and the story demands he put his new Jedi skills into practice so that all can see how much he's really learnt. This is after the film goes needlessly 'dark' for one scene involving the freezing/supposed death of a main character and no, the film is 'dark' for that one scene; not from the start and throughout, it's still that laser dodging, fast talking, monster eliminating 'fun' the prior film was. All in all, The Empire Strikes Back is underwhelming and viewing it now makes it seems quite silly more than anything. Perhaps proof 'event cinema' can and never will withstand the true test of time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the Star Wars Movies.,"Empire Strikes Back is not only a great sequel to one of the best science Fiction movies ever made but its probably one of the best sequels ever made.

Top Tier Cinema,"What can I say about ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that hasn't already been said? This film takes everything great about ""A New Hope"" and elevates it. The cinematography, the setting, the characters, the story, everything is crisp and succinct in ""Empire"". There were multiple times (3 to be exact) that I had full body chills, all because of the brilliant marriage of story, score and performance.This movie shows that the ""galaxy far, far away"" is more than just Tatooine and the Death Star. From Hoth to Dagpbah to Cloud City, ""Empire"" helps expand the Star Wars Universe. By traveling to different parts of the galaxy, the film physically separates the three leads. Even though apart, their connection remains strong with the force (and their incredible chemistry) binding them together. Their individual journeys have purpose and the addition of new supporting characters (Yoda, Lando, etc.) are legendary.If this film failed, Star Wars would not be the legendary franchise that it is today. Simply put, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is top tier cinema.Additional Note: The three ""chill-worthy"" moments were 1. Yoda raising the ship. 2. THE reveal. 3.

Unlike Father & Son,"Back in the 80's, people were very excited for the release of The Empire Strikes Back, the much-awaited sequel to the phenomenal Star Wars. But, I can imagine, they were also wondering if it would be as good as Star Wars. No, it's not. It's much better. There's more action, the characters become richer and we are introduced to new ones. Thankfully, Lucas backed down in directing and/or writing the film.Considered as the best film among the Trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back starts with the whole gang staying at a Rebel base in the ice planet of Hoth. After almost getting mauled by a Wampa Beast, Luke gets a message from Obi-Wan Kenobi to go to the Planet of Dagobah and look for a Jedi Master named Yoda. The Imperial Army arrives and tries to destroy the base, but the Rebels have already escaped, with Luke accompanied by R2-D2 goes to Dagobah. The Battle of Hoth is easily my favorite action scene in the whole Trilogy.While Han, Leia and Chewbacca are hiding from the Imperial army that's chasing them, Luke meets the 800 year-old Jedi Master Yoda. Full of wisdom and a funny way of talking, Yoda trains Luke to be a real Jedi and teaches him the ways of a Jedi. Almost nothing happens in the middle of the film, except for great character development and lots of intelligent dialogue. It manages to keep us interested and excited without having too many action scenes. We get to know more about all the characters, including the villains and new characters that we are introduced to.We then meet Lando Calrissian who lives in Bespin, a city that floats among the clouds. Lucas hardly touched this masterpiece, but he still added some more striking visuals, most of which aren't unnecessary. More windows are added to the buildings in Bespin, adding lot more light and life to the settings. The visuals added aren't a bother anymore, and for once probably made a scene look better.Han and Leia don't trust Lando, to which we soon find out that they were right about their feelings toward him. Luke forsees that they're in trouble and goes to make sure that they're all right. As Han Solo is about to be frozen, Leia finally admits to Han that she loves her. To which Han replies with, ""I know."" It's an incredibly touching and emotional scene, where things are just about to get worse.As Luke arrives at Bespin, he encounters Darth Vader, to which father and son fight. Quite possibly the best Lightsaber fight in all the Star Wars films, the scene is filled with so much emotion and a shocking revelation. Luke sacrifices his own life rather than join the dark side, and is saved by Leia and Chewbacca, along with Lando, after much threats from Chewy. The film ends on such a downbeat note, keeping a cliffhanger for the final movie in the Trilogy.The characters have yet to face another adventure, and learn more from each other as the Imperial is yet to be beaten and Solo to be rescued. It's not a happy ending, or should I say, a beginning for the characters as what the future holds from them is yet to be known. It shouldn't be a suprrise from anyone that The Empire Strikes Back is considered by many as the best of the Trilogy, because the film is a great stepping-stone for the characters we've grown to love in the first film and introduces us to new ones that we easily grow to love and care for. That's what makes Star Wars a great Trilogy in the first place: it's the characters we remember. Not the visuals.10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Best Star wars movie ever.,"Empire strikes back is the best star wars movie because it does everything sequel should do. She expands the star wars world and teaches us more about it. There are good actors and George Lucas is the director and writer in this film. In my opinion, this is the best acting star wars movie. She is also so much different from New Hope. When New hope was a happy and bright movie, Empire strikes back was dark and not afraid to do something new and dark. Also this is the first movie that Yoda is in. Special affect in this film is amazing during the 1980s, everything that happens in space is amazing and the practical affect in this film is gg.

Probably one of the most influential movies on my life,"ESB is one of the best science fiction movies of all time. In most circles, there tend to be a division between 'regular' movies and science fiction ones, but the Empire Strikes Back not only wrote the importance of the previously establish Star Wars saga into history, but borough the Joneses and Kims and N'Danou's and Guptas and everyone else from all over the world a re-lived curiosity about a genre that often is exclusively reserved to geeks, gamers, and goblins. The first star wars movie was a feat in special effects and something quite new. The Empire Strikes back, however, drew us into a new world with an amazing conviction. We were all so very much standing next to Luke and Han, so that they have almost helped share their world with us, but also influence popular culture today in a somewhat surrealistic concept, where the actors/actresses step out of the TV/silver screen and dictate the 'real' world, using their 'fantasy' world to justify for their candor - in an almost 'emperor's new clothes' fashion. Only the greatest movies have the ability to enmesh reality and the fiction on the screen. Lord of the Rings did it, Hitchcock did it, and Lucas did it!

The Best Star Wars and One of the Best Films Ever Made,"It took many years and many viewings before I could say that I liked this film better than A New Hope. But careful examination tells all - by every conceivable measure this is a better picture. The characters are more fully developed, Vader is even more evil, the score gives us the chilling Vader theme and the story is more interesting. Now that the six films are complete, The Empire Strikes Back is even more compelling and interesting than it was before we knew its Big Secret.All great heroes are flawed, and Luke Skywalker is no exception. Empire reveals to us in full that the inner battle he will have to fight is worse than any enemy he will face. As we meet for the first time Yoda, the wise Jedi master (we find out in Sith why he is on this jungle planet), we learn what a Jedi is, what his responsibility is and just how difficult that life will be. Luke, however, wants immediate gratification - he wants to help and wants revenge.The film cuts back and forth between Han Solo and Leia's pursuit by Vader and Luke's training and ultimately leads to the greatest scene of the six films, the epic light saber battle between Luke and Vader. And, if you are one of the 12 people on the planet who do not know the outcome, the less said the better.Empire rightly holds a place in the IMDb top 10, combining Action-Adventure, space opera and even the best elements of a super-hero film, into an infinitely watchable, entertaining movie. **** out of ****.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Possibly The Best,"After the sensation that Star Wars was, it would seem impossible to make a worthy follow up but somehow Lucas and his team did. In fact, there's a strong argument to be made that Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back even surpassed its predecessor and is the best of the franchise/hexalogy.

"Darker, more fluid advancement in the story line but not necessarily better","George Lucas' 'Star Wars' trilogy is the greatest fantasy story in all of film history. Yes, even better than the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. 'Lord of the Rings' is fine work but the characters aren't as well developed as in 'Star Wars' and they are too long. Also, each 'Star Wars' film stands out better than each 'Lord of the Rings' film. Three chapters in 'Lord of the Rings' is one big movie while 'Star Wars' is a space western, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is a dark, attractive and Gothic work of art and 'Return of the Jedi' is like a Disney film. Each has their own personality. As far as trilogies go altogether, 'The Godfather' films will always be the greatest in movie history'.I love 'The Empire Strikes Back' but I can't go along with the assertion that it is better than 'Star Wars'. I was one of those people that saw 'Star Wars' every weekend for a year when I was 11 and 12 years when a child's admission was only 50 cents to a dollar. There was such a magnificent freshness to 'Star Wars' that audiences couldn't get enough and when adjusted for inflation, 'Star Wars' is the second biggest box office film is history, second only to 1939's 'Gone with the Wind'. Meaning that these two films sold the most tickets in motion picture history.'Star Wars' even created the entire concept of the modern day blockbuster and influenced hundreds of films after it, is the biggest movie in the history of popular culture and created a new religion. A recent poll in Britain asked people to identify their religion and a substantial portion of them wrote in ""Jedi Knight"".'The Empire Strikes Back' does advance the story line forward greatly, has a convincing and blossoming love story between Han Solo and Pricess Leia and gives us the showdown we want. It also introduces us to the legendary Yoda and a new key player in Lando Calrissian and has some breath taking special effects. But 'The Empire Strikes Back' owes its success to 'Star Wars' but has to be given credit for the fact that it teaches people, especially the young, that the good guys don't always win and that the fight for what's right sometimes seems impossible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Bigger and To Some Better Sequel,"The Empire Strikes Back (1980)**** (out of 4)The second film of the original trilogy has the Empire forcing their vengeance as Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) begins his Jedi training with Yoda while Hans Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca and the gang try to get to Darth Vadar.George Lucas directed the original STAR WARS in 1977, which was a tremendous hit with both fans and critics. He basically took a ""B"" movie idea, something you'd see at a Saturday matinée and made it into a high-quality picture. This sequel had Lucas turning the directing duties over to Irvin Kershner and the end result certainly raises it to an ""A"" movie and one that many fans believe is the greatest of the series. I'm not going to lie, I somewhat enjoy the original a tad bit more but that's not to say this is a bad movie. Far from that.What's rather amazing is the fact that the producers, director and screenwriters simply could have given us the same film again but instead they decided to make it much bigger, more darker and I'd argue they really wanted to blow the original out of the water. The film once again benefits from some terrific special effects, a rousing score from John Williams and there's no question that visually the film is a lot more impressive than the original.You've also got the cast back together with both Hamill and Fisher once again delivering the goods but also Billy Dee Williams and Alec Guinness in a bit part. Once again it's Harrison Ford who easily steals the film with his comic timing and just that hero persona that shines through. Plus, it's just magic seeing him and Chewbacca work together.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is considered one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made and it's hard to argue with that.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
LemonKnight: The Empire Strikes Back Review,"In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is Star Wars at its best and is a groundbreaking movie and a near perfect sequel. It is very enjoyable to watch but is also incredibly overrated. The Empire Strikes is no where near perfection and definitely not the best film ever made like many people said. Although, I do agree that this is George Lucas Masterpiece.7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
o v e r r a t e d,"I think I just found the most overrated movie in mankind's history.It's totally a mystery how grown up people can enjoy Star Wars. I think it just comes from nostalgia.When I criticize this movie, for example, ""the plot was so simple and stupid"" or "" the creatures were created in a very unrealistic and ridiculous way,"" they always say to me, ""c'mon, it's a movie for children.""
But if this is a children's movie, why you guys are so triggered when someone doesn't like this movie? Deep down, you all know that this movie is totally crap, but just can't admit it to yourselves.By the way, I have to say that Chewbacca's voice is the most irritating voice I've ever heard. It literally raped my ears for 2 hours long.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The most highly anticipated sequel of all time,"And damn if it didn't deliver the goods and a helluvalot more. It is so dark in theme it almost enters horror flick territory and that is brilliance in and of itself to go from one extreme to the other so fluidly and poetically. It worked in a way that The Temple of Doom just didn't with moviegoers. I suppose that was due in part to the cool suspenseful plot developments, particularly Yoda, Han and Leia's budding romance, but largely due to the Earth-shattering ""the world is not flat it's round"" surprise ending. I would bet when George Lucas wrote that scene down on paper he must have been either laughing maniacally and saying ""Nobody could ever have seen that coming in two billion light years!"" or crying with joy all the while with the one idea that ""This will be so golden that it will be remembered til the end of time and even after that."" As Hamill said so eloquently, ""In the Empire Strikes Back, everyone has problems. Luke has problems, Leia has problems, they turned Han into a coffee table!"" I must also include Silent Bob's quote ""She says 'I love you.' and like a pimp he says 'I know'."" It was the equivalent of dropping burning napalm on the audience. They must have been more stunned than people leaving the theaters after seeing the Exorcist for the first time. It was pure 100% movie magic and worthy of the original in every aspect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The darkest and best of the original trilogy,"One of the rare sequels which manages to surpass the original, The Empire Strikes Back is an all-time classic. A much more personal tale, this film is really all about the journey of young Luke Skywalker. A New Hope followed Skywalker as he became involved in the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Here the rebellion is put on the back burner. This is less the story of a grand rebellion and more the story of one young man's growth as he continues to fulfill his destiny.We pick up with the rebels in hiding on a secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. All the familiar figures from last time around are here, including Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. And Luke Skywalker is here as well and it is Skywalker whom Darth Vader seems most interested in finding. Last time out Vader and the Empire were simply interested in wiping out the mostly anonymous rebels. Now, Vader has taken a personal interest in young Skywalker. The movie kicks into high gear as the Empire locates the rebel base and a great battle ensues. The rebels are forced to flee their base and here our heroes go off in different directions.Guided by the spirit of former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness in what is basically a cameo role) Luke Skywalker heads for the distant swampy planet of Dagobah where he is to be trained by the old Jedi master Yoda. Soon to be one of the most beloved characters in the series, Yoda is a 900-year old, two feet tall, green alien creature. The performances of puppeteer Frank Oz as Yoda and Mark Hamill as Skywalker are crucial here. Were the performances lacking audiences might have found it hard to believe these scenes where the young Jedi trainee converses and interacts with the rather odd little creature. But Hamill and Oz pull it off well. On Dagobah Luke (and the audience) learn much about the Force and the ways of the Jedi. In the original film the only Jedi we saw, Obi-Wan Kenobi was a rather mysterious figure. Now some light is shed on exactly who the Jedi are and what is required to become one.While Luke trains on Dagobah, Han Solo and Princess Leia are sidetracked on their journey to meet up with the rest of the rebels. Harrison Ford is terrific again playing Solo as he has the ultra-confident wiseguy role down pat. Carrie Fisher is again strong in the role of Leia, who drops some of the pretense of the last film and begins to give in to her rather obvious feelings for the swashbuckling Solo. Eventually Han and Leia make their way to Cloud City where we are introduced to another new character in the saga, Han's old friend Lando Calrissian. Han and Leia don't quite trust Lando and it soon becomes apparent that things in Cloud City are not quite what they seem. Sensing his friends are in danger Luke Skywalker leaves Dagobah to attempt to rescue them.Skywalker arrives in Cloud City to meet his destiny. Han, Leia and the rest of the characters fade into the background as the climax, much as the entire film, will be all about Luke Skywalker. Where the original Star Wars ended with an epic space battle, here everything leads up to a thrilling one-on-one showdown capped by one of the most jaw-dropping revelations ever seen in film.Some will say the ending of The Empire Strikes Back leaves the audience hanging. It is true there is not a clearly defined traditional ending as in the original film. But the ending here is powerful in its own way. It leaves you in great suspense, eagerly awaiting the inevitable conclusion to the saga. The film is not truly self-contained, it requires the knowledge of what has come before and the expectation of what will come after. It is by not going for the easy Hollywood ending that The Empire Strikes Back truly triumphs.Taken on its own merits The Empire Strikes Back can be said to even surpass the original Star Wars. The acting performances are again first-rate. Yoda is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable new character. In playing Lando Calrissian, Billy Dee Williams gives us someone well worth rooting for. Or against, we're not quite sure. The John Williams score, including the famed spine-chilling Imperial March, is magnificent. The visuals are dazzling, as would be expected. And most importantly we have a truly great story. The Empire Strikes Back, much more so than A New Hope, is Luke Skywalker's movie. It is fascinating to watch his journey as he moves towards fulfilling his ultimate destiny.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Clive Revile has been entirely cut out, and an improved holographic projection of Ian has been added along with expanded dialog.

The dialogue is still not great, but that was to be expected.Plus? We are introduced in much more detail to ""The Force"", expands the Universe to places beyond ""The Rebels"" and ""The Empire"", the score is still awesome and the action gets more diverse and less repetetive (although, it can get a bit boring here and there, it's not even close to the first one).

Simply the Best and Endlessly Rewatchable,"First of all, this is not just my all-time favourite sequel but my all-time favourite film. It thoroughly deserves that title because I consider it nothing less than a masterpiece. It takes everything great about the original and simply improves on it, a task many would've seemed to be impossible.With Irvin Kershner taking the reigns of director, from George Lucas, the film goes into a not necessarily darker tone but more mature. With A New Hope being a more light-hearted, but no less iconic, space opera this change puts more focus on the emotions of the characters we have met and, in turn, raises the stakes for heroes, especially Luke who must now face his foe.Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill maintain the effortless portrayal of their respective characters from the first film. The introduction of Billy Dee Williams as Lando is simply brilliant as he too fully embodies his role and bounces off Harrison Ford's Han Solo. Another introduction is that of Yoda (operated by Frank Oz) that adds to the mystery of 'The Jedi' and 'The Force' as this character is just overloaded with so much wisdom and is used so well to build Luke's character throughout the film.'Empire' contains possibly one of the most memorable line's in of all cinema; those who have seen this know exactly what I mean. However, it far from relies on this moment as there are a countless number of iconic moments and dialogue.The visual effects of the 1977 release of Star Wars may have been ground-breaking but this film shows how far the industry has come in 3 years. Whether this be the representation of Cloud City, the Walker Assault or even as simple as shots of the Falcon flying. These may seem easy enough to manufacture in 2020 but must have been incredible to see in 1980. I am simply gutted I wasn't able to experience that wonder myself.John Williams again excels at what he does. He is extra-ordinarily consistent in his quality, and not just in this franchise. He truly sends these films into the history books and is one of the many reasons Star Wars, Empire especially, is still so loved today.Empire Strikes Back is truly the heart of this trilogy and is unquestionable in its quality.

Relentless,"I usually watch this show every two years to keep a fresh perspective on it. This is the first real film experience I ever had, and it remains the strongest influence on me. The thing that amazes me about this, time and again, is the ingenuity of the pacing, the orchestration, and the motion of the vehicles and ships.This is a triumph of editing.The motion control work is so artfully done, it puts CGI to shame. Watch how the ships move. They dance alongside the camera, swooping toward and away from us. Look at the terrain whiz by in the snowspeeder search. No CGI can convince like that. This is basically helicopter footage on fast-forward, through the cockpit of a prop ship, but it works. The amount of activity going on screen at any given time is frenetic.And then we have Frank Oz. Forget that we live in a world where there are Yoda pajamas, animal crackers, dolls, etc., and just focus on this wonderful character in this one film. He is more lifelike than many of the actors we have working today. When he is on screen, I believe he exists. That is pure movie magic. Mark Hamill is given a tough job with this. Whenever you have a multi-million dollar film that hinges on the performance of one person and a sock puppet, there's pressure. People have blasted him for years over his acting, but it works. He pulls his share of the work and sells every scene.From the opening crawl onward, this never lets up. The music is simply beautiful.

The Evolution & Expansion of Star Wars,"Arguably the best film from the original trilogy (and entire Star Wars saga), The Empire Strikes Back strikes a more mature tone than it's predecessor; still fantastical and exploring a labyrinth of imagination that you could get lost in, but delving deeper into the mysticism of the force and division between good and evil.Some of the most famous quotes and scenes in cinema history are found within these two hours, influential and replicated or parodied countless times. It's difficult to find someone not aware of the film's 'twist', even if they haven't seen the film, and that cultural impact shows what a behemoth this film is. The storytelling takes an almighty step forward with these plot points, keeping the story engrossing and well paced.Empire sees the introduction of some of the most recognisable characters in media; fan favourites who's mannerisms and qualities endure beyond the film. Without losing any of the core characters from A New Hope, these new characters are integrated well, having meaningful contributions to the story and wider context, without overwhelming screentime.Relationships develop tenfold, creating more chemistry between all the characters, new and old. Whilst more apparent arcs of friendship, romance, and betrayal flourish, smaller interactions between less noticeable relationships show the evolution off screen - such as Chewbacca and C3PO. Leia in particular is given the opportunity to stamp her personality in the film, even more so than previously - an excellent character leading the way instead of falling into the royal category of damsel in distress.Once again, the settings as magnificent, none more so than the original locations in the likes of Hoth and Dagobah. Cloud CIty benefits from Lucas' later edits, but these built sets create such an atmosphere. These are supported by the costuming, props and puppetry, which are as iconic as the heroes utilising them.The soundtrack is still excellent and transitions the story between scenes so well. Overall, the whole film is a little more seamless, and it is the perfect film building upon an unbeatable foundation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It's Star Wars, you know how good it is","The cultural and technological significance of The Empire Strikes Back speaks for itself. It revolutionised CGI and practical effects to a whole new level.
The characters are so good, no wonder why they're so iconic. Everything points to the director having an idea of the characters created: Yoda's monologue about the force is so beautiful, it embodies the love Yoda has for it. And Han Solo's ""I know"" is so to character, keeping that arrogant and boastful persona as he would.
The use of the force is the epitome of subtlety as it creates this beautiful living organism.
It's a cinematic masterpiece: where the CGI might not hold up today, the cinematography certainly does, clearly inspiring movies to come.
Obviously it's one of the greatest action movies, let alone movies in total.

One of THE best sequels ever made,"Forty years ago, in a galaxy far away. A sequel of the movie that changed cinema forever was made, and it sure as heck didn't failed on anyone.Every top best sequels I see always has Empire Strikes Back on the number one spot, and there's a reason why. It took many dark turns that nobody at the time saw coming, it didn't use the same elements that the previous movie used and it felt like we were exploring the galaxy a lot more than we did in the last film.If I have to pick where to put this on my Star Wars rank list, it'd be on the top three, just not sure where in the three spots.The romance part of the film works really well with Leia and Han. Sure, the age gap between Carrie and Harrison was a bit awkward, but they somehow made it work great for the franchise and became one of the best couples ever.The reveal of Vader being the father wasn't a surprise to me when I first watched it, because I started watching the franchise with the prequels first in 2006 and knew what was happening.And I know this is going to cause a debate, but I think Yoda is a Muppet. It's not because of Frank Oz performing him, but it's because he feels like one to me. I feel like the Jim Henson company helped a little bit making him and there was an episode of Muppet Show where Luke, Chewie, R2 and 3PO was in and to me, that was a deal that Lucas and Henson made as a fair enough collab as a team. There's even some behind the scenes pictures that Jim, Kermit and Piggy were in.

Great,"The Empire Strikes Back, a vintage jewel in the Star Wars galaxy that had me navigating the asteroid field of nostalgia with a grin. The acting, led by the charismatic trio of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher, is a lightsaber duel of emotions. Film editing propels the narrative at lightspeed, seamlessly transitioning between Hoth's icy plains and the swamps of Dagobah. The strength lies in the darker, more mature tone, expanding the saga beyond the binary of good and evil. Weaknesses? The romantic subplot might be as clunky as C-3PO on an Ewok dance floor, but it's a minor quibble in the grand scheme. The music, John Williams' masterpiece, is the Force that binds the scenes together, from the Imperial March to Yoda's Theme. Cinematography captures the vastness of space and the intimacy of lightsaber duels, creating a visual odyssey through the galaxy. The message? A tale of loss, redemption, and the resilience of hope in the face of Imperial tyranny. 7/10 is a blast from the past that still holds its intergalactic charm, a Star Wars episode that's both iconic and imperfect, like an old friend you're happy to revisit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Galactic Masterpiece: Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back,"In a galaxy far, far away, there exists a cinematic gem that has stood the test of time, capturing the hearts and minds of fans across generations. I am referring to none other than ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back."" Words alone cannot express the sheer brilliance and captivating nature of this film, but I shall endeavor to do justice to its incredible impact.From the very moment the iconic opening crawl graces the screen, accompanied by John Williams' majestic score, you are transported into an unparalleled universe filled with rich storytelling and unforgettable characters. Director Irvin Kershner masterfully expands upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, delivering a film that sets the gold standard for sci-fi fantasy adventures.First and foremost, the character development in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is nothing short of extraordinary. We witness the growth and transformation of our beloved heroes, as well as the introduction of new faces who have become indelible figures in popular culture. Luke Skywalker's journey toward becoming a Jedi Knight is rife with inner conflict and self-discovery, a testament to Mark Hamill's exceptional acting prowess.The character dynamics are also expertly woven together. The unforgettable banter between Han Solo and Princess Leia provides a delightful mixture of wit, charm, and undeniable chemistry. Their captivating romance adds an extra layer of depth and emotion to the film, allowing viewers to become fully invested in their captivating love story.One cannot discuss ""The Empire Strikes Back"" without mentioning the iconic and menacing presence of Darth Vader.

Old time classic movie,"From the very beginning, The Empire Strikes Back sets itself apart with a darker tone. The opening scenes on Hoth, where the Rebels are on the run from the Empire, immediately immerse viewers in the high stakes of the war. The film quickly establishes that this isn't a mere adventure anymore; it's a survival story. The battle on the icy planet feels like a frantic last stand for the Rebels, contrasting with the optimism of the victory at the end of A New Hope. Yet despite the tension, the movie maintains a fast pace, pulling viewers from one intense moment to the next without overwhelming them.One of the standout elements is how the film handles its characters. In The Empire Strikes Back, we see significant development for Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Leia Organa. Luke, in particular, begins his journey from a hopeful young hero to a more mature, conflicted.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A mediocre school play,"""It is useless to resist...""Nope. Actually I found it quite easy.Terrible script. Mostly dreadful acting. Lousy effects, the animals especially. Action scenes that would embarrass the most amateur production.I quite like Darth Vader, both as a character and as acted. A convincing monster. Leia is OK too, though she is cursed with a feeble part, entirely beneath the notice of a decent actress. Between them they save this from an even worse score.Luke is mostly an annoying schoolboy. Most of the rest are stock parts doing stock things. The incest theme is quite fun, though it always seems like they simply didn't notice it until the reviewers started to comment. The comedy is lame. The music is cliched, reaching its ultimate nadir in the imperial march.And this stretched to 9 episodes and half-a-dozen spin-offs?

"This film was released wide in the USA on June 20th, 1980","Before the release of Star Wars (1977], in the theaters, it still had to go through the same steps as any other movie. It too was considered a one shot deal, just like any other movie. It too, like every other film, had to pass the big test at the box office first, before anything else could happen. As everyone knows, this George Lucas directed film, was a huge box office smash, becoming the highest grossing movie of all time. It still held the record in 1980, thus giving the green-light for Lucas to develop a trilogy of films. What makes Empire Strikes Back (1980), so good, is the fact that, the film is one of those bridge-films. It bridges the gap from the first film to the third film. Some number two films in a trilogy, are susceptible to taxing pacing, caused by the need to be a set-up for the big finale in the third film. If done correctly, the film can be a successful bridge-film, while still completing its goal of being an exciting entry in the trilogy. This film accomplishes the goal of being an exciting adventure, full of maturing characters and it comes with a more darker side to it. It also successfully bridges the gap to the third film, Return of the Jedi (1983). It creates major implications for the main cast of characters. It is a cliff-hanger of a story.George Lucas stepped aside as the director for this film, for director Irvin Kershner. Kershner creates a slick, exciting, action-packed adventure, full of dazzle, flare and artistry. It has one of the most incredible soundtracks ever, thanks to legendary composer John Williams. It is pure pleasure watching this film. It is the stuff of legends now. It is still hailed as being the best Star Wars movie ever. The film starts with the main cast together, but splits them up into two stories, that carries the film to the end, eventually bringing them together again, but with a price. The first sub-plot involves Luke (Mark Hamill), meeting the Muppet-like, Jedi master, Yoda (Frank Oz), who begins training Luke to be a Jedi. The other sub-plot involves Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), being chased by Darth Vader (Peter Mayhew/James Earl Jones) and enlisting the aid of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), the leader of Cloud City. The stage is set for one of the biggest cliff-hangers in film history.9.3 (A Mygrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Greatest Film Ever Made,"In creating a sequel to the phenomenally successful Star Wars, George Lucas and his team were faced with a seemingly impossible challenge.  How could the original be surpassed?  Three years (and a lot of cash) had, of course, given the film-makers the opportunity to develop the special effects technology far beyond the original film.  But this alone was not enough. Where Empire truly excels over it's predecessor is in the two essential fields of film storytelling-- both the plot and the characters are far richer and more captivating.  Why is Empire the greatest film ever made? We will never again see such a perfect blending of romance, adventure, emotion and movie magic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing movie,"Full of special effects, with a nice plot and very tallented actors. I loved the story and the it surprised me completely.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Grossly overrated,"This film is bad in the sense that it is hardly a film at all. It has no structure, no dialogue, no screenplay, a threadbare story, but one that is not told because of non-existent direction, etc. It continues where the original left off, and just notches off plot elements one by one without any urge to tell a story, or develop characters, relationships, etc. The makers probably conceived this as a filler between numbers one and three and didn't bother with it. Of course, that's all right. I don't have any problem with that. But what really does disturb me is the high praise meted out to this ""film"" from almost every quarter – from viewers and critics alike. On this board it's being rated as the 17th best movie of all time. I've consulted quite a few film guides, and they all tag maximum, or near maximum, stars to this film. Even more bizarrely, they consider it to be the best of the series, and in my mind it's clearly the worst. What is going on? Of course, it's not difficult to see why this film is idolized. The first film was both good and a milestone. Not great, but it was the perfect statement for an age. It was a fairy tale that was confused as science fiction. The ""Force"" embodied morality, even religion, for the space age. It is set in the distant past and therefore pertains to origins rather than where technology is going. Spaceships and laser guns are just the backdrop, and have nothing to do with the story or the subject matter. When this film appeared in the middle of the crisis-ridden seventies, it really must have been a beacon of ""new hope"". And to put the ground-breaking special effects into its proper context, they symbolized optimism. There is no doubt that the effects served the story well, but they served even better the mood of the age. And with all this going, Star Wars rightly became a tremendous hit, and the focus of fanatic devotion. It was to be expected that any sequel would have been gobbled up by the fan base, as long as it didn't spoil the original. Empire doesn't spoil the original. It not only continues the war between good and evil, it does so with more spectacle, more aplomb, more special effects.When people say they like Empire, what I think they really mean is that thy like Star Wars so much that they are thrilled that it has a new and glossy wrapping. Because Empire is nothing but embellishment. They're not judging the film itself. The ideal situation would have been if Star Wars remained as a standalone fairy tale. Fairy tales end, and they leave us with the aura of ""happily ever after"". They don't go on and on and become sagas, and if they did that would totally destroy the aura. Empire is the first mistaken step towards saga, and that is why it quickly finds itself out of its depth. There is nothing else to be told, and that's why the film is so bad. One boring battle joined to another boring battle, and in between we have cardboard characters mouthing atrocious dialogue that serves no purpose whatsoever. The strain tells. Everybody is straining to do something when there is nothing to do. The third film, The Return of the Jedi, redeems itself by trying to finish a story. The prequels are interesting because they are filling in the background. But Empire is caught in no man's land. It is bad, and it should be exposed as such. All this pretending isn't healthy, I don't think.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Empire Strikes Back (1980) Film? No. A show,"Perhaps this is the favorite film in the franchise for most audiences and that makes perfect sense. The film is a spectacle. From start to finish, its rhythm is wonderful and it becomes more and more fun. Every moment is epic and memorable. The soundtrack is very well used and the sound effects are as striking as the soundtrack. The characters are incredible, from new ones to those already introduced in the last film. The plot twist is perfect and has gone down in cinema history. This film was not directed by George Lucas, which makes it much better.

The Empire Strikes Back: A Timeless Sci-Fi Masterpiece,"As a Star Wars fan myself, The Empire Strikes Back is the epitome of everything that makes this saga a 10/10 experience. From its deep character development to its darker, more mature storytelling, this film delivers on every level.The continuation of Luke Skywalker's journey is gripping, particularly his intense training with Yoda, which adds philosophical depth to the Force. The film's heart-wrenching revelation about Darth Vader's identity is perhaps one of the most iconic moments in cinema history, still sending chills down my spine even after multiple viewings.The visual effects, especially the battle on Hoth and the cloud city of Bespin, were groundbreaking at the time and still hold up remarkably well today. Combined with John Williams' unforgettable score, these scenes create an immersive cinematic experience that leaves you in awe of the galaxy far, far away.In addition to its technical brilliance, what truly elevates The Empire Strikes Back is its willingness to take risks. The film does not shy away from portraying the Rebellion's losses or leaving audiences with a cliffhanger that feels genuinely emotional and compelling. It's a story of hope amidst despair, which is why it resonates so deeply.For me, The Empire Strikes Back is a masterpiece. It captures the essence of Star Wars while pushing the boundaries of what a science fiction epic can be. It's a must-watch that earns a 10/10 rating every time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Empire Strikes Back did not follow the crappy sequel line. The reason it might be so good is because George Lucas did not direct it. The only problem I have is the ending. Why is Lando Wearing Hans clothes? does Han have a closet full of the same clothes that fit Lando? who knows... The Empire Strikes back is a film that you can watch over and over and never get bored.

Good but just because it is darker doesn't mean its better.,"Star Wars Episode 5 The Empire Strikes Back tells the story of the evil galactic empire attacking the hopeless rebellion after the destruction of the Death Star. One thing that I feel is worth noting right off the bat is that I don't think this film surpasses A New Hope but is ratter on the same level in terms of substance as well as quality.What makes this film good is that it is able to keep its focus on the characters in a universe that is so interesting as well as vast. That is something that makes the original trilogy better in my opinion because in the prequels it was focused on showing us heavily C.G.I. visuals ratter then on the characters. This is one of many factors that make the original trilogy by far the superior films. The plot is also more complex then the first of this trilogy which shows that the people involved with this project were taking risks. The characters were all likable and interesting. And the fact that they filmed at real locations shows dedication from the director Irvin Kershner.The cons of this picture though are not minimal which leads me to feeling as though it is grossly overrated. The acting and dialogue is still hooky, the effects are showing age, the action is underwhelming, and unfortunately the fan base that surrounds Star Wars has made it difficult to watch Empire as it was intended. The story although complex is occasionally driven forward by plot convinces. And although I did not see this infamous twist coming, I also was not all that wowed.In conclusion The Empire Strikes Back is complex and has relatable characters which is able to drive this picture forward as well as be entertaining. And I'm giving this one a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The saga thickens and matures,"This film is the continuation of the story of the first. The war between the rebels and the Empire continues, while Darth Vader Luke demand throughout the galaxy. Directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, this film has the participation of the same actors from the first film.The film inherits most of the qualities of his predecessor. It has a carefully chosen cast and consistent performances, with some emphasis on the work of Harrison Ford, actor who was already highlighted in the first film and now consolidates his success. Action scenes are excellent, thought of meticulous way and the fight scenes with lightsaber remind us some great duels of piracy and swashbuckling films. The special visual and sound effects are the best that existed at the time and fulfill their role with great merit. The only difference between this film and the latest films of the saga is, in fact, this technical issue, given the huge advance that, in a few decades, the techniques and special effects achieved. The soundtrack was again in charge of John Williams, which continues the excellent work started in the first film of the saga. In fact, the first main theme of the chords of the saga became one of the songs that instinctively comes to mind of people when they think of film music, the same way as the ""March of Darth Vader"" has become one of most songs instinctively associated with the image of any movie villain. The point of greatest merit of this movie is the script. It is a deeper script, more psychological and intense than the script of the first film, and this contributed decisively to the success of it, and the franchise itself.

Why did this film need a special edition??,"Ask yourself this:Why did an already excellent film need a special re-tooled edition?Other than some minor effects touch-up(i.e erasing the black lines from the models)this film is virtually flawless...The effects advance instead detract from the story which is superior to the rest...The dialogue mercifully not written by Lucas is funny and insightful...So why the re-edits.The only reason I can think of is once again so Lucas can try out his new toys...Some of the re-edits are unecessary...The scenes with the Wampa are an example..If Lucas wanted to show the Wampa then it could've been edited right...Instead we get shots of the wampa eating then getting up.Then we see the wampa writhing in pain with one arm.Are we to believe that this is the same Wampa that attacked and captured Luke???Based on how it was shot and edited,it looked like there were two in the cave to me.Another unnecessary edit is shots of Vader's shuttle going back to the Star destroyer...Lucas said he did this because you wondered how Vader got there when you watch the film.I never did...If you pay attention to the film,Vader tells his troopers to bring his shuttle...Case solved...The extended scenes with Slave 1 and the Falcon I can understand but the shuttles scenes are done in what is essentially a fast paced car chase..Lucas cut the Biggs scenes because they interrupted the flow of the opening of New Hope but yet he had no problem putting in Jedi outtakes that are slow and lumbering into a fast paced scene....And did we need to hear Luke scream a recycled scream from one of the other films??....No,I don't think so...Nor do I care about Cloud City being opened up..It was fine as is....Overall,Empire was and still continues to be the flawless cream of the crop of the Star Wars sextet...There was no need for a special edition....",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The dark heart of Star Wars,"Star wars is a Saturday morning breakfast serial, with the upbeat 'let's have an Olympic medal ceremony' ending...Empire discards the fluffiness and moves away from its simplistic predecessor's obvious appeal to the child fanbase, without scaring everybody away in the process. The 2nd Star Wars film takes the original cast and subjects them to 2 hours of major discomfort...A forbidding icy planet replete with nasty creatures. There are ugly bounty hunters, monsters hiding out in the depths of asteroid fields, and Luke's foray into the black swamp of the Degobah system. It's a more taut, curiously downbeat film that slows almost to a halt in places, as Luke meets the Jedi Master who will teach him the ways of the force. The set pieces more than make up for the lack of pace...The opening battle on the Ice planet is a visually effective affair, and the stormtroopers have never looked as cool when they don their winter outfits. The asteroid chase and cloud city sequence are visual treats, that take you into the mysterious heart of the Star Wars Universe. The character development glues everything together. Luke's maturing process in the darkness of Degobah..Han and Leia's romantic chemistry, the droids comic relief and interplay with Chewbacca solidifies the group together and establishes a team spirit that was coming together at the end of Episode IV. The centrepiece of the film is the epic showdown between Luke and Vader,with that massive revelation, which inevitably ranks as one of Cinema's all time memorable moments. And it's a great sequence, from Vader's sobering welcome 'The force is with you young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet' to the almost surreal climax. The forces of darkness loom large at every turn of the film...you get the feeling that the rebels are just slightly out of their depth. There is an underlying menace at work that heightens the dramatic tension..Vader is never as beautifully evil as he is in Empire. We finally see just why he is (Emperor aside) the top dog in the galaxy, as he lays waste to his own generals in ruthless fashion. We get some great new characters...Han's old buddy Lando Calrissien (sp?) is the slimy administrator of cloud city, who finds himself in a no-win situation, and there's the legendary Boba Fett..bounty hunter with balls of steel, and an outfit so cool it instantly establishes him as a Star Wars icon. And of course, the emperor rears his ugly head, and we get a taster of his malevolance. Any faults? It's hard to find much complaint. Some of the dialogue strays into cheeseland, the pace is interrupted with the curious but necessary Degobah scenes, but all in all, the sum of the parts adds up to a supremely effective, tightly woven sci-fi drama, the most deliciously dark of all Star Wars movies, and the most mature. Classic entertainment, stuck in a time capsule of its own, with enough memorable moments to ensure its place in the higher echelons of cinema history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Empire is just at the right timbre for a good movie, as well as having what is currently the greatest movie soundtrack of all, according to my sources. All in all, a good movie and quite an experience.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Sorry not for our Generations (After Nineties),"The story (if you can speak of one)in this movie is very boring. There isn't any tension-building or climax whatsoever. The movie just stops after 2 hours. There is hardly any character building, and to my opinion there aren't many strong personalities. The only character that has won my sympathy is Han Solo,(Harrison Ford) but after being frozen he just disappears out of the movie, and no one seems to care about him anymore. Luke Skywalker is a w***er who is supposed to be a jedi knight, but instead he needs to be rescued all the time. I wouldn't have cared less if he had crashed in his plane, had been eaten by that snowmonster, had frozen to death, he got shot by the ATATs, if his father had killed him, or he had fallen of that tower. The music score is well composed, though I think a classical symphony isn't very suitable for a sci-fi movie. I believe they should have used synthetic music to create the right atmosphere. On the other hand the effects and sceneries are very impressive. Unbelieve what effort George and his guys have done!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

An Honest Review,"So, I was almost 1 when this movie dropped and, well, it started the opening night tradition.OK, well, how to do this? I guess we will start with the hate. I like to address the hate in movies, especially ones that are well regarded and loved.Now, I'll excuse it for the people that just don't like Star Wars. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.But then there are the people that really hate Empire because of...reasons. And those reasons are Revenge of the Sith.I'm sorry, panning Empire because of loyalty to the prequels--misplaced as it is--doesn't make I-III any better. It just makes you petty.Now, why its loved and, I'll admit, I am one of those fanboys that really do love this movie.For starters, Empire went dark. It was the really the episode that the good guys lost and, that made it unique among, well, among just about every movie not made in the 1970s. I guess that is what made the 70s such a wonderful time for movies.We could use a little more of that. We could use a lot more of that. We use a lot more gritty in cinema. And, we could use a lot more ""lived in"" Everything looks too clean.Empire had that.And then it had that big, legendary, reveal that made all those kisses between Luke and Leia utterly wrong once the second big reveal hit in 1983...which explained that look Han gave Leia when she told him in the next installment.Moving on...We have the Battle of Hoth, which, yeah, nerd awesomeness with kind of a WWI trench warfare v tanks feel and a WWII Evacuation of Dunkirk feel with the rebels on the run and the Empire forcing its way across the galaxy with brute strength.And that prolonged time on the Falcon, well, that was just brilliant for character development and, incest blocking.So, really, honestly, there was way too much to love not to put Empire on the throne.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Yoda and the one of the most powerful lines of all time.,"When I first saw The Empire Strikes Back I didn't really care for it. I wasn't really into the darkness that covered the movie. Now, I'm a little older and can appreciate this movie. This is the best Star Wars movie hands down. Not my favorite, but the greatest.This takes the Star Wars saga to a whole new level with the introduction of Yoda and the fleshing out of Darth Vader. Every returning character from A New Hope is given so much more to work with and it shows. We learn more about Han's past, Luke's past, and Luke's future. The visual feel of the movie is incredible. From Bespin, the cloud city to Dagobah, the lonely hideout for Master Yoda, each one of the locations presented support the turmoiled, chill of space feel that dominates the movie.The climax of the movie is the most memorable climax of all time. It's been alluded to more times than can be counted. It also takes the battle between good and evil from a back and white area to a shade of gray. The fact that the innocence of Luke can come from the pure evil of Darth Vader is perhaps the biggest revelation.This is one of the best sequels of all time.

My favourite Star Wars film,"I remember watching The Empire Strikes Back when I was young and just completely loving it. Even today it remains as my favourite film in the franchise.Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back follows Luke Skywalker training more and more to become a Jedi whilst Han Solo and Princess Leia are pursued by Darth Vader.After A New Hope, everyone was so excited to see the next Star Wars film. It became one of the most anticipated films of the early 80s and once it finally came out, people just fell in love with it. This is the best Star Wars film to date and here's why.First of all the camerawork in this movie is absolutely excellent. RIP Irvin Kershner, you did a great job. The special effects definitely evolved since Episode IV as they look really good. It's astounding to think that this movie came out in 1980 because how beautiful the set design and effects were. Whilst A New Hope didn't have many fight sequences, this one has plenty and the action scenes are extremely entertaining to watch that keep the adrenaline flowing.Apart from all the positives mentioned, the area where this film shines is its characters. The acting by everyone was superb once again. Writers Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan wrote a beautiful script as we learn more about each of our beloved characters. The chemistry between Leia and Solo is fantastic and quite funny at times. We learn a lot about Luke's past and his relation to Vader which makes up for a great conflict between the two. If you thought Darth Vader was evil in the previous film, wait till you see how menacing he becomes in The Empire Strikes Back. This film also gave us YODA which was an absolute treat.The Empire Strikes Back is my favourite Star Wars film and I don't think any other film can reach its level. The film is well paced alongside some incredible action sequences that keep the intensity going. Our heroes are given a lot of depth which makes us root for them and care about them throughout and the villains have never been so menacing. The Empire Strikes Back is a classic and will remain a classic for a very long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great film! definitively the best Star Wars movie.,"Definitively not like A new hope. The empire strikes is a good entertaining film. The action sequences are a lot better, we don't see something as stupid as the lightsaber fight between Darth Vader and Obi Wan. The fights are slow but intense. The stuff that happens on the film actually seems important, not like the boring stuff of A new hope. The empire strikes back creates some genuine tension on the plot. Characters are better now. They were good on A new hope, but only because they were fun. On here, we see the more of the characters, and the movie makes the viewers sympathize with them. The characters aren't profound by any means, but they're interesting. And here, i can forgive that Darth Vader is boring, because the movie adds some plot twists at the end that actually points to something interesting in the next movie. Is a classic, definitively not a masterpiece, but is the perfect entertainment movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Empire Strikes Out,"The second ""Star Wars"" film to be released has non-stop action, but the problem is that there is no compelling plot to make the action interesting. Endless shots of star ships gliding through space soon become tedious. The last third of the movie does generate some interest but it's too little, too late to save this from being more than a mediocre entry in the series. The other problem is that it just stops abruptly, relying too much on the sequel to clean up the loose ends. The dialog is amateurish and there is too much emphasis on special effects. Yoda is cute but Chewbacca and R2-D2 become increasingly annoying with the silly noises they make.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Flawless Sequel,"It is not always possible for a sequel to re-capture the peculiar magic of an original film. 'The Empire Strikes Back' manages to do so by being less of a sequel than it is a new film on its own. The story begun in 'Star Wars' is advanced, the characters & their relationships with one another are deepened and the film itself abandons much of the easy spirit of the first film in favour of a darker and more uncertain tone. If the first film was largely about heroism, the second is largely concerned with struggle. The main characters are soundly tested in this film and for the most part, they come up short.This is also the film that transforms Darth Vader into one of the screen's great villains. Vader was interesting in 'Star Wars,' but he is iconic in 'The Empire Strikes Back' and he rightfully takes his place as not only a great villain, but a great character. In spite of the despair that runs through the film, the visuals and imagination so apparent in 'Star Wars' returns here, as well. The film is littered with awesome action sequences and more than enough 'coolness' to measure up to its predecessor.Again, the original (1980) version is the one to see - if given the option - although the enhancements made to this film are somewhat less invasive than those applied to 'Star Wars.' Still, the film is more charming and more polished its original release. It is considerably less delightful than its predecessor, but it is every bit as good of a film, if not even slightly superior to 'Star Wars.'",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Empire Strikes Back,This is in my opinion the best Star Wars movie yet. It improves upon the first movie and has the one of the best plot twist of all time. Luke's Story in this is great and Yoda is a lot of fun. Darth Vader is an even better villain in this film. This film is fun and exciting from beginning to end. It never gets slow and is fast passed. This is an amazing film.9.5/10,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"More than the Dark Side, A Great Movie","When talking about The Empire Strikes Back many people have commented on how dark it is in comparison to the other two films from the original trilogy. However as was expected by Star Wars fans, Revenge of the Sith without a doubt took the title of Darkest Star Wars movie from Empire's mantle. Given the galactic scale of tragedy in the final prequel, Empire's personal tragedy reveals itself to be a little self-absorbed. In the post-prequel Star Wars paradigm, we should be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel in the final revelations of Empire.With the issue of darkness settled, the Star Wars audience and the movie-going public should now be able to see The Empire Strikes Back for what it is. The best Star Wars movie. And not only is it a great Star Wars movie, but it is a great movie. The direction, the writing, and even the performances come together to make it a complete movie.Watching the movies that George Lucas has directed, specifically Star Wars: Episodes I-IV, you can tell he is not a student of the craft of acting. The result is that actors are left developing the emotional life of the characters on their own. Some actors are able to survive and even thrive in this environment. Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness give inspired performances in the original Star Wars that make some of the other performances in the movie appear worse than they actually were.George Lucas responsibly tapped his professor from film school, Irvin Kershner, to direct The Empire Strikes Back, and the difference is palpable. Star Wars is without a doubt the most revolutionary in terms of Special Effects of the original trilogy. But in terms of quality movie-making, editing, cinematography, etc., Emipire takes the cake. And all the while putting together great shot after great shot, he managed to pull good performances out of most the cast. Not a single one of the primaries are flat or perform an unbelievable moment. Hamill's performance is so good you actually believe for at least a few minutes that he might stand a chance against Darth Vader.But the quality of film-making and the emotional life of the characters would not have mattered, nor could they have possibly existed without brilliant writing. In Empire Lucas is at his myth-making best (Han's metaphoric descent into hell and Luke's journey into the Dark Cave are brilliant), and the screenplay by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasden is sharp, well-paced, and energetic. As a result of this three-part collaboration, you have the rough and romantic flirtations of Han Solo and Princess Leia (in which you can hear the voice of both Brackett's earlier work, The Big Sleep and El Dorado, and Kasden's later work, The Big Chill and The Accidental Tourist). Also you have Yoda-speech when it was genuinely profound in a Confucian way, before it devolved into the gimmicky and painful form it takes in the prequels.On the whole there is no denying that Star Wars: A New Hope is the most influential movie of the series, quite possibly of the last quarter of the twentieth century (although it would have to fight with Jaws for that title). And with the fall of Anakin Skywalker in Revenge of the Sith, it no longer can be called the darkest of the Star Wars saga. But it is, with little doubt the best movie of the series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The best adventure movie ever.,"One of my seven 10s (of my about 200 rated movies) are given to this movie. And when I first wanted to vote for it, I had just seen it, yet again experienced the class, the acts, the dialogue, the action, the characters, the amazing adventures of Han, Luke and the rest. And let's just say that I hadn't seen it in years just before I voted. And a 10 sounded so, well, unreal, especially when you should actually presume that it's the original Star Wars which deserves a 10. If one of the movies should have one. But it was this one I found right. I still do. I am sure that this is the absolutely greatest adventure movie of all time. Of all Star Wars movies. Of the Indiana Jones movies. And of the Lord Of The Rings movies. Of every adventure movie I have seen, this one is the very best. Why, you will probably ask. Most people I know either prefer Star Wars IV or VI to this one. But I think they forget to take acquintance to the amazing chemistry there is between all the cast in this movie. And the classic scenes, there are many more than in the other movies. Luke meeting Yoda, and Yoda's amazing wisdom for such a small, little green alien. Vader confronts Luke. The truth revealed. Han and Leia's first kiss, and C-3POs interference. The introduction of Lando. Boba Fett. Admiral Piett's absurd rise to great Imperial stature. The battle of Hoth. Han frozen into carbonite. Just about everything of the dialogue, acting, everything of it is so classic, so climatic, so absolutely real. The Empire Strikes Back is the absolutely finest film in the entire Star Wars series. It's so intense, its plot and subplots are perfectly intertwined, just about everything in the film is perfectly fit for its genre. This is why this movie deserves a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The sequel to the groundbreaking Star Wars revisits everything that worked the first time while upping the stakes and refining the rough spots.,"Following the events of the last film, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew),Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), their droids R2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and the rest of the rebel alliance have been driven into hiding on the ice planet Hoth after their destruction of the Death Star. Darth Vader(physical: David Prowse, voice: James Earl Jones) continues his search for Skywalker and eventually finds the rebel base with the rebel forces forced to retreat and Luke is separated while Han and the others attempt to elude pursuit of the Empire. Luke travels to the Dagobah system at the direction of his deceased master Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) and directs Luke to locate his former master Yoda. As Luke dives deeper into the teachings of the Jedi and The Force, Luke's friends will face a danger that will force Luke to make a choice that could lead him to the Dark Side and discover revelations that challenge everything he's learned.George Lucas had always planned to expand Star Wars even if the first film proved unsuccessful down to contracting author Alan Dean Foster who wrote the novelization of Star Wars to write a limited location sequel novel that could be adapted on a low budget released as Splinter of the Mind's Eye. When Star Wars broke Box Office Records, Lucas reappraised his approach to the sequel leaving the Foster adaptation as novel (which became a success in its own right and the start of the Expanded Universe) and proceeding to plan a much more ambitious sequel. Lucas having felt the strain of directing Star Wars opted to take a role as Executive Producer and instead handed the reins to Irvin Kershner. The script received a lot of input from multiple parties as Lucas had many different ideas on how to approach the subject of Luke's father (who was not yet the reveal we know), Luke's sister (also originally a new character), and expanded roles for the Galactic Emperor and other planets which weren't deemed feasible. The script was given multiple passes by several writers including notably Lawrence Kasdan who had impressed Lucas with his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark. Upon initial release some critics were mixed in the darker tone from the original film with some outright lambasting the film, but overtime The Empire Strikes Back has been re-evaluated as not just the best film in the series, but one of the best sequels of all time.From the movie's introduction, it makes it clear to the audience that while the destruction of the Death Star was a victory slowing the threat of the Empire, it didn't stop them as the Rebels are forced to hide on the desolate ice planet of Hoth while Vader searches the galaxy intent on finding Luke. The harshness of the ice world is a fantastic setup with its bitter and inhospitable cold serving as a nice counterpoint to the original desert planet we saw in Star Wars and gives us the feeling of a new and unfamiliar place we've not yet explored. The characters also feel like they've advanced with Luke Skywalker carrying a more hardened demeanor in contrast to the fresh faced youth we were introduced to him as and Han and Leia have both advanced with the two developing a relationship and Han having become less cynical and self-serving as a character. The movie keeps itself mostly pretty simple with Luke embarking on a journey of self-discovery with Jedi master Yoda voiced and puppeted by Frank Oz and the character is a solid mixture of quirky, weird, and wise that makes him a unique mentor figure for Luke to play off against. The action scenes have also been expanded upon with a larger scale and more ambitious effects with the Battle of Hoth sequence featuring some great computer assisted Stop Motion to bring to life walking battle tanks called ""Walkers"" that look amazing in motion as well as destruction. We also get Billy Dee Williams as Han's former friend Lando who plays the role with the same cocky swagger as Han but still gives his own spin on it and gets some good moments in the film as a character. Darth Vader remains a solid antagonist in the film with his menace dialed up as the primary antagonist this time around, but also some solid revelations that are now famous (you know what I'm talking about) and some terrific pitch black humor of Darth Vader ""promoting"" various officers to Admiral after the previous one failed him.The Empire Strikes Back is a great film in its own right and one of the best sequels of all time. The characters you loved the first time around are expanded upon and revisited and the world is made to feel alive and bigger with new environments and world building that make the film an engaging sit even when you know what's coming.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I fell in love with Yoda in this movie. All the main characters from Star Wars IV are here. However, it is Luke and Yoda who steal the show. However, the movie did make me feel like I was between episodes and want more. I also felt that it really didn't have a true ending, just a closing of a chapter.

One of the best films ever,"The Empire Strikes back is the best of the original trilogy, as well as being the best of the entire series. Its so good that it is on my top ten films of all time. It manages to switch between the cheery space opera tone of the original film with added darkness and despair.The characters this time around are given much more screen time to grow and develop, being ever more three-dimensional. This depth of character is what adds to the first film and makes it so much better than the rest of the series. It shows the good and the evil, the greed and corruption and the tyranny that grows within the corners of the of the Star Wars universe.The cinematography, score and special effects remain quite consistent, moving on from those that were present in the first film. The only exception of this is the special effects, which have been slightly spruced up since the first film.The story itself has become a lot more brutal and unforgiving, without moving into spoilers, it fully embraces the dark side of the force and fully explores the darkest corners of its plot.It is because of the emotions stirred in Empire that the entire series takes on a mythic quality that resonates back to the first and ahead to the third.This is the heart of the franchise, this is the peak. Everything that has been added and built upon from the first film is fantastic, there are no conceivable downsides to this space epic.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the three,"Like the Wrath of Khan, Empire improves upon the first movie in the series. In fact, once all three were out, this remained the best of them. Often times the second movie of a trilogy feels more like a step that was needed to reach the conclusion rather than an adventure of its own.

Luke begins his training as a Jedi and we see in the tree that he is going the way of Vader.  Han and Leia squabble but they slowly start to warm up to each other in a classic scene of love finding its way through dialogue that never mentions their love for each other.  Yoda's philosophy of ""do or do not.""  are words to live by.

"A Timeless Space Opera, The Perfect Sci-Fi Epic","Top of the line for a majority of Star Wars geeks, and for good reason. It's the ideal melting pot of George Lucas's vast, quirky imagination, his influences' knack for dark, large-scale epics, and his key contributors' determined efforts to retain a central humanism amidst all the creatures, effects and operatic indulgences. A wildly ambitious picture, it's genuinely amazing just how much territory is covered over the course of two hours. Lucas and company manage to leap from the Hoth battle to Yoda on Dagobah, the asteroid field to Lando and Cloud City, before finally climaxing with the classic Luke / Vader showdown and revelation. That's an awful lot of set pieces, not to mention some seriously powerful plot points, but smooth talking and a few outstanding performances keep the film from feeling over-stuffed or under-explored. The cast, too, grows on an individual basis almost universally, with Luke wrapping himself in the wisdom of the Jedi, Han and Leia developing genuine chemistry and Darth Vader, in a surprise twist that should never have been so effective, actually showing some signs of humanity. Although it can be hammy from time to time, those moments are balanced expertly by a wonderful series of mountains and valleys, to the point that they stop being seen as negatives and instead contribute to the picture's eccentricity. A legendary effort that's just as monumental, entrancing and electric thirty years later, it's damn near perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Well Done. One of the best sci-fi films ever. It almost equals the 1977 original in terms of quality and popularity.,"Episode V ""The Empire Strikes Back"" released in 1980 in my opinion was a great sequel to the 1977 original. As far as quality it closely ranks to the original, and in terms of character development, and plot and as far as the storytelling goes it's probably better than the 1977 original. Directed this time around by Irvin Kershner he does just as good a job with the sets, characters, and special effects work as Lucas did making it just as good as 1977's. Here the saga now has a setting on the ice planet of Hoth, a place that the Rebels have hid from the evil empire in pursuit, with the real goal they have is to reach the fabulous city of Bespin nicknamed Cloud City for it's airy view. Here's when this installment becomes a real coming of age sequel in which the central character Luke Skywalker comes of age both in terms of skill and mind, and that's when he makes a stop in the swamp of Dagobah. It is in the swamps that hold an important part of the saga and the development of the Skywalker character is found here by training with the appearance of the Jedi master Yoda(hey, nice little green puppet!) as Luke's skill of mind and fighting ability is formed making one reason that Episode V is so important. Later a dark secret is revealed, by Darth Vader in the climax at cloud city, and it was just great to see the fierce battle between Luke and Vader to close out this installment. Overall ""The Empire Strikes Back"" might be the best of the saga in terms of the coming of age development of the central character(Luke). Also the plot finally reveals the hidden truth that's a very dark secret, and the introduction of a new and unique character(Yoda) holds the saga together just great. This really is just as good as the 1977 original simply because more key elements are shown and discovered, the only rule of law is I usually don't rank sequels over the original.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
How do you top a great movie? Like this.,"While Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) started the ball rolling with a bang, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) takes that explosive start and runs with that momentum in leaps and bounds. I've seen many sequels over the years, Terminator 2, Aliens, RoboCop2, Shrek 2, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings (bare with me on those two since I know they're book series), etc. and yet none of them seem to hit the beats of the development of the characters and plot alongside the action so perfectly balanced. I don't know, my review may seem a little ramble like but it's just one of my all time favorite movies and I'm kind of at a loss of words for how to talk about it professionally.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A proposed alternate subtitle: The Humiliation of Luke Skywalker.,"There are two main ways to follow up a genre film. The first was perfectly encapsulated by Aliens in the ""bigger is better"" school. You expand the stakes, scale, and number of character to create a bigger, bolder experience. The second is to not go bigger, but to go deeper. The Empire Strikes Back might be the best example of that way to go.The Empire Strikes Back actually feels a good bit smaller in scale than the original Star Wars. The biggest battle happens at the beginning of the film, involving a patch of icy land, several large walking tanks, and about a dozen speeders. That is smaller than the couple of dozen fighters attacking a moon sized base that can destroy a planet. The movie never goes bigger than that. In fact, the scale of the conflict continuously gets smaller as the film goes on.At the beginning, the conflict is between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. It's got galactic consequences, that great battle on the planet of Hoth. If the Rebel Alliance doesn't successfully get away, then the Empire's return strike after the destruction of the Death Star will wipe out its last major adversary for control of the galaxy. The next major set piece is the chase of the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field. It's now one ship versus a handful of fighters and a Star Destroyer and the uncaring nature of outer space. It's a chase in order to capture the handful of occupants on board so that Darth Vader can lure Luke Skywalker.The final conflict is between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. We're more than an hour since the Rebel Alliance has even been mentioned. The conflict involves only two people, not half a dozen. It's no longer about galactic consequences. Instead it's about a father and son and a conflict of good versus evil. The fight of the film narrows, and the only reason it can pull that off is because of the characters.The original Star Wars utilized archetypes to tell its well-worn story. The Empire Strikes Back moves beyond the familiar hero's journey, and in order to accomplish that it needs to move beyond archetypes. Luke is no longer the farmboy hero. Instead he's an arrogant war hero who thinks far too much of himself. Han is no longer just the rogue, but a man with his own sense of right and wrong. Leia is no longer just the princess in need of help, she can push back on Han and control situations like she could only try to in the first. Darth Vader is no longer just the antagonist, he's now got a more complex goal of turning the hero to his side of the overall conflict. These characters are far more interesting in this second adventure than the first, and the story's structure of the second film is built to allow these characters to actually move through actions and change.The center and highlight really is Luke. As I wrote a second ago, he's wildly arrogant at the start of this film. He goes out to check out a meteorite on his own and escapes from the clutches of a giant snow beast without help from anyone else. He also leads the successful feint against the incoming Empire attack on the Rebel base on Hoth, providing enough time for the transports to get away free and destroying a few of the AT-ATs as well. When he's sent to Dagobah to find Obi-wan's former master, Yoda, he thinks that he's beyond humility. He doesn't need it. He's awesome. But from the moment he lands on Dagobah, he fails at everything he does through the rest of the film. The capstone of his training is when he walks into the cave and fails to use the Force in the ways that Yoda had dictated, fighting the phantom version of Darth Vader and revealing that he had only defeated himself in the fight. He fails to raise his X-wing from the swamp. He fails to maintain control of his emotions when visions of Han and Leia suffering come to him. He fails to listen to Leia's explicit warnings of a trap. He fails in his fight against Darth Vader, only escaping through a desperate act of falling down a giant hole.His constant stream of failures, capped by his failed confrontation with Darth Vader, humbles Luke. He no longer feels like he can face the evils of the universe alone. Dangling from the underbelly of Cloud City with only one hand, he calls out to Leia, desperate for any help. Even in the final moments of the film, he stands with his friends, not apart, and has become part of a plan to help the captured Han instead of running out there alone. Luke's journey in this film is fantastic all the more because it undermines the hero's journey he went through in the first. It goes against the idea of how we think hero's behave and succeed after their great victories.It's the character work that really makes the film work, but the movie continues the first film's proud tradition of great design. There are expansions of the world in things like the Super Star Destroyer and the walking tanks the AT-ATs. Yoda is a creature come alive with puppetry. The fighters, the planets, and creatures are all great. The special effects move the technology of the first film forward, and it's always in the service of the great story and character journeys at the heart of the film.Acting takes another step up as well. Moving directing duties from ""Faster, more intense"" George Lucas to Irvin Kershner was a surprisingly good choice overall, but it makes sense once you realize that The Empire Strike Back is more character film than science fiction adventure.The Empire Strikes Back is a magnificent sequel that takes the characters from the preceding adventure seriously and gives them space to grow, propelling them through an adventure that truly tests them. It very rightly stands atop the world of genre fiction as one of the its greatest accomplishments.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Incredible StoryThis,"This film is incredible. I am so thankful for George Lucas and his boldness in writing it. I have watched quite a few documentaries on the Star Wars series and each documentary gives me more and more appreciation for the three films that came out in the 70's. Lucas took quite a risk with the Star Wars franchise and it (obviously) paid off for him. If you haven't, I would definitely suggest looking up some of these documentaries in order to see what the project was actually like when it was first made. The crew and cast describes it as a lot of chaos and self-doubt until its first debut when it gained its cult following. The way that Lucas wrote and directed these films is a tribute to his true genius and success.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My #1 movie of all time,"When The Empire Strikes Back was released for the first time, I didn't think it would be as good as the very first Star Wars that was released because usually a sequel isn't as good as a prequel. But boy was I ever wrong!!! In my opinion, I think that this is not only the best sequel, but the best movie ever made.Everthing about this movie is excellent, from the battle that's taken place on Hoth, to the climatic battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skwalker, where Luke finds out about his secret destiny.....This movie also introduces a new character named Yoda {who is about the size of a dachshund when it stands on 2 legs}. If you were to see Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of The Clones, you would find out why people in the Star Wars universe call him ""master"". I like the way he sounds like say fozzie bear from the muppet babies and his backwards spelling like, ""Powerful jedi, was he.""As I said with another review about ""Return Of The Jedi"", I owe it all to George Lucas. Without him, Star Wars wouldn't have been created. Thanks George Lucas!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Most Powerful Star Wars Movie,"The Empire Strikes Back is an example of how well done a sequel can be, it takes the series to a whole new level and is an improvement over A New Hope. The amazing thing is that this time Lucas wasn't the director. That doesn't change anything, he guided Irvin and ESB is still his creation.This time everything is on a larger scale. The battles aren't puny and meaningless, they are actual battles. The movie starts with the battle for the icy world Hoth. From there the plot splits in 2, one being with Luke and one with the rest: Leia, Han, Chewie, 3PO and R2.We are explained in more detail how the Force works and we see how truly powerful the Empire is. Thanks to the money Lucas earned from A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back has better special effects and some splendid locations, including Hoth and Bespin.But it's not all about battles, the love story part of the series is also developed, Luke's struggle to understand the Force and use it continues, while Vader is more determined than ever.Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is a remarkable chapter of the Star Wars saga.Final Score: 5/5 or 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Maybe even better than original,"I'm not sure which part I liked more - this one or the original. But this part sure is better in some terms. Like special effects, which were really better than in the first part (probobly because of the bigger budged). It's also better in terms of action. The sword fights were much more impressive than in first part. The starship battles were also very impressive and pretty realistic. Many new colorful and very important characters appeared in this part. What else did I liked was Darth Vader's position in this part. Here he looked more dangerous and independent than in the first part. It's a really entertaining movie and it's worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Probably better than Star Wars,"Call me blasphemous, but cinematically, The Empire Strikes back is far superior to the original Star Wars. We pick up shortly after the destruction of the Death Star. The Empire has dispatched probe droids to find the rebels. One probot finds a base on the remote world of Hoth. Frustrated, the rebels must bug out. Commander Luke Skywalker and his flight team make their stand against giant AT-AT Walkers and Imperial Snow Stormtroopers. Meanwhile, Leia cannot get to her transport, so Han Solo must get her out on the Millennium Falcon. Darth Vader is obsessed with finding Skywalker so he wants the Falcon. He will stop at nothing--even asteroids. Vader tracks them to Bespin where Han hopes an old friend, Lando can help out. However, Vader beat them there and force Lando to turn them over. Luke ventures to Dagobah to meet Yoda, the Jedi Master. There he undergoes training to be a Jedi. As he learns to focus the Force, he has a vision of Han and Leia suffering in a city in the clouds. He leaves training prematurely to face Vader. He is not ready. And he learns of Vader's secret. Star Wars was an introduction and The Empire Strikes Back goes deeper. At the outset, we learn more about the Force and how it can help. It was only vaguely touched on in the first one. We also learn more of Vader's sinister side. In the first one, his presence and appearance exuded evil. In this one, he demonstrates it through dispatching the Empire officers who fail him. We also get to see Leia and Han grow closer. Their love blossoms and grows. They had real chemistry. Finally, Luke really grows. He is the impatient, naive, and adventurous boy. He suffers for his decision. This forces him to mature. While some people found Chewabaca's incessant howling over the fate of Han Solo, I found it touching, giving the great side-kick alien depth and soul. The magic of Star Wars is unmeasurable. It was great swashbuckling fun with age old themes of good triumphing over evil. It allowed us to escape and be struck with wonder and awe. Empire, though, is thoughtful, deep, analytical, and fun. The audience will identify with Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie all the more because of their suffering. At this point, they were no longer larger than life, but human. I compare this to falling in love. With Star Wars, the infatuation and lust begins. With Empire, the love deepens and becomes solid. If it never happened, the love would not mature. This is Lucas truly at his best. I hope he recaptures this someday.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's Good But Is It Really That Great ?,"A conjunction is a word linking two sentences .

The film gets off to a great start where the rebel forces on the Planet Hoth have to fight a battle against The Imperial Empire who are attacking the base using giant robotic camels . That alone makes it worth seeing and we get some smart liners between Han Solo and Princess lela and we get some smooth patter from Lando who gives a masterclass in how to impress a womanBut ( There's always a conjunction )most of the spectacle is confined to the first half of the film and after that the story concentrates on all the spiritual nonsense involving the force between Yoda and Luke Skywalker .

Watching Hamill try and carry his scenes shows how unimpressive he is and how good the rest of the cast are in comparisonTHE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a good Summer blockbuster but the brutal truth is that it's no more than that . It was made in an era before CGI dominated spectacular FX driven films at the turn of the century and that alone makes it worth seeing even if the most impressive scenes happen in the first half .

Definately the WORST of the original trilogy.,"This film is without a doubt the worst of the Star Wars movies. I have no idea why people say that this is the best. Watching Episode 5 is watching a really really good movie...then the ending destroys it from being supurb.The film is bigger and has better qualities than the first. It really develops the characters. Han Solo and Princess Leia's off and on love story is very entertaining. Yoda, one of the best Star Wars characters, is introduced, and begins to enlighten Luke on the ways of a Jedi, something we really only heard about in Episode 4.Episode 5 is chock full of excellent special effects (for it's time), the ice planet Hoth is one of my favorite worlds in the Star Wars universe.Everything in this film is better than the first, the acting, the plot, the action. Then it all crashes with the ending...which is so abrupt it's like they just ran out of film that they had to cut it short. I mean they treated it like a TV show, leaving all of the characters in the middle of action and saying ""Tune in next week, same Star Wars time, same Star Wars channel!"" This all leads to them having to finish what they started in Episode 5 in the first 30 or so minutes of Episode 6, giving less time to develop the plot in Episode 6.In the end this is a good movie, bigger than the first, but unless you have enough time to watch it back to back with Return of the Jedi, I can't really recommend it, because it just feels unfinished to me.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the worthiest sequels of all time,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter George Lucas's Star Wars had wowed the world in 1977, the same world eagerly waited the big sequel that followed three years later, that was loved just as much, in some cases slightly more so, than the first film. It no doubt took twice as much effort to make, and drew in a huger box office crowd, and in doing so The Empire Strikes Back established itself as the film that rivalled the film it followed on from.All the main characters from the first film are back, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) and lovable non humans Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO, along with new addition Lando (a charismatic turn by Billy Dee Williams) a rogue pal of Han's who's now the head of his own establishment, as well of course as Yoda, the tiny green martian with wisdom who guides Luke on his way. The story's a bit too lost in names of special planets, spaceships and character names that only the most ardent sci-fi nerd is going to follow intently, but once again, the sheer spectacle and grandeur of Lucas's work over-shadows everything, a remarkable vision that still hasn't dated or staled over 25 years on.So sit back, relax and prepare to witness the sheer scale of escapist entertainment. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Return to Innocence,"Hoth. Yoda. Cloud City. That moment when you realize family really does matter  priceless.Individually these words represent small facets of pop culture, making whatever the question is in Trivial Pursuit obviously ""Star Wars"", but when you put them together, in this order, the words ""Empire Strikes Back"" will inevitably fall from your mouth. The second chapter (or fifth, however you count them) in Lucas' grandiose space opera involves a frozen planet, a little green man, the force, family, and eventually a good old fashioned hand losing. (Should I have put Billy Dee Williams somewhere in there?) A personal favorite among the original three, I grapple with words because what can be said about this film that hasn't already been said dozens, even hundreds of times. This is a staple to my youth, a film series that I have seen over and over in no particular order. For this viewing, I went with the classic Laserdisc edition which reminded me that no amount of special effect could change the heart of the story. What can be said? What should be said? In Skywalker's famous words to Yoda, ""I can give it a try""  we all know, by heart, what will follow next.""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the strongest chapter in the original trilogy for three reasons. The first is that we have three subsequent chapters, each dealing with a different world, in a different galaxy far, far away. Lucas, in my eyes, has expanded his opera into more than just a desert planet, or a wooded terrain, or on a star that causes death; he grew and blossomed with this film. As audience members, we believe in each of the settings, we understand how cold it is on Hoth, we can feel the moisture on Degoba planet, and our fear of heights is prevalent in Cloud City. Lucas defines, travels, and leaves out no detail as he escapes with us through this expanding universe. Moving onto a second note, this is a darker chapter. Without repeating what so many others have said before, Lucas challenges us to escape from scene after scene of battle (albeit he does put a small dusting in) and listen to the words that his characters are telling us. He places small Easter eggs throughout that still gives us goose bumps as we watch (and understand), he hints towards the final chapter, but without really giving us the entire sandwich, just a sample. This smattering of the unknown, the final scenes where Vader reveals his journal's secret to Luke, the iconic nature of the slicing of the hand, all of this matches against any battle scene any science fiction director could create. Lucas has always been criticized for his lack of character development in his six-part series, and with Jar-Jar I can understand, but he had hit his stride with what he wanted from his leads. I could see the spark between Leia and Han, the love between Chewie and C3PO, and Yoda's Oz like abilities when he explains to Luke that the force lives in nature. Lucas is telling us, giving us the chance to see that the final battle will be a line up between Nature and Machine  get ready Ewoks. Finally, this film is the strongest because it is a victorious battle for the dark side of the force. Very rarely do movie audiences walk out of a theater and feel as if hope has been crushed on the curb. Each time I view this film, I get this child-like sensation that maybe, just maybe, Vader and the Emperor will crush this little Rebel Alliance in the final chapter and reign supreme forever. ""Empire Strikes Back"" gives you that sense of possible dark side victory, with the call of the bounty hunters, the frozen carbonate, and the loss of Skywalker's ambidextrous abilities. Think of it this way, was the Dark Side really that evil, or did they just wear black and pursue those that were unwilling to follow the law? Goth British police officers?In all honesty, ""Empire Strikes Back"" could be re-watched at this moment. There are less big fight sequences than in ""Return of the Jedi"", and there are less moments of confusion and droid humor, ""Empire"" stands on its own because it remains an elusive, dark chapter. Our leads, those that we have given our hopes, hearts, and dreams to, have all been fooled, tricked, or captured, and it feels confined (like it is only the Millennium Falcon vs. an entire armada of Star Destroyers) in this middle chapter. You leave the theater wondering about that infamous ""Who shot J.R.?"" moment, and a desire to see the Force be victorious. To me, this middle chapter gave the Dark Side of the Force an equal opportunity to make a case for itself; ""Star Wars"" is an equal opportunity employer.Obviously, I loved this film. It has been a staple, like so many others, in my youth for years and further into my adulthood. I love these characters, these worlds, the unknown, and especially Lucas' vision. Despite the criticism of the ""new"" chapters, we will always have the original to go back to in any shape or form.Without sounding repetitive, watch this series.

Spark their imagination, and you will not be disappointed.Grade: ***** out of *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I guess that the Force will be with the original series forever!,"I don't know whether or not ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was better than ""Star Wars"" or not, but it's pretty much equally good. Since everyone knows the plot, I figure that I'll just talk about a few aspects. It's weird to think that Yoda was only introduced here; he's been such a central character in the series that it's easy to forget that he didn't star in Episode 4! In some ways, watching ""TESB"", you get the feeling that the people behind the scenes realized how lucky the series was making them, and so they decided to go all out. And they do just that.

One of my favorite movies(along with The Phantom Menace),"The Empire Strikes Back is one of the few movies I call pitch perfect. Everything is flawless- the action? Edge of your seat! The drama? Heart-wrenching and powerful! The comedy? Frequently clever and hysterical! The special effects? Better than A New Hope, and then some! As for the 2004 DVD version, it still has the original flavor of the theatrical cut, the touches are few, and still has most shots from the original version. Also, may I add that all of the characters are perfectly developed and lovable, villain or hero. Han Solo is a great character in this, all because of his charming and awesome performance by Harrison Ford. My favorite character from Star Wars is Chewbacca, and there is no exception here. The stop motion animation done with the AT-ATs and the Taun-Tauns still are amazing today, and the wonders of the ship battles are just as beautiful.

"A Masterful, Groundbreaking, & Timeless Film with Mesmerizing Effects and Standout Performances by Hamill & Co.","The Empire Strikes Back is an absolute classic science fiction film released back in 1980. It continues the story of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo as they battle the evil Galactic Empire.One of the many strengths of this film is its intricate and well-developed plot, which includes numerous engaging twists and turns. The film's visual effects and breathtaking action sequences are mesmerizing, and are elevated by John Williams' iconic musical score.The Empire Strikes Back also delves deeper into the mythos of the Star Wars universe, introducing legendary characters such as Yoda, and exploring the concept of the Force in greater detail. The film's central themes of temptation, sacrifice, and redemption are expertly explored through the character arcs of the protagonists, making this installment both emotionally satisfying and thought-provoking.On a technical level, the film is an undeniable triumph, with excellent production design, costumes, and special effects that hold up even by today's standards. The performances of the cast, especially Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, are also standout.In conclusion, The Empire Strikes Back is a masterful and groundbreaking film that is a must-see for fans of science fiction and action.

this is a good movie.,"For the 1977 film, see Star Wars (film). For other uses, see Star Wars (disambiguation). Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise centered on a film series created by George Lucas. The film series, consisting of two trilogies (and an upcoming third), has spawned an extensive media franchise called the Expanded Universe including books, television series, computer and video games, and comic books. These supplements to the franchise resulted in significant development of the series' fictional universe, keeping the franchise active in the 16- year interim between the two film trilogies. The franchise depicts a galaxy described as ""far, far away"" in the distant past, and commonly portrays Jedi as a representation of good, in conflict with the Sith, their evil counterpart. Their weapon of choice, the lightsaber, is commonly recognized in popular culture.

Almost Flawless,"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is arguably the best Star Wars film ever made, and one of the best films ever made. The film immortalized the already iconic characters that George Lucas created in Star Wars, while making a very dense and entertaining film. The Empire Strikes Back is so great because of the improvements made to Darth Vader, the ambitious tonal change, and the fact that it still contains one of the best twists ever. With enough analysis the most impressive thing about The Empire Strikes Back is how hard it is to find flaws in the film.Darth Vader still stands, and probably always will stand as one of the best villains ever brought to the screen, second on my list only to The Dark Knight's Joker. However, in Vader's first appearance Vader is slightly inconsistent in that he's a temperamental villain often yelling, which isn't nearly as scary as a villain who remains calm. I would contest that the best villains act like they are always in control, whether they are not, it is in The Empire Strikes Back that Vader develops into this villain, while also systematically murdering his failing accomplices. It could be argued that Vader's development helped the tonal change that Empire Strikes Back brought.It's another testament to the villain, when they are so chilling that the tone of the film seemingly dives with them. As Vader develops into the more controlled, systematic villain the tone of the film dives into a darker world. With Star Wars being considered, at least partially, a kids film it seems extremely ambitious of Lucas and Kershner to make a film directed at kids dark, something many filmmakers are unwilling to do today. The dark tone helps accentuate the character development as the characters hit their all time lows, and the film's tone represents that the world isn't always nice.The story for Empire Strikes Back, being the middle film in the trilogy, had the most freedom, and used it accordingly. The story of Empire Strikes back is arguably, the strongest in the series, as the film was one of the earliest to say the bad guy can win, in a giant blockbuster, another very ambitious move. However, the best element of the story is the unpredictable turns it makes, in particular it's iconic twist. The twist remains one of the most famous of all time, for a reason, and the film benefits from it.In the end Empire Strikes Back has the best story in the trilogy, the best character development, is very ambitious, and immortalizes it's iconic villain. On top of all of that it has been copied numerous times over the years, and remains one of the best films ever made. Empire Strikes Back still stands as the embodiment of what makes Star Wars so great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The action is stunning, the visuals still look ground-breaking today.

"""Laugh it up fuzzball!""","Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) -Before I start the review of this film I will state that I do love it, because I love all of the Star Wars universe, especially the original trilogy, but also because it was a really well made film and it was delivered excellently in the same way as the first.I may ramble and reminisce a bit too much at times, not there should be some sort of point to it and actually that's the affect that these films have on a lot of people.This film didn't fall in to the usual trap of a sequel, with repetition and pointless continuation just for the sake of making money. It had some great moments, including laughs, action, space fighting, romance, the whole lot and with an original plot that continued the story because it needed to.I wouldn't have liked to have turned up to it without having seen 'Star Wars' (1977) beforehand and if you have to finish things off due to some sort of O. C. D., like I do, you will need to watch the next one, 'Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi' (1983) too, because this one ends on a cliffhanger.It works as Episode ""V"" of the original 3 (V, IV & VI - Ask George) and of the larger nonet that it became with the release of the Prequel Trilogy (1999/2002/2005?) and the more recent Sequels (2015/2017/2019) too and many regard it very highly on its own, but it certainly couldn't have been released or have been so successful without Episode IV, because I needed to know where they came from, who Ben was, why Luke had magic powers and so on.With that aside, I think that I mostly tend to appreciate this film, because I only remember seeing ""IV"" and ""VI"" on TV as a child, with maybe a few clips of this one, until my parents finally got a Video Cassette Player and of course the all important Cassettes to go with it, which came quite a bit later due to these highly popular productions actually being quite expensive back then.As a result I probably haven't seen this one as often as the other two, but feel a nostalgia based on a clearer teenage mind watching it almost new, as opposed to a 7 year old's memories of cute Teddy Bears (Ewoks) for instance.The story and the character development was great, because it meant that there was more of the universe that I already loved and I got to know my favourites better, whilst other great personalities like Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and Yoda (Frank Oz) were introduced.""Empire"" actually had some of the better jokes, a great story and many of the classic moments that have since been turned in to memes. Harrison Ford looked mighty fine as Han Solo too.The update of the film, when it was digitally remastered, added some beautiful colours to places like Cloud City and clarity for the rest of the film. I also finally got to see more clearly what it was that attacked Luke at the beginning of the film, which, fun fact, was written in because of a car accident that he had in between recording, which left his face quite hideously disfigured.I also thought that they had realised that Harry had given them a lot more than they had expected in the first film and they seemed to have decided to expand his role in this one to make him more than just a roguish taxi driver. They later did the same, quite cleverly, with Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) in the sequel films, because although the Jedi bit is great, the films have always relied on these additional characters to keep the action going in other ways while the young Padawan gets trained or has extended laser sword fights.The brilliance of this instalment was also added to by yet another superb soundtrack provided by John Williams, who managed to almost completely create something new, on top of the existing themes, but without it being far far away from the general style of sound already used.As far as I'm concerned, you can't go wrong with any of the Star Wars films (Skip 'The Last Jedi' - 2017), because they contain so much heart and a vast knowledge of the film history that had been collated in George Lucas' mind while he grew up. That was obvious with nods to many of the other great epic western, medieval, sci-fi and war films and tales that went before and of course the polish he delivered with each of the films in this series, not to forget the brilliance that came from his own imagination and the superb supporting special effects created by the ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) studios.I look at other films from the late 70's and early 80's and wonder why they didn't put as much in to it as the people that made this original trilogy, because it obviously worked if you want to create something that lasted.962.22/1000.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Cinema Personified: Brilliant Movie,"Rating: 9.7
Overall, a brilliant movie that really builds on where the last movie left off and improves on it in so many ways to make it a very memorable film that is not only the best in the series but in film history as we see a more mature Star Wars in the characters that take part in it.Great Direction (The actual moving of the story and making sure all pieces come together is incredible managed and executed, and this movie is a definite improvement in directing people than its predecessor as the director was really able to get more out of his actors in their performances for this time around), Very Good to Great Acting (Very Good from the Live-Action Cast; Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Very Good from Mark Hamill (showed the progress he has made from being a naive/hopeful kid to someone more cognizant of the present and the work he needs to put in to be a better Jedi), Great from Harrison Ford (the real star of the show in all his scenes as he smooth/cool nature really helps show how great of a character Han Solo really is (and he really cleaned up the delivery of his lines in this movie as there are not any awkward pauses as there were last time), Good to Very Good from Carrie Fisher (She really improves this time around as she is given more freedom to play as opposed to last time; she also really grows as a character from being the damsel in distress to being a loving leader), Good to Very Good from Billy Dee Williams (Really becomes a memorable presence in all the scenes he is in with his cool nature that conflicts/competes with Han, though there is some hiccups in delivery as he is still getting used to the Star Wars universe as opposed to the other members of the cast), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship; and really grows the character to show how loving he is towards his new friends), Great to Incredible from Frank Oz (Really brought the character of Yoda to life with the puppeteering and the vocal performance, Good to Very Good from the rest of the Live-Action cast; Very Good from the rest of the Vocal/Costumed-Characters cast), Incredible Story (Really sets up different elements of the universe very nicely and uses the concept of parallel storylines very well; also has some of the most iconic moments of the series and does a good job in building the downfall of the characters; the only issue this time around is that it does not have the ability to build worlds like the previous film could), Great Screenplay (The dialogue this time around felt way more natural and was better written; the screenplay still shines is the foreshadowing to future Star Wars events, symbolism, iconic lines (with it having one of the most iconic lines/plot twists in cinema (or even narrative) history)), Brilliant Score (Takes what was great from the previous film and adds some new themes that really make this score stand out as well), Great to Incredible Cinematography (Which really stands out in the Luke vs. Vader scene), Very Good Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life, but there are some issues with Sound in this movie as there feels like a delayed sound with the lightsabers (which is very annoying if you have watched the prequels)), Very Good to Great Editing, Very Good Visual Effects (This movie does not really go overboard with the new visuals of the re-release as much as the other movies so it is easier to comment on), Incredible to Brilliant Production Design (Created some very iconic sets that are well remembered in history, and really added to that with the Hoth/Dagobah/Bespin sets which are regarded as some of the best in all of Star Wars), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context), Plot Structure was very well written as it has three major parallel story lines that all converge to the climax and the end (something that helps keep the audience engaged to see how the different arcs are coming along), Pacing was better in this movie as it felt more consistent and not as slow as the last one, Build to climax is done very nicely as it is really pivots the franchise into seeing who these characters really are as they have to make important decisions for the future; Climax was the best part of the movie as we get to see what Luke's training has come to/seeing the rest of the crew into action as we get to see how much the characters have grown yet see how far they really are to their goals in the sage; moreover one of the most important lines in history is delivered in this climax that make Star Wars a franchise memorable, Tone does not play as much into the space opera or science fiction epic as the last one but does have shades of it; feels more like a standout movie that really transcends genre in many ways (while still keeping the same star wars charm), Really can be felt of as a stand alone movie (even though it leaves so much to be answered with its ending) as we get to see the rise and fall of the characters as they must continue their own individual quests to grow as characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
May the rose-tinted glasses be with you,"Not for the life of me do I understand how people think this is better than its predecessor. Yes it has its moments but there is a distinct drop in quality, not least when it comes to the special effects. At times it looks like watching a close up of toy spaceships being moved around on fishing wire.The development of Skywalker is poor throughout these films and is particularly bad here. His progression from outer-galactic farmhand to Jedi Knight is laughably far-fetched and just doesn't seem feasible. His tutelage under Yoda is under-done and the use of 'The Force' as a plot band-aid is tiresome and insincere, a clear example of Lucas' often childish writing.The battle scenes were poor in A New Hope but get even worse in Empire Strikes Back. Very poor choreography and, even for 1980, pretty amateurish special effects. Did people really find the battle between Skywalker and Vader in any way engaging? I honestly just don't get it.There is plenty to admire about this film and it's certainly not the worst sequel ever made but a classic it is surely not.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's easy to say. It's more difficult to explane: The best movie ever made,"The saga continues (please excuse me for some dumb spelling mistakes, they just got here)... The first Star Wars movie didn't really turn me into a deep star wars fanatic, but I must say, theese three movies are my absolute favorites!The second (or fifth, whatever it is the same anyway) part of the trilogy, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' is just as good as all the others. At some points it is more of a direct remake of the first movie, but mostly it is new profiles and new stories to experience. I thought the rescuing of an innocent princess was magic. Boy! Here (for those who did not knew) Luke gets to the ''Dagobah-system'' to find the Jedi-master Yoda, Obi Wan's master. There he will learn to suffer hard training, and wild adventures until he finnaly meets the master of darkness, Darth Vader. In the same leap goes Han Solo's adventure in Lando Calrissian's city in the clouds, together with Chewie, Leia, C3PO and R2-D2. It's pure magic, and that special effects got better after three years didn't make things worse. I love theese films. May them live forever!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"""No, I am your father""","The Empire Strikes Back expands upon the established world of Star Wars without forgetting what made the first movie so amazing. The effects are just as enthralling as they were in Star Wars (if not more so), as shown in the amazing new worlds that Empire introduces (Hoth, Cloud City, Dagobah), and John Williams once again blows us away with a score that is on par with his work in the previous movie.
The story takes us in a different direction than Star Wars, giving the audience a greater insight into the workings of the Empire and Darth Vader's character. Vader's arc culminates in his iconic confrontation with Luke Skywalker at Cloud City, which ends with possibly the greatest twist in movie history.
Empire's story is more mature than its predecessor, and leading actors have matured and greatly improved as well (props to Mark Hamill, who did about half of his scenes with a puppet and still made them believable). The dialogue is sharp, the camera work is clean, and new iconic characters get to shine in this movie. I especially loved when Yoda gave his explanation of what the force is, increasing the audience's understanding without removing any its mysticism.
Overall, this movie expertly balances pretty much every aspect it should. The acting, the visual set pieces, the sound design, the score, and the story all shine, combining to create a masterpiece of a movie.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Even better than the first one and rightfully a highly beloved and cherished part of popular culture!,"When I was a kid and was years away from watching ""Star Wars"" franchise myself, I was watching a soccer game with my dad and I distinctly remember that the commentator said ""The empire strikes back."" when a goal was scored against our country. I am not from USA, I am from Croatia. And I can guarantee you most of the adults who heard that understood the reference. That alone should tell you how much this movie is beloved and immortalized in popular culture. Even though the first movie was a giant success, this didn't mean making the sequel was easy. There were, again, problems with the budget and with filming and editing, but, in the end, we still received an amazing movie due to imagination of George Lucas and the talent of the people working on the movie! This time, the plot is faster, more focused and darker than in the first movie, but the whole thing is still very entertaining and fills you with warmth only movies made with a lot of effort, care and love put into them can. Basically, if you weren't won over by the first movie, there's nothing here to change your mind for the worse and you can only be impressed. But if you didn't like these movies in the first place, you wouldn't be reading this random review from some guy from Croatia, yet here you are, waiting for some random stranger to praise this movie for bazzilionth time. And don't worry, I will!

"The best of the ""Star Wars"" films","No matter what you think 'defines' ""Star Wars""- the action sequences, the detailed and enthralling mythos, the memorable characters, the romance, or just the atmosphere of adventure, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is in just about every way the most rewarding viewing experience out of any of the six live action ""Star Wars"" films (I have not seen ""Clone Wars"" and don't intend to right now). Why? Because it pulls off what ""Revenge of the Sith"" failed at: creating a compelling and well-written character-driven story while still delivering plenty of action, humor, and remaining an homage to the serials of the 1930's and 40's.It's surprising that there remains debate over how right or wrong critics were on the film at the time of its release, when it received not negative nor very positive reviews, but mixed ones leaning towards the positive side, generally. Few critics initially recognized the superiority of this screenplay to the first film in the series, and not only its relative complexity but its richness in its allusions to and utilization of literature and films of the past to create its own unique mythos. It's hardly surprising, given that Leigh Brackett was involved in writing the screenplay, some of her greatest achievements in her film career being ""The Big Sleep"", ""The Long Goodbye"", and ""Rio Bravo"", all rich, detailed, and intelligent screenplays.Yes, attempting to argue that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is an intelligent character-based film is fast becoming pointless; you're either preaching to the choir or attempting to convince those with the prequels fresh in their mind that ""Star Wars"" was, once upon a time, a franchise worthy of real praise. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" really does tell a compelling story, however, and it is compelling mostly because we really do care about Luke's journey, we do care about Han Solo, we love Chewie, we adore the banter between R2-D2 and C-3PO, and arguably most of all because Darth Vader isn't just a 'cool' villain, he's a genuinely interesting and compelling character (er, if you can keep Hayden Christensen out of mind). Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett have achieved something rare and special here, a grand Hollywood spectacle which can be analyzed and discussed at great length (which I'm definitely not going to do, if you're interested pick up one of the dozens, hundreds possibly, of books written on the subject, or just do a quick Google search) . It's a great screenplay.Not that there haven't been great screenplays let down by incompetent film-making in the past, but ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is certainly not an example of this. I'm sure ""Star Wars"" fans know much more about the making of this film and how much credit Irvin Kershner deserves for the end result than I do, but for this review I'll credit him with the quality of this film on a technical level. It's an improvement over the first film in many ways, as far as I'm concerned, especially the set design (which is more ambitious here), and the quality of the visuals and even the acting. ""Star Wars"" may have an opening scene and shot which remains magical to this day, but I'd argue that most of this film is memorable and enthralling, with only one or two scenes in the first half hour or so being just 'good'. The acting also improves notably, with the exception of Carrie Fisher (who really just isn't a good actor), Mark Hamill is arguably the most improved since the first film, really coming into his own as Luke Skywalker here, and even giving us one of cinema's few good 'NOOO!!!' moments. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" also introduces us to Yoda, of course, and I'm really surprised at how animated and expressive Yoda is (being, I'm pretty sure, a puppet at this point). The special effects in general are outstanding, outside of a couple of the creatures near the beginning of the film.It's not just that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is an enthralling and exciting film, and an iconic one at that, but it really does work on a deeper level. No, I'm not saying that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is some sort of immeasurably complex and subtle film, but what's impressive about it is that it offers spectacle and humor, but is also a genuinely compelling tale driven by its characters, primarily Luke. It's a great, great movie, and where ""Star Wars"" may fall just short of deserving the sort of praise it gets, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" really is a terrific movie and deserves all the praise it has received and will receive in the future.9.5/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the worst in the history and OMG so much overrated,"The Star Wars movies were the worst movies of all time.Science fiction by itself is bad enough, let alone being a cult-like nerd flick.The music was the best thing, and even that was melodramatic at timesAnd come on, what's the whole ""long time ago"" thing. If we don't have flying machines now, we most certainly didn't have them in the pastOK, so maybe the Star Wars movies don't belong on the bottom 100, but in the top ten is ridiculous.First, the movie does not have a proper ending . It just stops when all the battles have finished and do not explain any other things after the battle. Instead, it only shows a shot of the characters looking out the window. This really disappoints me. Second, about the love between Princess Leia and Han Solo. I have never thought that Leia and Han Solo are a couple until they suddenly kiss. It makes me feel very surprised because the movie does not show any obvious relation between them. Third, the movie does not tell story but showing a battle sequence instead. It is very boring for audience to watch. Finally, the battle of Luke and Darth Vader did not bring out a mood of climax but instead it makes me think that ""It is ridiculous.""",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

My 1st film now I'm 40 : A retrospective - The Empire Strikes Back,"When I was six, two incredibly creative ladies, a mother and daughter babysitting duo named Phillise and Mary Frances, not only introduced me to the imaginative art of Michael Whelan, but they also screened for me my very first vhs; The Empire Strikes Back.To say this experience was life changing is no understatement, especially now as I watch the film again at 40. In fact, it's themes, archetypes and narrative, are even more relatable now as someone even further along their own story.Cinephiles such as yourself, will know, that George Lucas crafted something in consult with his friend and professional academic Joseph Campbell.Joseph John Campbell (March 26, 1904 - October 30, 1987) was an American writer. He was a professor of literature at Sarah Lawrence College who worked in comparative mythology and comparative religion. His work covered many aspects of the human experience and his best-known work is his book 'The Hero with a Thousand Faces' (1949), in which he discusses his theory of the journey of the archetypal hero shared by world mythologies, termed the monomyth.So at the root of the Star Wars story, one still growing with shows like Andor and a new slate under the guidance of Dave Filony and George Lucas once again , is a notion that perhaps this film has the clout and revere it does because the creators succeeded at hiding the vegetables in the cheese in a way no other film has and with such meaningful permanence.The subtext of the film, if open to the idea that films have a subtext and social historical context, is that the Director and writer were performing the age old ritual of offering up a universal story to a scared village. Story serves this purpose in its many forms, including cinema. It brings us together in community so we can escape from the trauma of reality and basked in allegorized aslects if life, projected up on the screen in the same way shamans told and still tell stories by fire or projector light.As you get older and life begins to offer up new existential buffets of fear and death, The Empire Strikes Back, and its tone, plot, themes, performances, lighting, score and subtext, seem to take on even greater meaning. Perhaps the most poignant being the portrayal of things that do actually happen to families and people who living in worlds where empires and villains and there choices can test the individual psyche in ways only Luke Skywalker could know.For me, dealing with the 7 month decline of my mother with brain cancer and witnessing the lack of care and resources for her before and during the pandemic, felt like I was up against evil forces far greater than me. The test of seeing her suffer in a broken healthcare system in crisis, and then being placated by administrators, doctors, nurses and ceos aware of the resource issues and poor care but unable to agree or admit and unwilling to do anything about it, pit me in a psychological battle that tested my wits and strength in ways that made me the worse version of myself, one who was angry. The struggle to deal with anger, much like Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalkers, is the struggle to deal with emotions in the face of injustice, but not just any injustice, injustice that claims one's family.If we look at the present state of the world, one cannibalizing itself in misinformation, political scandal, war, environmental collapse, mental health crisis, the disappearance of the middle class, the rise of fanaticism, the phenomenon of mass shootings, broken healthcare and education systems, nuclear proliferation, pandemics, and perhaps the greatest threat, the unregulated advance and public experiment of A. I., well it certainly does seem like age of evil empires and heroes up against unspeakable odds and bad actors.This is why at 40, with all that's happened since I first watched the film at 6, the story continues to gains in importance and meaning. Yes it's just a silly space opera, but it also represents every persons own struggle against forces they cannot control. Welding the force represents obtaining balance, and in real life, balance is a myth. We all want to be Jedi's, we all want our families to just be safe and get along, we all want to be loved, we all want to live on as force ghosts, and we all want an Ewok baby to cuddle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The best part of the first trilogy!!!!!!,"I still think that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best one of the trilogy. I haven't seen the new Star Wars movie yet but that won't last for long. The reason why I think that this one's the best of the first trilogy, is because it is the darkest, it's the best sequel I've ever seen and it's got all the ingredients (romance, adventure etc.). Myfavorite scenes are still the ""asteroid belt sequence"" (I still don't know exactly how they pulled this one of) and the lightsabre duel at the end of the film.The fourth film was as George Lucas said primarily about introducing the characters. The fifth film was a more complicated one. It had to function as the bridge between episodes IV and VI. The drama was also more intense in this movie than in the other episodes. The last installment of the first made trilogy was primarily the climax or the ending of the complete told story.My final remark, if you haven't seen the Star Wars trilogy yet, wait until George Lucas has finished the Prequals.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Film That Truly MADE Star Wars. The template for a perfect sequel.,"It's 1980. For three years, you've been eagerly anticipating the sequel to Star Wars, a film that almost immediately becomes a fixture of pop culture. In this pre-internet age, all you can rely on are interviews given by George Lucas and discussions with other fans in basements, comic book stores, school grounds etc.And then, The Empire Strikes Back comes out. I don't think it's exaggeration to say that without this movie, Star Wars wouldn't be what it is. Sure, the first movie is a masterpiece and transfixed audiences immediately. But THIS is what I think of when I think of Star Wars. The world George Lucas introduced us to in 1977 feels far larger, lusher, and more lived in this time around.Whereas the first was undoubtedly a low budget, yet ambitious movie, this one feels BIG from the opening moments of the film. The costumes are better. The set design is better. The effects are better. The performances are better. The writing is better. Everything feels so much more elevated. It's also an objectively better shot movie; while the first has iconic moments, it doesn't have a ton of awe inspiring shots or imagery. This one? I think the final battle with Luke and Vader - especially in the beginning - is one of the most visually striking moments put to film.The set design feels elevated as well; Hoth, Dagobah, and Cloud City show us so much more of the galaxy of Star Wars than the first one did. I also feel like the performances are way more confident; Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher have electric chemistry and their romance is so well done (also, note to the guys: all women like good men who can be scoundrels sometimes, it's not that hard). Mark Hamill gives a far more nuanced and complex performance this time around as Luke; you see so much more of his flaws as a human being, especially when contrasted with Yoda (whose first appearance is still his best).And then, there's Darth Vader. Thematically, he almost feels like the main character. Vader was cool in the first one. In this one though, he feels like a character from myth. The way everyone looks at him with fear, the screen presence he carries, the power he wields. Darth Vader BECAME one of cinema's greatest villains because of this movie. And let's be real, the twist this movie provides (I don't want some kid who's never seen this movie to have it ruined via internet review - as irrational as it is) is probably the gold standard in cinema. Right? The single most iconic twist in film history.If you couldn't tell, this is my favourite Star Wars film (not a radical opinion, obviously). To me, it encapsulates everything great about Star Wars and is truly one of the greatest sequels of all time. There's a reason why every great sequel is compared to The Empire Strikes Back. It expands upon the first, improves upon it, and leaves us wanting more. It's a perfect movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

mature sci-fi,"The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars - Episode V, is often hailed as the best of the films. This rests on that it is the least action driven of the 6 films and instead relies on story and dialogue. Yet it is definitely not a s good as Star Wars or Return of the Jedi. It looks likes it will be the most mature work. But it suffers from lacking th e freshness of Star Wars and doesn't the sense of conclusion that Return of the Jedi has.Like Revenge of the Jedi its pessimistic tone gives the impression that this is th more mature serious work.The plot of the film doesn't develop the story. Its simply the Empire hunting down the rebels. Missing Empire the Strikes Back doesn't affect the understanding of the story of the 3 films.Its positives are the relationship between Han Solo and Leia and the famous scenes between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.

The Retaliatory move of Darth Vader and the Empire,"""New Hope"" showed the whole world that fiction can be adventurous, fun, and new worlds, as George Lucas showed, need further disclosure. A new film was needed that would continue the story of the confrontation between a small army of rebels and an unshakable and gloomy Empire led by Darth Vader. The fans got such a movie.The very title reveals the essence of the upcoming conflict. The Empire and its Death Star had suffered a crushing defeat, which meant that a retaliatory strike was needed, a step that would make the rebels lose. And this film perfectly demonstrates how the stakes are rising in this legendary confrontation.The main characters have matured noticeably, they have grown up, become more serious. Their characters are perfectly shown in the events that surround them. It seems that the actions in the previous movie were like a starting point. Now each of the heroes chooses his own unique path. Luke Skywalker, as the main character, decides to become what he did not think a few years ago - a Jedi, a warrior of light, who once and for all must defeat evil in the person of Vader and Emperor Sidious, who is still flashing in the background. Obi-Wan Kenobi's self-sacrifice seems to have made him an adult overnight, made him feel indebted to this old teacher. And then Luke accepts this burden of fate, intending to fight to the last.Leia Organa and Han Solo are testing the strength of their fragile relationship so far, they do not want to give in to each other. All this happens against the background of the struggle with the imperial armies and a series of betrayals, when it turns out that friends can no longer be trusted. In the maelstrom of events, news comes under the finale, which is now fashionable to call a ""twist"". This is an event that turns out unexpectedly, something that turns the whole narrative upside down or vice versa. The history of Star Wars was probably one of the first to show this technique in the cinema. This is remembered for many years, and the play of the actors (those who saw it will understand which actor and what situation I'm talking about) amazes with its sincerity and literally makes the audience tremble from the discovery that happened.However, this seemingly gloomy picture is not devoid of positive interesting moments. Huge Wookiees, droids and ridiculous situations allow you to dilute this tragic story of one family.The creators of the picture skillfully use the technologies available at that time, which enable viewers to see and, most importantly, believe in the reality of those worlds that are shown to us on the screen. All this is flavored with excellent dialogues, colorful characters and a wonderful musical component. What the Imperial March that appeared here is worth, which for decades will become the personification of the yoke of evil, the approaching dangerous Darth Vader.The creators perfectly show several storylines and interactions between the characters at once. There is a love relationship, and the relationship between mentor and student, a test of friendly feelings. And each of the lines is successfully woven into the overall plot, makes you empathize and see yourself in these diverse characters, understand their motives, agree or not with their opinion.""The Empire strikes back"" makes it possible to leave our native Land and go on an unprecedented journey, makes you throw away your earthly experiences, understand how much brighter and more dynamic life can be, because it is in a galaxy far, far away, where events happened a long time ago. Cinema will allow you to ask a lot of questions about the meaning of life, about relationships, about the world, which is not only black and white. The world is multifaceted, with its own complexities and ambiguity. And, most importantly, this film will encourage you to see the next one, the one that will complete the classic trilogy and finally put all the dots on the ""E"" for these heroes.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Best. Movie. Ever.,"The exciting story. The enthralling places. The captivating characters. The lively sounds. The overwhelming music. Not to mention the dark mood, the brooding feel, and the seriousness of it all -- hand in hand with the often quoted claim that ""these are movies made for children"". It all comes together in a maelstrom of pure movie magic. This is the pinnacle of ""Star Wars"". It goes straight to the heart... and then through it. It's an emotional bomb.To surpass this would take a miracle. Will it ever happen? I sure hope so. Because I definitely want more of this. (Believe it or not, but the animated series ""The Clone Wars"" comes close.)This is the standard that ""Star Wars"" should look to when charting its future journeys. It is proof that when ""Star Wars"" goes dark, ""Star Wars"" goes good.Seeing this movie, taking it all in, makes me sad. Not just because of the story, not just because of the nostalgia, but also because of the massive contrast it creates against the ""Star Wars"" of today. It's like two different worlds, two different realities.Of all the fleeting sights and sounds reverberating through the dark tunnel of time, this movie runs through it all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

By far the most imaginative part of the Star Wars trilogy,"In the glory days of science fiction, critics wrote about the ''sense of wonder.'' That's what ''The Empire Strikes Back'' creates in us. Like a lot of traditional science fiction, it isn't psychologically complex or even very interested in personalities (aside from some obvious character traits). That's because the characters are not themselves--they are us. We are looking out through their eyes, instead of into them, as we would in more serious drama. We are on a quest, on a journey, on a mythological expedition. The story elements in the ''Star Wars'' trilogy are as deep and universal as storytelling itself. Watching these movies, we're in a receptive state like that of a child--our eyes and ears are open, we're paying attention, and we are amazed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not quite as good as the first, but still a masterpiece","A lot of people say that The Empire Strikes Back, the second of the original Star Wars trilogy, is the best in the entire Star Wars trilogy. Watching it for the first time in a while, in the theater with my parents and a friend of my dad's (who's a big Star Wars fanatic) just today, I found it to be fantastic. Although, it doesn't quite reach the excellence of the original (especially with George Lucas no longer helming as director), it's still fabulous.This movie picks up three years after the original, during the continuing struggles between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. Having destroyed the Death Star, Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) face attack by the Imperial forces and its AT-AT walkers on Ice Planet Hoth. While Han and Leia escape in the Millennium Falcon, Luke, under the guidance of the ghost of his deceased mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness), journeys to the mysterious Swamp Planet Dagobah, in search of Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Yoda's help gives Luke his only chance of survival, when the Dark Side of the Force beckons him into the duel of duels with Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones).Just like in the first movie, the story is exhilarating and engaging. It's also far more mature than the first movie, and perhaps that's a really good thing. That much being said, even though the movie does still have engaging action sequences, it feels a little longer compared to the first movie, though they're roughly the same length. Another thing that holds this movie back from trumping the original is that compared to the first movie, the humor is only in trace amounts, when a story of this caliber could've easily used a little more; R2-D2 and C-3PO, practically the drive of the first movie, are given reduced focus this time around, and their amusing banters are scant.Still, however, the acting is terrific from everybody. Mark Hamill is, once again, fantastic as Luke, perhaps even a little better than the first movie. Everybody else who returns from the first movie is incredible, especially David Prowse (may he rest in peace) and James Earl Jones as the physicality and voice of Darth Vader, respectively. Also joining the cast is legendary puppeteer and actor Frank Oz (best known for Sesame Street and The Muppets), who's just exceptional as Yoda.And just like the original, The Empire Strikes Back is a visual win! It's filmed and edited very shrewdly, especially in the action sequences, and the set design is, of course, phenomenal. And of course, the special effects, despite George Lucas having amped them up since the original release, are incredible for a movie released in 1980, particularly the lightsabers, and on an additional note, the scenes of Luke talking to Obi-Wan's ghost.And last but not least, the music! John Williams returned to score this movie, and once again, he did an incredible job. He composed new cues for this movie, and even reused his famous main theme. It's still as timeless and majestic as the first movie.All things considered, The Empire Strikes Back is an excellent follow-up to the original Star Wars movie. It does fall a little short of the first movie, but it's definitely a must-see for anyone who's a die-hard Star Wars fan!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Film That Truly Shows the Magic of Cinema,"I remember that when I first came into contact with Star Wars, I was around 13 years old.

I myself had already been charmed by the headline, when I watched the movie I just couldn't even sleep trying to find a way to build a lightsaber too and fight the bloodthirsty Siths. That was 23 years ago, even today I still dream of being a Jedi, although I know that I am too old to be trained.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Unlike the first one, they made it darker and they explored the series.We got to see more worlds and we got to know more about the Jedi and how the Force works, the Lightsaber duel in this is really intense, much quicker and precise.Another reason why I love this one is because the Bad Guys win, which is surprisingly rare, we get Han Solo captured by Boba Fett the Bounty Hunter, Vader wins the fight and the heroes still don't want to give up.And also this was the film that gave us the greatest plot twist of all.Also, Yoda is awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My Favorite Star Wars Adventure!,"In 1977, a cultural revolution began with the little-known science-fiction film called Star Wars created by visionary director George Lucas. It ended up being the highest-grossing film of all-time and it still ranks very high in the midst of today's blockbusters. It was a very enjoyable movie and it created memorable characters that will live on for eternity. So of course we would get a sequel. In fact, Lucas created a whole world around his baby -an ambition that was not normal in 1980. With the sequel-The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas handed the directorial duties to his former college film professor Irvin Kershner because of his duties with his rising visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic, but of course he was very involved with this film. But enough of the background, let's talk about this film. This sequel is much darker in tone, more mysterious, and quite frankly the best film in the franchise. Our favorite characters like Luke and Leia Skywalker and Han Solo are back and we are introduced to more characters that are stored away in our hearts forever such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian. This is also the movie where we have the famous battle and reveal between Luke and Darth Vaderor shall I say between father and son, but more on that later.After the Rebels blow up the Death Star at the end of A New Hope, they hide away in the icy planet of Hoth. But the rebel base is soon discovered by Darth Vader (James Earl Jones and David Prowse) and the empire. From the battle that ensues, our characters are separated. Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) flee across the galaxy from the Empire. They end up going into Cloud City where they come across an old friend of Han's- Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke (Mark Hamill) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are sent to the abandoned planet of Dagobath where he continues his Jedi training with an old Jedi master named Yoda (Frank Oz). But will they stay forgotten for long with Darth Vader relentlessly pursuing Luke across the galaxy? One of the biggest improvements over the original film is the visuals. While the visuals in the 1977 film were good for its time period, George Luca's new production company really improved upon the visuals. Along with the visuals, the film has strong production design and character design. I loved the look of Yoda, which was a puppet of course. You can tell the visuals were strong for a variety of reasons. There were the sights of the majestic Imperial Walkers during the battle of Hoth, the hairy sloth creature that attacks Luke after he gets lost on Hoth, the creepy, dense look of Dagobath, the spiral towers of Cloud City, and of course that lightsaber battle between Luke and Vader.SPOILER!! My highlight out of many of them is the revelation that happens near the end of the movie in Cloud City. I am sure most of you have seen the movie but if not, read no further. Darth Vader reveals to Luke during their intense duel that he is Luke's father, Anakin. Of course in the process, Vader chops of Luke's hand and he falls through a chute but is saved from falling to his death thanks to the Millennium Falcon. Also, the movie ends with Han Solo being captured by the Empire and frozen solid. So these events are just some of the reasons why this film is darker and more sinister than the space opera feel of the first film.The acting remains a strong point in the movie. Harrison Ford is excellent as always. I loved his ""wounded ego"" attitude and his bantering with Chewbacca added some lightheartedness to the movie. Yoda is my favorite new character. Not only did they want a realistic puppet, they actually wanted a good actor to bring that puppet to life. And Frank Oz did just that. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher remain excellent in their respective roles as Luke and Leia. And the voice of James Earl Jones? Well, the same magic that it always created! Need I say more? Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back is my favorite Star Wars movie, and frankly one of the best sci-fi films of all time. It really expanded upon the mystery and the lore the first film provided. The film explores its mythology in darker tones and that added depth and humanity to our characters. Lawrence Kasdan's and Leigh Brackett's screenplay took Lucas's world and created something that was evolutionary and breath-taking while staying true to its roots. The film ended on a sinister cliffhanger, so you bet we will be seeing a third film. The story and the visuals are fantastic, and now you can see why this is my favorite Star Wars film.My Grade: A+ ""No, I am your father!"" (Vader to Luke) ""Try not, Do, or do not!"" (Yoda to Luke)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What I don't like about this one...,"I'm probably gonna be the Most Unfashionable & Despised Reviewer Alive for saying this, but I am not a huge fan of this episode. In fact, I consider it to be the weakest in the story. Now, when you've stopped hyperventilating, I'll explain why.The worst scene I feel is when Luke and Han say goodbye to each other at the ice hanger. One copy of the script I read says that they gaze at each other with a ""deep sense of admiration for the other's wisdom and heroic endeavor"" (- or something like that). Well I'm sorry, but all I could see were two truculent teenagers behaving like immature brats. The sexual tension between Han and Leia had, IMHO, been ham-fistedly set up almost from the first scene. In a hectic rush, it felt like the audience was banged over the head that there was ""unresolved chemistry"" between the two characters - almost straight out of a dime novel. Which leads to the big farewell scene, and we get that sullen sour look from Han as he and Luke say ""Well, see ya"". (Wow - high quality drama!)**Spoiler warning**And to top that off, just look at how Luke behaves with Yoda. After leaving Hoth, he has this determined quest to find this mysterious individual he's never met, breaking Rebel orders in the process. Then when he crash-lands on the planet, he seems to go into a hissy fit when everything isn't quite what he expected. Then this little green man (believe it or not!), turns up and asks if the young man wants any help. There's some comic schtick as the little fellow bumbles around in the camp, with Luke harping like a nanny throughout. Then the guy beckons the Hero to follows him back to the hut. And Luke, ""with a deep sense of destiny"", follows him. They arrive at a little forest house. Luke whines about the situation, and then - (tada!)- we find out that the little fellow is ... Yoda! (Could see that one coming a mile away!!!) So our interstellar hero is then all gushing and plaintive - practically fawning over the little guy!.Geez, the whole episode plays like a two-bit soap.If this is supposed to be the best episode in the series; well I'm sorry, but I'd rather stick to the original. At least that had some style and a tight whup-ass plot! And the sexual tension was handled more subtly, with a tinge of comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The One That Changed The Playing Field,"""Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back"" is a great example of expanding on the universe established in the original one, and turn to a more darker tone and direction that adds depth in everyone's beloved characters and of course, tragedy.If Episode IV was an amazing yet simple adventure, Episode V increases the scale and goes deeper into the rich and mysterious universe and characters respectively. Right off the bat, the film starts with one of the best action set pieces in cinema which is the Hoth battle, and once again, the practicality of the whole scene was beautiful and remarkable, the miniatures still aren't as noticeable and still pretty much hold up until today. The imperial walkers were mesmerizing to see in the screen and still holds up compared to CG nowadays. Darth Vader returns and makes one hell of a comeback from a limited amount of screen time last movie. However, the Hoth battle was just an appetizer, there were plenty more to come. As Luke and R2D2 goes to the Dagobah system, he meets Yoda, one of the most beloved Star Wars characters. Han, Leia, Chewie and C3-PO try to escape as the Empire mercilessly hunts them down. As these 2 narratives coincide with each other, the movie gives you more depth and development for each of the characters. Luke learned the way of the Force, Han and Leia developed a relationship that sparked an amazing sense of chemistry between the two. At the end of the film, the two narratives collide and a showdown between Vader and Luke occurs that is both tense and exciting to see. From a suspenseful and chilling duel, it became an emotional ride for both the audience and for our hero. Giving us one of the best twists in cinema history, this film cements its place in our memories and in cinema forever. The dialogue in the film was also brilliant, surprisingly, most of the best and quotable lines came from Yoda and they were executed very well. The choreography for the lightsaber battles were handled way better than before, (especially since they now know that the lightsaber was a great idea after all) and they used it to their advantage. In the end, Star Wars Episode V, is what Star Wars needed, a boost and a different turn that forever places this franchise in our hearts and in our midst. The force is strong in this one.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

How sequels should be done,"This review is for the 1980 theatrical release and not the 1997 and later specialized editions.This movie really did push movie making when it was released in 1980. The special effects, performances and story are breath taking. It doesn't look too much to existing myths for inspiration but rather in creating its own lore. It takes the Force, the darkside, the lightside, the Jedi and explores them and expands on them to make a more deeper film. Yet it still maintains a sense of humor.
The film has aged remarkably well, it is a beautiful movie from start to finish. While the original Star wars may have revolutionized cinema, the Empire Strikes Back perfected it. It proved that pop culture can be every bit as good as any drama or period piece. I wouldn't hesitate to put it as a contender as the greatest movie ever made.

Wars not make one great,"The story of the rebellion against the Galactic Empire continues with Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, R2 and 3PO on another blistering ride.The best praise I can give The Empire Strikes Back is that it was the first Star Wars movie to hold my 3 year old daughter's attention for the entire duration, and it's easy to see why as virtually every scene is a new and interesting story.Several great characters are introduced such as Yoda, Lando, Boba Fett, and the Emperor, who add further interest to the overarching story, while the original movies favourites of Han, Chewie, Leia, Luke, Darth Vader, and the droids continue to entertain.There are countless cinematic moments such as the Hoth planet scenes, the epic chemistry between Han and Leia, and virtually everything that happens on Degaba and in the Cloud City. The classic scene with Luke and Vader is so atmospheric and dramatic you will be hard pressed not to find yourself role-playing it with your own children one day.John Williams is the true star of the show as his music fits the emotion of every scene perfectly. I still catch my daughter humming the Imperial March to herself from time to time.Visually it is one of the greatest movies of all time, with groundbreaking (for the time) effects, excellent cinematography, editing, action sequences, puppetry, sets, costumes and battles. Likewise the sound effects are wonderful.The performances include memorable turns from James Earl Jones, Frank Oz, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Anthony Daniels.Some consider it to be superior to the original Star Wars (A New Hope) and they may well have a point. It is darker, more intriguing, delivers an excellent twist, and ends on the edge of a cliff. However, the spectacle didn't awe me on the same level as the original. This is not fault of the sequel, as it simply came second, and much like a junkie chasing their first high I never quite achieved the same feeling.(This review is for the original theatrical release and not the special edition)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Empire Strikes Back,"Yoda adds his name to the list of Star Wars characters. He starts out as a puppet and ends up as a computer generated image. I never liked the venerable Yoda. He is self-righteous. His wisdom is inscrutable. At 900 years old, he is not quite as old as Methuselah who made it to 969. The exotic names and grotesque creatures become hard to digest after a while. Lightsaber duels afford opportunities to doze. I saw this movie because I saw the one before it. Lucas made it because he made the one before it. His franchise was becoming a money-making trap. The dark, confusing scenes bothered me. A lot of the action felt contrived, as opposed to being something which occurred naturally.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Star wars originals #2: the empire strikes back,"Whenever I call a movie a perfect sequel, I usually say it's also an imperfect movie, the empire strikes back would be one of the first examples I would give out, I do think that it kind of has a slow start and some of the C-3PO stuff is unnecessary. But that doesn't bring down the fact that it's one of the best sequels of all time and of my personal favorite star wars movies, everything that happens after this revolves around the twist in this movie, and then they made the prequels and revenge of the sith explains everything, I prefer the empire strikes back over revenge of the sith as a sequel, but as a movie, I prefer revenge of the sith, this movie also has a lot heart and stakes.

This is the pinnacle of all Star Wars.,"This is the pinnacle of all Star Wars. The only SW film which is truly great, at least in my opinion. Let's first talk about the story. Certainly the film started off on a wrong foot as it was very much 'A New Hope' once again, but then it pretty quickly changed tone and went into a completely different territory.It became much more mature, sophisticated and infinitely more involving in its second and third act. It also became a much better crafted, much more engaging adventure with some incredible high-spirited sequences such as the asteroid chase scene which is the finest action scene here. Lando is solid but not too memorable and Boba Fett is entirely forgettable and overrated, but the part with Han and Leia is still excellent and very well done.But of course the highlight is Luke's storyline. It is the greatest Jedi storyline so far and the one which is emotional and also stupendously well told with great dialogue. I loved that swamp planet and it was a perfect location for Luke's training. And of course the fight with Vader is unforgettable, the twist remains great to this day and the ending is an excellent tease for the sequel. The film is very much a second, middle chapter and although some may have a problem with it, I really liked that it did not have a proper beginning and ending. It truly is the ultimate middle chapter in a trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best film!,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action. It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development. The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film. The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series. This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional.

The standout film in the series so far.,"Story author and executive producer George Lucas truly managed to outdo himself when it came to making a sequel to his landmark 1977 ""Star Wars"" film. It combines an appreciably high level of character development with some genuinely exciting and riveting scenes, and introduced the well loved character of diminutive Jedi master Yoda into the formula. Villainous Darth Vader is brought to the forefront rather than being a lackey to somebody else. The relationship between cocky spaceship pilot Han Solo and serious minded rebel leader Princess Leia evolves to where romance can finally take place. And Luke Skywalker becomes more than just the naive and idealistic farm boy, letting his emotions get the better of him.With the directing chores being handed over to Irvin Kershner (""A Fine Madness"", ""Up the Sandbox"", ""Eyes of Laura Mars""), ""The Empire Strikes Back"" marks a maturation in terms of story quality, as well as a willingness to go to some dark places. After all, as it begins, it sees its hero in serious jeopardy. It's never treated as a given that Good will prevail. The screenplay is credited to Leigh Brackett (""The Big Sleep"", ""Rio Bravo"", ""El Dorado"") and Lawrence Kasdan (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Body Heat"", ""The Big Chill""), and stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher make the most of the material. The endearing Yoda is one of those examples of a puppet who truly does become a character rather than just a gimmick. The film is a little short on cool aliens, but it does feature a Yeti-like monster called a Wampa, and an enormous slug used in a funny ""worm in the apple"" sort of gag. The spectacle is fantastic, but it never overwhelms the story. The early battle scene on the ice fields of the planet Hoth is incredibly well executed, and the final lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader (who of course has a revelation in store for the youngster) offers one thrill after another.The special effects are as impressive as ever, and it would be difficult to hear that memorable John Williams score and not get into the spirit of the thing. You truly care about the characters and want to see what will happen with them. And it delivers an ending that perfectly captures a sense of uncertainty and a degree of despair, setting up the problems to be solved in the next film.This is definitely a milestone blockbuster that holds up well 33 years later.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Didn't live upto hope,"I had heard just so much of star wars ever since eternity and I directly saw the movie regarded as the bestest in the entire series. But man....it was so underwhelming. Not saying it was a bad movie. But nowhere near the status people portray it to be. It was like your another science fiction coming off a story thought by a bunch of fascinated teens with passion to create something fantastic and stylish but without some actual depth. I guess, maybe it was a great movie in 1980, for people of that time. But me having seen movies like Dune (which had so much more depth, more human, not mere fantasy but conveying reality) and man of Steel, this didn't make much sense of it. Just a okayish ""entertaining"" time pass movie.So, from one movie, what I get is, star wars was back then what Marvel is now. A gigantic lore with some really amazing characters (no doubt about that. Yet the movie is not human because all the characters are just one directional and single layered) with the sole purpose of movies being immature entertainment. I predict that just like Marvels, down the line, star wars will be directed not by directors with individual vision but by those who serve to the fans vision and also I believe I am going to see a lot of fan service as well. Let's see if my prediction comes which I will know once I have seen the rest of the movies.It just makes sense even seeing the 1980 film that Disney took over star wars. The brand Disney has been stamped all over it ever since then. I just wondered that people called it one of the darkest movies in series, when it's not even near what a ""dark"" movie is.Even on the entertainment front, I was not thouroughly impressed. But it's at least good in that segment.Overall, seems like a good movie for your kids.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Stupendous film on all the fronts!!,"The Empire Strikes Back (also known as Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) is an epic space opera film directed by Late Irvin Kershner. The film stars an ensemble cast includes Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Late Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, Late David Prowse, Late Kenny Baker, Late Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz.Darth Vader is adamant about turning Luke Skywalker to the dark side. Master Yoda trains Luke to become a Jedi Knight while his friends try to fend off the Imperial fleet.What a superb follow up of the first part of the original trilogy and an outstanding film on all the fronts, be it it's plot, it's execution, acting, screenplay or BGM the film never disappoints on any front. The film is also one of the rarest phenomena in the history of cinema in which the second part is better then first part. Finding a fault in this film is very difficult.

The best movie ever made,"To say this movie is overrated is just wrong. Not just in the sense of being incorrect. It's morally wrong to speak ill of this movie. This is more important than Picasso's work, or Da Vinci's or any other great artist. And to critique this film in any measure is perhaps the greatest display of a lack of self-awareness that a person is capable of. Who are we to question any aspect of the definitive masterpiece of all of human existence? Every technology breakthrough-from fire or the wheel, all the way to the computer or the internet-is merely a means to this end. If there were an asteroid aimed at annihilating all of human history, and we could only save one cultural artifact, it had dang well better be this movie. It represents the high point of human achievement. It is so mind bogglingly good that George Lucas should probably be etched in stone as his own version of Mt. Rushmore. His impact for good on the world through this movie is frankly incalculable. No human being will ever live on this planet without having been positively affected by it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Shadows in the Cosmos,"The film's masterful blend of adventure and introspection pulled me into a narrative where every twist felt both monumental and deeply personal. Luke Skywalker's struggle, as he confronts the daunting truths about his identity and the heavy burden of destiny, resonated with my own battles of self-discovery and the courage it takes to face one's fears. Yoda's enigmatic guidance, rendered with quiet wisdom, reminded me of the mentors in my life who challenge and inspire growth even in the darkest of times. The stark landscapes, whether the icy plains of Hoth or the shadowed corridors of the Rebel hideouts, seemed to embody the emotional terrain of hardship and hope. Every lightsaber duel, every whispered secret of the Force, and every moment of quiet reflection wove together a tapestry of resilience and wonder. In a galaxy filled with both dazzling light and deep, consuming shadows, the film not only redefined what a sci-fi epic could be but also invited me to ponder the timeless struggle between good and evil within ourselves. This cinematic masterpiece remains a profound reminder that sometimes, our greatest victories are born from the trials we face, both on-screen and in the depths of our own hearts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Amazing,"Takes the first Star Wars and improves literally everything- many of the shortcomings of that first film are either outright fixed or at least made less noticeable.Special effects are significantly improved (less CGI additions in the bluray version, too. And if they are there, they're generally less noticeable)Bigger and more ambitious action scenesPacing is just flawlessDialogue is sharper; the banter between characters is much betterIt's better shot from a visual standpoint, too. The first Star Wars had plenty of iconic images for sure, but this one just feels more cinematic, with better camerawork, lighting, and use of colour.The new locations are also great.Uses a satisfying three-act structure that still somehow feels exciting and unpredictable (if you've not seen it before, of course)Characters are fantastic, as are the new additions to the cast (Yoda's scenes are gold- every single second of them)Empire is more menacing, and the heroes are in near constant peril. Death Vader being properly unchained from Tarkin made him the iconic villain he's known as today.That twist is so well known by this point, but if you try to imagine being in a theatre and hearing that for the first time in 1980, it would have been mind blowingEvery character now openly finds C3PO annoying, so his comic relief goes from laughing ""with him"" (which scarcely worked in the first film) to more or less laughing ""at him,"" which is way funnier.It's dark by Star Wars standards but it's not depressing. There's plenty of fun and action, and a surprising amount of humour that largely works- it balances the seriousness with the excitement and the humour perfectly.Ending satisfies while also leaving you hungry for the concluding chapter (which had its moments, but seems to get a little worse upon each revisit, while Empire Strikes Back only seems to get better with age).This is absolutely a near masterpiece that's hard to fault to be honest... but you didn't need my ramblings to tell you that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A near perfect masterpiece of a movie,"The Empire Strikes Back is a 1980 epic space opera/space fantasy film directed by George Lucas and direct sequel to Star Wars. As a brief summary, The Empire Strikes Back is a classic example of a movie that the critics of the time got very wrong. Initially receiving mixed reviews and being slammed by some is nowadays considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time and the best Star Wars film overall...and its not hard to see why! The Empire Strikes Back continues on from the events of Star Wars revisiting the characters of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo. The Empire Strikes Back is known to be the much darker sequel, with much more character depth, vulnerability and emotion. Lucas continues to develop his beloved characters in all the right ways with the Han-Leia relationship, the more powerful feeling of friendship and of course the biggest, most shocking twist in cinematic history with Vader and Luke in the final act of the film. The Empire Strikes Back also continues to evolve the world introducing us to new places, new characters such as the legendary Jedi master, Yoda, improving the special effects and an even more beautiful soundtrack, provided by John Williams. The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect example of a sequel done right, equal and at times even better than the original. Epic battles, intense space chases, powerful emotional character development, shocking twists, thought-provoking ideas, themes and messages and finally groundbreaking sequences and special effects. In terms of flaws The Empire Strikes Back virtually has none whatsoever, other than an unfortunate twist which has had a negative response later on in the franchise, a few unnecessarily long scenes of Luke's training, and in my opinion a slightly weaker general plot than the original story.

Fun--But Much Better When I was a Kid,"I'm continuing to watch all the Star Wars movies in preparation for ""The Force Awakens"". I've made it up to ""Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"".This is the one that I always think I'm going to love, and then don't. Maybe that's because I think things are going to happen in it that actually evidently happen in ""Return of the Jedi"" (Palpatine makes no appearance in ""Empire"", despite his being...the Emperor). Maybe it's because I find Yoda to be less endearing in this movie than I did when I was five years old. Who knows.Whatever the case, I'm giving ""Empire"" 7/10 stars. Yes, it does continue on the story of ""A New Hope"" relatively seamlessly. Yes, the characters are iconic, and yes it is a fun movie overall. Yes, Luke and Vader have a memorable showdown with a memorable line. But it just wasn't as enjoyable for me as ""A New Hope"". The story seemed to bend and sway a bit (Luke's visit to Dagobah, for example. The dream sequence encounter with Vader also is a little weak).A long story short, I like this movie, but not enough to give it an 8 or above. Good movie. Fun. But not one of my faves.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Boring mess,"Lame, garish, gimmicky, unedifying, meandering, unexciting, forced, completely and utterly unentertaining.And all the more odious because of that stupid, incessantly growling beast Chewbacca and the cacophonous beeping and buzzing of R2-D2.That's what comes to mind when I think of ""Star Wars,"" in particular the first trilogy. Maybe it's an early-1980s-movies thing. Maybe it was great because that's what the cutting edge of sci-fi looked like back then. But movies like ""Back to the Future"" weren't that bad. It was just a couple bitter pills I had to swallow, so I could say I've watched that so-called cultural monument, the phenomenal epic franchise revered by most everyone, when asked.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Masterclass in Storytelling and Character Development,"From the moment the iconic opening crawl of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" unfurls, I felt a rush of nostalgia mixed with excitement. Having grown up in a household where Star Wars was more than just a movie franchise; it was a way of life, I was eager to revisit this classic. Watching it again, I was struck by how the film manages to balance character development with thrilling action, creating a narrative that feels both intimate and grand.The icy planet of Hoth sets the stage for one of the most memorable battles in cinematic history. The sight of the Rebel Alliance scrambling against the imposing AT-AT walkers is not just a visual spectacle; it's a testament to the film's ability to convey the stakes of the conflict. I remember feeling my heart race during that scene, a mix of awe and dread as the Rebels fought against insurmountable odds.Then there's the heart of the film: Luke's journey to train with Yoda on Dagobah. The scenes between Luke and Yoda are some of my favorites. Yoda's wisdom, humor, and the sheer quirkiness of his character bring a unique flavor to the film. I found myself hanging on every word, absorbing the lessons of patience and perseverance. It's a reminder that growth often comes from struggle, a theme that resonates deeply with anyone who has faced their own challenges.The emotional weight of the film is palpable, particularly in the climactic confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader. The revelation of Luke's lineage is a moment that still sends shivers down my spine. The choreography of their lightsaber duel is breathtaking, and the intensity of their connection adds layers to the story. It's not just a physical battle; it's a clash of ideologies, of light versus dark, and it left me questioning the nature of good and evil.The film's score, composed by John Williams, elevates every scene. The Imperial March is now synonymous with villainy, and it's hard not to feel a chill when it plays. Each musical cue enhances the emotional landscape, pulling the audience deeper into the narrative.As the credits rolled, I was left with a sense of satisfaction and a longing to dive back into the Star Wars universe. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is more than just a sequel; it's a masterclass in storytelling that explores themes of hope, sacrifice, and the complexities of family. It's a film that stands the test of time, and I can confidently say it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An absolute classic,"In a sea of derivative sequels, The Empire Strikes Back stands out due to its dark tone and the stakes of the story. The empire's ruthlessness contributes to this oppressive tone, to the point where there is little to no hope for our heroes to escape this peril. The twist at the end of this film, as I'm sure everyone knows at this point, is not just shocking for the sake of being a twist; it allows discussion on the grey area between the extremes of good and evil. The new musical themes introduced in this film are incredibles, especially ""Imperial March."" Once again, the effects are phenomenal for their time and still hold up tremendously, particularly the AT-ATs. Overall, I slightly prefer the first film, but I don't think anyone would argue that this is one of the greatest sequels in cinematic history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Rewatching Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is a sublime experience. It's the pinnacle of the Star Wars franchise, a crowning achievement that has yet to be replicated in over four decades. Although I score it slightly higher than the original, the fact is that I like these two almost equally. Empire ditches a bit of the old school pulpy serial feel and opts for a more serious tone at times, but it never loses the sense of fun that makes Star Wars so beloved.The writing in Empire is a significant step up from its predecessor, featuring wittier dialogue and a stronger structure. The entire cast has grown into their roles by the time of this film. Harrison Ford's Han Solo is even more charismatic, Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker shows real depth, and Carrie Fisher's Leia is as strong and spirited as ever. All the performances feel more natural, a testament to Irvin Kershner's direction.One of the most striking aspects of The Empire Strikes Back is its third act. It still holds up incredibly well 43 years on, delivering tension and excitement in spades. The editing is once again a huge reason for the success of this act, skillfully ratcheting up the tension. The visuals are nothing short of amazing, with the duel between Vader and Luke being particularly iconic.However, my one gripe remains the depressing open ending. I've never been too enthused by it, even though I understand its narrative purpose. It leaves the story hanging in a way that feels unresolved, but it also sets the stage perfectly for the final installment.Despite this minor dislike, The Empire Strikes Back is a near-perfect film. The film's improved writing, standout performances, and incredible third act make it the crowning jewel of the franchise. Its glory hasn't been replicated in the many attempts since, solidifying its place as a timeless classic that continues to captivate and inspire.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 6.0

Very good but...,"Very nice, the plot is very interesting followed by an equally excellent direction.

Best yet,I think it's a great sequel to the fourth movie and I really liked it,5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The ""heart"" of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy...","""The Empire Strikes Back"" does its best to visually surpass the original ""Star Wars"" and the special effects or the creatures' designs are as convincing as the pioneering space epic, there's also a richness of landscapes, taking you from the snowy summits of a cold planet to the tropical jungle, but beyond the escapism, it's the excitement to see again that iconic gallery of characters, Han Solo, Leia, C3PO, R2-D2, Luke, Chewbacca (whose mourning and moaning sounds took a whole other resonance) and a few newcomers. In ""The Empire Strikes Back"", the key word is ""Back"".Now, take the most hardcore ""Star Wars"" fan -I think there's a name for them, and I guess I would know if I were one- and take someone who doesn't care much about the series, now, ask the pair to list four or five classic ""Star Wars"" moments, I bet a good half of the scenes will belong to the glorious episode V ""The Empire Strikes Back"", directed by Irvin Keshner (and George Lucas as the Executive Producer). By the way, do you know the joke, why did Lucas start ""Star Wars"" with the 4th, 5th and 6th episodes and then made the first three? Because Master Yoda directed them (punch line drum sound). Well, that's just to show you I didn't use the word 'sequel', and this is not because I don't want to offend sensitivities, but because I don't take the film as a sequel but as the real journey into the soul of ""Star Wars"", the dark side, literally.It is in this film that the relationship between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) transcends the limits of the simple crush, the interactions between them are really catching and you can tell that Harrison Ford challenges his character, and has fun teasing the little Princess who's not insensitive to his charm. A film where actors have fun playing their characters can't turn bad, and it is a credit to the directing for having made the romance efficient with no more than three or four scenes. And they all culminate with one of the most touching declarations of love, touching because of its laconic but sincere answer you know. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is also the film that pursues the coming-of-age of Luke Skywalker and features his initiation by Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Obi-Wan was a great character but Yoda has everything, the speech mannerism, the mimics and this little quality that makes him like the perfect crossover between Mr. Myagi and ""E.T."" except that he came the first.Yoda is the heart of the story, and when he warns Luke about the dark side of the Force, he knows exactly where he's heading to, and I guess ever since ""Star Wars"" ended, the audience knew what the next film had to deliver. Which leads to the one true reason-to-be of the film, the climactic light-saber battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker right after having plunged us into the evil Empire Lord's psyche and revealed the Shakespearian truth about his identity. Now, is it really a spoiler to spoil it or is it a of prescription case? In a Simpson episode from the third season, which means 1992, a gag consisted on Homer leaving the theater and spoiling the ending to all the lining up moviegoers. So after one decade, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was already part of cinema's history. I guess you can't call yourself a movie lover but if you don't know Vito Corleone, Scarlett O'Hara or the father of Luke Skywalker, well it kind of shades off to ignorance.Indeed, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is like the second tome of Homer's Odyssey, it is an inevitable and valuable portion of Cinema's history regarding perhaps the one true myth that solely belongs to the silver screen. And it is for this achievement that it's impossible not to recognize the cinematic value of ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Say what you want about the creatures, the special effects, the little gimmick or childish moments, but when the film starts and you have in order, the 'Fox' logo, the 'long time go' title card-and then the first pumping sound of the triumphant fanfare, something melts inside you and you're like a child who just sat on the roller- coaster. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was the most anticipated movie, the follow-up to the all time most popular film and it managed to become more popular by injecting novelty within the relationships and add new characters such as Yoda or Lando (Billy Dee Williams).It even managed to equal the original by having its own score: ""The Imperial March"", as if it had to have its own existence independently from the first, and it's fitting that the score is about the villain as Darth Vader seems more majestic and frightening in this opus, actually he was nominated #3 in the AFI's Top 50 villains but it was the Darth Vader from ""Empire"", the one with the Imperial March. Even Vader raises its iconic status with his (temporary) victory over the rebels. Because that's also what characterizes the film, the bad guys have the upper hand. It concludes with a frozen Han Solo, an amputated Luke with the painful knowledge about his origins, a disintegrated C3PO and so on a cliffhanger so obvious it doesn't even need the obligatory ""to be continued"", we know the fight between evil and good isn't over. I guess at that moment, ""The Return of the Jedi"" immediately became the most anticipated cinematic project.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Makes an excellent case for the best sequel of all time,"The Empire strikes back is a complex movie to review. On the one hand, in terms of plot development and pacing it feels like a step back from A New Hope. Luke goes to train with Yoda, while his friends evade a Star Destroyer through the power of plot armor. Eventually he goes to save his friends.However, it does a few things exceptionally well:1. Expand the world building of the original film. A New Hope was largely a fairy tale story which could stand on its own. But Empire Strikes back grounds it in a believable universe. The death star is gone, but that barely made a dent in the power of the Empire. The nature of the force is expanded on. The emperor is introduced. Darth Vader isnt just some random bad guy anymore.2. Subverting expectations done right. Structurally, the Empire Strikes back is kind of an odd movie, and its even more unique in that it ends on a pretty dark note. Luke going to save his friends doesn't really work at all. He instead gets his hand chopped off, almost dies and needs their help. But this subversion doesn't just come out of nowhere like a The Last Jedi gotcha, it actually makes sense.3. The plot twist at the end is so well known that people dont really factor it in when reviewing the story 40 years later. But keeping it in mind, this really would be a shocking moment to anyone watching it the first time.Also, with a better director at the helm, Empire Strikes back has better dialogue (slightly, its still not great), better acting, and better cinematography. John Williams even steps it up a notch with the music.Overall, the somewhat weak plot development (it spends far too much time in asteroid fields, a cheesy romance, and training montages), still makes me think its a bit overrated. But its still the best Star Wars movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best star wars movie ever!!,"Greatest of all star wars movies hand down!!! Change my mind, I bet you cant.... the second greatest star wars movie is Rogue one. These are the two movies that are the backbone of the star wars movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This film goes well beyond sci-fi. A true cinematic masterpiece.,"The Empire Strikes Back represents everything that I've come to expect from a film: Brave heroes, menacing villains, a well-written story, fantastic action scenes, a strong supporting cast, drama, romance, surprises, and a beautiful musical score. ""Empire"" focuses heavily on developing the characters from the first film, rounding out their personalities, and introduces several great new characters (Yoda, Lando Calrissian, Boba Fett). The special effects still hold up well to today's standards, the dialogue is witty and intelligent, and the character dynamic allows the actors to play well off of each other. It's a very different kind of film in that the ""good guys always win"" theory is proved wrong, and Darth Vader's surprise revelation at the end of the movie is still one of the best movie moments ever, which was shocking for its time.This is one of the few films that I find that never diminishes after each viewing. Even without the ""Star Wars"" name behind it, the amount of movie ""magic"" this film generates captivates me just as much now as it did when I was a child.This is a prime example of cinematic perfection, and in no way should be missed by anyone. A true classic and worthy of the ""10"" that I gave it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Force is Strong with this one.,"I'll Admit, I'm not on that bandwagon saying that this film is my favorite in the Star Wars franchise. But I tip my hat to Lucas and everything this film offers. This film is one of the best films ever made. I don't doubt that one bit.What this film does so brilliantly versus the 1st film is going further in depth into the characters of Luke and his journey learning the force. This film is about him fighting between the good and dark side of the force internally. It's that classic arc of battling between the good and bad part of us and learning not to give into the anger, hate, and suffering. It's iconic, and Hamill does such a great job.So did Harrison and Carrie. Having their relationship explored and getting to see how both of them help each other grow as people. It's really good.And once again, James Earl Jones proves even more why he is Vader. He's much more ruthless, short tempered, and so much more imposing than ever. He's inflicted Physical, Emotional, and Mental Pain on all of our heroes, and he plays that part so effortlessly. Iconic doesn't even begin to describe how amazing he plays Vader.And I gotta say, I'm constantly impressed with the action scenes in this one. Some very solid Sci-Fi Space action, and some really iconic lightsaber fights. The Sound Design of the blaster's spaceships, and lightsabers again are really good.And as always, John Williams continues to show why he's one of the best composers in Hollywood. The Score is very memorable. Not bad at all.Again, this isn't my favorite in the franchise, but I give all of my respect to this one. It's a really well-made film.

Exile To Hoth,"Though the intrepid three heroes of Star Wars destroyed the Death Star commanded by Darth Vader, the rebel army is still on the run. They've taken refuge in a frozen planet called Hoth much like George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge. In the meantime the Empire still searches for the rebel army in The Empire Strikes Back.When the attack comes, it comes full force, the rebels flee as do Luke Skywalker and R2D2 in one ship and Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca and C3PO. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker is given a mission in a dream by the late Alec Guinness, killed in the first Star Wars film to receive Jedi Knight Advanced Training from the legendary Yoda and he seeks him out. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher and company seek out Ford's old friend Lando Kalrissian to repair his ship after Ford plays a dangerous cat and mouse game with Darth Vader's battle cruiser.As Lando Kalrissian, Billy Dee Williams steps into the Star Wars pantheon of heroes and proves quite useful if not quite on the up and up. George Lucas continues his tradition of writing about futuristic Homeric like heroes in a galaxy far away.And as cinema, The Empire Strikes Back continues the quality of excellence that the original set. Looks like the Force is definitely with George Lucas.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the greatest movies of all time,"After the indescribable success of the first amazing Star Wars film, people were hungry for more, so George Lucas decided to go ahead and make a sequel.You think it would be hard to live up to the film of the century, yet George Lucas does it again effortlessly, and an even better job.Almost everything about this film is perfect; the format of the story, the classic sword fight, the story itself, the special effects, everything was just unbelievable, I could go on for days.It is very hard to describe how epic this movie is. I love the Dagobah scenes, they were spectacular, and I liked Yoda even better than good old Obi-Wan Kenobi. The city in the clouds is fantastic, and when you first see Darth Vader there you could kiss George Lucas for doing such a good job. The sword fight in this film is faster and cooler, and the dramatic lines at the end is great. Han Solo and Princess Leia were made for each other, and Han Solo's last scene in the film shows how much he has matured as an actor.There were two things that bothered me about this film, though. The first is the first 15 minutes of the film. It's just a very weak opening, and it seems longer than it actually it is. However, that is made up for by the amazing battle scene on Hoth. Another is when Luke and Leia kiss; it just doesn't seem right.Other than that, the movie hit perfection on technically every level. Darth Vader is as creepy as ever (especially when you see the back of his actual head and you wonder what's on the other side), and his theme music is great, along with the rest of John William's grand score.The Empire Strikes Back, overall, is a masterpiece, and should be #5 on the Top 250 list. It's one of my favorite movies, and it is definitely one of the greatest movies of ALL time (as in all the movies in history). 9.9/10 (almost a 10, that's how good it is).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The rest compared to that scene is pretty good, including Yoda's first appearance, Cloud City, and of course, ""I am your father."" It's interesting that this Irvin Kershner replaces George Lucas for the directing (I almost assumed Lucas directed all six films).

Star Wars lives! Vote for me!,"VOTE USCWANNABE My name is Tom Costabile and I am currently the lead runner up in the Presidency contest at Hyperspace.com, known on that site as USCWANNABE. I have been intently working on trying to win this election and have come to the conclusion that I can't win this with just friends and family...I'm going to need the help of the millions of fans Star Wars has adopted for itself to win this contest so I've decided to write this letter to introduce myself and my ideas for the fan club presidency.I went back to school and got my GED. I went to college for Media Arts and Animation (because I wanted to be GL) and got my bachelors. I moved to Studio City, Ca to go to USC and started my real life, the one I envisioned when I was 5, and within 3 years I own multiple corporations, my dream houses, my dream cars, I don't do drugs or drink In essence, I have everything I have ever wanted for myself and I have Star Wars and George Lucas to thank for it, and my way of giving back is to take my place in the SW world and be the best damn Fan Club president anyone can. I have a few ideas for how I can make it better for us as fans :I feel that we are entering a very scary time in terms of our beloved Star Wars. For the first time in SW history we are in a realm of uncertainty as to what's going to happen next. For the entire time SW has been in our lives we knew there was going to be more, it was just a matter of time, and now, according to Lucas there will never be another film. Of course we're going to have the video games, the board games and the television shows and so on, but nothing, absolutely nothing can compare to watching the midnight showing of a new Star Wars film. It's probably the greatest experiences of my life and I don't want it to end! I feel that there is a way around this though. If there were more conventions than SW would stay alive forever. If we as fans can come together more frequently I believe SW would never leave us and its that simple. We need to urge LucasFilm to produce more functions in more cities all over the world in order to satisfy the needs of the true fans and as president this will be my number one priority. Not just every 3 years, but every year. Not in just one city but multiple cities. One of the things I found to be disturbing was that because it was in Indianapolis, and only in Indianapolis, it was extremely hard for a lot of people to come there. They would have to get time off work, save up money, and make room for this in their personal lives. These reasons deterred a lot of people away and that I feel is not fair to them. It should not cost an extrordinary amount of money and time to celebrate these films and now that there won't be any movies its all we have to look forward to as a group. If LucasFilm will not cooperate with this I feel that we should come together as a group and make it happen ourselves and as President of the fan club I would be more than happy to make all of the arrangements and make this happen!I also feel that SW fans are probably the most enlightened and creative people on the planet. We at an early age saw the talent that went into making these films and have been trying to find that talent within ourselves ever since, and the best part about it is many of us have but we don't know what to do with it!! Especially in a day and age where there are more film students than law students and a time where the world is the smallest its ever been in the history of the Earth. We as a society are watching films from England, France, Japan and so on and seeing the impact that SW has had on not just the USA, but the world!! I propose that if I become president I begin an organization where people from all over the planet can submit their artworks (not just SW stuff) and gain the assistance of people in the entertainment industry. From writing to storyboarding to CGI to film and all that has to do with it. An organization by SW fans for SW fans!! A way to come up and not need no one but ourselves to make it happen. If we took all the talent that is in the group of people that will read this letter and put it together in a serious way your talking American Zoetrope to the tenth power. Your talking about possibly the next wave of great filmmakers. A way for me to give back.I felt an obligation to do this. If I don't win this contest I want everyone who reads this to know how I feel about everything that has been going on around us in the SW society as an extremely concerned fan. I think that everyone I have ever met at the conventions and the midnight showings and the Weekends at Disney have been the greatest, greatest group of people this world has to offer, and I am so greateful that I'm a part of it.

One of the Best Films Ever Made!,"This 2nd (or fifth) enstallment in the Star Wars series I believe is the best one yet (and ever).  The special effects are as good if not better than the first film and the characters are much better than in the first.  Though George Lucas didn't direct this enstallment, I think that's good because it gives the chance for Irvin Kershner a chance to see what he can put on the screen for us to watch.  And it is actually quite good.  With a terrific soundtrack by John Williams, the character Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz who is my favorite puppetter ever beside Jim Henson) and a startling revelation (this is the film where we find out Darth Vader's secret), this film is a dark, enchanting and great movie experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""It's like something out of a dream.""","As Luke Skywalker sits in a swamp on an alien world talking to his droid companion R2-D2 he unwittingly gives that most accurate of all descriptions for this movie. The Empire Strikes Back does indeed seem like the stuff of dreams. The images, the music, a beautiful princess, a city floating in the clouds,...the atmosphere is surreal and unearthly. One critic aptly stated that it was hard to believe this movie was even filmed on earth. This epic battle of good versus evil in a galaxy far, far away has elements of all your favorite space, fantasy, and swashbuckler stories. It strikes a responsive chord somewhere deep in your memory. Again Luke says it best with his observation that ""there's something familiar about this place.""From the outset, Empire Strikes Back was in a class by itself, far outshining its two companions in the trilogy, Episodes Four and Six. Even the newest Star Wars offerings, Episodes One, Two, and Three don't quite measure up to this 1980 blockbuster. George Lucas now has access to much more wondrous technology to tell his stories but he has fallen into the trap of relying too heavily on computer-generated images. When this technique is overdone what you end up with looks kind of like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. That's okay while you're trying to find a good seat in the theater, but when the actual movie starts the audience expects to see something a little more real. By contrast, when you watch ESB you have to keep REMINDING yourself that it's not real! That's the highest compliment you can pay a sci-fi movie.Well, Empire is back in the stores again. For a limited time of course. I look forward to the day Congress declares this movie a national treasure like The Wizard of Oz. Then maybe George Lucas won't be able to yank it off the store shelves whenever he feels like it. If you're like me, a Star Wars fan from way back, it's time to get reacquainted with an old friend. If you still haven't seen The Empire Strikes Back at all, shame on you for putting it off so long. But I envy you the adventure you are, I hope, about to discover.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"The ""Star Wars"" universe matures and refines itself in Episode V","""A New Hope"" opened us up to a galaxy of possibilities. ""The Empires Strikes Back"" begins to show us just how large that scope really is. Not only that, but there is a definite sense that ""Star Wars"" has grown up a little bit in Episode V, including taking a much darker tone.After the destruction of the Death Star, the war between the Rebellion and the Empire is on. ""Empire"" takes us first to the icy tundra of Hoth, then to the jungles of Degobah and lastly the futuristic Bespin aka Cloud City. Immediately our imaginations begin to expand. In terms of characters, we are introduced to Yoda, the ancient Jedi master who begins training Luke. There is also Boba Fett, the cool-looking bounty hunter in the awesome ship and Lando Calrissian, the handsome new friend to the original gang. The film doesn't settle with what we are familiar with from Episode 4 and keeps pushing our imagination further.Most importantly, the characters that we fell in love with previously seem a lot more viable than they once were, not merely vessels for the exchange of brash remarks and one-liners. Princess Leia (now sporting a more femme fatal look as suits her true character) and Han Solo begin to carve out a relationship that is essential to the greatness of this film. Luke's maturity is just as important. We're blown away by the famous ending scene with Luke and Vader because of how far Luke has come since his days on a desert farm. He no longer sounds like an idiot every time he opens his mouth.Last but far from least, even Vader, the enigma, becomes more complicated in this film. The character development is really what makes this film considered the best of the entire saga by many, many fans.So many times, nearly all the time, do middle films in a trilogy fail in comparison to the films on either side of them, but ""Empire"" doesn't. Most of the time it can end up as just a bridge with no ability to stand on its own, but it stands on its own. It borrows just enough from ""Hope"" and sets things in motion just enough that it does its job as a transitioning film, but the climax is kind of thrilling in its own way, not just as in we can't wait to see what happens next. It has plenty of its own, new elements to keep it fresh and like an expansion of the original as opposed to a mere continuation of it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Praise for The Empire Strikes Back,"The Empire Strikes back is the second film in the renowned Star Wars trilogy.  Being the second part in a three part saga, it was naturally the darkest of the films.  But, that does not make it any less a part of film history. It was one of the most successful sequels ever, continuing the story of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo.  It also included many key points in the story. In this film, Luke Skywalker truly begins his Jedi training, and cuts it short, something that will plague him for years to come.  Luke also confronts Darth Vader, and finds out that Vader is his father, the most dramatic moment in the film, and when he loses his hand. Princess Leia and Han Solo finally fall in love, only to be captured and separated when Han is frozen in carbonite. Leia is driven by her love for Han for the next year, unable to let him go.  Han is frozen, unable to move, in the clutches of Jabba the Hutt.  This is the beginning of a wonderful romance. This movie has done a superb job of continuing the Star Wars saga, and deserves every ounce of praise that has been thrown at it.  Then again, I'm probably a little partial.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Best Star Wars Film,"I love all of the original Star Wars films, but for me this one takes the biscuit. I have heard some people say that The Empire Strikes Back is the weakest of the trilogy, and that it suffers for being in the middle. I would dispute this utterly. For one thing, the plot has a slightly different format to the other two: instead of the old destroy-a-death-star scenario, we have the chance to learn more about the galaxy in general and to explore the characters in more depth. This is the film in which a lot of key character relationships are forged in earnest. It also includes, in my opinion, the best light sabre sequences: Alec Guiness may be a super actor, but he's not desperately nimble, whilst we do not have the same confidence in Luke as we do in Return of the Jedi.Some people these days are dazzled by the modern films, but believe you me, the old ones are better. They have better characters, and are not bloated in the same way. Carrie Fisher is super as our fiesty heroine, whilst Harrison Ford takes a strong role and Mark Hamil excels as the ultimate hero. You don't get much better than this. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
was OK but wasn't the best star wars film,"I have to admit, I never read the novel this is based on. But I'm guessing the people who don't like the movie at all (which is fine), either haven't read the book or don't like the book. I'm saying this, because what you are getting here, is very close to adult films. Something people in Germany (censors that is), do not have a problem with (the movie is rated 16+).I can only guess the movie will be NC-17 (if they rate it) in America. There are explicit images of male genitalia, a lot bare breasts (though mostly of our main female lead). With all that said, I went into the movie with the impression I wouldn't like it at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Beyond Star Wars,"I think that it went beyond Star Wars. You got to know the characters a little better, you had some humour. I thought of The Empire Strikes Back as the second movement of a symphony. That is why you see some of the things slower. And it ends in a way you cannot wait to see to hear the vivace, the next movie, the allegretto. Episode V didn't have a climax at the end. It had an emotional climax. There were something about Empire that immediately just clicked when I saw it. I did not know how all the romance between Solo and Leia were going work and the adventure and were it too serious, and all this sort of stuff. But it really came together. Until its premiere, cases of lighting striking twice were rare in Hollywood. Sequels were nearly always a letdown.

The movie takes us to Cloud City, one of the best destinations in the series, where we meet the coolest character in the franchise- Lando Calrissian, played brilliantly by Billy Dee Williams.

Greatest of the Star Wars Films.,"I love the Star Wars films as a whole. However I feel that The Empire Strikes Back is easily the greatest film of the series and one of the greatest films ever made.The rebels are forced to flee from the ice planet of Hoth after the Imperials discovered their hideout there. Solo, Leia, Chewbacca, and c 3P0 take off in the Millennium Falcon. Luke meanwhile travels to the Dagobah System to learn from the jedi master Yoda. Darth Vader then puts all his efforts into capturing the Millennium Falcon as to lure Skywalker to him. Vader then plans to turn Skywalker over to the dark side of the force.The main reason for this film being awesome is that there is so much going on. There really is no main setting and instead see various awesome settings. The ice planet hoth, swampy Dagobah system, asteroid field, cloud city of Bespin; it just is great how there are so many different places where action takes place in this film.The action in this film is legendary. Battle of Hoth is awesome and the imperial AT AT walkers are really a spectacle to behold. The asteroid field chase with the millennium falcon is also great. Also who can forget the legendary lightsaber duel at the end between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. I certainly never will forget that duel, to me that is the best moment in Star Wars history.This film does an awesome job developing characters. Solo and Leia develop a romantic relationship that I think fits the film well. Also the character of Chewbacca is portrayed more as a great companion and useful at helping out rather than just as a lumbering brute as he is in the first film. Luke starts to use the force more and develop into a jedi. Darth Vader also goes from being just an evil villain in the first film and becomes a legendary villain also capable of making outstanding strategies. Vader in this film is the greatest villain I have seen in a film and the way that he is portrayed in this film is awesome and the best portrayal of a villain in a film.New characters are added in this film. Lando Calrissen gets his first appearance. I do not really like or dislike Lando that much. Yoda make his first appearance in the Star Wars franchise. Who can not like Yoda? Yoda is easily one of the most powerful presences in a film and a master of the force. Frank Oz does an awesome job portraying Yoda. But to me the best new character in this film is Boba Fett. Fett is a great bounty hunter who will hunt down people in constant pursuit. Fett is my favorite Star Wars character and he adds to the films overall tone of suspense and unease in this film.The music is phenomenal in this film. This is the first film to use the Imperial March song and that film goes great with Darth Vader. When it is played at the same time as when Vader is on screen it is outstanding. Easily one of the best musical scores ever in a film, hats off to John Williams. Deserved to win an award for Composer of the year.Great music, action, lots going on, character development, great new characters, this film is the best sequel ever made and also the best of the Star Wars films.

not so comic book styled after all...,"The reason I love ESB the most is because it is the most humanistic of the whole Star Wars universe.  That's not to take anything away from the others (which i totally love as well!), but they all strike me as more comic book styled.  The whole Han and Leia interaction (and perhaps this may have been due to Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher and their 'alleged' relations) just comes across as sincere and real.

I hope before Lucas writes the next episode he takes another look at Empire and remembers its really all about the characters and not the special effects.True, Episode 1 made over $400m but 20yrs from now I think it will be remembered as the least favorite, Episode 1 was proof that if you don't have special characters no on will care about the special effects.The Empire Strikes Back had both!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"the best of the Star Wars saga takes up a somber, more nihilistic note and emphasizes the fact that special effects can be special in more ways than just persuasiveness","Having viewed both the theatrical and updated versions of the first ""Star Wars"" picture, my reaction is still the same: a mixed review with an ultimate marginal note of recommendation. Now I have sat down to watch back-to-back both the theatrical and updated versions of the second movie, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and my verdict is still unanimous on that one as well: this is one of the best science-fiction movies ever made and it still baffles me how critic John Simon could comprehend of saying that a movie this bold and imaginative and daring and thrilling is junk and is dehumanizing to the younger generation. It certainly isn't to me. And the reason why I primarily admire ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is not the fact that its special effects are first-class or that they are used with imagination, but that its dominated by a superb science-fiction story, memorable characters, smart dialogue, and a true foreboding and mysterious atmosphere totally alien to the cheerful opera-like personality of the first movie.""The Empire Strikes Back"" take place after the destruction of the Death Star. The Galactic Empire's command is now mainly controlled by the tremendously fearsome Darth Vader, who is vigorously hunting young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who is one of the leaders of the Rebellion. After a battle with the Empire, Luke and his friends are separated. While Han Solo and the others try to dodge Vader's pursuit, Luke lands on a mysterious planet where a little creature named Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) teaches him the ways of the Jedi.There is not a single weak element to ""The Empire Strikes Back."" But I think so many people miss out on what makes the picture so enthralling and wonderful. Everybody mentions the special effects and yes they are revolutionary and spectacular, but the skill and persuasiveness of the special effects is just two dimensions of their success. The third and most powerful dimension is the fact that they are used with imagination. Special effects are just a package order in Hollywood. But using imagination behind them cannot be bought and paid for, it takes the genius that these filmmakers possess. And the special effects are used to create a world. Just for example, the ice world of Hoth where the beginning takes place. It's not just that we see a big icy world that looks like a frozen planet, but that we see creatures and ecosystems. This is a world. Not a set. The costumes used for Chewbacca and C-3PO and the comical R2-D2 are effective as the models for spaceships, but the most astonishing effect is Yoda, who is nothing more than an animatronic creature controlled and voiced by Frank Oz, who expresses every emotion that a human actor can through his face and eyes and this puppet Yoda has more emotion than the CGI one that was found in the prequel trilogy.But what I admire most about this picture is the dark, moody atmosphere, which is quite rare for a science-fiction picture. Typically, the atmosphere is cheery or lighthearted, as in the first movie, but ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is darker, most nihilistic, mysterious, and somber. It's a violent picture. Kills and betrayals are not felt as moves in a chess game. The characters are three-dimensional, especially Han Solo and Darth Vader, who before was just a strong supporting presence, but here has evolved into one of the screen's most chilling villains. Before he mostly just stood around and hissed through his voice machine, now he really dominates the screen and drops our jaws.Comparing the theatrical version to George Lucas's updated version, which includes an extended scene of the Yeti-like monster that attacks Luke early in the picture, both are equal in their majesty. Which is better? Hard to say, but it's close. So if a person came up to me and asked me ""which version should I see?"" I'd answer, ""take your pick. You'll have the time of your life.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Masterpiece,"Not only was it the most anticipated sequel in movie history it was and remains the greatest sequel in movie history. For me this movie is the benchmark.

the saga continues,"Director:Irvin Kershner, Script:Leigh Brackett, Lawrence Kasdan, Story:George Lucas, Cast:Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Alec GuinnesGeorge Lucas's decision to have someone else direct his film could have been a disaster but instead it worked out in the films favor. Kershner directed a very wonderful film here considered by many to actually be the best in the series. My mother-in law has all but the third on DVD so I've decided to watch all five that are currently out on DVD. I must say I think this might also be my favorite. This films seems to be more plot driven with perhaps less focus on the action than others in the series.After they destroy the death star(from the previous film), the rebel forces seek asylum on the ice planet Hoth. Darth Vader and his forces find them there and they flee. Luke Skywalker and R2D2 end up on the swamp planet Dagobah. The atmosphere of this planet is very surreal. Here we are introduced to Yoda who we all knew from the two prequels. Yoda is the Judi master and he teaches Luke about the ways of the Jedi and the secret power of the force. Luke is also guided by the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Meanwhile, Han Solo and Princes Leia end up on the planet Bespin. Here we are introduced to Lano, Han Solo's old friend and comrade. However, Darth Vader got there first and out of fear, Lando betrays his friend and hands them over to Darth Vador. Skywalker senses their danger and against the advice of both Yoda and Kenobi he leaves to save them.In this film, we are introduced to new characters and we also learn a secret about Darth Vader in relation to Luke Skywaklker(but I know none of you know this so I won't tell!). The previous film was a fun action oriented family film, this a much darker film. It deals with the forces of good and evil and its hero, Skywalker, is put into several situations where he is tempted to go over to the dark side. Also, Hans Solo is not rescued and we are not sure about what is going to happen to him. It seems as if the evil forces of Darth Vader are winning. This film leaves one wanting to see the next one. I have not seen episode six and I have heard it is not as good as ether this or A New Hope but It probably will reveal the fate of Hans Solo. One thing I personally liked about this film was the scenes at the beginning on the planet Hoth. The mountain scenes are beautiful. It is different from all the previous films. It actually looks like earth! I think it was filmed in either Alaska or British Columbia. Probably because it was a very high budget movie, it doesn't look as old as it is. Watch some low budget horror films from 1980 such as Friday the 13 and they seem very dated but this film holds up very well for a 25 year old film and to me looks as if it could have come out today.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It also bears some very unhappy truths as to where this franchise has gone over the years. This was the film out of the original trilogy that Lucas had very little to do with and it shows. It shines above all the rest as the fans favorite of all favorites. One of the main things that are forgotten about the original trilogy is that these films had very wonderful characters. Those cardboard creations of so called characters in the new films cannot stand up to the band of ragged rebels struggling against the oppressive Empire. The action is brilliant & helps the story instead of being pointless & an excuse for CGI overkill. I can only hope that once the Lucas legacy is passed on, new blood will continue on to breathe fresh air into this awesome vehicle of fantasy.

The first Star Wars movie didn't really turn me into a deep star wars fanatic, but I must say, these three movies are my absolute favorites!The second (or fifth, whatever it is the same anyway) part of the trilogy, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' is just as good as all the others. At some points it is more of a direct remake of the first movie, but mostly it is new profiles and new stories to experience. I thought the rescuing of an innocent princess was magic. Boy! Here (for those who did not knew) Luke gets to the ''Dagobah-system'' to find the Jedi-master Yoda, Obi Wan's master. There he will learn to suffer hard training, and wild adventures until he finally meets the master of darkness, Darth Vader. In the same leap goes Han Solo's adventure in Lando Calrissian's city in the clouds, together with Chewie, Leia, C3PO and R2-D2.

The one that got us hooked,"Along with Revenge of the Sith this is the fastest film in the trilogy.

I'm writing this having assumed most of the people reading have seen it, so I won't go into describing its magnificence as you can likely see that for yourselves. Suffice to say, it continued the magnificent trend of Star Wars films in the 80s and it still holds the flag up high today as a true contender for one of the greatest films of all time. Yet for me it is more important as a piece in the tapestry of the Star Wars Saga.It is as important as and as good as all the other Star Wars films to me. It is the darker middle act of the original trilogy allowing for that ecstatic ending in Return of the Jedi; it is the penultimate act of all 6 Star Wars films, again, the darker mood before the happy ending. It continues developing the story and characters we have become enamoured with and it does it SO well.

But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).I can't review ""Star Wars"" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to ""Star Wars"" and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Trek"" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"great movie, but still overrated","There's no doubt that this is a great movie and was revolutionary for its time, just how every Star Wars has been, even Episodes I-III, but definitely overrated. Least appealing action, no great up-close one-on-one battle, and definitely does not meet the standard of Return of the Jedi. It was a necessary aspect of the trilogy and can't be left out because of many necessary plot lines, but similar to Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers, drawn out. I don't even believe it would rank second in the new episodes that have been released in the past ten years that are far more revolutionary. They were part of the first movies to be filmed digitally and bring the most character development and bring the story full circle. Out of the 6 released Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back finishes in a dismal 5th.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A great sequel to Episode IV : A New Hope,"I had gotten curious about the ""Star Wars"" saga. But I had bought the DVD collector's box-sets of both the original and the new prequel film trilogies. And after that, I love the ""Star Wars"" saga.Where we left off from the first film, Luke Skywalker and his rebel band had form a based on the frozen planet of Hoth. Luke was surveying the area, when suddenly he and his tauntaun got attacked and caught by a snow monster called a Wampa. At the rebel base, Han Solo was about to leave for Tatooine to pay back Jabba the Hut, when he heard that Luke hadn't come back; so he sets out to find him. Meanwhile, Luke manage to escape from the wampa; but he finds himself caught in a blizzard and collapses in the snow. Suddenly, he sees the Force ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi appear before him. Ben tells Luke to go to Dagobah to undergo training under Yoda, a Jedi Grand Master. After the spirit disappears, Han rides up to an almost unconscious Luke, who is mumbling indistinctly about Ben, Yoda and Dagobah. At this point, the tauntaun that Han was riding on collapses and dies from the extreme cold. To keep Luke warm during the blizzard, Han uses Luke's lightsaber to cut open the dead tauntaun and places Luke in it. Han then sets about erecting a shelter that he and Luke will stay in during the night, until a search party found them.At the base, Luke was recovering well. But a probe droid that was spying on the band, had found the base! Darth Vadar attacked the base and the rebels scattered. Luke (along with R2) headed for Dagobah, remembering Obi-wan's word. And Han, Leia, Chewie and 3PO headed for Bespin the City in the Clouds. Meanwhile on Dagobah, after a...not so good start, Luke found Yoda and begins his Jedi training. But during his training, Luke senses his friends are in danger on Bespin.Now he must go and save them. But Yoda urges Luke not to go, because it is just what the Sith wants - to lure Luke into the Dark Side. But Luke must go! And he promises Yoda he will come back to complete his training.That's all I could tell you folks, watch it and see how it ends. I think it is a great sequel to ""Episode IV: A New Hope."" And also I am a Leia/Han shipper",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Much better than the original,"The second instalment of the original trilogy is in my opinion far better than the original film. The original film introduced something brand new to the movie scene back in the 70's but aside from being an instant classic and being very original it had some problems. The characters were very badly drawn up making them nothing more than card board cutt-outs and in the end that felt very unfulfilled. This problem is rectified in Empire Strikes Back. Its very obvious that George Lucas has had more fun writing the characters in the second movie. He begins to give them edge and more depth. The story in the second film is also far more fulfilling than that in the original and the twitch at the end is still one of the most interesting and well-thought-out twitches in movie history.The acting has also improved loads since the first film mostly due to the fact that the characters are better defined. Especially Mark Hamill shines in this film and if you compare him to the character of Anakin, played by Hayden Christensen, in Episode II you begin to see some similarities. They are both quite hot tempered and impatient and you actually see where George Lucas was going. Also Harrison Ford begins to show his real talents in this film. There are a few new characters in the film like Lando Calrissian, played by Billy Dee Williams, and Yoda, voice acted by Frank Oz, and they are both good adds to the cast list.The effects have of course improved and they serve to make the film even more visually interesting than the first film. Furthermore the second film is darker than the original film and this darkness works very well within the Star Wars universe and I wish they had use this darkness more in the third and final film of the series.All in all Empire Strikes back is the best Star Wars film out of all the series.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Is No Room For Improvement....,"Not only the greatest sequel of all time, but without question its the greatest movie ever made!  Topping the first film (A New Hope) seemed impossible, but George Lucas and Irvin Kershner did it in 1980 with EMPIRE. A darker, deeper, more elaborate action packed film that skillfully tells two inter-connected stories as characters from the original movie are powerfully developed.  Luke Skywalker comes of age and realizes a terrible family secret.  Princess Liea and Han Solo try every means of evading the Empire but eventually end up in Darth Vader's hands.  The climax of the film is unforgettable and the special effects are not only impressive even by today's standards, but perfectly serve to tell this incredible story.

The Most Spectacular Outer Space Fantasy Ever Made,"Although ""Star Wars"" set a new, spectacularly high standard for movie effects & action, it was also a remake that featured a cast of unknowns & semi-retired character actors. Even with a big budget and built-in audience, it would have been easy to make a second-rate follow-up or even a dud bad enough to kill the franchise. Leigh Brackett's clever script, Irvin Kerschner's directorial craft, George Lucas's unprecedented production values & the energy & intensity of the cast allowed ""The Empire Strikes Back"" to set a standard for outer-space adventure that has never been equaled. Lucas's first original ""Star Wars"" story emphasizes the series's two great strengths: fantastic action & the wily, wicked Galactic Empire. After their hidden base is found & destroyed, the Rebel Alliance flees in disarray, with Solo (Ford), Princess Leia (Fisher), Chewbacca & the droids hotly pursued in the damaged Millennium Falcon by an Imperial fleet. Luke (Hamill) vanishes into a jungle planet to find Jedi mentor Yoda & complete his training. Story flaws, including the fact that Luke's training takes place in the same amount of time as the Millennium Falcon's pursuit & the introduction of important characters near the end of the film, are unnoticeable unless you're looking for them. The action starts early & never lets up, with the battle of the ice planet alone more than enough for any action film. But there's plenty more where that came from, with the amazing flight through the asteroid field & the lightsaber duel in the cloud city standing out. Ford makes the most of his opportunity of developing Solo as a charming ""scoundrel,"" with Fisher game as his reluctant love interest. Hamill, who isn't really leading-man material, is sufficiently believable as the peasant hero growing into an elite warrior. The New Age, Oriental ""Force"" (rarely called a ""religion"") gets more prominence in ""Empire"" but never bogs down into hokiness or boredom. All these elements combine to give the film a never-failing theme of harried heroes hounded by an evil force that is so vast, powerful & diabolically clever that the viewer is moved almost, but not quite, to despair--exactly where Kerschner wants us. This is outer-space fantasy, not science fiction, so don't look for any science. And despite ""The Force"" as a plot device, there's no point in looking too deeply for Heavy Themes or Subtle Meanings. In fact, subtlety of any kind was pretty much killed off by this and other Lucas & Spielberg films. All you get with ""Empire"" is a couple of hours of straightforward, nonstop, matchless thrills without condescension or manipulation that you can enjoy again & again without ever getting tired of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best sequels ever!,"The first Star Wars film was released it was a massive success audience were craving for more. George Lucas promised more and when The Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980, it was not just a film release, it was an event. Despite fears that a sequel would never be as good as the original and the film technically under-performance this is one of the few sequels that was better then the original.Despite the Rebel Alliance destroying the Death Star and the universe now safe from the ultimate weapon the Empire had gone on the offensive against the rebels, hounding them out of the bases. They are led by Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones), the most fearsome commander for the Empire. On the ice planet Hoth, the Rebels have to fled when the Empire's forces attack. Within the Rebel camp Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamall) receives a message from Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi (Alec Guinness) from beyond the grave to go to the planet Dagobah and learn the ways of the Jedi from a powerful master Yoda (Frank Oz). His friends Hans Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and 3CPO (Anthony Daniels) have to escape Hoth and end up being chased by Darth Vader. They set out for safety to the Cloud City led by Hans' friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Vader himself becomes obsessed about finding the Millennium Falcon, and Luke who becomes a major threat to the Empire.Lucas did the smartest thing he could with this sequel, he took more of a back sit. It is known that he is not the best screenwriter and director in the world, but is he a great producer and ideas man. He came up with the basic story idea and wrote some of the key scenes, but it was Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan who wrote most of the screenplay and Irvin Kershner was brought in to direct. This team made a brilliant sequel expanding on the ideas of the original ideas of the film, from the mystical powers of the Jedi to the multiple worlds and creatures that are created to how the Empire function, which was a cross between the Roman Empire and Nazi Germany. Brackett and Kasdan with Kershner's direction were able to interweave multiple story lines in a space set epic. Like the original the Empire Strikes Back was able to use many sci-fi ideas into the film, multiple alien races, psychic powers, grant designs of futuristic weapons and warfare and a setting crossing fighting a dictatorship and general lawlessness. Kershner was able to make a atmospheric film which a darker in tone, particularly in the third act. He shot some of the best action sequences in the whole series, like the battle of Hoth, and the fight between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader was not just an excellent fight but also brooding experience, filled with tension and is one of the best sequences in film history. As well as it being the best Star Wars film it is also Kershner best film by a long way. Despite the darker tone Kershner was still able to lighten the film enough and allow the audience to relax with some well timed humour.The characters are developed even further. Darth Vader is even more menacing then he was in the first film with a dark ambition and secret, making him one of the best screen villains ever. He oozes a dark charisma and he is as ruthless as Hitler, Stalin and Mao when it came to military command and tactics. The relationship between Leia and Hans Solo also improves, from hating each other to discovering their true feelings. Luke too grows from a competent commander to a man who has to discovery his destiny, but also prone to his emotions, when he needed to master them. Billy Dee Williams is an excellent addition to the series and his character represent a moral dualities that inflecting the world they live in. They is good acting all round, with James Earl Jones and Harrison Ford being of the most worthy note.A must see for film fans everywhere.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is how you make a sequel!,"Just like The Godfather, they said it could not be done, but they made a sequel to Star Wars as compelling as the first. The Empire Strikes Back is darker than the original, but none of the matinée fun is lost in the process. In a sense, that makes it even more impressive than the first! In this chapter, the empire is closing in on the rebels and Luke must go learn from a mysterious Jedi named Yoda, while Han Solo and the rest of the rebels must dodge Darth Vader. The beauty of the first Star Wars is all here, the elements of destiny and fate, the terrifying scenes of Darth Vader, the powerful visuals, and the well-timed comic relief.

The Empire Strikes Back,"I have reviewed this film before but I thought that it deserved an extra special mention. Yesterday, this was the first film I saw in a cinema since we were all confined to barracks - and boy what a cracker. Where to start with the superlatives? It's fantastic - right from the opening bars of John Williams' score; on through the three mini-adventures rolled into one, we are treated to a marvellous feast of well-written, snappily directed, entertaining action packed adventure. Picking up from the first film, our rebels are holed up on a frozen planet being relentlessly pursued by Darth Vader. When one of his probes discovers their icebound base, they've got to get the hell out of there. Now sure, the CGI suffers a bit after 40 years; and can someone please tell me what the point of these lumbering Imperial Walkers is? They are like metal polar bears that constantly trip over their own shoelaces, but aside from those most minor of criticisms we have a great story; characters that we care about (personally, I'm an huge Vader fan) and who develop plausible, credible personalities; the detailed animations of ""Yoda"" are superb to see again on the big screen and it builds excellently to a sword fight the like of which has not been seen since ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938).

"R2D2 didn't activate the hyperdrive, Vader did","Although R2D2 was told that the hyperdrive was deactivated, it was made clear by C3PO that R2D2 had ""illusions of grandeur"" in thinking it could reactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. Also, notice that Vader was trying to reach out to Luke (on the Millennium Falcon) showing signs of a ""father/son"" bond. The clincher is when Vader is looking at the Falcon and the hyperdrive is suddenly activated. Shortly after, the Admiral, who was to have deactivated the hyperdrive, is taking one big gulp awaiting Vader to punish him for this screw-up. However, Vader solemnly walks out of the room with no show of anger.As such, I think it was Vader, and not R2D2, that re-activated the hyperdrive.

The Force is strong with this one...,"Star Wars may have been a brilliant beginning, but it's The Empire Strikes Back that has made sure this epic saga will remain unforgettable. In my opinion, this is the best Star Wars-movie ever, alongside Revenge of the Sith. Darker and more mature than its predecessor, Empire is 100% masterpiece.As the saga got more mature, George Lucas handed the writing and directing duties to other people: the then unknown Lawrence Kasdan and Lucas'film-making tutor, Irvin Kershner. With these people's help, the movie became darker, Greek tragedy being added to the Flash Gordon-style situations. As for the characters, they became richer and more ""human"" (the Han/Leia romance subplot is pure genius).Among all the great stuff, there are two things fans, but also ""ordinary"" people, tend to remember more fondly about this film: First of all, this is the episode that introduced Yoda, and what an entrance he makes: those expecting the wise Jedi from the prequels won't believe what they're seeing. This Yoda is an old fool who starts playing with Luke Skywalker's tools, stealing his food and even hitting R2-D2 with his stick, before getting mentally stable again and accepting to train Luke, so that the young boy can face Darth Vader who, as the title (and John Williams'magnificent Imperial March) suggests, has an essential role in this movie.But most of all, this film will remain immortal thanks to its shocking climax: unexpected, unpredictable (unless you've already seen the prequels or the Simpsons-episode where Homer spoils it) and unforgettable, it's the stuff really great movies are made of.People say the second part of a trilogy is always the trickiest to achieve; well, in this case, it was worth all the trouble: the Empire doesn't just strike back, it totally wins!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The best in the series,"Empire Strikes Back has long been my favorite in the original trilogy. I remember going to see this when this was released theatrically as a little kid with my grandma. Empire is one of the rare cases where the sequel blows away the original. Creator George Lucas got some very good help in making this with writer Lawrence Kasdan and hiring a director that actually knows what he was doing, Irvin Kershner. With outsourcing some good help, this collaboration turned out to being a winning team to bring (and improve upon) George Lucas's vision. The film looks incredible to this day and the groundbreaking special effects from the 1st film are improved upon and look better here. The story in this installment is darker(and better suited to my tastes), but is also stronger and better as a whole. The characters are better fleshed out then the original film, the chemistry between the actors and performance are also much better.

Learning Game,"George Lucas doesn't understand religion.  He can never convey the concepts and theories of it (or the belief in it for that matter) to any extent. Hence, the best movie he directed is American Graffiti since it is not so concerned with making obvious subtexts.Lucas pretends to know philosophy in the Star Wars series, but he never embellishes on the gray area between his monolithic ""good"" and ""evil"" sides. That said, The Empire Strikes Back remains the best in the Star Wars series because Lucas lets the reigns of directing fall to someone who knows what they're doing.  Irvin Kerschner is not a talented or smart director, but he has more sense in his head than Lucas.  Lucas' head is stuck in Never Never Land so it is up to Kerschner to add sense to the movie.There is also the support of Lawrence Kasdan (before the man wound up making garbage like Dreamcatcher) and Leigh Brackett touch up his original story in order to remove unnecessary garbage.  As Pauline Kael put it, the movie is not concerned about the ""comic book hedonism"" of the original Star Wars. Return of the Jedi would emphasize what happens when Lucas gets his way (again) and hires out some poor sap to direct.  The level of concern about Yoda this time is not the same as the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi, smart move.The level of static shots, using just pans and tilts, are marvelous compared to the constant sense of motion that Star Wars wants to make.  It gets worse with Attack of the Clones and Phantom Menace.  The biggest factor is that the effects haven't aged.  The space scenes are elaborate, but not annoying, and John William's score aptly supports them.  Compare the asteroid pursuit here to the vastly inferior one in Episode II, the magic has faded with CGI.Overall, there are good movies and bad ones.  The Empire Strikes Back is not better than Star Wars, it is a quantum leap forward from it.  If any film in the series holds my record for ambition, execution, and presentation...this is it.  4 out of 5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Brilliance Strikes Back,"Prior to 1980, there had not been a movie sequel that quite destroyed over dethroned the original in terms of quality, cultural impact, and everlasting effect. Ever since 1916, when the first movie sequel was born (Fall of a Nation---completing your pointless trivia of the day), there had been very few successful sequels that could stand tall with the original. Of course, there was French Connection II, and Godfather II, but neither of them could quite compare to the original. Enter Empire Strikes Back. Not only did this sequel have a tougher job to live to its original counterpart (a box office phenomenon that would forever change marketing, merchandising, and film-making for generations to come), but this sequel quite frankly did the unthinkable by changing the tone, raising the stakes, and not promising a happy-go-lucky ending that usually associates with sequels. Empire Strikes Back is yet another Star Wars movie that broke the rules of how to make a film and also ushered a new style and technique of film-making.This movie didn't have the expected ending. Not all the backstories and main stories reached a resolution. The bad guys did win. The good guys were doomed. This sort of stuff doesn't happen in blockbuster sequels, but Empire Strikes Back dared to do this. Accompanying the change in pace is an excellent score, superb directing, incredible action, top-notch special effects, and basically the complete package in entertainment. The blend of action, drama, suspense, romance, and humor is among the best you'll ever see in a movie. Not only is it one of the best sequels ever, but it's also one of the greatest movies ever. This sort of movie-making magic just can't be duplicated.Empire Strikes Back is about the travels of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo (Mark Hamill, Carrie Fischer, Harrison Ford) as they suddenly encounter a massive resistance coming from the Dark Side of the force. Led by an angrier and less sympathetic Darth Vader, the rebels are suddenly faster, swifter, and smarter in their attempt to control the universe. At the same time, Luke begins his training to become a Jedi knight, only to have his training stalled when the conflict is becoming increasingly dangerous to all his friends. While it is obvious George Lucas didn't have every detail planned out in the trilogy (Example: Leia/Luke/Han love triangle), he had a grand idea as to where the franchise was going story-wise.The strongest part of Empire Strikes Back is like that of the original: the special effects and the associating visual spectacles that transports you to a totally different universe. The film was larger-than-life, as every location is grander and more impressive than the last: beginning with Hoth (and its classic snow battle) and ending with Bespin. While this was Lucas' creation and story, we cannot forget the directing of Irvin Kershner, which was the best of the entire franchise. Thanks to him, the acting here was best, the surprises were best-hidden, and the pacing was at its peak. The two hours breeze by here, and is capped by one of the strongest finishes in any blockbuster movie.All of your regular characters were back and were at their most entertaining here: Han Solo is at his cockiest and funniest in the second installment, Luke Skywalker is at his most heroic (and most foolish), 3-CPO is at his funniest (and most irritating), and then Darth Vader is at his downright scariest. When Luke has to fight him, the only hint of sheer terror in the trilogy occurs then—as Darth Vader pretty much tosses him around like an unwanted ragdoll. Adding to the fear is John Williams' immortal imperial march song, which makes its debut here. The rest of the music in this movie is also spectacular, and should have won the Oscar that year.Bottom Line: This is one of the top sequels of all-time, because it separates itself from the original by changing the tone, and expanding (and improving) upon everything that make the original Star Wars so great: the writing, special effects, directing, costumes, blend of action and comedy, set design, characters, musical score, pacing, and overall fun. Empire Strikes Back outperforms the original Star Wars in every aspect; from the better first act to even the smaller things like the lightsaber dueling choreography. It would be years before we find a blockbuster sequel that can top the original, and that's Terminator 2 which doesn't occur until the next decade.Like I've said about Star Wars, if you have not seen this movie, it's because you are trying so hard to avoid it. If you don't like this movie, then it's because you just don't enjoy good movie-making. Empire Strikes Back is one of those rare movies that can be wholesomely entertaining yet engrossingly deep at the same time. This is borderline-art, and is a sheer joy from the first minute to the last. The Empire Strikes Back: raising the bar for blockbusters and sequels everywhere---too bad there's been so few of them that have matched the same level of quality.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Laugh it up, fuzzball...""","In a 'post-classical' era, films are often quite simplistic - they are driven by high-concepts and childish premises; experiencing them is fragmented by tie-in merchandising and the like. They concentrate on action too much, substituting character psychology. Or so the argument goes in Bordwell & Thompson's 2006 book ""Film Art"" - whether or not you agree with any of this, there is no questioning Star Wars' role in facilitating it.""The Empire Strikes Back"" was the first sequel to the hugely successful 1977 blockbuster ""A New Hope"" - picking up where the other left off but, strangely, not really feeling like it does an awful lot to advance what we witnessed other than put its protagonist through a training regime and have his friends chased around space by some villains for 90 minutes. How far have things REALLY been advanced by the time this 1980 effort has finished, beyond a quaint love story and a jarring familial revelation?The film's opening act takes place on a barren, wintry planet called Hoth. Following the destruction of the Death Star at the end of Episode 4, a weapon capable of destroying a single planet in one foul strike, a military group known as 'the Rebels' retreat in the wake of an Empirical counter-attack, which involves despatching robotic probes to various parts of the galaxy to scout the potential positions. What everyone is fighting for, we still don't know. Later on, during a conversation about mineral mining in a visually impressive city built into the sky, it is inferred the fighting is to do with control of natural resources.When we first see the series' hero, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), on the surface of Hoth in a blizzard, he looks a little like an alien in his arctic gear complete with goggles and mouth-scarf - you might say he bears a passing resemblance to the film's villain, Darth Vader, whose jet-black helmet covers his entire face and gives him a similar un-human quality. Skywalker unfurls his coverings, looking far more grizzled than in the first film. We are then lulled into a false sense of security when ally Han Solo (Harrison Ford) confirms over a radio that the 'sensors' are in place. Job done, we conclude - but Luke is ambushed by a snow monster and dragged off to its cave.Not returning, and with Solo out there looking for him, the base takes the decision to close the main doors as the dark creeps in and the perishing cold become overwhelming. Cleverly, director Irvin Kershner focuses on the pained expression of Princes Leia (Carrie Fisher) as they shut - whose fate does she fear for the most? Luke's escape from the Yeti provides us with a tantalising early look at the power of the lightsaber, which takes the monster's arm clean off - an important detail for a later duel... But why does Luke then LEAVE the safety of the cave as the storm rages? Why did the film have him caught in the first place? Half-dying in the snow, he has a vision of dead friend Obi-wan (Alec Guinness) who tells him to seek ""Yoda"" on another planet so that he may complete Jedi training, but we know that Obi-wan can appear at any time to tell him this - Luke doesn't need to be on his last legs and think he's hallucinating.Eventually, one of those enemy probes passes by the base, but the Rebels mysteriously attack it when the plan was to maintain invisibility - why not just let it pass? Cover blown, the Empire attack - but are the Rebels evacuating the base or defending it? We're not sure. Irrespectively, the act ends when the Hoth fight ends - Solo; Leia; Chewbacca and a friendly robot named C3PO leave on Solo's ship whereas Skywalker departs to find Yoda with R2D2.From here, the film cuts into two halves: Luke's strand is slow, methodical and contemplative as he spends time on a jungle planet with a small green alien learning how to perfect abilities in 'the force', whereas Solo and the gang endure a more causality driven experience as Vader's ship pursues them through asteroid belts; the stomachs of giant worms and cities built into the clouds.What becomes curious about the film at this stage is that the antagonist, Vader, makes a conscious decision to pursue Skywalker not to kill him, but capture him so that they may join together as villains. In addition to this, an entire passage of the film beds said protagonist down in one place so that he may learn about patience; concentration and being contemplative - hardly things associated with 'post-classical' cinema. By today's standards, this is positively blockbuster revisionism. But surely there is a hole in Skywalker's training: is he not working towards wrecking a revenge on Vader? Isn't this contrary to the force's teachings?Solo's strand is more simplistic, more familiar to this post-Star Wars era blockbuster school: the bad-guys are chasing the good-guys; there is a meagre romance between Solo and Leia - royalty mingling with common-folk. Amusingly, Kershner uses a recurring gag to do with Solo's ship's power-thrust mechanic failing to roar into action when he needs it, and we grin at the metaphor. Strikingly, very little of any real interest happens on this strand which seems present to keep people amused as the other stuff plays out.I read and hear of people remarking how much 'darker' the film's tone is, and so it is better than IV, but I would disagree. Tonally, the films seem quite similar - certainly, the characters here are in hairier situations, but so what? It ends on more of a downbeat note, for Skywalker; Solo and even Vader, but does so in order to tee up the next film, not because its ending is in line with any kind of thematic it's exploring. How is one to conclude now, almost 40 years on from the changing of the cinematic guard? ""Empire..."" is functional, but perhaps undeserved of its status.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The best movie I have ever seen.,"I think that it is the best movie out of the trilogy and it is the best movie I have ever seen.

The plot is well structured and leaves you  wanting more, I enjoy it every time I see it.My favourite scene in the movie and a great movie moment in history is the part when Yoda raises the X-wing out of the waters on Dagobah.

More action at the expense of interesting characters,"While its predecessor laid the groundwork for character development in a fantastical world of unknown planets and creatures, this story focuses more on the determination and execution of power. The music is thematic to each character or circumstance which proves to create a specific tone depending on the characters that are seen on screen, and though risk is amplified and deception is introduced to further texturize the unique Skywalker story, the aggressive use of dated special effects creates a distraction more so than an escape. Where ""A New Hope"" stands strongly as a solo film, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is distinctly positioned as a bridge between the introduction and conclusion of this three-part saga which provides an array of moving parts with nearly no resolution. The film is incredibly exciting because of the amount of turbulence these characters face collectively and individually, but without the technology or staging process to propel audiences deep into the cockpits of space (which is where most of this film takes place) an argument could be made that this vision was truly ahead of its time. A reputable expansion of the events from the first film that simultaneously withholds the expansion of these characters and everything that made them interesting to begin with.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

An epic continuation of the Star Wars saga,"The first time I watched STAR WARS, the immortal words ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" were not there on the screen. I cannot recall when it was that I first saw those words and realized that STAR WARS was but one chapter of a much larger whole.When STAR WARS: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK came out, my father and I went to the theater and watched in awe as that next chapter unfolded. The plot twists were shocking at times (although in today's world, rather cliché -- but they were not cliché _then_) and at other times, goofy.The dialog was just as I remembered STAR WARS -- stilted, canned, and corny (witness the dialog between Han Solo and the Princess if you want to know what I mean). But let's face it -- you do not watch STAR WARS because of the dialog. You watch it in the same vein as reading old epic tales of Greek Gods and Heros -- for the things they are doing, not the things they are saying.Overall, this is either the best, or second best of the six STAR WARS films. Well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
To the Hoth System!,"Episode VI is a very mixed movie. I think it gets more appraisal than it deserves (though I admit that the acting is much better this time around). The movie also has a type of darkness that makes it different from the first.My problem with this film is very much the same as with Episode II. It always felt like ""Return of the Jedi: Part I"" rather than its own movie. True it has great moments and surpasses Episode II in the amount of variety (Ep. II always looked very plain for some reason) but an open ending in films is something I look at with some reserve (except with Resident Evil).The good thing is that RotJ picks up soon after and we get a brilliant closure. Not the greatest film in my view, but a good film none the less.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
a revised impression,"I have seen Star Wars probably 35-40 times and Empire about 20 but had never watched them back to back (on consecutive nights) until the new DVD versions came out. Put me in the camp of those who feel the added digital effects are a desecration; I want to see the movies the way they were released originally. I simply tried to ignore the alterations and was successful for the most part. It certainly is nice to see these films in widescreen, with outstanding picture and sound quality.I felt the same way after seeing Star Wars again that I have since 1977: it is the greatest achievement in the history of movies. To my surprise, however, when I watched Empire the next night, I was disappointed. It is a very well-directed, well-polished movie, but to my mind, it lacks the visual, graphic brilliance that helped make the original so extraordinary. Star Wars and American Graffiti, the two masterpieces George Lucas directed in his youth, both have an incredible, unmatched look. Lucas didn't move the camera much, but he made up for it with the amazing, jukebox-like style of what he photographed with it. Empire lacks that quality.***SPOIILERS AHEAD*** Star Wars was really a perfect story that ended with what is still the greatest action sequence ever (the Death Star battle) followed by the ultimate coda (the Throne Room scene). Watching Empire right afterward was a little jarring. Suddenly, without warning, we learn that despite destroying ""the ultimate power"" in the universe, the rebels have gained no advantage, and they're on the run, stuck hiding on a miserable little ice planet with a single, tiny base. Wouldn't more fighters, more systems have joined the Alliance after the destruction of the Death Star? How did the rebels go from ultimate victory to being nearly crushed so quickly?Another major shock to me -- and probably the biggest weakness of Empire -- was the change in the relationships of the three main characters. In Star Wars, from the moment Luke first saw Leia, he was in love with her (""who is she? she's beautiful"") -- so much so that he stood dumbstruck when he first entered her cell on the Death Star. There were strong hints that Leia reciprocated -- she kissed him (half on the cheek, half on the lips) twice, looked very nervous when he seemed dead in the final battle, and certainly Luke was in puppy-love with her the entire film. Now, all of a sudden, in Empire, Luke and Leia are on-screen together for about three minutes total, and there is no hint of Luke's love for her. Without explanation, now it's all about Han and Leia, who despite no hint of attraction in Star Wars are suddenly are madly in love. I suspect there are three main reasons for this:1. Unlike Fisher and Hamill, Harrison Ford was not signed up for sequels. He only agreed to come back on condition that his character was developed from the wisecracking, cynical sidekick into the wisecracking, cynical, romantic hero lead. This gave his career a great boost, but in my opinion totally undercut the character of Luke Skywalker, who should have been the emotional focus of the movie (as he was in Star Wars).2. Mark Hamill's disfiguring car accident in December 1976 (after completion of principal photography on Star Wars) made it easier to turn his character into a monk-like, asexual person (the process that started in Empire and finished in Jedi). In Star Wars Hamill was a handsome, though callow, screen presence. But after the accident (despite plastic surgery), he just didn't look good. It hampered his performance and basically destroyed his capacity to play a romantic lead.3. To the extent that Lucas planned to have Leia be Luke's sister (a terrible decision that I suspect was not made until after the release of Empire), they obviously could not be romantically involved. However, their ""incestuous"" love for each other is all over Star Wars. I think the decision to make Leia and Luke siblings only came after the radical character revisions in Empire eliminated any romantic feelings between Luke and Leia and turned Luke into a boring monk.Indeed, Empire's greatest weakness is that it's too heavy. The ""dark side of the force"" was only briefly discussed in Star Wars, but here it's played up to an extent that the concept just can't support. Yoda says that ""fear, anger, hatred"" lead to the dark side, but how exactly is a human being supposed to avoid these emotions? The Force was fleshed out just the right amount (i.e., not too much) in Star Wars, but here it is revealed not to make a whole lot of sense. There's way too much ""good vs. evil"" that's no longer presented in a fun style in Empire. It's taken too seriously, which reminds me of the Lord of the Rings movies -- not a good thing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best of the Original Star Wars Trilogy,The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the original Star Wars Trilogy. The sets were even better than the Star Wars sets.

This movie has more character development than the other Star Wars films. The special effects are even better than the first one. I think this is Darth Vader's most sinister role of any of the other Star Wars movies. Secrets will be unfolded. I think Irvin Kershner did a great job directing this one.

It's much more enjoyable and interesting when you know what everyone's talking about! This being the second of the ""original"" films, coming after the mega-success of the first movie, there was obviously more money spent on the sequel and it shows. Many impressive locations and effects, and I really loved the music score this time around (especially the ominous ""theme"" each time we returned to Darth Vader's ship). Better performances from the main cast (especially Mark Hamill), too.One interesting observation for me is that I'm noticing how dated many of the ""puppet"" effects seem today, coming after the newer prequels! This is unusual for me, as I have always gone on record as slamming CGI and always praising the ""old school"" of rendering offbeat characters (I still do); but after enjoying little Yoda as an animated being in REVENGE OF THE SITH and now seeing a less convincing ""prop"" of this character as originally realized for EMPIRE, I may just be starting to gain a slight new appreciation for some of the computer graphics. ***1/2 out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Best of the Star Wars Franchise, and Most Fun to Watch","Some spoilers ahead""Empire Strikes Back"" is the best of the ""Star Wars"" movies, and a vast improvement over the original. This may have to do with the absence of George Lucas as director, but the most conspicuous examples of this film's qualities are the improved acting of the leads since their appearance in the original, new memorable and interesting characters, and a compelling storyline.Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are slightly better than they were in the original. Luke Skywalker still seems a bit green and immature, but he undergoes some transformation as he undergoes his Jedi training with Yoda. For a rubber puppet, Yoda is a magnificent character. He embodies the mature spiritual and moral characteristics that Lucas wanted the Jedi to embody. He warns Luke not to yield to his dark visions of his friends' suffering, and that he must instead complete his training. It is Yoda, rather than Obi-Wan, who truly leads Luke down the long and arduous path to being a Jedi. Frank Oz, despite sounding like one of his myriad Muppet characters, brings a calm, almost dispassionate persona to Yoda. This great Jedi Master is a welcome addition to this movie.Another new interesting character is Lando Calrissian, played elegantly by Billy Dee Williams. Calrissian, like Han Solo, is morally ambiguous, and is forced to betray his old friend after Han and Leia have been intercepted by Darth Vader and the mercenary Boba Fet. He is a almost a mirror image to the roguish Han Solo, though his switch to the side of the good guys seems rather abrupt. Overall, Williams plays his rather secondary role admirably.One of the few characters to improve is Lord Vader. James Earl Jones has trained his voice to match Vader's ruthlessness and lack of empathy. He plays the bad guy as calm, cool, contemplative, and almost emotionless, which matches Vader's spiritual nature (his devotion to the Dark Side) and which amplifies the character's ability to intimidate audiences. If Vader were some cackling, maniacal supervillian, no one would take his menace seriously. The scriptwriter deserves some credit for making Vader far more sadistic and evil than he was in the original, e.g. his willingness to risk his own men's lives in an asteroid field, and his penchant for strangling a series of Imperial officers for simple mistakes. David Prowse, the man in the Darth Vader costume, also does very well here.The story is better than the first because it moves beyond the simple ""damsel in distress"" and ""good-triumphs-over-evil"" themes of the first. The good guys do not triumph either in the beginning or the end, and we also learn that the Force is a more complex power than the original movie suggested, e.g. that yielding to one's emotions, even to save one's friends, is a dangerous gamble. The actions scenes and special effects are equal, if not better, than the first movie's. The settings of the ice planet of Hoth, the swamp world of Dagobah, and the glittering white Cloud City mining camp are beautifully rendered. This, like the first movie, is not high art, but it is a very competent and mature science fiction movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best of Them All !!!,"Without a doubt the empire strikes back is the best star wars film out of the lot, even the new ones which in my opinion devalue the saga. From beginning to end you watch Luke learn to use the force and become a jedi, you also see the return of a very significant character in obi-wan kenobi. To learn the truth of Luke's father and who he is, is the shock of the decade. From the swamps of the degobah system to the sky's of cloud city this film is an adventure of mass proportions with an ending to rival any film, old or new. Lukes quest to become a jedi takes a twist when he faces darth vader for the first time, when vader breaks him mentally and physically you cant see a way back for our hero. Smuggler han solo is frozen in carbonite and taken to jabas tower on tatooine where we await the next instalment.

The best of all six,"Where the first was an introduction to this vast universe, this is a further adventure in it, and an expansion of it. New worlds, creatures and technologies. Like its predecessor, this has something for everyone, and this is a stronger film... perhaps the most so, of the entire series. Kershner is undoubtedly at least part of the reason... he worked to make the characters realistic and credible beyond what they were, and it pays off. The various relationships are more believable than in the others, and the developments are very natural. This offers an emotional connection to the material, for the viewer, in addition to all the entertaining aspects. The plot remains interesting throughout and it never stands still. The pacing is spot-on, there isn't a boring moment in the two hour running time. The effects are impeccable, and Lucas had the crew push themselves to the limit, and it shows... big time. The score is yet again fantastic, Williams adds to what he created for IV. The acting is good, and seldom poor. The tone gets darker, setting up a sequel. The episode before this was a solid story even if it would be the only in the franchise, and this is a perfect middle part. This has by far the greatest light-saber action in the Original Trilogy. This is exciting and masterful with dialog and tension of high quality. The DVD features a commentary track well worth a listen, with several speakers, including Irvin. I recommend this to fans of Star Wars(regardless of what exactly you take that to mean), science fiction and movies. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best in the trilogy,"This is no doubt the best of the three Star Wars films. I don't count the 'prequels' or recent 'sequels', spin-offs and such.The original film was lots of fun, but it was also trying to find out what it was, to establish a distinct tone, to define the universe it was played in, and so on. Also, a limited budget impacted the production in tangible ways. Now, for 'Empire', they had all these things in place. The characters were developed, the universe defined, the budget was there. Also, a better film director was employed this time around.The film further develops the characters, in most enjoyable and interesting ways. There is drama here, that neither the first nor the third film ever came close to. And the scenes on Hoth remain the most memorable for me personally.But there is a problem here: the exploration of the 'force'. It never went anywhere. It got bogged down in the swamps of Dagobah, and became incoherent drivel that seemed to randomly pick up elements from various philosophies. Yoda's teachings have all the depth of a 'How to find peace with the universe' booklet you can buy for a dollar. I hated Yoda and everything about him. When they realised they were dealing with quasi-philosophical nonsense, the filmmakers tried to compensate for it by making Yoda arrogant and pretentious, as he makes silly demands on his pupil. Also, the return of Obi Wan was annoying to me, and totally unnecessary. But another problem is created by turning Luke's training into his mess: he remains an alien character. We emote with Han, Leia, Chewie, and the droids, but not him. He never becomes intriguing or relevant for our emotional investment in the film. Until the end of the third film, he remains this alien figure that exists to push forward the plot about the 'force', while everything truly interesting and emotionally engaging revolves around the other protagonists. His confrontations with Vader remain sterile and feel like something the film is obligated to deliver, but no one truly enjoys. When I was a kid, I wanted to be Han Solo. Luke never became a hero, and nothing he ever did moved me the way the adventures of Han and the other protagonists did.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
More than 20 times viewed and it NEVER gets old,"I literally watched this movie about twenty times when I first got it, VHS , a box-set of the original three. But this one is best! It was the most exciting, it kept you on the edge of your seat and your mind the whole way through. Although, I have to say, Lucas has become very lazy in the Star Wars saga since the Phantom Menace, which was quite poor. This is vintage Lucas and this your vintage space movie. Star Wars (any of the original 3 and Episode 3) is a must see! It includes many household names. Some, though, hate Star Wars with a vengeance. Those people lack in creativity and are subject to boring, lack-luster films. All I can say is have fun because I know you won't for missing out on this 5-star, one of a kind classic.

The Movie That Made Star Wars,"In 1977 Star Wars Episode IV, the revolutionary sci-fi fantasy film, played on screens all over the world and changed the word cinema as we know it today. Star Wars gave new meaning to visual appeal and opened an entire galaxy of aliens, heroes, villains, soldiers, and legends to everyone everywhere. With inflation accounted for, Star Wars still stands as the best box office hit ever. But despite all the accomplishments of Star Wars Episode IV without the success of Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back the Star Wars series would never have reached the longevity and greatness it has today.We all know the story. Luke is the last (as portrayed then) hope for a struggling rebel alliance trying to put a stop to the harsh, tyrannical rule of the Galactic Empire. Along with a bizarre group of companions (Chewbacca, Han Solo, Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C3PO, and R2D2) Luke goes from a typical poor farmer boy to blowing up the biggest space station in the empire. The Empire Strikes Back elaborates. With Obi-Wan having been killed by the mysterious Darth Vader Luke meets the isolated and nearly deranged Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo and Leia make shelter at the City in the Clouds only to be betrayed by Lando, Han's old friend who is the proprietor of the city. With his friends in captivity with the Empire, Luke abandons his training with Yoda prematurely and goes to save them. Luke and Vader confront one another giving the world the first great lightsaber duel and a true look at the power of the 'Force' and its manifestations. Vader tells Luke the notorious ""I am your father"" line and the biggest twist in cinema history is sealed. They all escape (save Solo), Luke minus a hand chopped off by Vader. Han Solo is frozen in carbonite. Needless to say there is no definite ending, which is okay for a 2nd of 3 movies.What makes The Empire Strikes Back so great cannot be cornered to one portion or aspect.-Creator George Lucas already had the story which obviously helps. Many sequels fail because they lack freshness and creativity. Lucas had the stories for 12 Episodes before even releasing Episode IV.-Yoda and Lando were the only new characters and Frank Oz and Billy Dee Williams both had firm grips on the story and their roles in the plot.-The revelation that Luke's father was actually very alive and in fact Darth Vader was one of the most anticipated but yet not surely known twists ever.-The visuals in Episode V kept par and passed Episode IV. The ice planet Hoth, the City in the Clouds, Dagobah, and the asteroid monster were all amazing eye candy in 1980.-Irvin Kershner also did a brilliant job directing, much better than Lucas himself did in any of the prequels or Episode IV. He made the original encounter with Yoda perfect. It was as not only was Luke meeting Yoda, but so were you.-And of course, John Williams served up another score of brilliance. He's the best composer to ever work in film.What The Empire Strikes Back truly does is save the Star Wars series. If this movie was some half-attempted low rent film that coasted off the success of the original like almost every other sequel out there we would not be here now talking about the prequels and the Return of the Jedi would have been some movie that topped the box-office for one weekend before falling into oblivion. This movie maintained the greatness of the original and then some.The perfect sequel for the perfect trilogy, this movie, it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
How do you match Star Wars? Make The Empire Strikes Back!,"When George Lucas made the Empire Strikes Back, he succeeded where so many filmmakers have failed. A Sequel to match the original, and the secret is simple, don't mess with the formula that worked the first time.The Darkest movie in the trilogy, Empire Strikes back is also home one of the finest battles in movie history. The Battle of Hoth is so full of imagination and excitement, it still stands out as one of my favourite action sequences of all time. Empire also introduces us to Yodi, the Jedi Master, who now has to train Luke to take over the fight against the dark side of the force, While Han and Leia try to escape the clutches of the Galactic Empire.Cloud city is the setting for the finale of the movie, another beautifully created scenic world from the mind of the great George Lucas. While Han is tortured and then turned over to Jabba's bounty hunters, Luke Finally has to face Darth Vader and learn the truth behind the power.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best movie ever made.,This is my favorite movie of all time. I grew up watching the original trilogy and I have been into Star Wars and movies ever since. This movie and King Kong are really important to me because if it was'nt for them I would'nt be the same. Anyway the plot summary. The plot is great and original. I love how this was one of the first movies where the baddies win. Come on the bad guys gotta win sometime. It is'nt fair that the goodie tooshoo's always win. The effects are some of the best I've ever seen. They were the best in their time and the best today. The acting is great as well. The actors take great passion and empathy in their roles and it helps make the movie so great.

A good sequel,"This sequel to ""Star Wars"" is good but not great and although a tad overrated, it still delivers.Three years have passed since the first film and the rebels are being hunted by Darth Vader while Luke Skywalker trains in the ways of the Force under the guidance of Yoda. Han Solo and Princess Leia take the time out to have a clichéd romance on Cloud City and at the end, we get the ultimate twist ending which I won't spoil for newbies.This is grand entertainment with a dark tone, great performances and one heck of a light-saber duel but the cons are there. Some of the battle scenes are protracted and uninteresting, the romance subplot is boring and clichéd and the story as a whole lacks solidity.There are two new faces this time who add plenty of spice. Billy Dee Williams is simply cool as Lando and Frank Oz delivers a fantastic job as Yoda. Watching this, I truly believe that Oz should have been nominated for an Oscar. He got us to care and root for a puppet, something CGI has never done successfully, at least not for me.Bottom line, even though it lacks solidity and is a bit overrated, this is one hell of a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A truly masterpiece and the best film of the original trilogy,"The Empire Strikes Back, sequel to A New Hope, is fairly considered by many as the best movie of the Star Wars saga, because the film presents exciting fresh ideas, a more mature tone, it's mindblowing, fun as hell and is presents everything what makes people love Star Wars.The characters are better here than before, in A New Hope. Darth Vader is more intimidating, looks cooler and in every scene where he is, he's being badass and that's makes everything better. The relantioship of Leia and Han is just perfect, every scene of them interacting is really fun to watching and the time passes just too fast. The training of Luke in Dagoba, with Yoda, shows why Star Wars is the phenomenon it is, because embraces the weird stuff with pride, fantasy and sci-fi at their best. Lando is a charismatic character, and even by what he's done, you can't feel angry about him. It's great to see Luke's journey evolving, and reaching the apex in Return of the Jedi.The visual effects here are better than in A New Hope. The Battle of Hoth is amazing, the AT-AT walkers were so damn perfect, makes it everything better, and the photography of the whole sequence is great, as in the whole movie itself, the sountrack, again, as in the movie itself. Every aspect of the movie deserves compliments.The most remembered scene of the movie, the revelation that Darth Vader is Luke's father, is revolutionary, mainly because of the date when the movie was released, is that what I mean when I said exciting fresh ideas. The movie is worthy of a second watching, and even more. It's impossible to get sick of it.

This movie gives them MUCH more to do.  Plus the special effects are very very good, and even in 2002 more than hold their own against the best of today.Yoda was an OUTSTANDING creation.

Casablanca in Space,"To me, ""Empire"" is the perfect illustration of a B-series movie state of grace. Not only this one is the best of all in the ""Star Wars"" anthology, even better than the Lucas's ones, in all respects, but it is a true lesson of cinema. I use to say that it is ""Casablanca"" in space. (look at the poster !)Kershner - a clever, pragmatic, director - has done the best work ever in history of science fiction / fantasy / fantastic series, for ""Empire"" is one of the most achieved films in dramatic writing, special effects credibility, light, editing and rhythm, estetics, philosophy, and even on the subject of love stories (all the others segments of love stories in the Star Wars anthology are... just fake). The only movie I remember that can be compared to this achievement, and particularly in the ""classic special effects era"" (before 1983) is Ridley's Scott's ""Blade Runner"". Think about that.""Empire"" has changed a lot of things in the fantastic genre. The very subtle psychology of such characters like Darth Vader or Han Solo was a whole new intention in the B-movies in 1980, and has been imitated a lot since then, until ""Pirates of the Caribbean 2"" last year. Think about that, too.On a personal point of view, I think ""Empire"" is a totally mastered work, a work that suffered, but that acquired a true soul. Remember Kersh wanting to be dropped on the top of an ice mountain to conceive the fact to be cold, really cold - and the helicopter that couldn't take him back to the base... That's the way true movies were done, a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...Raphaël Zamochnikoff Nice, France",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

With twits and turns all around this movie is definitely worth a watch.

Better than the first?,"The Empire Strikes Back does not suffer from 'middle film syndrome'. It greatly enhances the Star Wars universe. Luke Skywalker's (Hamill) adventures take us to the ice planet Hoth, where the Rebels are hiding from the Imperials. They're eventually rooted out by Darth Vader and his army. Luke, Leia (Fisher) and Han (Ford) and the droids make their escape, the former heading to Dagobah for Jedi training, whilst the others seek help from an old friend. TESB is full of blistering action; the battle of Hoth, with the AT-AT walkers and Luke's first Jedi experiences making the back of the neck tingle. A now heightened romance between Han and Leia plays out to stunning effect. New characters are introduced, but only a few so that Empire never detracts from the main trio. Then there's the twist.

John Williams score is probably another reason why so many fans rate this so highly. Though the main themes from the first movie are all present and correct, the films darker tone is reflected perfectly in the soundtrack. Yet there are still moments of hope (the swelling strings as Yoda gives Luke a pointed lesson that ""size matters not). Oh yes, and there's also the matter of THAT revelation!

Holds Up the Best of the Whole Saga,"As a kid I was raised on Star Wars, all six of them. I loved each one, but this one stood out as being one of the worst of the bunch. I have no idea why, but watching it now it's easily the best.The plot takes a darker turn, and it works perfectly. A New Hope felt like a somewhat poor beginning to the series (a little forced and rushed at times. Still a good movie though), but this one starts it up again and immediately makes it better. It picks up right off the bat, then slows back down again. It's quite well paced.The characters and their relationships are further developed too, now that they aren't just a bunch of people thrown together due to circumstances. Instead, their a bunch of people thrown together due to circumstances all supporting the same cause and willing to actually work together.Overall The Empire Strikes back is just the best Star Wars movie. It holds up the best of them all, and has a serious, darker tone that works really well. Unfortunately not all the movies could be this good.

Great successor,"'Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back' has it easier on the one hand, since the basic characters and the basic story can be taken for granted. On the other hand, the sequel is automatically compared with the predecessor and the pressure of expectation is high.Episode V doesn't need to hide from its predecessor. On the contrary, it's even a bit better. The main reason for this is that the aforementioned basic elements no longer need to be introduced. This episode can deal with new things and, above all, a deeper story right from the beginning.Starting with the battle on the ice planet Hoth. This is really good and can convince with the effects. The mood is altogether more threatening, darker and a bit more brutal. This part seems more serious and adult than Episode IV, but the funny and easy undertone of the characters is still not lost. This is mainly due to Han Solo, C3PO and R2-D2.We also learn more about Darth Vader and Yoda appears on the scene (again). Yoda is one of the best characters, but I find him in the first scenes when Luke meets him like a senile, not serious, slightly stoned weirdo.Overall, a successful continuation and an ideal starting point for the conclusion of the first trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The whole thing is just so beautiful to look at, especially the stuff in the snow.

Best of the trilogy,"This movie is the best of the three. Better lightsaber sequences, and better effects. The realtionship  between Luke and Yoda, especially when Yoda tells Luke not to leave, but he leaves anyway, was great. Han and Leia get a little bit of action, and C-3P0 gets pushed around. The ending was a complete shock for me. I never thought a sequel can be better than the original, I was wrong. A great film, I suggest for everyone to see it. 11/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The greatest sci fi film of all time,"Empire Strikes Back is the prime example of how to do a movie sequel; it furthers the story,raises the stakes, expands the characters and universe, goes in daring new directions, improves the technicals and fixes any of the flaws found in the previous film. Empire is a lot darker than its predecessor and this helps to heighten the drama and make the story more compelling as now we truly see the threat the empire can impose. It becomes more though provoking as a philosophical side to the force is introduced. New, equally iconic and beloved characters are introduced, characters like Yoda, Lando and Boba Fett. This is also the film that truly defined Darth Vader as one of the greatest villains of all time as not only is he made more intimidating but also more complex thanks largely to the infamous twist. Yet the film still manages to be just as fun as the original as we have great space battles and the greatest lightsaber duel of the entire saga. Yet what makes these action scenes so cowling and exciting is our emotional investment we have with the story and characters, you will laugh, cry, feel tense and cheer, once the end credits roll you'll be emotionally drained.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The one that provides the saga's magic,"First,I'd like to add two things. I don't think that the whole Star Wars trilogy is an unique masterpiece, but then ESB belongs to my favourite movies. Why? While Episode 4 needs almost an hour to speed up and Episode 6 puts too much emphasis on little cute furballs, ESB is quite different from them. The atmosphere is dark and desperate, the plot as well as the characters are worked out perfectly in this part. Here we find most of the things which made that huge impact of Star Wars on our culture; John William's Imperial March, the first (and more impressive) appearance of Yoda and of course the legendary lightsaber duel at the end- when I think of Star Wars, it's ESB I remind. So there are two things to say:If you don't know the Saga, watch all three of them in the right order but don't give up after the first one, ESB will probably change your mind if you thought it was too childish. And then, may the force be with George Lucas to make Episode 1 look like Empire Strikes Back.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The epitome of what the 2nd installment of a trilogy is!!!,"I will summarize my comments in one short conversation a friend and I had three weeks ago.  We were discussing Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.  I was voicing my displeasure with the utter predictability of the show and total lack of any climactic event and being left with a feeling of absolutely nothing happened in that film.  My friend replied with the comment, ""That's what the ""middle"" film of a trilogy is.  It is simply the glue for the first and third films.  Not every trilogy is STAR WARS.""  My point exactly.  Empire is still light years ahead of itself simply because it is still the only ""middle film"" of a trilogy to keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you taken aback by its own climactic events and revelations.  We can all remember the first time we saw the Battle of Hoth and were blown away, also who cannot say their world was sent for a spin when we found out Darth was Luke's father.  We all have our own personal moments with STAR WARS.  The music still stirs our souls and is prevalent in our society.  Ask any Raiders fan if they enjoy the Imperial March.  It is a part our culture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not all that bad,"The Empire Strikes Back is not all that bad and has its moments.Once again a simple film which is easy to follow. I can see why a lot of kids, probably 10-12 year olds or even younger loved theses films as there was nothing like it at the time. It would also appeal to many sections of the public as harder or more intellectual films often divide their audiences. Star Wars is quite simple and never goes over your head which is why many children and many adults as well like itIt is quite amusing to note that one of the most quoted lines in movie history is actually incorrect. Darth Vader actually says 'No I am your Father' in reply to Luke protesting otherwise.

This is the one!,"Of all the films in this series, this (the second filmed) is very much the great one. No time is wasted on character development as we covered that in the original Star Wars, this offers thrills and effects that still highly entertain. The entire cast is better in this than the first simply, I guess, because they have become more comfortable in their roles and after the amazing and surprising humongous success of the first, they were now taking this much more seriously. Actors aside, this is a directorial triumph more than anything. What a visionary Lucas was, even though the directorial credit went to Irvin Kirshner due to Lucas dropping out of the Directors' Guild, but make no mistake about this though. This is a Lucas film much like Poltergeist is a Spielberg film.

The Sequel That is Better Than the original!,Star Wars: Episode V - The empire strikes back (1980)This movie is a continuation from The first star wars ( by the release date ) and it's safe to say that this sequel is better than the original in many ways1. The story is more clear and you will not feel a ton of confusion as supposed to the first one2. The more good action scenes supported by an improved CGI ( better than the original fighting scenes )3. You get to learn more about the characters (obivously)And there is more stuff that is really good and makes this movie actually great in terms of a visual and storywise movieOverall 8/10 it's a good movie and worth watching if you want to see more from the star wars universe =),8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Greatest Sequel To Grace The Screen,"It has been echoed an infinite amount of times before. It has been chanted from the highest hilltops and the most well known critic sites on the internet. It has been said time and time again. Star Wars Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back is not only the best Star Wars movie, but the best movie sequel ever made, and a prime example of how follow ups can match up and even prevail over their predecessors. While I like the prequels and the film that started it all in 77, The Empire Strikes Back has always been the SW film that glowed the most for me and had the best scenes out of the entire saga. It also introduced my all time favorite Star Wars character and my favorite movie character in general, brought to life by a man who based the character's look and facial expressions off his own. The Empire Strikes Back is the ideal Star Wars film for me, and although it received a mixed reception when it was first released, it has garnished a monstrosity of a following these last couple decades and it shines as one of the greatest sci-fi thrillers with loads of twists and turns to quench your thirst.From the opening battle on the snowy world of Hoth to the final confrontation between Luke and his soon to be revealed father, Darth Vader, this film has a scale, a scope, a powerful, eminent feeling to it. John Williams' exuberant score plays through like an orchestra at an opera and each scene carries suspense and magnitude as you see the events the main characters must live through. As a sequel, it also digs much deeper into the characters' souls and puts them up against powerhouses we never thought they'd go up against, not even in the first movie. Luke Skywalker must train to become a jedi on the swamp planet of Dagobah and at the same time, he must learn what makes the ways of a jedi work. He must be patient and believe in the unbelievable, which is something he fails to do at first (That is why you fail!). He also must learn to avoid the temptations of the dark side and learn what the force is all about. The force is not always about lifting things and tricking people's minds, it's a much bigger entity than Luke could ever imagine, and it's something that touches every life form. In a peanut shell, the force is with everything and allows all creatures to coexist and be bound together as one solid package. This is one of the many lessons Yoda teaches Luke in the second act of the movie.Luke's friends, Han and Leia are also met with extreme challenges in this sci-fi sequel. As they are constantly on the run from the relentless Empire, they must learn ways of hiding and working together for the benefit of surviving the Empire's vicious clawing. Han and Leia must also balance their romantic feelings for one another and learn to get along as well as not let their inner devils get the best of them. But in the realm of seriousness, there is also a bit of comedy and endless excitement. I love Han's relationship with C-3P0 (Never tell me the odds!) and that the Millennium Falcon is always malfunctioning and breaking down. It can't even make the jump to light speed, which it did so frivolously in the first outing. The chase through the asteroid field remains one of my all time favorite scenes out of the saga and John Williams' score for the scene amplifies it's awesomeness.Now let's talk about Yoda, my favorite Star Wars character and movie character of all time. Designed by Stuart Freeborn, Yoda drew inspiration from Albert Einstein, Buddha and even Kermit the Frog, but overall came off as a wise little creature with a brain as big as the galaxy itself. He undeniably has the best dialogue out of the movie and at times, it's hard to believe that Yoda was a puppet and not some real life alien from another world. Luke takes his teachings seriously, but when Vader uses Luke's fears to his advantage (by torturing Han and Leia), he flees in a state of franticness and his inexperience is the main reason why he fails against Vader in the Cloud City ""windy room"". When Darth Vader revealed himself to be Luke's father, many jaws dropped, many undies were pooped, and many gasps were heard throughout the theaters back in 1980. Today, the climatic twist is still as legendary as it was then and it has been lampooned bazillions of times on television shows, parodies and other movies. What makes the scene great is the build up. It's something we weren't expecting and when it came, it smacked us hard in the faces.Of course, there is so much more to talk about, like the Fett man, the awesome Harryhausen style stop motion of the AT-ATS and the tauntauns, the brilliant, exotic looks of the environments and the overall quality of the film, but I've rambled on long enough. The Empire Strikes Back is a mesmerizing experience that still holds up some 33 years later. If you had to watch one Star Wars movie and didn't know which one to watch, why not give this one a viewing. I don't even think you need to see the first film to enjoy this masterpiece, for it's energy and richness makes it stick out like pink hair. It's truly an experience that will leave lifelong lasting memories, so if you need a getaway, take a trip to that galaxy far, far away and let George Lucas' imagination do the talking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One Of The Best Sequels Ever,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a stronger film than ""Star Wars"". The characters are stronger and more established and it is better made.

The best sequel I've seen thus far...,"The Empire Strikes Back has got to be the best sequel film thus far in motion picture history. The main thing that makes it stand out is the fact that it is very dark and different like Citizen Kane. Han & Leia's love/hate relationship is a great detail among the many other great details in the film.We also have that great score that produced the powerful ""Imperial March"" which is one of the most recognizable pieces of music ever composed. Along with that in the score is other great climatic music. Too bad they gave the Oscar to that dude who composed the score for Tess. I wasn't too impressed with that one.Then there are the sound effects. They were a bit ahead for the time and very interesting. Ben Burt is a technical mastermind.Then we also have a great cast. Granted most of the actors/actresses were reprising roles, but they still did well. I for one am a bit disappointed Billy Dee Williams wasn't nominated for an Academy Award for playing Lando, but I also understand not everyone can be nominated.Hopefully Episode II will bring some of the elements from Episode V to make up for Jar-Jar in Episode I.

Great sequel to a great movie.,"The Empire Strikes Back is about the continuing battle between the Rebels and the Empire. All the good guys from the first film return to fight the evil Darth Vader, and this time around, a big secret comes out. This movie probably contains the first great twist in a film.All the aspects from the first movie are carried over well, only the plot is more complicated and darker. Luke continues to struggle with becoming a Jedi, and goes to the great Jedi Master Yoda to help. The special effects have gotten better too, and it raises the action a bit.In my humble opinion, this is the weakest movie of the original trilogy, but just barely. The movie is still loads of fun and tells a great story, and continues to revolutionize the movie industry.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Characters come into their own.  Story develops masterfully.  Action-packed!  Best Sequel? Heck,  best movie?","Han Solo and Luke Skywalker become the most famous space-frontiersmen of all-time.This is the penultimate moment in movie history. The answer to the question: Can a sequel be better than the original? Even Lucas' attempts to ""enhance"" the film over a decade later would be futile. It was like trying to ""enhance"" a classic song. You cannot improve upon it - you can only mess it up.The puppet Yoda would later give way to the CGI Yoda, but Yoda would never be as significant nor as powerful as he was in ""The Empire Strikes Back"".This film is basically three acts. Hoth. The Degoba System(sp?). Cloud City.The movie moves at a breakneck pace, and the film's action sequences have a degree a realism in the model-usage that still seems unrivaled with CGI.The film manages to be funny without being corny, action-packed without being unrealistic, and iconic without being cliché.No film is perfect, but this is very close. It is hard for any avid movie fan to come up with a top ten, but this is unquestionably top 5 for me.I'm 38. Many films had an impact on my life. Blade Runner, Back to the Future, Star Wars, Empire, Platoon, SIxteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Ferris Buellers, E.T., CLose Encounters, Goonies, Raider's, Bond FIlms Etc, etc. This film IS my childhood. If bias means the best film from your childhood - then I'm bias. The Empire Strikes Back could be the best film ever made.You'll Like this if you liked: The Wizard of Oz, Raider's of the Lost Ark, Star Wars, or Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.""Now all I have to do is find this Yoda - if he even exists""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My favourite movie,"I used to think that Return Of The Jedi was the best out of the original 3, and The Empire Strikes Back was the worst, but that was when I was a kid. Since then, I have grown up a bit more now and watched the 3 all over again. I now believe that Empire is clearly the best of the 3. Why is that? Because of the following things. 1. Best Plot out of the three and it shows you that it doesn't all come down to special effects. 2. The movie is very dark, revealing and more importantly it's realistic that the bad guys actually win.Like how many movies out there do u see the bad guys win? The trouble with other movies is they are so predictable in that you know what will happen. In Empire you don't. 3. Best acting by the cast out of the three. 4. The soundtrack, the best music score I have ever heard. It adds a lot to the movie. 5. Irvin Kershner did a fantastic job of directing, I wish George Lucas brought him back for episodes 2 and 3. The scenes with Luke in the cave was Brilliant. The Battle Of Hoth was great, but I really enjoyed the scenes on Dagobah with Yoda and Luke. Yoda telling us about the force and the brilliant ending. This movies is 5/5 stars and my favourite movie off all time In conclusion I wish George Lucas would watch TESB again and realise the prequels should be done the way empire was done. The Phantom Menace was above average but it is nowhere near as good as Empire and the WORST out of the 4.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Everything looks real and most of all Master Yoda, Cloud City do.This movie is not directed by George Lucas but instead by Irvin Keshner.

George Lucas' Best,"In 1980 I was 8 years old... I still have vague memories of standing outside the movie theater waiting to get in to the (then) new film. I was so excited I could hardly stand still. Once inside the theater I saw what was to become my favorite movie in the Star Wars Saga!The plot thickens in this sci-fi saga as we learn more about the young Luke Skywalker and the vile Darth Vader as well a budding romance between Leia Organa and Han Solo. The movie also revels a little more about Han Solo's past with the introduction of new characters Lando Calrissian, Lobot and the Bounty Hunters (in particular Boba Fett). We are also introduced to the wise Jedi master Yoda.I will not say more due to the fact I do not want to spoil the film for any first time viewers.

"Leigh Brackett is what made this movie good, not Lawrence Kasdan.","I think the real reason The Empire Strikes Back is such a good film is because it was written by Leigh Brackett, not Lawrence Kasdan. I believe all the major story ideas and plot points of Empire came from Brackett's draft and were later adapted, by Kasdan, into the final screenplay. Had Brackett survived and continued working on Empire, it probably would have been even better.My first suspicion that Kasdan was a hack writer came many years ago after I, like everyone else, heard he had written Empire. I immediately checked Kasdan's filmography to see if there were any other notable films I had not yet seen. Unfortunately, the only other poignant movie written by Kasdan was Indiana Jones: Raiders Of The Lost Ark (for which George Lucas wrote the story). Kasdan also wrote the screenplay for ROTJ, and I personally think that ROTJ is both a cheap and poorly written film. ROTJ was my first clue that Kasdan may not have been responsible for the success and quality of Empire.Upon further research into the writing of Empire I eventually found Brackett's name buried in an article somewhere: Researching Brackett I noticed she had co-written the screenplay for ""The Big Sleep"" (1946) with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. I remember watching all the major Bogart films in college and now, upon comparison to Empire, I see major similarities - especially in the romance and drama genres. This is also a big clue.Kasdan was able to skate by for many years without writing anything, allowing him to soak up the admiration for Empire without providing any body of work for comparison (besides ROTJ). Now that Kasdan's name has been plastered all over the media for the Disney Star Wars remakes we can now see that Kasdan has no real writing talent.I am happy to say that I know Lawrence Kasdan is not a good writer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A dark and compelling chapter in the saga,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is widely regarded as one of the strongest entries in the ""Star Wars"" franchise, known for its darker tone and deeper exploration of characters and themes. Directed by Irvin Kershner and released in 1980, the film continues the epic saga of the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the tyrannical Galactic Empire.The film follows the journey of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and their allies as they face off against the formidable forces of Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) and the Empire. Along the way, they encounter new allies and enemies, and uncover shocking truths about their own destinies.""The Empire Strikes Back"" is notable for its stunning visual effects, memorable action sequences, and iconic moments, including the revelation of Darth Vader's true identity. However, some viewers may find the film's pacing uneven, and its darker tone may not appeal to all audiences.Overall, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a compelling and essential chapter in the ""Star Wars"" saga, deepening the mythology and raising the stakes for its beloved characters.

Conflict in the Shadow of Darkness,"Conflict is never a one-sided affair, where there is great victory for one side comes great tragedy for another. This film is one of my favorite films of all time, it's my favorite ""Star Wars"" film of all time and my favorite sequel of all time.Indeed, this truly is one of the not just the best sequels that really helped set the standard in how to continue a franchise but also just simply established ""Star Wars"" as a saga in general. Let alone this is probably one of the darkest sequels ever as it's not the most cheerful which to me makes the film and story all the better because as an old saying goes sometimes when things are at their worst, is the time when people are at their best.The action is great, there are lots of memorable action pieces like one of my favorite battles of all time of course is the Battle at Hoth. I really love those Imperial Walkers I thought they were just awesome looking and at the same time really menacing as they look like giant dogs. I really love the model designs and stop motions effects by the late great Phil Tippit.There were also the first mechs I've ever seen, I really like how they move which is tank like which makes sense as they're by their nature giant tanks. Personally, I don't mind in fact sometimes like that kind of movement in mechs the best, as opposed to the flighty movement you would see in anime like ""Gundam"". Let alone the fact that these Walkers don't go down so easily, where in most anime despite how awesome looking the mecha is, they always seem to be built so flimsy as they go down in one hit or two. In a way this battle was sort of like a David vs. Goliath battle as we see the Rebels devise a clever tactic to taking down the Walkers which is cool because it's simple.The space chase with Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C3PO is also awesome as we see they are all just jumping though hoops and going though the motions, doing their best getting steps ahead of the Imperial pursuers. Like going through the asteroid field which really put my on the edge of my seat as we know one wrong move your dead. Along with the cave they were all hiding in which to me is probably one of the biggest close calls ever, literally.Along with the saber action, really liked seeing Luke use the light saber a bit more in the film even the fight with Darth Vader which is one of my favorite one of one battles of all time. Sure, there was the fight between Obi Wan and Vader in the first film, but this fight I thought was a lot better because there was a lot more to the fight. From seeing not just Luke and Vader clash with he sabers but also utilizing and even using what's in their environment as their weapon. I even like in this battle it really feels like it could go either way, despite how skilled Luke is it might not be enough as Vader is more experienced. Or even from how the fight goes there are moments when it seems Luke might be able to turn the tables but there are times when it really looks like fate isn't smiling on Luke.The story and what I love in the sequel is that the character is better than before where their a little more fleshed out, three dimensional and less archetypical which makes us care about them more.From Han and Leia, both are one of my favorite fictional couples of all time. It sort of fit with the 80's decade as there were lots of TV shows based on romantic couples like ""Moonlighting"", ""Macross"", etc. Like with those shows both conflict and romance just go together and make a beautiful combo as both are somewhat the same, what is romance without conflict and love can really hurt and be scary sometimes. But most importantly in both this and those shows we already know these two belong together and are going to come together but it's a question of when.I really love the banter between both, which is funny but also endearing, both are somewhat opposites in many ways from class to just simply disagreement on just about anything to everything. But many both are in conflict because of how both feel for one another which is love. Han is more forward with his feelings despite not outwardly confessing and Leia is constantly in denial or confusion over hers which is why she is unable to admit her feelings to both him and she. As both spend more time together, we see just like any ship going out of light speed their feelings start emerging, which also makes what happens in the end even more tragic.Luke as usual is being Luke though here we see he's became a little more mature as he is now a rebel commander, so he's taken a little more responablity in both his career and life. However, that and time has not quilled a certain fire in his soul that is blazing out of control as Luke has became a lot more impatient and reckless which unfortunately leads to some bad choices that not just Yoda and Obi Wan are in disagreement with but us also. Sure, in some of those choices he had good intentions and in one scene goes out to help, but as two old sayings go, ""good intentions are nothing if there is no follow though"" and ""good deeds don't go unpunished."" Things like that just show Luke still has a ways to go in the way of the Jedi.Darth Vader as usual is himself but we see he's a little more ruthless and even angrier than before which is reflected from his relentless determination throughout the film down to even offing anyone that makes one error too many. But what I like about him in this film is you get a little character out of him. There is an actual sense of emotion in his pursuit for Skywalker. This really deepens the mystery of the character more. Really liked one scene where he is talking with his master ""The Emperor"" whom we see for the first time, where it seems like in the conversation Vader voice sounds like he cares about Luke and what happens to him, but we're not sure why.Of course there is the new edition Yoda whom is voiced brilliantly by Frank Oz best known for his puppetry and vocal work in ""The Muppet Show"" and ""Sesame Street"", really like the look of the alien which is cute looking but also has a respectability about him. Yoda is one of my favorite characters in the franchise, to me he's sort of an alien version of Mr. Myogi. Just like Myogi he has his comical side but when the comedy ends, he really gets down to business. From the tone of his voice you really buy him as a person with a heavy amount of wisdom as well as emotion which makes both Luke and us take him seriously.The other thing is the story which I feel is both a rich sci-fi fantasy adventure but at the same time a rich personal character drama. The plotline we see the good guys are in a very bad place despite scoring a goal, the puck is now in the bad guys court and they are hitting them hard. Really like in this film we see some really dire locations from the Ice Planet Hoth, the swampy dank Dagobah system, and even part of the lower levels of Cloud City it really reflects the state and state of mind the good guys are in, all bad. But I like how despite this the good guys aren't going to sit there and take it; they might go down but their not doing it without a fight.The ensemble throughout the film are all split up, their barely together in the film except in a scene or two. But this actually turns out to be a good thing because it give each of the characters a chance to have their own story all interconnected into one big one; as well as us to become better acquainted with them and understand more of the universe they occupy.I really love some of the philosophy going on in the film which is mainly in the Jedi Training at Dagobah; it's richly thoughtful and one of the first films that actually go me into Philosophy. Really love seeing the Jedi Training going on, which kind of makes the film ""The Karate Kid"" in space. You really see how just like in any walk of life it takes hard work to become a warrior or anything else you want to be in life. Also the philosophy in the film really taught me about what fear really is and where it comes from, but also about the power of faith and what it really means.Then of course there is the big reveal near the end of the film, which was a total shocker at the time, even I was one of the people shocked I remember thinking ""You've got to be fraking kidding me!"". It was something I couldn't see 30 to 40 miles away. And I love that, I felt it was an example of a twist when done the right way, there was never any hints throughout the movie and there were never any in the previous film. This made it even more effective but also all the more dramatic because it actually makes sense.As an old saying goes, ""the battle may be lost, but the war is far from over.""Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best of the Star Wars films!!!,"Empire Strikes back is incredible. Mark Hamill is amazing as Luke Skywalker as he was once again like before. ""I am your father!""

The best sequel ever made!,"That statement alone could stir up controversy, with some saying that that title belongs to THE GODFATHER, PART II or THE DARK KNIGHT. While I agree that those sequels rank the best, I would still have to give the crown to THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. It's marvelous! Energetic, funny, thrilling, dark and complex; it has everything for the audience to enjoy! There is not ONE slow moment; moving at the speed of a particular Corellian freighter through light speed without sacrificing any character development or story progression!

The best movie ever.....PERIOD!!!!!!,"I remember as a 10 year old child seeing this movie when it was first released back in 1980.  I was completely awestruck by the special effects, characters, and the incredible plot-twist at the ending. Now, 20 years later, nothing has changed.  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" still leaves me with a feeling that no movie before or after ever has.  A feeling that I have just seen the absolute pinnacle of cinematic masterpieces.  I have never seen the ""Special Edition"".  I never intend to.  I want to rememberr TESB as it was originally released.  Because, in my opinion, there is no improvement on perfection.The soundtrack of this movie is absolutely the best original soundtrack that I have ever heard. Just a couple of days ago, I purchased it for the 3rd time. I had it on 8 track, vinyl, and now own it on compact disc.  Now I can experience the movie all over again just by listening to the complete score. TESB is the best movie ever made....PERIOD....Slightly better than the original...Much better than ""Return of the Jedi...and MILES above the ""Phantom Menace""...my God, what was Lucas thinking? Let's just hope that Episode II will do TESB justice, and bring a sense of respect back to the Star Wars saga. But one thing is for certain, TESB will forever be the greatest movie ever made....PERIOD!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Holds up better than A New Hope,"POSITIVES:1) Darth Vader is so intimidating and awesome in this film
2) The John Williams score is flawless
3) Star Wars is always at its best in my opinion during its moments of darkness and tension, this film is full of moments like that
3) The lightsaber fight is much better than the one in A New Hope
4) This film introduces Yoda and Lando who are both amazingly iconic charactersNEGATIVES:1) My main negative is that I just HATE the entire Hoth opening. It takes 40 minutes!!! The opening 15 minutes with the Wampa are completely pointless and add nothing to the story. A lot of the dialogue during the 40 minutes on Hoth is incredibly cringey and it also features the infamous brother and sister kissing scene. Cut Hoth out and shorten the film to 90 minutes and it would be a 10/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Best of the Star Wars line.,"Better than Star Wars. Better than Return of the Jedi. And do you know why? Because it spends more time on character development and dramatic buildup than either of its siblings. While The Empire Strikes Back does include its share of space battles and lightsaber duels, the big focus isn't on special effects, but on relationships between characters. The heroes and villains are both developed in interesting ways, plus there's that surprise twist which you probably already know about, but which I won't risk spoiling for you.The Special Edition of this movie is also the best of the three. Except for the dopey, fake-looking Wampa-eats-a-Tantan-like-a-corncob scene, and the bloodcurdling scream that's been dubbed in when Luke throws himself into the bottomless ventilation shaft, most of the added/retouched stuff is pretty good. I was very impressed by what was done with Cloud City, and felt that it added greatly to those scenes. Darth Vader has a somewhat silly-sounding new line, but I liked the way the final chase scene was intercut with him flying back to the Star Destroyer.Definitely not the popcorn-gobbling big-screen videogame that Star Wars and Return of the Jedi are, but certainly superior to both in atmosphere, characterization, and execution.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Greatest Star Wars Best Movie,"This movie is an example of how to not only do a perfect sequel, but a perfect sci-fi movie in general.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Luke Skywalker is trained to be a Jedi Knight and must finally come face-to-face with Darth Vader where he will find out that nothing is as it seems.,"I consider that Empire Strikes Back is the best movie in the Star Wars series (well, at least from the 5 episodes that have been released up to now). It has all the elements of a great movie: great performances (surely better than the previous Episode IV Star Wars), a good story, suspense and more...I believe that SW-Episode IV lacks from the ""Empire"" at the aspect that it barely covers any of the basic story (its my hope that a ""A New Hope"" may look better and feel better when it is linked with Episode III)... Its also the only star wars movie (epis. 5) that I rate with 10(excellent): its unmissable for all movie junkies.The best scenes in the film are of course the ones with Luke Skywalker training with Yoda and of course the (""soap-opera"") ending that no one will forget when Vader reveals the secret to Luke. Its also better than the disappointing last installment in the series (ie SW-EpisodeVI: The Return of the Jedi) which has the same ""kiddie"" feeling with the also disappointing prequels. I hope (and can't wait for it actually) that Episode III (that comes out at May 19) will be better than Ep.1 and 2.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Star Wars movie ever!,"This Star Wars movie was the darkest film with quality characters. In this film you get to know the characters properly.

The best film in the series,"With ""The Empire Strikes Back"" George Lucas & company delivered the next chapter in the hugely popular ""Star Wars"" saga. Picking up where the first film left off, the rebels are on the run from the Empire, who've stepped up their efforts to stamp out the uprising once and for all. Meanwhile, Luke seeks to learn the ways of the Force in preparation for his showdown with Darth Vader.The cast is mostly unchanged from the first film. The most notable new faces are Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and Yoda (voiced by puppeteer Frank Oz). I'd venture to say that the acting is a little better than the first film, though that may be because the characters are a little more refined.The film contains the same sense of excitement as the first but there's also a darker side as Luke discovers the truth about his father's supposed demise. Then, of course, there's the cliff-hanger ending that leaves the viewer itching to move on to the final chapter.The direction, taken over by Irvin Kershner, is (in my opinion) a step up from the first film. No doubt the film's improved look was also bolstered by a more generous budget. The special effects were spectacular once again and landed a special achievement award at Oscar time. Of course, the effects aren't as polished as today's best efforts but they remain impressive.The score by John Williams is excellent; as good as (if not better than) his score for the first film. Also, the sound is top notch once again, resulting in the film's only Oscar win.All in all, the middle film in the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy makes a strong case as the single best film in the series. While I feel that the trilogy works best as a whole since each of the films contain elements that are best appreciated by looking at the big picture, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" contains the best combination of action, humour & drama.By the way, forget about the 1997 'Special Edition' release and go with the original. If I recall correctly, this film didn't have any particularly irritating 'improvements' like the other two films but I may be forgetting something.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Probably the finest of all sequels.,"The Empire Strikes Back is more than just a sequel to one of the most successful movies ever made; it redefined what a sequel could be. You could take a pre-existing story, expand upon it greatly and STILL make it a well-rounded and debatably self-contained movie. Empire reprises the stars of the original Star Wars movie and makes them all shine; Mark Hamill is great as a self-doubting yet well-meaning hero, Harrison Ford again gives a great take on cinema's most loveable scoundrel Han Solo, and the late Carrie Fisher gives Princess Leia a post-Alien sci-fi feminist makeover in that she's no longer anyone's damsel, but her own strong-hearted woman.Need I say more as to why The Empire Strikes Back is considered the best sequel ever made? It's become the go-to film when comparing film sequels in general. Though it's become an overused cliche to compare sequels to Empire, it's true. You can't really argue with the best of the best. A story of heroes on the run and the baddies closing in is still great especially when it's a space-opera that explores aspects on human spirituality.I could go on about why the film's great, why George Lucas made the least changes to this film in The Original Trilogy's Special Editions and why Empire was for a time the most successful independent movie ever made. But why should I? The film speaks for itself. The music, the writing, the direction and the acting all add up to the very best film in the Star Wars saga.This is a sequel that can easily be recognised, appreciated and seen as its own movie. Though it does help watching this back-to-back with the original. It's something few sequels can be: medium-art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is not a film.  This is a fantasy.,"In 1977 when Star Wars came out it was the biggest thing to happen to movies in a very long time.  Star Wars was a science fiction film that focused on escapism rather than scientific lore that usually weighs down other sci-fi films.  Instead of explaining everything through the actors dialogue Lucas just showed us with sophisticated direction, set designs, and special effects.  Still if it was not for Empires Strikes Back the Star Wars saga would not have achieved the level of pop culture status that it now enjoys, for if it was Star Wars that introduced us to the worlds and the main characters of the original trilogy it was Empire Strikes back that gave us the entire theme of Star Wars saga.  It clearly showed us the struggles of the good and power of the evil.  The empire is just not a government body to be despised but to be feared as well.  The Empire is a collected evil who iss everywhere.  The story also reveals much more in terms of who Luke actually is, of his gifts, and how he could be a candidate for either good or evil.  As well it hints at the connection between Luke and Leia and of course reveals the Luke and Vader connection.Plus this film through color and music and the interweaving of character development and action sequences swings us a way from the space opera frivolity of the first film and sends us through a mystical fantasy both dark and beautiful, dangerous and brilliant.Last of all the writing in the film elevated the saga in a way that no other Star Wars film has been able to do.  Leigh Bracket and Lawrence Kasdan worked wonders in their screenplay.  Instead of soaking some serious and more romantic moments with dialogue that is heavy worded we get moments that are mixed with clever one liners and situations that forces Han and Leia to fall in love.  I wish I could say the same about Attack of the Clones love story, which was fine but failed to capture that sort of chemistry.In short this films is a masterpiece and one that has not been matched.  It has not been matched in memorable characters, plot revelations, atmosphere, or music.  Although few films have come very close they all still fall short of this one fantasy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The 2nd best Star Wars movie,"It is a fact that this one is the best. But, I disagree with this fact. I think this is the second best. This is my 4th favorite movie. The only Star Wars movie that is better then this is Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. In my opinion. But this is a great film. I love this film. This is the best sequel of all time. In my opinion. I think it is almost as good. I think that the only reason that you guys think this is the best is because Lucas did not direct. But this one has great dialogue, and some of the acting is better. It introduces a lot more of unforgettable characters like Yoda, and Lando, and the emperor. Yoda rocks. So does the emperor. and Lando. It is the darkest of all 6 films in my opinion and the most mature. So, It is a great movie and the greatest sequel ever. MPAA Rating:PG. My MPAA Rating:PG-13. I think this is even darker the Revenge of the Sith. It has some romance. A great lightsaber fight. and don't forget the infamous line. Darth:No, I am your father.

"Involved, occasionally rousing, but lacking spirit...","The first sequel to 1977's ""Star Wars"" was so hotly anticipated, it sparked the whole trend of film-goers sleeping outside movie theaters in droves, waiting anxiously for the eventual release. Once the picture premiered, it didn't seem to matter to the faithful that it was missing the frisky spirit of ""Star Wars"", as well as a solid finish. Mark Hamill returns as Luke Skywalker, being educated by mystical Yoda and facing off against Darth Vader, who reveals an unanticipated secret. Irvin Kershner's direction is thoughtful--he brings to the action sequences a deep undercurrent of purpose--but he's also mechanical, perhaps spending too much time with Luke (who, due to a car accident suffered in real-life by Hamill, has a perplexed, dour appearance). Harrison Ford provides lots of old-fashioned charm, the special effects and music are wonderful, but the cliffhanger finale wasn't really fair (at the time, it felt like a slap in the face). Producer/creator George Lucas re-released this to theaters in 1997 with three extra minutes and a lofty title change. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Ups The Ante In Every Way Possible,"Following the monumental success of ""Star Wars,"" this opened up the opportunity for George Lucas to release the final two movies in the trilogy he set out to create. That's not saying that ""Empire"" didn't run into its fair share of problems, but regardless, this feels much more polished than ""Star Wars,"" and that is saying a LOT.Now, I certainly think that ""Star Wars"" is one of the greatest motion pictures of all times, a fantastic, A+, perfect film. The sequel, ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" however, is a complete game changer. Everything is bigger and better than ever. The visual effects are superior to the already impressive originals, and the actions sequences are more explosive, but even from a storytelling standpoint, ""Empire"" takes things to a whole new level.The story continues with Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and the rest of the gang at the Rebel base on the ice planet Hoth, but following an attack by an Imperial fleet, the team is split up, with Luke setting out to the Dagobah system to train with the ancient Jedi master Yoda, and the rest of the gang evading capture by the evil Darth Vader, who is back and more villainous than ever. The story this time around is much darker, much more mature, and more fleshed out. It develops the story without being a mere retread of the previous film, and yet, it still maintains that trademark Star Wars feel that made the first one so good. The comic relief is sharper and wittier, the characters are developed in a really natural and fascinating way, and the new characters like Yoda, Boba Fett, and Lando Calrissian also perfectly find their niche in Star Wars lore, fitting in perfectly with the rest.All in all, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" takes everything that made the first film so fantastic, and improves it significantly, and then turns it on its head. If ""Star Wars"" is one of the best sci-fi fantasy films ever made, then ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is THE best sci-fi fantasy film ever made. One of the few perfect films in history. I love this movie, and I can't rave about it enough. It's a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the original,"As we already know, sequels are rubbish. They are nothing more than someone taking the characters from the original and putting them into a new setting that no one really cares about (see Men in Black 2, Neverending Story 2, etc). But every so often a sequel comes along that is just as good, if not better than the original, such as Aliens, Termenator 2, X-men 2 and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. But the Empire Strikes Back is the GREASTEST sequel in film history.Empire may not be as flashy as the original, nor does it have as much action, but it has one thing Lucus has neglected with the prequels: a good, solid story. Empire, like any other great film, has a few flaws, such as dragging on with needless information and too little of Boba Fett, but it makes up for it with fun characters (including news ones like Yoda and Fett), better SFX and that famous revelation of the truth about Darth Vader. Also, despite what some say, there is character development. For example, in the original, Luke Skywalker was an innocent teenager who hungered for action, while in Empire, he is more mature and serious. In the beginning of Empire he is a little like the Luke from the original, half way through he becomes more impatient and at the end he is emotionally confused.The film maybe a bit childish, like so many say (but everyone is entitled to their own opinion), but you must remember that the target audiences for Star Wars, as Lucus said, are children.In closing I'll just say Empire is a great film to watch while you sit down and relax and, like I said for Star Wars, is one you must see at least once.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Quite possibly the best all around film in history,"'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back' is a phenomenal film. Breathtaking, action packed, and heartfelt. It is the best film in the saga, and without a doubt one of the greatest films you'll ever watch.Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is getting more in depth training to be a jedi from the legendary master Yoda (Frank Oz). All the while, it appears that Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) may be in more danger than they know as the power of the Emperor and his apprentice Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) grows.Whether it be Harrison Ford's snide and sarcastic one liners, or the pure lovable charm of Mark Hamill, or the continued legacy of one of film's greatest villains, 'Empire' rules in every aspect of film-making. Kirshner's direction is beyond the time period of 1980. This film looks like it was made in 2000. The effects are brilliant, and the action is seemingly non-stop. Of course, the true allure of these films lies in the story telling, and this film is by far the best of the six in its story. This is the definition of a flawless film. The writing from George Lucas is just great. It keeps a certain air of mystery about Darth Vader that, unless you've been living under a rock for the past 30 years, you know proves crucial to the story, not only in this film, but in all the others except 'A New Hope'. What makes Star Wars so intriguing of how it just meets every moviegoers needs. You will not find someone who has seen this movie and disliked it. It has everything you could ask for in a film: action, romance, suspense, comedy, and the classic story of good vs. evil. 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back' is a classic in every sense of the word. I recommend this film to everyone, regardless of age.10/10 --spy",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
BEST SEQUEL EVER MADE (before The Dark Knight),"After the huge success of ""Star Wars"" both critical and in the box office, giving birth to a new era cinema. George Lucas was already planning its sequel, but decided to divide his work with the director Irvin Kershner and screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, many fans were afraid (even with Lucas writing the story), but this group brought the saga to a all-new and unexplored level.""Empire"" begins shortly after the huge events of its predecessor with the entire rebel army after destroying the "" Death Star"", fleeing through galaxy with the powerful imperial fleet right behind them with ruthless Darth Vader (David Prowse) in command. And with the rebels we see Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) finally realizing his dream of becoming a pilot in the rebel army against the empire, and alongside him his ""inseparable"" friends: the brave and cocky (and Badass) Han Solo (Harrison Ford); the brave and intelligent Leia (Carrie Fisher); the.....Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew); R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). But their lives begin to suffer a great risk when the Empire finds the rebel position in the ice world of Hoth, where a huge battle starts forcing the rebels to retreat. Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C - 3PO manage to escape in the Millennium Falcon, but end up being captured later by Darth Vader thanks to a betrayal of Han's friend, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke and R2 were able to escape as well, but with the voice instruction from Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), Luke is advised to go to the Dagobah system and meet the Jedi master Yoda (Frank Oz) which will help Luke know and control the ""strength"", which later will bring him sinister secrets and the sacrifice for his friends.At the time it came-out, the film was poorly received by critics and fans, but perhaps understandable. No one at the time expected to see a major change in direction that the director and writers, hell, even the Lucas led to film and its history, and today the film is considered not only the best Star Wars ever made, but also one of the best sequel of a saga in the cinema.If Lucas in the 1st film had already revolutionized the modern cinema, so here he and his team raised barriers never explored. While the 1st movie had the great adventure of Luke going to rescue the princess from evil forces in a massive sci-fi style full of humor and thrilling moments. In this one he maintain the great sense of adventure and the humor is not lacking thanks to Han, but here everything is brought to a much more human side thanks to its unforgettable characters. And also thanks to the writers who deliver an amazing and beautiful narrative to the characters since small to big dialogues between the characters showing their human side, and also further exploring the ""Jedi"" topic that it wasn't been well explored in the 1st movie. But also the other side where the film is taken is into a very dark twist that began when dark secrets from the past begin to appear.A flawless script and characters very well evolved, but also at the technical aspects the film rises completely. From the incredible visual effects with a beautiful visual direction from Kershner. And also the new and memorable soundtrack from John Williams ""The Imperial March"", you know, that dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan, dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan (I know, it's strange to describe a song writing and not listening, well anyway)?! Not only the best ""Star Wars"" or the best sequel ever made, but also one of the best movies ever made will be marked forever in the history of cinema. All thanks to a flawless script, beautiful direction, strong performances (especially Mark Hamill with an incredible evolution of acting) and the biggest twist that cinema ever had makes ""Empire Strikes Back"" an eternal masterpiece!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

My favorite Star Wars movie of all time,"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is a sequel based on Star Wars: The New Hope and many people say that this film is known to be one of the best Star Wars sequel and one of the best of the Star Wars Trilogy.The plot tells that Rebels are hiding from the Empires and once again their leader is Darth Vader, meanwhile Obi-Wan tells Luke to find a Jedi Master named Yoda and he will teach Luke how to become strong with force. When the Empires finds the Rebels, they attack the base and Luke is now separate from Han & Leia as they both hide and run from the Empire.As I mention, many people calls this movie one of best Star Wars sequels and one of the best Star Wars trilogy of all time and understandable why it is. A side from have great effects, music score, and the greatest plot twist that no one saw it coming; it has good drama that is portraying well to our characters, a romance connection between Han & Leia, Luke trying to understand how the force works which does help built more to understand of how it works to those who are become a Jedi, and as for Darth Vader was started as a cool bad guy, it's this movie that turns him into one of the greatest villains of all time. He can be both patient & intelligent and both powerful & merciless killer and it fits perfectly on why we should both love & be afraid of this character all in once.Overall: It's a well done sequel, that is well pacing and focus and that's why this movie is my all time favorite Star Wars film",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A continuation that doesn't have a right to be this good,"""Empire had the better ending; Luke gets his hand cut off, finds out Vader's his father, Han gets frozen, and taken away by Bobba Fett, it ends on such a downnote. That's what life is, a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets."" - Dante Hicks, Clerks.One of my other justifications for remaining ignorant to the Star Wars franchise was the fact that I felt I had already seen them before. After hearing the above lines in Kevin Smith's Clerks, I had no ambition to seek out the series because of the fact that I already knew all, or most, of the major, visceral plot points in the second installment, The Empire Strikes Back. But even knowing these details going in, I still emerged as enthralled and as taken as ever. It's one of the most awe-inspiring, gripping sequels I've ever seen.My love for the series of Star Wars, so far, has likely been because I don't try to understand it all. I allow myself to sink into the films, letting the film's imagination, and my own, take me on a cinematic Odyssey. The less I look into the meaning of it all and the interworkings of the characters and series, the more, I feel, I see in terms of vision, writing, atmosphere, and style. Thank goodness I took this approach to The Empire Strikes Back, which employs all these elements with slick, constant entertainment. It abandons the cheery, free-spirited style of its predecessor in favor of a much dark enigma. Never before have I seen a film go from comforting entertainment to sheer calamity within one sequel.Perhaps much of this is thanks to Irvin Kershner, who takes over for Lucas in the directing department. After achieving monstrous success with the original Star Wars, against all conceivable odds, Lucas, who was perplexed at how to follow up the hit, sidelined himself to executive producer and hired Kershner to lend his vision with the screen. New writers by the names of Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan were hired to continue the harrowing tales of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). I couldn't imagine the hesitation amongst fans when these creative decisions were made. They must've expected the absolute worst from a sequel to an explosive hit. Could it be like the extreme hesitation the Star Wars fanbase currently has now with J.J Abrams manning the camera and Michael Ardnt writing the script for the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII in 2015, or should I not even mention that? The wonderful thing about these new faces being the driving forces behind this film is that we get a different spin on these characters and their lives that isn't drab, redundant, or contrived. Had The Empire Strikes Back adopted the same sort of easy-going charisma of its predecessor, this could've easily been a cheap rehash of previously successful material. Instead, Kerschner, Brackett, and Kasdan wisely choose to further develop these characters, making their problems more three-dimensional, their personalities more vivid, and their biographies more interesting.Again, there are some terrific and grandiose special effects put to use here. The effects on the Millennium Falcon and the exterior shots of a galaxy far, far away is just marvelous and very appealing on the eyes. I'm always amazed at the naturalism of these effects, even for the late seventies/early eighties. Despite being largely products of computers and other visual mediums, they still possess an authentic and wonderfully realistic look to them.One particular instance is when Han, Leia, and the rest of the gang fly their ship into the asteroid farm, which is exactly what it sounds like. Dozens of asteroids hurl themselves at the ship at breakneck speeds, leaving Han (the driver) with little time to react and dodge them. The animation and visual technique of the asteroids is astonishing, and every moving object adopts gorgeous fluency and technical precision. It's a visual wonder to say the very least.The Empire Strikes Back beautifully carries the Star Wars franchise further than it might've even gone under the intense and uncompromising care of Lucas himself. The new faces delightfully provide us with more entertaining adventures and more eccentric characters such as Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), consistently keeping us in-tuned and intrigued with the limitless possibilities of this creative world. Like before, Hamill, Fisher, and Ford provide the most likable of chemistry, and the scenes of intensity and peril do not fall short of enthralling, even if one is aware of the outcome. There are many directions Return of the Jedi can take, but if it shows the gripping intensity of its predecessor and the truly mysterious nature of its original, then the possibilities are as endless as the galaxy the series inhabits.Starring: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, James Earl Jones, Frank Oz (voice), and Billy Dee Williams.

"Excellent movie, and the best of the Star Wars series.","Good Points:  Everything that made the first Star Wars movie great is in abundance in Empire Strikes Back.  The mood is darker than the first film and not quite so fairy-tale-ish, and it's nice to see the good guys get their butts kicked for a change.  Also, here the characters develop further than in the first film which shows that Lucas was pacing things nicely for what was to become a trilogy.  And who could ignore the special effects? Those wizards of eye candy, Industrial Light and Magic, which formed out of the first movie, deliver some incredible visuals that are still fun to watch even today.Bad Points:  Very little to complain about here.  Honestly, I can't think of a single thing I didn't like about the movie.Bottom Line:  A great sci-fi classic just like the first one.  If you liked A New Hope, you'll love Empire.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A kids' movie! Whatever.,"Well from the 1977 one, which ofcourse I loved a lot and was trying to convince myself it to be a grownups' movie. But with this one, that came crashing down. It is a kids' movie. But that doesn't matter. I still like that. May be being a kid aswell sometimes is good. I wonder about the chidhood of those baby boomers. It must have been terrific. Nowadays kids' movies are nowhere close to this one. And if it is liked by kids and adults alike, then it is one serious contender.They could have been more serious about those light saber duel. Could have been made more realistic, after all that's the signature weapon of the whole franchise. Same goes for Yoda as well.Apart from that everything was amazing.

The Best of the Star Wars series,"Say what you like about A New Hope, Return of the Jedi, or The Phantom Menace.  For sheer emotional power, this one has got them all blown out of the water.The first time I saw any of the Star Wars movies was when I was laid up at home after having my wisdom teeth removed the summer before my senior year in high school.  The movies just blew me away, but not having time to get overly attached to any of them, I decided that the Empire Strikes Back was the best, for many reasons.  We get more plot in this movie than in any of the other three.  There isn't necessarily as much action as the more exciting Return of the Jedi, nor is it all as new and visually exciting as A New Hope, but the story is more important here than all that extra stuff.When the original Star Wars came out, people were so blown away by the special effects that no one really noticed what a bad movie it was.  Not that it was a terrible movie, but the dialogue was terrible, the acting was atrocious, and the direction was, well, choppy.  It was a great movie, but very badly made.  Does this ring a bell?  Sounds almost exactly like what we have been hearing about the Phantom Menace, doesn't it?Return of the Jedi was a much better movie than A New Hope.  All the actors had gotten a little better.  It was a very different cast than in the original.  The action was more intense, the story was wrapping up, and we got one final titanic battle with the Empire.  Special effects technology had gotten better as well.  The biggest problem with the movie was how long-winded it was.  How many ways can the emperor phrase the same statement?  You'll have to watch it to find out.Which brings me to The Empire Strikes Back.  The action wasn't as intense, the acting wasn't a whole lot better, and loyal Star Wars fans got ticked off at how cute Yoda was.  There's really no pleasing some people, you know? They reacted the exact same way with the Ewoks and Jar Jar Binks.  Amazing. Anyway, with all these problems, why go see the movie?  The answer: here is where the plot thickens.  Just when it seemed that the Rebellion had gotten the Empire on the run, the Empire comes back and just about crushes their best hopes.  We get the shocking truth about Darth Vader's identity (well, it was shocking when the movie came out...I don't think anyone who has even heard of Star Wars doesn't know it by now).  We get crucial hints to the relationship between Luke and Leia.  You get murder, betrayal, and a truly terrifying encounter in the swamps of Dagobah (hint: not Yoda).  There is so much more to this movie than to any of the others.  That's the reason I consider it to be the best so far.  I'm ready for Episode II.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Movie in Series,This has to be my favorite movie off them all.The best of both trilogies.The story goes deeper. The characters are more nuanced.There's more on the line.

The Famous second.,"Well, so many things had been written through the years about this. Gonna keep it moderate.Yes, the Star Wars Saga matured A LOT with this movie. They tossed away most of the naivety and let the grown up people be just that. Grown Ups.Farm boy Skywalker comes of age, starting to be aware of his legacy. Two other fellas has to admit they're in love. The androids and robots keeps entertain. The dark lord shows some of his single pennies of humanity. Environments developed to great treat for the audience. (For example the impressive Cloud City takes; still watchable 36 years later.)I still like the first three (quite oldish) movies in the series much better than the following. In my opinion, SW founder G. Lucas waited way too long with the sequels. He once said - I've read - that he waited for screen special effects to be developed for translating his visions just right.(Personally I think that's bulls**t; he simply wasn't all clear of what way to turn in the story, even if he supposedly had some ""present"" and ""future"" ideas.) If the ""Episode I"" had been written and filmed in, let's say, around 1988-89, with the crew still kind of fresh from ""....Jedi"", we would have been presented a whole different movie, not having that heavy political theme of the -'99 flick, I think. (The story of senator/future emperor Palpatine - Ian McDiarmid - is a rip-off from history anyway....slowly building up his ascendancy like the way a well known German did in the 1930's.)And the SW fans of the 70's and 80's (like me) would have felt a more close connection to the originals, rather than having the jump of 16 years.Anyone agree?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

40th Anniversary,"This film made such an impression on a ten year old boy that I, watching it forty years later for just the second time, still know the details of the story, characters and scenes by heart.Rebels hiding on an icy planet are discovered and overrun by Darth Vader, storm troopers and sophisticated machinery. The prize that eludes their grasp is not so much the rebel forces but a young man, Luke Skywalker, who has the potential to become a great leader, visionary and warrior; a jedi knight. While Skywalker trains to be a jedi his friends are captured and used as bait to lure him into a trap where he will be forced to choose whether he wants to join Vader's forces or die.The secret sauce of The Empire Strikes Back and what makes it infinitely better than Star Trek, is the jedi knight philosophy expressed by its master practitioner Yoda. It simply radiates wisdom and truth and resonates in our hearts. ""Do or do not,"" Yoda says ""there is no try."" He warns against anger, fear and aggression which flow easy and are seductive. It is much better to ally yourself with the ""force"" and the life energy that surrounds and binds us. The romance between the characters of Han Solo and Princess Leia, and the acting of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher that bring it to life, also makes a sad sack of the Star Trek franchise. Unfortunately, the romance is unbalanced and macho oriented, as well as PG rated. Still, it is more romance than a hundred Star Trek episodes put together. Mark Hamill is a bad actor who, deservedly, drifts into the shadows and has no more successful roles to play.While the Empire Strikes Back is a wonderful film, it does not occupy the exalted place in my mind and heart as it did 40 years ago. It is the difference too, between boy and man. These days I desire more depth in beauty and wisdom, in writing and cinematography, than this somewhat simple film achieves.

Now this is what Star Wars is all about,"All the Star Wars films are very good, but Empire Strikes Back is the best of the series.  The story line is more convoluted than the rather straight froward A New Hope and Return Of The Jedi.  Though it lacks the special effects of the more recent trilogy, ESB has better interaction between the characters.The growing romance between Han and Leia is paced just right.  The rise of Luke to power under the guidance of Yoda shows the tension and respect that often exist between experts and trainees.  The comedy act of R2D2 and C3PO is classic.These actors, often criticized in the other films, do very well in ESB. Ford and Fisher give their best performances in the whole trilogy in this episode (Hamill was more consistent through the series).10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Can it get any better?,"The Empire Strikes Back, from this point on to be referred to as Empire, is truly the greatest film I have ever seen.  Why?  I could give many reasons, most of which would have been said before.  However, this film really does have a completely different feel to it compared to Episodes IV and VI. People say it's dark, and it is, but there is a lot more to it.  There is this transitional feel about the characters and the movie, something which shows how our intrepid heroes are being forced into darkness.  Luke Skywalker, is learning about his past and the powers that he has inherited from his estranged father.  This also introduces Yoda into the saga.  Han Solo and Leia are falling in love, this changes Solo's character from the out and out space cowboy, so to speak, that we know from Episode IV.  He has mellowed and found different priorities in his life.  This is definitely the middle ground for the development of this character.  I never liked what he became in Episode VI, his role in the movie was poor and he had changed a lot from the loveable ""rogue"" that we saw in Episode IV.  Leia's character had changed from a slightly stuck up ""princess"" in Episode IV to a more ""lets get down to it"" action character who was not afraid to get stuck in, fix equipment and shoot a blaster.  Then we have all the obvious plot developments.  Seriously, a great film.  For me Harrison Ford, aka Han Solo, is the star of the film.  His character was a whiny, annoying kid (like we see from his father in Episodes I and II) in Episode IV but in Empire we see the beginnings of the man he becomes.  There is so much about this film, and the characters, that make it No #1!  Add all this in and is it any surprise that this is the film where George Lucas didn't write any of the script, or direct it?  His only contribution was to write the story.  A lot of people would see this and hope that Lucas doesn't direct or write the script for the highly anticipated Episode III.  Unfortunately, I'm one of them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Those were the days,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is widely considered one of the greatest sequels and science fiction films ever made. It continues the epic saga of the Star Wars universe, delving deeper into the conflict between the Rebel Alliance and the evil Galactic Empire.The film picks up after the events of ""A New Hope,"" with the Rebel Alliance on the run from the Empire. The characters we grew to love in the first film, including Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, and Darth Vader, are further developed and face new challenges. The plot takes unexpected turns and revelations, keeping the audience engaged and invested in the story.What sets ""The Empire Strikes Back"" apart is its darker and more mature tone. The characters face personal and emotional struggles, and the film explores themes of identity, betrayal, and the struggle between good and evil. The reveal of Darth Vader's true relationship to Luke Skywalker remains one of the most iconic moments in cinematic history.The visual effects, considering the time of its release, are groundbreaking. The icy landscapes of Hoth, the swampy planet Dagobah, and the vibrant Cloud City are all brought to life with impressive practical and visual effects. The lightsaber duels are intense and memorable, showcasing the growth of the characters' abilities.The performances from the cast are exceptional. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker goes through a significant character arc, while Harrison Ford's Han Solo brings his signature charisma and wit. Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia is portrayed with strength and determination. The introduction of new characters, such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian, adds depth to the story.John Williams' musical score continues to be a highlight, enhancing the emotional impact of each scene and contributing to the film's timeless appeal.While ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is often praised, some might argue that its pacing feels slower in certain parts compared to the action-packed first film. However, this allows for more character development and a deeper exploration of the Star Wars universe.In conclusion, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a masterpiece of science fiction cinema. It successfully builds upon the foundation laid by ""A New Hope"" and elevates the Star Wars saga with its complex characters, emotional depth, and memorable moments. Even after more than four decades, it remains a beloved and influential film that has left an indelible mark on popular culture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke is one of my personal favorite action sequences in the Star Wars universe.

You can see it here,"that Lucas was starting to lose his touch.The truth is that he should have stoped with A New Hope. A New Hope was awesome, great from beginning to end, perfect. This film is not very good, it's very boring and has a rather weak plot, which leads to ROTJ and TPM having weak plots and bad stories.I think that this movie shows what happens when sequels go bad.

"""No. Try not. Do...or do not. There is no try.""","Three years after George Lucas changed cinema with his 1977 mega hit STAR WARS its first sequel came out. To me this is the best of the whole series of films so far containing both secrets and the introduction of a few great characters to be added to the list of STAR WARS cast. To me as well this film sits only behind Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY in space stories put on screen.Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice of James Earl Jones) is on the hunt for the Rebels. It looks like he has found them, so the Rebels are on the run to escape his clutches. Han Solo (wonderfully played by Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) bring along Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) within the Millennium Falcon (which gets a lot of screen time in this film). Meanwhile Luke (Mark Hamill) is of the Dagobah system in search of Yoda (voice of Frank Oz) to continue his Jedi training.This film is different than the original and really is much darker as the title of the film suggests. John Williams is back and with new themes like the amazing 'Imperial March' he has an even richer score than the original. I do believe Lucas did the right thing in bringing in two excellent screenwriters in Leigh Brackett and later Lawrence Kasdan. I have no idea who came up with what idea, but I am glad Lucas got some fresh perspectives and perhaps ideas to infuse into his space epic. As well as having veteran director Irvin Kershner direct the sequel. This film has everything a STAR WARS fan loves.Also starring Billy Dee Williams who is pretty cool as Lando Calrissian...until Chewie gets ahold of him and look fast for John Ratzenberger who plays Major Derlin.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Sci-Fi at its Very Finest,"Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's an impressive sequel that manages to surpass the expectations of its predecessor, this is the standards that every film maker should aim towards when considering a sequel, the first one is fun and introduces the characters in a light hearted manner, but this one further develops them and their universe in a much darker tone. It's definitely the bleakest film in the series, showing the main characters succeed the least, and even the ending isn't particularly joyous, let's just say the title suits the overall tone of the movie perfectly. The cast are still in great form here, in fact several of them have improved between the three year gap of the first movie, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher have certainly improved as actors and, overall, they seem much more comfortable in their roles. We are also introduced to some great new characters in this film, such as Lando and Boba Fett, but the one who stands out the most for me is Yoda, one of my favourite characters of the franchise, Frank Oz perfectly portrays the wise and woeful personality of this master Jedi. There are so many noteworthy moments here, whether it be the wise words from Yoda, the battle between Vader and Luke or Han's farewell to Leia, every scene makes me smile, it's a piece of film history that will be remembered for years to come. Terrific performances, a thrilling storyline and special effects that still hold up today, fans of Star Wars and sci-fi in general will not be disappointed by Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back, I would recommend it to all moviegoers.Luke must complete his Jedi training with Master Yoda while the Empire has returned after the destruction of the Death Star, with Vader's only intention now being to find Luke.Best Performance: Harrison Ford",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fall of the galactic empire,"Well, many people tend to praise this sixth installment of the archifamous franchise, although analyzing it coldly, it is the weakest of the first three.I have always liked Star Wars movies, I have never been a freaky, but as a kid, as almost everyone liked to have the dolls of the movies, posters and all that paraphernalia so well mounted by Lucas, a very intelligent uncle without a doubt in When it comes to making money.In this third installment that concerns us, we have a spectacular start, very well done and exciting. The arrival of both the androids, as Luke himself to Jabba the Hutt's lair, to rescue a captured Leia in her attempt to rescue her beloved Han Solo herself, and who has been turned into a sexy slave with one of the most erotic outfits that have been seen in the history of cinema.All that first initial part, until the destruction of Jabba's ship in the well of the almighty Sarlacc, is masterful, hilarious and unforgettable.So, what prevents me from giving this delivery a higher grade? Very simple, the second half of the film with the arrival of the protagonists in Endor, hits a tremendous downturn that perhaps many do not know or do not want to perceive. Simply the whole teddy bear roll is completely left over because it is too childish and even boring. Until that time Star Wars had been a saga for an adolescent-adult audience, but the inclusion of these ewoks already downgraded it to a movie for kids, which did not have to be, but of course, greater public higher income, Lucas is Very very smart, I've always said it.The development, well, we are told about the final echos that lead to the destruction of the second death star, by Darth Vader, ultimately redeeming himself, the death of Palpatine and the end of the Imperial dictatorship, making the republic and the Restoration of the Jedi as guardians of peace in the galaxy. All this in a spectacular and very emotional climax, with melodies by John Williams during the Luke-Vader clash that freeze the blood, phenomenal and very dark.I, like many others, prefer the original 1983 version, in which Sebastian Shaw appeared at the end as Anakin Skywalker, and not Hayden Cristiansen's mammon, which does not stick with a deadly tail in that scene, since on top The effect is fatal and very forced. I also don't like modern fx additives in some sequences simply because they don't connect well with the visual aspect of the set. But this is just my opinion.It is a great sequel and conclusion of the first trilogy, but due to erroneous decisions that I have commented, some teddy bears making antics and certain highs and lows of rhythm and a not very bright direction of Richard Marquand, tied hand and foot as said by Lucas , which controlled even the smallest aspect of its ""toy"", as Spielberg once defined it, makes it not so satisfactory and round, since it does not have the opera tone of the first two wonderful parts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A great Star Wars film but a misunderstood legacy and impact,"The film is really good but i have some mixed feelings though. The fights are based part of this film, but the worst part is the romance like agh George why can't you make a good romance? I know this has a great reputation in the Star Wars franchise I could say the same for me but, the pacing and it tries to be too big of worldbuilding. I
would rank this a 7 but it's still a god movie.P.s: I need one more thing to this which is about the films legacy and impact and how it affects the film. First this film mostly what expect but like there's twists in here that are amazing tho some are just there. Secondly darth Vader which ties into something that's about impact and legacy which is that people have made darth Vader as a myth I don't see Vader as a myth more of a character inside a myth. Here's why, because if you just think of him as some unstoppable machine (yes he's a unstoppable killer which I can note) he's a human character who has heart but many people put these pedestal for these characters way to high and that's why some hate Rey because of the fact she is already a myth to begin with.

A Significant Improvement!,"The Empire Strikes Back was a lot better than the original film to which it was a sequel in a great many ways.1) It focused a lot more on the deuteragonist Han Solo than the first movie did
2) It developed the relationship between Han and Leia (even if it still tried to force Luke into a love triangle with them, which doesn't work for these characters.)
3)It introduced Yoda who was an engaging character and an entertaining trickster mentor
4) It built upon the menace of the villainous Darth Vader
5) While the first movie had the followers of the Evil Empire call themselves followers of The Dark Side and this movie keeps that, this film does a much better job with it, turning the Dark Side into a metaphor for how corruptible even our heroes are
6) This movie introduced the Emperor
7) I know that it's one of the most well-known twists in cinematic history and as such most of us (myself included) knew what the twist was before watching it but I think the plot twist at the end was quite well done
The Flaws
1) The forced love triangle of Luke, Leia and Han
2) C-3PO is as annoying as he was in the first movie (if not more so.)I can live with this movie's conclusion being used as a set-up for the next movie because at the time franchise films were so rare that certain problems are inevitable and shouldn't be held against them.All in all, it's a decent film.

My favorite Star Wars episode,"This is my favorite Star Wars episode.  This is like the most important episode in the trilogy because this is when Luke Skywalker begins to train in becoming a jedi.  Also because it first introduces Yoda and he tells you about the force.  What it is, and how to use it.  Without this episode, a lot of people will be lost.  They would be like, ""What's going to happen if Luke get's mad?""  Obi-Wan tells him to never use/get hatred because that leads to the dark side.Also, this movie tells us a lot about Han Solo and Princess Leia, where they actually express their love towards each other.  Other than that, it tells you about Han's deal with Jaba, how he has to pay him or else.....  In Star Wars: A New Hope, it tells you this, but not as much in this movie.  So my review of this movie is that I think its the best Star Wars episode.  I give it 4.5/5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of them All,"This is my first comment on IMDb, and I'm from Iceland so try to bere with my English. The Empire Strikes Back is on of a kind. It surpasses the original Star Wars in many ways. The visual effects are much improved, the asteroid chase and the Cloud City for example. John Williams' score is better, not by a long shot, but, better. 'Imperial March' is one of the best movie themes I've ever heard. The Sets are bigger and much more exotic. All the actors are doing pretty good job. Irvin Kershner is doing a good job, but I was disappointed that Lucas didn't direct. One of the reasons I liked this movie better than the original is because, that now, we get to know the characters feelings and thoughts. In the original we only got the know the characters. The Love between Han and Leia, The wisdom of Yoda and of course the father relationshp between Darth Vader and Luke.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great,"This is a Hollywood sci-fi film that really shines. Multi-line narration, special effects blasting, character contradiction shaping, father and son fighting, love, inspirational and so on are not the original film, the film is more to learn from the wisdom of the film workers in a film, make the film wonderful and good-looking, and even affect the development of the film is the most desirable place. As a transitional work, the film has the advantage of an open ending, which arouses the appetite of the third sequel. A few details are handled although rough, but also do not affect greatly hinder.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best of the trilogy,"I like this one because it has the best plot of the three. I specially like that since its the second of a trilogy it has a dark ending. This movie develops the relationships between the characters very well. And like all SW movies it has great Special Effects, that is amazing after almost 2 decades. The introduction of well known characters (Bobba Fett and Yoda) and many other things that are already mentioned in many comments make this one a must-see for anyone who hasn't seen it",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My favorite movie of all time!,The empire strikes back took everything from it's predecessor and made it even better. This movie has the characters from the last movie and vastly improved them while introducing new characters. The empire strikes back has a lot more iconic momments and an iconic twist. And the empire strikes back is hands down My favorite Star Wars movie and my favorite movie of all time!,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pure entertainment,"To be honest I've only seen this one and Episode IV: A New Hope so I can't tell if this is the best of all the SW Series. What I can say is that it's definitely more entertaining than the first one. I think it has everything to do it a nice movie. It's funny at times(I don't know what's your opinion but for me Chewbacca is just incredibly funny, his ""aaaaaugh"" language makes me laugh all the time), it has a sort of romance thing in there, characters are more mature and more defined. Harrison gives a very nice performance. Yoda is as funny as Chewbacca but he's serious and respectful as well. Darth Vader's revelation comes at a good moment, specially because the movie leaves us wanting to know more. What will happen with Han Solo, what made Vader choose the dark side of the force?I don't know how I have been alive for 22 years and never saw Star Wars before. I remember going to the Universal Studios or some theme park like that and seeing the small figurines of the characters of the series and never being really interested. More recently I lived in London and never visited the Star Wars exhibition next to the London Eye. Things which I regret now that I definitely enjoy the story.I hope the next one satisfies my expectations, as far as Episode V concerns, it's a masterpiece (just as it is).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Star Wars film made,"Although it is argued that 'A New Hope' was more original and revolutionary (Which it is), I believe that 'Empire' is a better film. While the first film touches on Luke's destiny, in 'Empire' Luke begins to see the potential of his power, and also sees the temptation of the dark side. Where this film succeeds where the others fail is in the psychology of the film. Luke realises that his own worst enemy is himself, not Vader. Vader too is given far more scope in this film. We see his full range of his powers, his relationships with Imperial Officers, and more importantly with the Emperor. The climax of the film (Which I won't give away, just in case you've been living under a rock since 1980), ties up a lot of loose ends and intertwining stories from the film. Ultimately it sets up a great start for the final part of the trilogy (Unfortunatley it wasn't lived up to). A very solid 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Movie Ever!!!!,"As if being a part of the most successful series ever, Empire stands as the best movie ever.  Though it could not exist without its counterparts, its plot complexities, character development and superlative story telling allow it to reign superior.  Even though it was the least successful of the the trilogy, most critics agree it is the best of the series.  It accepts its role as a single part of a series and takes the most signficant strides to give the Star Wars saga meaning.And who can forget 'No, I am your father.'",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Story continues with more action and adventure - and romance.,"Having destroyed the Death Star, the Rebels are now being pursued by the evil Imperial troops. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) now leads a group of freedom fighters and they are based on a frozen planet called Hoth. Darth Vader is still obsessed with finding Luke, and sends probes looking for them.When Luke and his group is discovered by the probes, action and adventure ensues as they attempt to escape Darth Vader, who launches a full attack on them. Meantime, Luke is on a mission of his own to find the Jedi master, Yoda - as instructed by the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Yoda is a small, ugly looking green creature with big ears - a fantastically designed character who in time would become one of Star Wars' most memorable characters, and film character in general.We learn Luke's father was Anakin Skywalker, who was a great Jedi. Yoda teaches Luke to become a Jedi, and Luke gains powers in the process. There's more humour here than in 'Star Wars' and there's also a romance developing between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher).The film once again boasts fantastic visuals, production design, and props. During the course of the movie our heroes must overcome many obstacles, and there's plenty of action to keep the viewer entertained. There's also a big reveal at the end regarding Darth Vader.Although this is an incredible movie in its own right, I still enjoyed 'Star Wars' more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent,"Excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky's photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Quintessential Sci-Fi Masterpiece,"In 2002, science fiction can only be described as laden with special effects. Quality stories are few and far between, with a return to the fantasy genre as a last refuge for the scoundrel. The two Star Wars prequels further illustrate this weakness in science fiction. In other words, we are always making comparisons to THIS film, the grandmaster of all modern science fiction films, ""The Empire Strikes Back"".ESB stands on its own merits for so many reasons that I can only hope to give a partial list. Having gotten out of the way the troublesome task of introducing us to the Star Wars universe in the 1977 adventure, we can now jump into the frantic struggle of the Rebellion. Anything introduced in ""Star Wars"" is simply improved upon in ESB, not overproduced and overrefined. The look of ESB is real, gritty, elegant, and sometimes even glowing (as in the Cloud City). The elements of creating mood and atmosphere are so perfect that it is no wonder they are copied in so many other films, often to poor effect. The music alone goes from brooding to anxious to frantic to mysterious to exotic with such balance that it defines perfection for future SW film scores.The acting is real and hard and makes no apologies. It is neither over-the-top nor sleepwalked through, and each character is at his/her highest note. Yes, the technobabble in some points sounds stupid at times, but it's overpowered by the myriad other positive elements in the storytelling. ESB is the last movie made before the Indiana Jones films forever influenced adventure movies with the relentlessly overlapping and often ridiculous action that hurt ""Return of the Jedi"" in 1983. (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" would hammer home the formula of serials to the extent that RotJ would be fraught with juvenile moments and caricaturizations of beloved characters, but that's another story.)Yoda was, at the time of ESB's release, a technological miracle of storytelling. Here was a muppet that audiences just *knew* was real, somewhere in the Universe. His wisdom reached deep into the human soul, sounding ominous, real, and masterful. The power of the character of Yoda is seen in how many adults as well as teenagers and kids in 1980 accepted him as real and respectable.What more could be said about ""The Empire Strikes Back""? It's the masterpiece all others strive to become similar to and never achieve. It ends on a cliffhanger and yet is a self-contained story. It's a classic even if it is seen before it has had the benefit of ILM's special edition rework. It is, in short, perfect storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better Than Episode IV!,"This movie is a little better than Episode 4 but sill it's just an ordinary science fiction film. It wasn't until Return of the Jedi when some really good science fiction kicks in. There were many good moments in this film with Han Solo and the return of my favorite character, Yoda.This is about how the Empire scattered the rebels and how Vader is obsessed over Luke Skywalker.The acting is pretty good. Harrison Ford made Han Solo a great character. He added humor to this guy.The lightsaber duel between Anakin and Luke is a good one. Also one of the most famous movie quote comes from that scene.The music by Williams once again a beauty. The recently deceased Irvin Kershner directed a pretty good movie. The special effects are somewhat better than the first. I rate this film 8/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Is it in your destiny to watch this film?,"Once again, George Lucas takes us to a long time ago in a land far, far away.  This film is a follow up to one of the biggest grossing movies of all time.  To tell you the truth, this movie was not that great.  The characters were further defined, but this film did leave enough out there to tell even the most novice of movie watchers that there was one more film to come (even if Lucas didn't tell us beforehand).I did like that touch of humanity to the film.  Bad guys DO win (once in a while), there are flaws to people that others WILL take advantage of, and we don't ALWAYS win the good fight!The second part of the trilogy gives an insight into ""The Force.""  It, sometimes, reminds me of a hokey martial arts film.  But the depth of the characters in this film became a part of history in the first one, making box office history as the number one grossing film that took almost twenty years to break.  But this film did fall a little short in my book because I did not find some of the elements of the film believable.  It was still a good film, but I still liked the first one better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best of the entire series,"I remember seeing this classic movie as a kid.  I loved it then, and now that I am grown up and know a bit more about movies (and have seen many more of them), I love this movie even more.Where Star Wars: A New Hope was a movie that introduced the main characters of the first trilogy, Empire is the movie that really gets into the meat of the story.  Luke trains with Yoda to become a Jedi, the others (Han, Leia and C3PO) are chased by the evil empire, and of course Luke finds out that Darth Vader (the BEST villan in the history of the movies) is his father.This is also the movie where George Lucas was free to do just about anything he wanted with his special effects.  And, it REALLY shows in this movie. The scenes on Hoth with the Imperial Walkers are very cool even by today's standards.  The asteroids and space battles are much better than in A New Hope, much more refined.  Just about everything in this movie effects wise is an improvement on A New Hope.I love all three of the first trilogy.  I even like episodes 1 and 2 (although they both pale in comparison).  However, this is by far the best of EITHER of the series.  Let's just hope that episode 3 lives up to the greatness of this great movie series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Still holds up,"Just saw the special edition of this movie again last night after a few years, and I'm still amazed by it.  Easily the darkest and most dramatic of the star wars films (and the best), highlights include the opening hoth battle, the asteroid belt chase and the final lightsaber dual between Luke and Vader.  The special edition actually adds to cloud city, making it seem much larger and open and enhances its feeling.   The added wompa creature scenes are not as effective, but do not really detract from the film.The look of the film really sticks with you, especially on Degobah and Cloud City...great lighting, angles in the scene where Han Solo is frozen in carbonite.  Best work by John Williams in the trilogy as far as music goes too...""Empire theme"" ranks with ""ride of the valkyries"" in apocalypse now as a power anthem.Only part that slightly bugs is when the millennium falcon is docked in the worm's stomach on the asteroid and the ""minocs"" appear (it goes for amateurish ""startle"" scares like in a corny slasher flick) but otherwise an awesome movie.

it could be better,"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back offers an unforgettable cinematic experience. The second film of the series draws viewers in with its epic storytelling and visual grandeur. As characters deepen, the universe expands and enriches.The film's action scenes and special effects are awe-inspiring. The Empire's dark atmosphere adds depth to the story, while Jedi powers and lightsabers provide unforgettable moments. The emotional connections between characters further engage the audience.However, the film might not be as straightforward and light-hearted as the first for some viewers. The story holds more complexity and deeper meanings. Keeping up with the pace of the first film can be a challenge at times. Additionally, there might be questions about certain character decisions and the flow of events.In conclusion, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back stands out as one of the greatest works in cinematic history. With its legendary universe, profound characterization, and impressive visual presentation, it offers an impactful experience.

The GOAT from a Galaxy far far away,"I still remember to this day, going to the cinema with my Dad and younger Brother, not actually knowing what we were going to watch. I was maybe around 10 at the time.. lights in the theatre dim, 20th Century Fox logo.. and then *BOOM*
The ""Now"", iconic theme and the Scrolling narrative.What I didn't know back then was we were watching the two back to back! Yep, Star Wars first followed by The Empire Strikes back.As a small 10 year old-ish, I still to this day, remember how blown away I was seeing the huge Star destroyer take up my whole vision, seeing Vader for the first time and then when we got to meet Han and Chewy and the most iconic ship of all, The MILLENNIUM FALCON.Fast forward to the end of the film, seeing the Death Star blow up and my tiny, Juvenile mind blown to pieces, I remember standing up, ready to leave and my Dad saying we were going to wait for a bit, grabbed more popcorn and drink, sat waiting, mind reeling and then the movie lights dimmed again.Being young and confused, fan fare on the screen, I was thinking ""Great, we're watching it again""
*BOOM*The Empire Strikes BackThe first film blew my young mind. The second? How I didn't wet myself with pure excitement I'll never know.Everything was bigger, better, faster, new scenes, vehicles, characters and the now iconic ""No, I am your Father"".I left the theatre that day, a full blown Star wars fan. And Christmas that year was just Star wars toys.For me, the fact that not just one, but TWO films, back to back, managed to keep a small teen enthralled for over 4 hours is a testament in itself to how great these films were.Whilst the 1st drew us in, the 2nd film is what kept us there - and to this day, one of only a handful I can repeatedly watch over and over without wanting to skip through any parts.This, for me, is why I rate this film so high and still love to watch.Unfortunately, the special editions whilst improving some parts, also ruined other parts of the film.If you ever get the chance, watch the original version at the cinema and whilst the FX may look dated compared to modern CGI, it still knocks the socks off a lot of films.An excellent story with twists and turns - A simple Good vs Evil story to be enjoyed.To Everyone involved in making the films, a massive Thank you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Rich and Rewarding...Beautifully Done...Perfect Production Personafied,"Anticipation...Star Wars Fans Waited Three Years for the Follow Up and were Not Disappointed. The Rewards were Many.Widely Considered, with Miniscule Dissent, ""Empire"" is Touted as the Best of the Original Trilogy and the Best Film in the Franchise.The Template, Format, and Style Introduced in the First Film, Homages, Throwbacks, and Classical Storytelling Solidified and now Characters are Expanded and the ""Star Wars"" Universe became its own.The Film is Darker, more Violent, and Richly Conceived. The Dialog is more Mature and most of the Fluff and Fancy of the Original is Abandoned for Relationships and Edge of Your Seat Danger.Failure among Our Heroes is Often and Everywhere. The Suspense is Forever moving the Film along at a Breathtaking Pace. The SFX are Incredible, Detailed, and Amazing. The Sets have Color Schemes that Benefit the Mood of Scenes and Never Look Like Sets.Believable, Bold, and Brimming with Atmosphere the Entire Production is Beholding to the Detail and Artistry of the Filmmakers.Taking a Major Chance, Unheard of in 1980, the Movie Ends with a Cliffhanger. After All, wasn't the Original Conceived as a Tribute to the ""Cliffhangers"" of Old? But it was something that Audiences at the Time were Not Accustomed and it was a Shocker.Overall, Epic Sci-Fi Fantasy doesn't get any Better and the Movie Holds Up in Today's CGI World and the Film is a ""Stand Alone"" Achievement of its Own.

The opening of this movie is spectacular. And in this movie we're introduced to Yoda who is one of the best movie characters of all time. We also have the greatest plot twist of all time. And this movie just does exactly what a sequel should do: Raising the stakes for our heroes and battle them to their lowest point.

George Lucas is a genius!I remember after watching this movie as a child I earned enough money to purchase an AT-AT Walker toy and a Snowspeeder, both of which I enjoyed playing with for hours on end.If you're a sci-fi fan I can't recommend the Star Wars saga enough; especially this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Do Or Do Not. There Is No Try.""","The best science fiction film of all time has its story continued in this just as excellent sequel. By now, I'm sure most people have either seen this or have at least seen scenes from it and you probably all know the story and that it was a huge success. For those of you that have not had the pleasure to view this film, I shall do my best to persuade you to seek this one out. Of course, if you haven't seen the first film, and by that I mean the original 1977 entry, then get that under your belt first so you aren't completely lost.The last part of that last statement may not actually happen because of the way the film is made. Even though it pretty much picks up where first one left off, you can put this film by itself and still be highly entertained and greatly impressed.There are a lot of things to love about The Empire Strikes Back. The villain, Darth Vader, is better than ever. His dialogue may be some of the best ever written. Lines like ""You have failed me for the last time"" and ""Don't make me destroy you,"" when taken into context, really blow you away as far as meaning and even enunciation. James Earl Jones is definitely a candidate for our greatest voice of all time.Vader's not the only one spouting out great lines. A new character, in the form of a Muppet, might just steal the show. The fact that you are watching a puppet teach Luke Skywalker the ways of the force and you totally buy it really goes to show you how creative this movie is. The mannerisms of Yoda are so spot on that you think you're actually watching a person.A movie with the greatest villain of all time and the best use of a puppet can't have any more to offer, right? You tell me that again once you've seen the Battle of Hoth through the eyes of the soldiers staring down those AT-ATs. As soon as you've seen that, you may claim that you've seen everything. Why more movies don't use miniatures and stop-motion animation is beyond me. After this film set the bar as high as it did, you'd think people would want to have their epic films at least look realistic like this one.If those amazing feats aren't enough for you, try dodging asteroids while being chased by TIE Fighters, searching through the murky swamps of Dagobah in search of the greatest of all Jedi masters, or fighting the Dark Lord of the Sith atop Cloud City. Yes, The Empire Strikes Back has enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat for the duration.For those of you who like a little more substance with your style, look no further. As I said before the dialogue is crisp and really makes you think. The romance between Han and Leia may have as much tension as that climactic lightsaber fight. Even the comedy is well played and timed. The movie also has one of the best, if not the best, ending ever shot on film.The Empire Strikes Back is one for the ages. A film so jam-packed with literal awesomeness that you may need to pick up your jaw when the end credits start rolling. Crank up the sound, sit back, relax, and then prepare to get blown away by the second, or possibly fifth, chapter in the Star Wars saga.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The characters in this film are delightful, particularly Yoda as the great Jedi Master. Every scene he is in is extraordinarily interesting.

the empire kicks butt!,"Star Wars episode v-the empire strikes back is the critical darling of the six films, they loved its darker tone and serious plot twists and the FX is superb. Under pressure to write a full story for a movie he wasn't sure he'd make Lucas turned over directing to Irvin Kirshner, who does a fine job. Luke, Leia and Han have been pursed by the EMpire and specifically VAder who is obsessed with Luke, to the ice planet of Hoth. Amazing miniatures and FX lead to a terrible beating for the rebellion and they are on the run. Luke, advised by the spirit of Ob-Wan journeys to Degobah to meet Yoda, a JEdi master, while Han and Leia end up in Bespin to call on Han's old friend Lando Calrissian.Yoda is a puppet, but instantly feels real and is one of the most popular characters ever in cinema. Frank Oz (thats Miss Piggy to you!) does wonderful work and the training of Luke on the swampy bog really brings the philosophy of the Force home. Fantastic stuff. Han and Leia are betrayed by Lando and given over to DArth VAder, who really only wants Luke. Luke, against the advice of Both the cryptic Yoda and Obi-Wan goes to save them.Luke's battle with Vader is what everyone wanted after iv and its awesome, only Luke gets his butt kicked and loses his hand! Then Vader drops the bombshell to end all bombshell and tells Luke that Obi-Wan lied, ""No, I am your father!"" Interstingly Vader is the Dutch word for father. Its a great, if very risky, twist and the actors give it all they've got. Han is frozen in carbonite and given to the bounty hunter Boba Fett to be delivered to the villainous and so far unseen JAbba the Hutt.The movie ends with the rebellion in disarray and Luke and Leia bereft of home and family. Lando, played with style by Billy Dee Williams, turn s out to be a hero and vows to find Han, along with the loyal Chewbacca. John Williams delivers another great score and the end leaves you breathless and wanting more. Oddly I had no qualms with the minor tinkering George Lucas did on this one.

"My favorite Star Wars movie, and one of the best movies of all time!","Almost after every classic which has been fortunate enough to top the box-office, collect rave reviews, and be beloved by so many fans as well as common movie-goers! The thing that follows almost every time is a sequel! And 80 percent of the time it sucks... 15 percent of the time it's alright... And 5 percent of the time it's awesome and arguably better than the original! For me, The Empire Strikes Back is one of those 5 percent! And for me it is slightly better than the original, and one of my all time favorite movies! Following the worldwide success of Star Wars, Lucas quickly published that he would be writing a sequel, using ideas he couldn't fit in the original movie. This time Irvin Kershner would be directing the Star Wars flick. It went on to gross about as much money as the original, and it preceded the expectations for a Star Wars sequel!The Empire Strikes Back doesn't try to top the original at any point! The Empire Strikes Back takes off not long after the end of Star Wars! Luke, Han and Leia are now key fighters in The Rebellion, and Darth Vader is hot on the trail in the pursuit of Luke! Like Joss Whedon is planning to do with the Avengers 2, The Empire Strikes Back is a much more darker and personal movie flick, than the original movie was! The acting is much better as the actors have bonded with and understands their characters much better. The character development is better in this movie, even to the point where Leia and Han gets intimate! The movie is just downright equally as exciting and entertaining as the original, has tons of memorable dialog and scenes and an incredible story serving as a follow-up to the original! Gotta' give George Lucas credit for that!Luke Skywalker has become a professional resistance fighter, and well on the way to become a Jedi at this point! His acting is better, and his character is more interesting! Same goes for Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa! Harrison Ford is still as badass and as entertaining as in the first, and this time he's even got a really memorable line! Darth Vader is much more sinister in this movie, than in the original! He's got more really memorable lines, his character is much deeper and more ruthless! Darth Vader will always be my all-time favorite villain for this movie alone! Billy Dee Williams also debuts as a new smuggler and badass character! Frank Oz is magnificent as Yoda, and delivers an amazing performance!The technical category is awesome and better than in the original! The editing, sound and visuals are again amazing, and John Williams has a new theme tune for Darth Vader, called ""The Imperial March"". This tune is alone deserving of an Oscar. The movie took home 2 Oscars in the technical category!So... In the end you get: better acting, more memorable characters, more great lines, an equally amazing story, a fantastic screenplay, better direction, new great music and the characters are just downright better! Calling The Empire Strikes Back a sequel is a travesty! The description ""an expanded chapter for the original movie"" fits this masterpiece better! One of my and many other peoples favorite Star Wars movie, and favorite movie of all time!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"If you thought Star Wars was a tough act to follow, spare a thought for Richard Marquand.","It's hard to think of Empire as merely a film.To me,it represents more than that.In a way,i wish i could watch it again through new eyes and experience it without knowing the next piece of dialogue seconds before it's uttered.When you think this way about a film,it means you love it more than you ought to.This is true of mine and Empire Strikes Backs relationship.I saw it as a child and all the deep and meaningful stuff was lost on me but i recognised that i was sad when Han was taken away. Years later,the power of the film hit me and made me understand that, not only was this film amazing to look at,it covered almost every base technically. Looking at the Star Wars 'franchise' (hate that word) as it stands now, this is the film that made the life and longevity of the thing possible. Empire is truly the best of the Star Wars films and a strong contender for best sequel ever made. It's a film about relationships and growing and learning who you are. It's about finding your place in the world/galaxy and understanding how your impulses,as strong as they are sometimes, are not always the path to progression and betterment. I understand Empires power now, it's a film that teaches if you let it. Its also an amazing spectacle of the imagination that furthers something that was already brilliant and groundbreaking. If you thought Star Wars was a tough act to follow, spare a thought for Richard Marquand, director of Return Of The Jedi.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Best movie ever. No contest.,"People who know me ask me what my favorite film is. They expect me to say Star Wars knowing what a big fan I am. While Star Wars remains the movie that made me love movies in the first place it is Empire that cemented them.I can't think of a more perfect movie for the artistic medium that is film. Empire crams everything in that a die-hard movie fan wants.It has the best villain in the history of film. It has the best special effects action sequence being the snow battle on Hoth. It has the best space sequence. The asteroid chase. And even though everyone loves the Millennium Falcon I still love the Empire's Star Destroyers. Very cool.Even though Irvin Kershner directed you can feel George Lucas's stamp all over it. I've seen Kershner's subsequent films. He is good with actors and dialog but is out of his depth with pacing and special effects. Saying that though, he and Lucas complimented each other nicely on this film. Both needed the other and it works for the film.Also one of the great supporting actors of modern film was introduced here. I'm not talking about Billy Dee Williams or anyone. I'm talking about the sage Yoda. One of the best characters in modern film. And all he is is rubber and wires. A brilliant melding of art and technology.Revenge of the Sith comes out next week and all I can say is that it will have to be very very very good to knock Empire of it's pole position not only as my favorite Star Wars film but my favorite film entirely.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best movie of the trilogy!,Don't ask me why I liked this movie better than the others...I just did.Maybe it was the sabre battle between Darth and Luke on the skywalk.  Maybe it was Boba Fett.  Who cares....it was just terrific.An excellent movie!10 out of 10,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A bit improved,"The Empire Strikes Back is a bit more improved from the original.First, the writing. The writing in A New Hope really needed a polish, but it really is pretty good here, though nothing Oscar-calibar. Also we get to see the great Yoda here, which he was absent in A New Hope.Second, the acting. Mark Hamill is better here than he was in A New Hope, probably because he is in more dangerous situations than he was in A New Hope. I think this is because in the original and ROTJ, Hamill was pretty bland and flat unless if he was in a real turning point or in danger, which was pretty scarce in those films except when he found his aunt and uncle dead, or a couple of other situations I forget. Carrie Fisher isn't as semi-wooden here either, she is actually quite good.Thridly, the effects look more polished. In the original they looked cheesy at best, but here, they look more smooth and real, except for the creatures at the beginning of the film were Luke was stranded. But the lightsabres look better, the sound effects are smoother, and is more pleasing.Fourthly, the plot is more devolped. The plot in the original felt like it was stolen from a medival fairy tale with princesses, here, it shows more of The Dark Side, the characters are more devolped, the suspence is better, and the events are more layered.Overall, this is great polish-up from A New Hope. One gripe though would have to be how the irony from the original lacks here, but it is still a great film.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not just one of the best sequels ever made, not just one of the best science-fiction movies ever made but also one of the best movies ever made.","Widely this movie is known as perhaps the best sequel ever made. However calling this movie the best sequel ever made alone is not enough. It's so much more than just a sequel and it's overall one of the best movies ever made.Everything you could wish for is in this movie. Adventure, humor, romance, action, great characters. It's all told in a fast pace but never at the expense of the character development or story.""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is known and regarded as the darkest movie out of the two Star Wars trilogies. It's dark not in terms of visual style, after all Cloud City is one of the brightest cities you've ever seen in a movie, but more dark in terms of the story, characters and emotions. Basically in this story it's the evil Empire that prevails over the Rebels. Evil sides in movies are often the more interesting ones and this movie is perhaps the very best example of that. The ultimate movie villain Darth Vader is more evil than ever in this movie and doesn't even spare his own commanders.But it's not only the dark side that makes this movie different from any other Star Wars movie. Also the storytelling is different. For instance there is no big battle at the ending and the ending is actually an open one. Instead the biggest and most exciting battle is already in the beginning of the movie; the Imperial ground attack on the Rebel base, with giant walking tanks, AT-AT's. It still is one of the best and most memorable battle sequences out of movie history. Also not in the least because it's not set in cold dark space but on the white snow planet Hoth. It makes the battle unique and therefor all the more memorable.But don't worry the movie is not all dark and depressing, there also is room for entertainment. Luckily all the things that made ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" such a great classic and entertaining movie are still present here. The movie brings back all of the main characters and chooses the develop them even further. Especially the Han/Leia romance gets developed in a great non-formulaic way. Luke's character gets more vulnerable (especially of course after the famous classic Darth Vader revaluation sequence). He's not a real hero but more a character that struggles with his own future and past. The C-3PO and R2-D2 characters are yet again present as the comical relief of the movie. It works in a great non-distracting way, unlike perhaps was often the case in the new Star Wars trilogy. But the movie also leaves room to introduce some new big characters. Yoda is the best example of this. It was a big gamble to let a puppet play a significant role in the movie. But the character works very well and is not a laughable one. This is also really thanks to his performer and voice Frank Oz, who makes it a real character, that over the years has grown out to be one of the best known and likable characters and also thanks to Mark Hamill who's acting with Yoda also makes the character more believable and a life one, instead of simply a puppet. Also Lando Calrissian who is energetically played by Billy Dee Williams, is a new character in this movie and a welcome addition to the cast. But also of course lots of villains are introduced such as some cool Imperial officers and also Emperor Palpatine makes his first small appearance in this movie. But the most welcome new addition is Boba Fett, who is one of the coolest characters out of movie history, even though he has hardly any lines or action to do in this movie. His presence alone is good and cool enough on its own, to make a lasting impression. But it are not only the characters that make the movie entertaining. The movie also features lots of fast paced spectacular action and some well written and placed comical dialog, that are all perfectly performed by the wonderful cast, who all share some great chemistry together.The movie is good looking with some highly convincing special effects, even by todays standards. It provides the movie with some spectacular and impressive memorable sequences. The cinematography by Peter Suschitzky sets up the perfect mood for this movie and Suschitzky is perhaps one of the most underrated cinematographers in the business at the moment, with already movies like ""The Man in the Iron Mask"", ""Mars Attacks!"", ""The Vanishing"" and the David Cronenberg movies ""eXistenZ"", ""Spider"" and ""A History of Violence"" behind his name. Also all of the characters and sets are highly convincing looking, something that was still lacking a bit at times in ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"". The musical score by John Williams is a true classic and perhaps the best or at least most memorable out of all the Star Wars soundtracks, mainly of course due to the Imperial March that can first be heard in this movie. It all combined is the reason why this movie is such a classic perfect masterpiece, that is as good as flawless, which helps to make this movie one of the best ever made.Not just the best Star Wars movie but also one of the best movies of all time.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Even Before The Special Edition... Still The Best Movie Ever!!!,"This is my number one movie of all time. It has a critical and personal touch to my heart. The Best Star Wars movie ever is also the Best Movie ever!! Right from the visuals, dialog and pace. Has anybody said that this installment (of the previous trilogy) has the best sound a picture quality? Someone was doing something right when they filmed this. Darth Vader has never looked better in a menacing way (I have not seen Revenge Of The Sith so I am not sure). Pay attention to the scenes when he is looking out to the stars for a hint of Luke. Man, I can keep going for hours on this one! The Hoth scenes were so goddamn priceless. Those Imperial Walkers scared the crap out of me when I was a kid. The Special Edition was a tough call, but I do have to say of all the last trilogy, this one had the best restoration. If you can, see the original cut of this, it was the way it was meant to be seen, with no tampering! Every time I tell people that ""Empire"" is my favorite Star Wars movie, they just look at me with disbelief and say ""... but Return Of The Jedi had a lot more action scenes...""

"Still the greatest movie I have ever seen, still awesome!","Proved that Star Wars was not a fluke - and even improved on it and expanding an already amazing universe. it was this movie that made Darth Vader the ultimate villain/movie icon (or fallen hero?), this movie that defined the force (something which many other films have tried to copy) this movie that had a main character (who was completely believable & watchable) who moved us with the magic of the force - yet was a puppet; this movie that showed us the most epic duel/showdown/cliffhanger to date; this movie that showed that Harrison Ford was a movie star - and this movie that made us all want to fly the Millennium Falcon ( the first movie spaceship to really fly), fight with a light saber and be a bounty hunter!And it still amazes me today!

A pop culture phenomenon,"Perhaps the best science fiction movie ever made. This movie defines sequels as it is know today. The movie goes light years ahead from the first in every way; special effects that to this day even look better those modern sci/fi movies of today. The characters are defined and the saga really begins in this epic story. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Leia suffer difficult and effective changes though out the movie. The introduction of Yoda as the tinny Jedi master was amazing, the former smuggler, and Solo's best friend Lando as a two face allied was perfect. The fearsome and imposing Darth Vader with his deep voice is for me the best performance of James Earl Jones ever. The light saber duel between Luke and Vader was dramatic and surprising. And the revelation ""no, I am your father"" it has become a pop culture phenomenon. Empire is the best of all the 6 film succeeding where others have failed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Simply the Best,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" belongs to that rare breed of sequels being better than their hailed forerunners.

After all, and especially after that computer animated waste of anyone´s time called, among other things, ""The Phantom Menace"" (1999), the suspicion that George Lucas might have invented the Star-Wars-Universe but isn´t its major artistic force is rooted in evidence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fun, imaginative, iconic space adventure with a kick-axx cast","""Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) was the anticipated follow-up to the initial mega-hit blockbuster from 1977. It's an epic, but simplistic space fantasy about an evil empire and the noble souls who dare to fight it. The main cast features Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian), Alec Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi) and the voice work of James Earl Jones (Darth Vader), Frank Oz (Yoda) and Clive Revill (Emperor).This is an amusing, inventive, iconic space adventure with a stellar cast. While I prefer the adult-oriented space science-fiction of Star Trek, I can't deny that this space fantasy grants you an entertaining two hours with lots of sci-fi action, space ships, a snowy planet, asteroid caves and mysterious swamps. I also appreciate the mind-powers angle. It doesn't hurt that Fisher is in her prime and easy on the eyes, not to mention Ford and Williams are at their charismatic best. Even the more obscure Hamill shines in his boyish youth. Then there's RD-D2, C-3PO and Chewbacca.The film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This was more of an original story than the other sequals, since the story line revolved more around the individual characters than a great threat to the galaxy or a planet(Ep. 6:  A Death Star, how original; Ep. 1:  Naboo under attack).

Untouchable,"The dramatic high point of the entire Star Wars saga remains the moment in Empire when Vader tempts a defeated Luke.  What Vader is offering is very enticing: come on kid lets you and me take over this universe.  There is also a genuine caring portrayed in Vader's voice.

Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin',"Luke studies under Yoda, fights Vader and learns the big horrible family secret (don't you just hate skeletons in the closet?). Han Solo & Princess Leia fall in love when not exchanging red hot love/hate barbs. And we also meet the man who previously owned the Millenium Falcon, Lando Calrissian.Star warfare highlights include the battle on the ice planet of Hoth, the Millenium Falcon being chased through the asteroid field, a handful of shootouts, and of course, the duel between Luke and Vader. There's also some chilling suspense in the cave when the abominable snowman from outer space is either stalking Luke or mauling him or getting his arm severed. But the film also boasts stronger performances this time around in addition to the superior light saber duel. Mark Hamill's Luke may complain a lot but he manages to make the complaining believable and never tacky or annoying. Harrison Ford steals every scene he's in as Han Solo, and once again he is well matched by Carrie Fisher's distressing damsel Leia, who manages to argue with him in a believable manner. Even Vader himself seems to become more soulful here and not just a giant hulking half maimed machine man tyrant.Easily the best of the old trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fantastic Worlds, Rushed in Parts","There is a lot for the story to get through in 'The Empire Strikes Back', and for the most part it is entertaining, and the film just flows beautifully.The first act however isn't particularly memorable. There feels like a disconnect between Episode IV and V, leading to a feeling of confusion. Visually it isn't the best the film has to offer, but it has some fascinating inhabitants.It isn't until the middle of the film where the emotions really rein in true and character arcs become truly interesting. Plot B however during this time could have been more inventive and imaginative.It's difficult to pick out a particular performance as the actors/actresses occasionally deliver their scenes with too much ham and over the topness and I would have preferred a more grounded and human approach to their lines.Overall it's a particular taste in the series, and due to the amount of content it has to get through, it leaves out too much emotional exposition for some characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The best sequel ever made,"The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that respects the original film while going in a deeper and darker direction. It isn't something that's easy to achieve but Irvin Kershner was able to do exactly that with this memorable and powerful sequel.After the Empire attacks the rebel base on Hoth, our set of heroes go seperate ways. Luke goes to the Dagobah system to learn from the wise Master Yoda. The rest of the heroes are attempting to flee from the Empire until Han finds an old friend in Cloud City. However, something sinister is happening in Cloud City and Luke senses this through the force.What is so great about this sequel is its masterful blend of action, humour and deep philosophy. The battle of Hoth draws you into the movie with its spectacular special effects. Then the movie spends time dealing with the philosophy of the force with Master Yoda, one of the greatest characters in the series. We also have more humorous adventures with Han, Leia, Chewie and C3PO.The climax is what separates this movie from the rest of the series. Essentially the heroes lose and the Empire gains the upper hand. We also discover a dark secret which wowed people at the time. People didn't know what to think at the time of release but now it's cemented as the series high point.Essentially this movie managed to expand upon what was already a perfect roller coaster ride of a movie.

The style used before computer animation gives it a sense of reality that has not been matched in episodes one, two and three.

excellent,"After reading countless reviews about these Star Wars DVD's over the past few months here on Amazon from some who are taking this issue way too seriously to others who just don't seem to have a clue as to what some words mean, I finally feel compelled enough to write a review of my own.To begin, I agree with the majority of reviewers in the fact that these films, the original unaltered Star Wars trilogy, deserve much better treatment for release on DVD. Now, from what I understand, the original negatives/prints were destroyed or altered during the restoration for the Special Edition release back in 1997 and, as a result, can't be restored. Therefore, the laser-disc transfers from 1993 are being used as source material for the DVD release, which explains why these ""bonus"" DVD's (don't get me started on the originals only being - according to the soulless marketing geniuses at LucasFilm - ""bonus"" discs), won't be anamorphic and without 5.1 surround sound. I also understand that LucasFilm is not willing to put in as much time, effort, or money into this project since the original unaltered films didn't represent his true ""vision"" for the films. However, I take issue with the reasoning behind this thought process.First of all, I'll admit I'm no film restoration expert, but common sense would tell me that 95% of the restoration of the original unaltered trilogy has already been done since only, at the very most, 5% of the original movies was altered for the Special Edition release",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The plot gets deeper!,"After destroying the Death Star, the heroes set off into another adventure where the try to destroy the empire created by the menacing Dart Vader(David Prowse). When Luke Skywalker is on Planet Hoth, it would quite resemble Antartica in a way. The Tauntauns are the fine animals that would endure the harsh cold there. And the Wampas are so fierce they would catch any victim off guard. Luke Jedi instincts paid off against the Wampa. I liked th part where Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) snickers at Han Solo(Harrison Ford) where Princess Leia Organa(Carrie Fisher) tells him off. There were a lot more characters in the movie, too long to list, but I know that in the swamp scene, where Yoda teaches Luke more about the Force. And getting that X-wing fighter jet out of the swamp needed more work. Then there's the battle between Vader and Skywalker. That fight scene would take the storyline further and further to the truth of Anakin Skywalker; Luke's father! This movie has a lot to show, and it's just as fun as the fourth one. Which I thought was the first. Still, I enjoyed this all the way through. 5 Stars!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Movie. Would recommend to all,"Such a classic, absolutely love this film and all of the other Star Wars films and spin off series, must have watched this at least 3 times it's so good
The theme music is so good and other music is good as well. My only complaint is the quality but it is fairly old so that can be totally excused. Would recommend to anyone who likes adventure is sci fi or action movies or to anyone who has watched another Star Wars movie and loved it. In my family every generation has watched it and loved it.Such a classic, should be so much higher rated even though it is already a good rating. Shoutout to Star Wars fans, love you all

"Why, you stuck up, half-witted, scruffy-looking Nerf herder.","Sound, Art, Music, Special Effects, Costuming - these all make this a film worth revisiting on Blu ray. Even without surround sound, this is a special film to watch and enjoy.It was just an amazing adventure that took me back to seeing it for the first time in 1980. I enjoyed the performances, and I especially enjoyed Harrison Ford, who I don't think gets enough credit for his job in this film.

Easily the greatest Star Wars movie.,"Watched as part of a Star Wars Marathon, hence the shorter review.This is it. This is the greatest Star Wars film, this is the quintessential sci-fi movie. It has everything: a strong, likeable cast of characters, an even stronger plot with zero dull moments, a beautiful musical score, innovation beyond belief, development of the universe with characters like Yoda and Lando, and one of the single most memorable twists in cinema history. It is to sci-fi what Terminator 2 is to action. All three acts - Hoth, Dagobah, and Cloud City - are a joy to watch. The set design is truly on another level when held up against not only Star Wars, but other films too. Characters have clear, satisfying development, changing relationships, and some are even permanently physically and mentally altered. If Episode 4 was the setup, it was worth it for this level of payoff - the film doesn't need to worry with exposition or closure. It's just iconic scene after iconic scene. This is a true cinema classic.86/100--Admin--

One of the great sci-fi films of all-time,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is not just the best installment so far in the ""Star Wars"" saga, it is arguably one of the best sci-fi films of all-time. This is what science fiction and fantasy films are all about.I won't bother too much with the story line, since most people (especially film fans) know all about the ""Star Wars"" films. After watching the film again recently, I had to just sit and admire the other worlds brought before our eyes... Hoth, the frozen planet... Dagobah, the swamp planet, and of course Cloud City. This film is a feast for the eyes, like so many great sci-fi films such as ""Metropolis"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". The skyline of Cloud City and the sights and sounds of the Dagobah and its creatures are enough to make you smile in awe of the other worlds brought before our eyes.The other factor in the film which makes it such an effective piece of emotional entertainment, is the relationships. The audience is allowed to identify and feel for the characters through these relationships. The romance of Han (Harrison Ford and Leia (Carrie Fisher), the conflict between Luke and Darth Vader as well as the friendship formed between Luke and Yoda make for an enjoyable and interesting slice of entertainment. This film puts its characters in both complicated and tough situations and in many cases leaves them hanging (with responses coming in ""Return of the Jedi""), but this is what gives the film its creativity and power. This is a great sci-fi film and the best so far in the ""Star Wars"" saga. A 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Gripping, Exciting, Amazing","After getting absorbed into the world of Star Wars thanks to memorable characters and set pieces, ""The Empire Strikes Back"", delivers in almost every way possible. While the ""Star Wars"" was honestly nothing much more than pure fun, this one told a dark and intriguing story that really threw its characters for a loop. Since we've pretty much grown to love these characters, the turmoil they face really drives a strong emotional connection that the last one didn't necessarily have. It even digs deeper into the myths of the force. However, I felt I didn't get enough of it. I wished the second act was much more broad like its first and third acts. It could have added another 30 minutes for all I cared. And really, that's my only biggest gripe. This movie delivers in a way that was never seen before. By putting its characters at stake and giving the story more grit it made for a gripping Star Wars experience. I give ""The Empire Strikes Back"" an A!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A more romantic, serious & darker episode to the holy trilogy...","GEORGE LUCAS has inspired all of us STAR WARS lovers with STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE in 1977, in 1980 he then brought us STAR WARS: EPISODE V - THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (second in the STAR WARS TRILOGY) is a much darker film, with more drama, romance and evil. Being a more dramatic film is actually quite heart warming at times, JOHN WILLIAM's fantastic musical score and the actors of the film have helped a lot to make the dramatic scenes...dramatic.We see a lot more of LUKE SKYWALKER's (well acted by MARK HAMILL) development as a JEDI KNIGHT and education of the FORCE. A new character is introduced in this film and his name is...YODA who is a GREAT JEDI MASTER, one of the most interesting characters in the holy trilogy. YODA grabs the eye of the audience with his short and funny appearance and astonishing JEDI powers. The elements of the FORCE in this film are much more interesting and inspiring than what we see in the other two STAR WARS movies, with uplifting scenes like LUKE's education of the FORCE from YODA.One of the many highlights of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the blossoming romance between HAN SOLO (amaZingly performed by HARRISON FORD) and PRINCESS LEIA (played sweetly by CARRIE FISHER). LEIA's sweet, innocent yet tough personality miXes well with HAN's scoundrellish style.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK being the DARKER film of the trilogy, has more evil within, which means there is more of the dark lord of the sith...DARTH VADER (played by DAVID PROWSE and the voice of JAMES EARL JONES). VADER uses his powers much more effectively here, he dominates the movie and shows no mercy.Another good mention is the SPECIAL EFFECTS, they are actually a little more dazzling than the EFFECTS in the first film, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK won a special OSCAR for the VISUAL EFFECTS.If you haven't seen THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK I suggest you have a look at it and see what you think, I think anyone who's anyone should enjoy it, but if you haven't seen STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE, I strongly suggest you see that before STAR WARS: EPISODE V - THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is easily the best in the HOLY TRILOGY and one of the best movies ever made, well that's what I think anyway...I rate it a 10/10! Bye kids...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not Better Than The First,"Whilst a lot of people deem this movie superior to ""Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope"" and one of the best sequels ever made. I disagree.Plot In A Paragraph: A long time a go in a galaxy far, far away a classic tale of good vs evil is being played out, After the rebels have been overpowered by the Empire on their new base, Luke Skywalker takes advanced Jedi training with Master Yoda, while his friends are pursued by Darth Vader.What can you say about this movie that has not already been said?? The story is filled with the standard elements, (love, betrayal, over coming your fears and good vs evil) but the movie is anything but standard and it has a twist ending you'd never get away with in this day and age (the age of spoilers on the internet)I'll get what I didn't like out if the way first. When I first saw this as a kid, I was so excited to see it, but I hated the downbeat ending with what happened to Luke and Han Solo, and even recall being bored. And even now over thirty years later, I still remember how disappointed I was, even if I appreciate it for it's part in the story. But It feels bloated and over long, it seriously drags during the 50 mins - 1 hr 25 mark, I checked my watch and could not believe it had only been on an hour, It felt much longer.Now that's out of the way.....We get to see the ice planet Hoth, The swamp land of Degobah and the beautiful cloud City of Bespin, whilst introducing us to Landon Calrisian, and more importantly The Emperor and Jedi Master Yoda.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Everyone is spot on. Mark Hamill is excellent as the eager hero Luke Skywalker, who is devastated to learn a family secret. Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as the cocky pilot Han Solo, he is good looking with charisma in spades, whilst Carrie Fisher looks cute and feisty in equal measure. David Prowse does what is need of him as Darth Vader, but it's James Earl Jones who makes the biggest Vader impression and revelation.Unfortunately with the exception of Ford, the success of these movies type cast them and despite starting in some interesting movies with a good story and good performances. Sadly these pictures never found audiences as movie goers refused to see him as anything other than their characters here.The score by John Williams is again another valuable asset to the movie.One of my favourite parts of the movie was the banter between Ford and Fisher, they had real chemistry and I'm surprised they never paired up again away from these movies.All in all ""Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"" is a highly professional piece of work, suspenseful, with a good sense of atmosphere it makes for excellent entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The genius of the trilogy(yes-it remains a trilogy until Lucas makes up for that Phantom Menace crap) is the way it effortlessly draws you in and immediately makes you forget you're watching a mere""movie"".

One of the best sequels in the history of cinema,"The incredible, universal success of ""Star Wars"" in 1977 was a big incentive for George Lucas and his squad to deliver a sequel that could cover them in money just like the first did and that could satisfy fans and critics. The final result was (and is) a fantastic movie, arguably the best sequel ever in this kind of cinematic experience. As Lucas left the writing job to his fellow storyteller Lawrence Kasdan (very possibly the real mastermind behind the most amusing lines, considering the awful job Lucas did all alone with the prequels), the adventure is just as iconic as ""A New Hope"", but with a darker and somewhat more mature mood, as the title suggests. If ""Star Wars"" was an epic poem, and in some ways it is, this film should be considered its ""discentio ad inferos"", that is the lowest moment for the hero, who then rises from its ashes and manages to win once and for all (""Return of the Jedi""): both Han Solo and Luke Skywalker find themselves in great danger at the hands of Darth Vader, a character that immediately grows in depth after one of the last scenes, which is also one of the most famous scenes (and worst quoted lines) in the history of cinema and possibly the best idea to come from George Lucas's mind. One possible mistake could have been to recycle our beloved characters in cheap fashion, but instead everyone of them grows and gets more defined through the story and we are introduced to yet some other iconic members of this wonderful universe, like Master Yoda, Lando Calrissian and the baddest bounty hunter ever, Boba Fett. On top of all that, John Williams's music is just as fantastic as the first time around, modelling itself to the more grim atmosphere.Is Episode V better than Episode IV?

Nice movie,"_The Empire Strikes Back: A Galactic Masterpiece_""The Empire Strikes Back,"" the fifth episode of the Star Wars saga, is a cinematic masterpiece that has captivated audiences for decades. Directed by Irvin Kershner and released in 1980, this iconic film is widely regarded as one of the greatest sequels of all time, and for good reason. With its richly detailed world-building, memorable characters, and emotional depth, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a must-see for fans of science fiction and adventure.The film takes place three years after the events of ""A New Hope,"" with the Rebel Alliance on the run from the Galactic Empire. Darth Vader, the embodiment of Imperial power, is determined to crush the Rebellion and capture Luke Skywalker, the young hero who destroyed the Death Star.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) - I Am Your Father!,"The fifth (or second) installment of the highly successful ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" really took me along for the ride. Set three years after the original, the Galactic Empire, in the clutches of Darth Vader, are still in pursuit of tracking down Luke Skywalker and his small band of friends, including Han Solo and Princess Leia. When Luke tries to learn the Force from Jedi Master Yoda, and his friends are captured by Vader, he must decide whether to complete his training to become a Jedi master, or confront Vader to save his friends. Wow, what a movie. As a big fan of the original, I'm an even bigger fan of ""Empire Strikes Back"". This movie blew me away with everything new. The characters are still memorable, the visual effects are still awesome, the environment is breathtaking, the story just got better, and the character of Yoda was just plain awesome. But my favorite part in the whole movie was the final confrontation between Luke and Vader, and the climatic ending, that's better to be left unspoiled, is one of the greatest endings ever seen in a movie. Also, this movie was actually very dark, due to containing some graphic moments of blood, killings, and even torture. I was just thinking the same exact thing: ""awesome""! I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish, and I was blown away by how better the series gets. This is the most darkest, thrilling, and jaw-dropping movie of the whole series so far.

The perfect Star Wars movie. The perfect action adventure flick. The perfect film.,"It's now an accepted fact that the first Star Wars is regarded as one of the most, or amongst some communities, the most successful movie of all time both in terms of critical acclaim and box office gross. Attempting a sequel to a movie of such magnitude, while an exciting prospect from the movie goers' perspective, is a suicidal task for the crew behind the same. One can only imagine the immense pressure of expectations that the makers of this film would have gone through while making this movie and even more so when the movie eventually saw the light. However, this movie not only fulfills all such hopes that fans of the first movie would have from the sequel but takes the Star Wars franchise into an even better and exciting territory, and improving upon the minor flaws of the first, turns out to be an adventure that can be regarded as good as perfect in all aspects of film-making. Although I had gotten a slight hint of this from the forums and internet talk, I now realize why this is regarded as the best movie in the Star Wars universe.There's little need to get into the plot as it is best experienced by watching the movie directly. To describe it in short though, Darth Vader is desperately after Luke Skywalker and wants to turn him to the dark side. In an attempt to capture him, he plans to use his friends Han Solo and Princess Leia as bait. Meanwhile, Luke, guided by Obi-Wan Kenobe's voice through the mystical Force must travel to Dagobah where he must learn the true ways of a Jedi Knight in order to confront the evil lord Darth Vader.Once again, all the elements that made the original Star Wars a success abound in the sequel. There's a well conceived story put together in place, great writing and editing that makes all the sequences feel connected to each other allowing them all to flow together, there's the original cast giving better performances this time being more aware of their characters, and of course, there's the by now famous Star Wars opening musical piece. Lucas, busy handling his newly established visual effects house and finances, hands over the directorial reins to his trusted professor Irvin Kershner. A professor at the University of Cinema Sciences, the way he handles the epic sequences while at the same time concentrating on expanding and developing the characteristic traits of the main cast gives the film an emotional depth which was sorely lacking in the original movie and which was one of my complaints with that film - the characters there were appeared too flat and devoid of personality as though they were just going through the motions. The presence of some character development this time allows us to connect with them even better which in turn makes the situations in which they get involved in a lot more engaging. Amongst all, the character of Han Solo as a dependable ""scoundrel"" is what really stands out; Ford plays him out in a near perfect way which is not only consistent with what Solo was in the first film, but also takes it in a further positive direction. His sequences with Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia are amongst the high points of the movie and are brilliantly played out. We also see Mark Hamill as a now slightly more mature Luke Skywalker as he journeys to Dagobah to learn the ways of a true Jedi from the strangely voiced Yoda. And of course there's the inseparable duo of C-3PO and R2-D2 who are actually forced to stay apart from each other for a major portion of this movie. As much as I can admit to not being able to understand anything R2 says, I have inexplicably grown to like his presence immensely in Star Wars.The film features visual effects and action on a scale that's almost twice as big as its predecessor (the budget only confirms this). Spending $32 million on a movie in 1980 would not have been regarded as a wise decision but thank goodness that Lucas decided to go for it or we might not have been able to witness space battles on such a huge scale. The battle on the ice planet at the start of the movie is brilliantly staged and a behind the scenes documentary sheds some light on how some of these miraculous shots were achieved. What's really great about the action is that unlike the heavily edited action sequences of present films wherein the average shot just lasts for about 2-3 seconds, shots in Star Wars last longer making the action very comprehensible and easy to follow. Its easy to see the strategies being adopted by each side while fighting as opposed to units just being brought down by random shots fired by people / creatures obscured by the miss-mash editing. And the best sequence of the movie comes towards the end in an epic battle between Luke and Darth Vader that literally will send your pulse racing. Even more exciting is the battle's infamous outcome which I shall not reveal.Movies like The Empire Strikes Back come only once in a while. Perhaps, every decade must have only a few of these movies present. Fans would obviously come up with a few nitpicks here and there but as far as my opinion goes, this movie is perfect in every aesthetic and area of film-making I'm ever aware of. Now that this movie has set such high standards for the Star Wars saga, I wonder where the next movies will take me.

Disappointed in theater but grows to be one of the best,"I remember watching Episode V in the theater back in 1980/81 and i walked out with an uncomfortable feeling that this was just a moneymaking episode and simply not finished. In fact it wasn't, since it was designed to be the dramatic middle-part of the trilogy, which i did not know at the time - i was 14 and had no idea about the trilogy.If there would not be an episode VI this would indeed be a major downside of episode V, but as the center part of the trilogy it was the best possible movie. In fact the plot does not really feel that epic, it just develops the characters more and prepares for the final act of episode VI.Now, more than 36 years later we do have two completed trilogies and a new one just started plus a prequel to episode IV and all those movies can be judged from a wider angle and perspective. Having said that, this one is still one of the best, although not the most enjoyable, which i think is episode VI. But all three original movies are very close and from a cinematic point of view TESB stands out, since it has the most perfect balance between all the aspects that makes STAR WARS great. Any other episode has its flaws and issues, but episode V is almost complete in all ways.In addition to this it simply downgrades the prequel episodes 1-3 to just being a lousy effort, but although Lucas tried to create something unique they totally fail in terms of being a serious contender to the original trilogy. Almost everything is either over sized or flat, and especially that is the complete opposite of episode V. It's technically advanced, serious, funny, full of ideas and action and has a straight plot.

The greatest sequel of all time,"Like the original ""Star Wars"" film, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" always finds itself inside my top ten. It's extremely close in quality to ""A New Hope,"" but I place this film just slightly below that one. This is however, in my opinion, the greatest sequel ever made. Like all great sequels, it doesn't try to be too much like its original. This film has a completely different feel to it, and it proves to be far more dramatic and intense than the last film. In this film we are introduced to one of the most well-known and most-imitated characters of the saga (and movies in general), Yoda. This character brings about not only some of the most humorous bits of the movie, but also some of the most important and challenging ones. It has a bit of a slow start, which is really the only reason I rate it less than the original. I'm not really sure why I prefer the original, but there are few circumstances when I like a sequel almost as much as the first film. The lightsaber battle at the end is probably the most intense one in the entire saga, and if you are unaware of how it turns out, watch it now and find out.

"This film is no less spectacular than ""A New Hope""","Of all the movies that have had follow-ups to the original, many just had sequels made only because the first was successful enough for it.  First thing to know: ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is NOT a sequel.  A standard ""sequel"" is simply the same or similar characters from one movie put in the same or similar situation to the one of the original movie, which is complete without any sequel (Jurassic Park, Speed).  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was pre-planned, and while ""Star Wars"" did seem like a complete story by itself, that was a result of creator George Lucas' uncertainty of whether or not they'd be given the opportunity to complete his saga of stories. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" did an excellent job as the film following ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", because it strived toward the same excellence the first one achieved, while the mood of this chapter contrasted that of the first entirely.  The first one definitely had a lighter sort of mood to it, as far as the action among the rebels.  This film concentrates more on the war itself, and how tough it is on the rebellion.  It also has more establishment of the imperials and their ruthlessness, which definitely adds a darker tone to it.  Score composer John Williams helps give this feeling to the film, with the now famous Imperial March that is so closely associated with villain Darth Vader (James Earl Jones).  For a mood this dark, there sure is a lot of really nice scenery in the film, from the glaciers of the planet Hoth to the spanning cloudscape of Bespin.  The special effects remain as amazing as those in ""A New Hope"", and have been re-done with a ""Special Edition"" as well as the first one, although not as much has changed in this film.  The acting is also just as good as it was in the first one, with the addition of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams).  The emotion of this film definitely surpasses those in ""A New Hope"", with the characters' personalities and relationships explored more deeply, such as between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and even Luke (Mark Hamill) and Darth Vader, who for the first time have an actual face-to-face confrontation with each other in the unforgettable lightsaber duel.  This film is even more suspenseful and action-packed, with an incredible climax and other very high points as well. Of all the intense and breathtaking aspects of this film, the one that everyone has remembered since, and will be remembered for as long as ""Star Wars"" itself, is the revelation by Vader to Luke, which most people already know by now.  If you are one of the very few who don't, don't do anything until you see this film (and the first one, too) and find out from the movie, not from some loud-mouthed friend, the way many of us did.  As hard as it would be to make a film as great as ""A New Hope"" after it changed the standards of filmmaking forever, this film definitely meets and surpasses the first one.  It will also leave you hanging for the trilogy's final film, ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983), which also does not disappoint in any way.  A SECOND must-see for science fiction fans, or movie fans in general.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Almost as good as the first.,"This one is exelent and almost as good as A New Hope.  The only thing that brought it down for me was the fact that it was so depresing. In this one the Rebles have been driven onto a remote planet called Hoth. The Impeials find the base and lay seige to it.  Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammiel) gose to Dagobah to complete his jedi training by master Yoda (Frank Oz), while Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mahew), and C3P-O (Anthony Daniels) flee to Cloud City which is owned by an old ""friend"" of Han's, Lando Calrision (Billy Dee Wiliams).  The climax much more intense than the last (so is the rest of the movie). Again exelent preformances by Mark Hammiel, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Billy Dee Williams, along whith the rest of the cast.  Again George Lucus is an exelent story-teller. This isn't as good as the last just because it's so dark.  I give Star Wars Episode 5 The Empire Striks Back 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

movie is the perfect merchant between silly and serious,"Jesus is serious improvement. I mean the first one. I liked on a silly level. I mean it's amazing. It's one of the most silly and creative films. I have seen but this is an war movie that feels like things are happening and they are not just hilarious bad guys who got their heads into the wall. This is intense now.The biggest change is the characters filled more developed and deep now which isn't improvement and even if it is a more serious movie it is still has time for silly silly stuff like a little green dwarf on your back who teaches magic just that kind of silliness that bring it together,The last part of the movie is just so intense and you're wondering for the characters that they feel in danger and the movie ends on the best cliffhang I have seen in the movie.Was most impressed by was Luke Skywalker and yodas training because it was just the right amount of silliness and fun, but it was also in meditative it felt like he was learning something but he had too much pressure to sit down.The thing to say is that this movie is the perfect merchant between silly and serious movie making and the classic it is today.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Some films age very well; this one simply doesn't!,"The film was made in 1980. You would think you have to watch it with a different perspective. Think about the limited resources they had at the time. Well you need not. It can be compared to any contemporary film sci-fi or otherwise. True, people who cannot watch sci-fi movies won't appreciate star wars to its true value. But then, can they appreciate cinema as a whole? Casting this unsolicited attack aside, those who are not experts in the field and I would include myself as one, should start with star wars series. Star Wars IV a new hope was a very good start but the special effects and plot was not as refined. You could see the lack means as a first major project for George Lucas. But it is easily forgiven since Star wars V is the gem in the crown. I have to rate this film as a masterpiece, if not by its incredibly credible special effects (even by 2009 standards), but by a story which keeps the mystery till the end. The epic fighting and tight situations keep us on the edge of our seats throughout. It is fast paced. But I watch this film at least once every year. And every time I know I am going to watch it again. I know the story, I surely remember almost all the scenes of the movie. It is the atmosphere in which we are cast from the minute the small written resume rolls up the screen with the background music, that doesn't leave us. George Lucas, as confirmed Steven Spielberg is a master at story telling. He adds the spices to an already good sauce to make it sublime. Hans Solo is in the same vein as Indy in Indiana Jones, but we just never get tired of it. The two droids add an uncanny sense of humour; the unity of the whole rebel group; the love hate relationship of Hans Solo and Leia, all very simple ingredients mixed together by the genius of George Lucas, whether he did it purposely or not. We are projected in a well oiled machine working at optimal capacity, and all we can do is follow, no questions asked. It goes without saying that I recommend buying the collection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Only a fully Trained Jedi with the force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor""","The sequel to George Lucas' fantastical Science Fiction story ""A New Hope"" has a dark and excellent follow up in ""The Empire Strikes Back""- my favourite film of all time. Who could ever imagine that Darth Vader lord of all evil, was once Annakin Skywalker soft-spoken, noble Jedi Knight and most of all Luke's father. We have the debut of Master Yoda, ostensibly a comical character but in truth a deep and thoughtful Lord of the Force If you Haven't seen Empire with it's dark battle between Vader and Luke at the Climax, and the opening for the sequel at the end then my feeble minded friends you simply haven't lived.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nooo... That's impossible,"As you thought Lucas had used up all the ideas in a new hope, he once again proves you the impossible. To make a second movie as, or even more popular as the first, the recipe is pretty simple, more action. The soul of a new hope is what I to believe to be the storytelling, pacing and the way it escapes you from reality and puts you in a galaxy far far away. While the empire strikes back still evolves these things I don't really feel the same soul in the story, it has more action, some new characters that is point on and just more starwars, but I don't really connect to the movie in the same way that I did with the first. The story feels a bit rushed and squeezes in a bit to much action, more than what you would expect after watching ""a new hope"". StarWars is much alike Aliens, Terminator and Jurassic park. They first movies heavily relies on the wonderful storytelling and originality in the script while the second movies all just focuses on the action, sure I would agree that the story is good and that for some it would have felt a bit boring without the action, but I would really have loved that instead of just continuing where we left off that the focus instead would had been in something else. There is a wonderful opportunity to on a deeper level show Lukes struggles in becoming a Jedi but in some way it feels like a missed opportunity and is instead naive and like a foreplay to the after laying action.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Darker, better story, better effects","The Empire Strikes back defied every single expectation from viewers. How could anything be any better than the epic original Star Wars movie? It's not even directed by George Lucas, right? Wrong.Irvin Kershner directed Empire and it is the best Star Wars in the original trilogy, the best Star Wars movie so far, one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time and one of the greatest movies of all time.In Empire, we see our heroes evolve and we see them at their most vulnerable. The story is enhanced, expanded and we learn the true nature of the force and a very dark secret in the Skywalker legacy.The effects are way better than in A New Hope and it is very dark and sinister as well, which I love.

It Is A Dark Time For The Rebellion,"The Empire Strikes Back is the second instalment of the classic Star Wars saga. It is widely regarded as the best in the entire series in which I completely agree... In the hands of director for hire Kershner, a more satisfying character study of the relationships between the lead actors is achieved. Although credit should be given to Lucas for setting up these interesting characters and assembling a great cast to begin with.The story arc takes a downward turn from the celebratory climax of Star Wars where the Empire's ultimate grip on the galaxy has been weakened by a small rebel armies valiant uprising. Here we find the rebels in a completely hostile environment, hiding out on a remote ice planet where the terrain is almost uninhabitable. It does not take long to establish that the fight for freedom is far from over and the might of the Empire is closing in on the hidden rebel base. Following a devastating attack, the rebels are disbanded and relentlessly pursued by the Imperial Fleet lead by Darth Vader who is hell bent on capturing Luke Skywalker by any means necessary, much to the detriment of the Millennium Falcon's Captain Solo, co-pilot Chewbacca and passengers Princess Leia and C3PO.The outcome is a dramatic, magical, mysterious, sweeping action extravaganza that end's with a complete uncertainty for many of the character's plights.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The greatest blockbuster of all time.,"Simply put, The Empire Strikes back is virtually flawless, and easily my favorite film of all time. Combining the epic story, iconic characters, and wonderful imagination of the original Star Wars trilogy with the masterful character driven direction of Irvin Kershner results in a breathtaking cinematic experience. It can be considered a masterpiece all on its own, and this is in large part to the superior storytelling techniques on display.Empire Builds on the excellent original film with improved dialog that is consistently witty, and the character development is superb. As with all Star Wars films, the special effects are impressive and provide new exciting worlds to explore. The screenplay deserves credit for giving meaning to the entire trilogy, especially the scenes with Yoda, which get surprisingly deep in the psychological sense.This may also be the finest score John Williams has ever composed among a career full of them. In fact, this is fittingly one of the greatest scores composed for a motion picture. Every scene is done perfectly, with memorable musical cues for every character, and gives us such iconic themes as ""The Imperial March"" and the poignant love theme that beautifully closes the film.There is not a scene in Empire that doesn't serve its purpose effectively. The screenplay is one of the very best, balancing so much character driven story with a thrilling plot and one of the best twist endings ever. Every major character benefits from a strong dramatic story arc. The film is also remarkably effective at achieving a perfect balance of action, humor, tension, and romance. Often times credited with being almost too dark when compared to the other installments, Empire actually stands out as the Star Wars movie with the most genuine wit and humor. It features lots of comic relief, provided by not only the side characters but also with the ever engaging banter between Han Solo and Princess Leia, which adds a level of believability to the romantic subplot. The scenes between Han and Leia are some of the best ever captured in a major blockbuster such as this. Harrison Ford completely cements Han Solo as one of the coolest movie characters of all time in this film.This episode makes the most out of being the middle act in the trilogy by jumping almost immediately into an exciting battle with the attack on Hoth, and also features plenty of other action, such as the asteroid field chase (both again benefiting from the excellent score). The action on cloud city also serves as being refreshingly suspenseful in its simplicity. And as good as the earlier scenes are, the light saber duel between Dath Vader, the greatest movie villain of all time, and Luke Skywalker is a masterpiece in character driven action. So much is going on between the lines in Empire it would be impossible to fully cover it. Suffice to say that there is more accomplished in these scenes emotionally than in anything seen in the entire prequel trilogy. The ending of the film is, again, beautifully done, with its cliffhanger nature feeling strangely resolved and poetic.The spectacle of incredible effects, characters, and story all comes together in one incredible package, and makes The Empire Strikes Back one of the finest achievements in film history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Back and better than the original,"The Empire Strikes Back is in my opinion a superior movie to the original Star Wars.  Many true Star Wars fans would agree with me on this.  The characters, action, and overall plot of Empire is greater than its predecessor.  The ending is less predictable and is at the same time relevant to its title.  True, it's not as original as Star Wars because the basic aspects are similar and for that reason may not be regarded the ""greater"" movie, but I think that Empire at least attempts and in my opinion succeeds in breaking the old rule that sequels are never as good as the originals.  It is because of these reasons that The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Worthy successor,"I must imagine that making a sequel to 'Star Wars' must be like trying to follow Johnny Carson in the Tonight Show. How do you follow up an act that was so well received and set the standard so high? There is a such thing as warming up an audience. It's a totally different matter when you blow them away. In these days, when it is customary to believe that sequels have no chance to equal their predecessor, all one has to do is point to 'Empire Strikes Back' to reject that notion.The movie is so elegantly made and so vibrant in its creativity, it somehow finds a way to surpass its predecessor. 'Star Wars' opens its universe but 'Empire Strikes Back' enriches it. Yoda makes his appearance into popular culture. Luke discovers the truth of his family. And each character completes an arc that they merely began in the first movie. If 'Star Wars' is a movie about innocence, the naive farmer boy flying off to save the galaxy, then 'Empire Strikes Back' is a movie about how that innocence was lost. When happens when the party is over?It is well known that Mark Hamill was in a car accident before the filming of the sequel. The accident did extensive damage to his face, and many worried that he could not act the part of Luke Skywalker anymore. The result was that he created a far more mature version of Skywalker for the better of the franchise. He portrays Skywalker as a veteran of the rebellion, aged through fighting and no longer a naive boy.The making of 'Empire Strikes Back' was approached with artistry, which made it a much darker film than its predecessor. Not everyone appreciated the change, but no one could deny that it was a masterpiece, very dark and yet very human in its story telling. The scene I remember most comes near the end, when Darth Vader is staring out the window of his ship watching victory come within his grasp only to slip past him again.The audience cannot see any facial expressions because of his mask, but the pain of his loss is very perceptible. He is a worn soldier, scarred by evil but very desperate for what he wants. It is possible to pity him, which makes the complications of the story that much more compelling. I did not always love this movie. But that has changed. And I expect soon that more people will see that 'Empire Strikes Back' is the defining moment in the Star Wars saga.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A beginning,"I watched this movie for the first time in 1997 when they digitally improved it, as I am too young to have seen it on the cinema upon first viewing in 1980. I was 10 years old back then, and ever since then I have been very fond of science fiction as well as fantasy, history and the universe in general.This movie contained all the heroes, the villains, the action one could ever wish from a sci-fi movie, and the effects are still amazing today, in the age of computer-animated star ships and the like, as I noticed upon viewing it a few months ago.If you like sci-fi and have not yet seen this movie, you must have hid under a rock for past 26years. Even if you have already seen it you should get it, as it is a pillar stone in special effects and the good versus evil theme that has fascinated humans for so many generations.A good tenner for this movie! Two thumbs up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the saga is an understatement.,"The first instalment established the premise and the mythology of Star Wars, but the characterisation is defined in Empire Strikes Back. Often regarded as the quintessential sequel, Empire Strikes Back emphasises more depth with the characters depicted through emotional dilemmas.The ideology of the force is also implied with much more significance this time around as opposed to the brief exposition addressed in A New Hope. The training sequences with Yoda are among the best in the saga, exploring a variety of relevant themes and various aspects of the force, notably the contrast between light and dark.Han and Leia's chemistry was one of the film's highlights. No dialogue came off as cliché or stilted and Harrison Ford's improvisation during the ""I love you scene"" on his iconic line ""I know"" was significantly more impactful as opposed to the initial scripted exchange of ""I love you too.""Darth Vader is also more compelling in Empire, with the tension paying off with the final climax, resulting in one of the most iconic scenes in cinematic history.For a film so close to perfection, minor flaws should be noticeable. As much as I love C3P0, some of his comic relief, notably in the Bespin segments, came off as forced and inconsistent.Regardless, Empire Strikes Back is a masterpiece and one of my favourite movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Dark Side compels you to see this movie!,"Most sci-fi fans, and just plain ol' SW fans agree:  This movie is the best of the original trilogy.  I have yet to see attack of the Clones, but if TESB is any indication AotC will be the best of the prequel trilogy.  The Empire Strikes back provides much more action than the first, and provides some much more interesting landscapes than Tatooine did.  Bespin provides a nice look into the technology and spledor of the SW universe.  The introduction of Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian pays off big, as the audience is given a better development of Han Solo.  In addition, the character development continues, and gives more insight into the desperation of the Rebel Alliance.  The Battle of Hoth is very well done, and easily outdoes the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Endor.  If, for some reason you have been living on the moon for the past 22 years, SILENTLY get a copy and watch it, for the ending is one that no man should be told in advance.

Larger than life battles such as the Hoth invasion and the final lightsaber duel between father and son strike this film home and being bigger and better than the original, with a darker and more brooding villainous plot that leads into the third chapter of the saga, it keeps viewers entertained and captivated.

With this movie comes the end of the adventures, the agony and the expectation of what it's going to happen.In this movie everything ends with only one winner and who is going to be? Luke Skywalker or the Dark Lord? If you want to now the end of this movie you have to see it...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Continuation of a Wonderful Trilogy,"When it comes to sequels, I strongly believe that everyone gets an empty feeling in their stomach. There can always be a misfire when it comes to the next chapter of a saga, and this one was one of those films that worried many, many fans. At the same time, however, it was very anticipated. ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" ranks as my second favorite ""Star Wars"" film, following closely behind ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"". Most fans would disagree with my arrangement of favorites, yet I don't believe any would disagree with this film getting an outrageous score. That's right. ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" is--simply put--phenomenal. Everything from the scale of the film to the sets to the acting to the writing has improved from the original film.The rebel alliance, at the beginning of this film, are relocated in an icy planet called Hoth. As they wait for Luke to return from his scouting, Han Solo goes on the rescue to save Luke, whom was captured and nearly eaten by a polar bear-like monstrosity. After they return to the rebel base, the Empire locates the rebels with a droid sent to Hoth, and then they invade the area, attempting to find Luke Skywalker and his friends. The base is destroyed, but now Luke must go to Dagoba, in search for Jedi Master Yoda so that he may begin his Jedi training.Once again, Mark Hammill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher (along with every single actor from the original film) make a return for this enormously exciting sequel. However, their performances have taken a huge step upward, crafting one of the best character-based films ever created. This time around, you can practically cut the tension in the air with a lightsaber because of these stupendous performances. It seems like every actor became one with their character even moreso than in the original phenomenon.Another huge step forward was the writing. George Lucas may have created the prequel films in later years, but there is no denying that his writing was extravagant in this particular film. ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" has a deep message along with a--what I consider, at least--better storyline, along with better character arcs. Lucas outdid himself with this screenplay. This film also included one of the most shocking plot twists in film history, and it changed ""Star Wars"" fans forever. This particular scene also became the most quoted line in cinema history, seeing as how revolutionary it had become.One more surprise with this film is that the special effects have gotten ten times better than the original. Everything about this film is perfect, to a tee, when it comes to the special effects. We even get a real lightsaber fight this time around, clocking in at about fifteen minutes long. I wasn't near being born when this film came out, but everyone tells me that this lightsaber battle was so intense that they couldn't control themselves at the the theatres. Even the space scenes look real. The detailing of the scale models used for spaceships were extensive and edgy.""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" is just too perfect. The film was way beyond its time of release, and that is an absolute mouthful.My rating for ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a complete, well-deserved ten-out-of-ten stars.I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.May the force be with you! God bless, and Merry Christmas!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Solid sequel,"I saw ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" in the the theater. I saw the ""Special Edition"" in the theater too. I've seen it many times at home. Every time I watch ""The Empire Strikes Back"" I remember how the audience reacted. I remember when they laughed and I remember when they cheered. Few movies can bring be back to the theater experience like this movie. I don't watch ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as much as I watch the original Star Wars but I still have seen it a bunch of times. It's always an easy watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"7.2/10 - More Character Driven, Dark, Well-Paced","Moving forward from A New Hope, I now arrived at the most beloved Star Wars film to ever exist (most likely to ever will) - The Empire Strikes Back. I thought that the previous movie was pretty nice, but apparently I should've had liked it more because I got quite a bit of noises of disagreement from friends, so yeah. With hopes to like this one more, I pressed the play button and watched it. Let's dive into it, then.The Empire Strikes Back starts at a low point for the rebellion - now they're the ones hiding, being hunted by the empire, and despite having a magnificent victory against the death star recently, they, and especially young Luke Skywalker, still face more danger than they ever had before. Will Luke manage to shake off his pride and become a true Jedi, or will he succumb to the euphoria of his previous victories and fail everyone he cares about?I'd say that one major change from A New Hope to Empire is the main focus - in the previous movie I felt like the focus was on the worldbuilding (which makes sense, considering the fact that it was the start of a big franchise), and now the story feels much more character - driven. It's not like suddenly we're at a best-psychological-thriller-of-all-time levels, but I just feel like there's more focus on personality and flaws - especially with Luke and Han - which I like quite a bit. Also, Yoda is such a fun character here, both as an indicator to show us Luke's personality, and just as himself, too. He's really fun all around.One more thing that's an improvement over the previous film, I'd say, is the cinematography. Just the compositions of each shot, the darker color grading, the more mature aesthetic. I like that, and I'd also say with that that the action scenes got so much better here, pulling you into the movie more, with more engaging choreography and more slowburn moments.The pacing, which was one of my main issues with A New Hope, is much better here, more tight and consistent. Throughout the entire film, or almost the entirety of it, there's a good balance of drama and comedy, and I never felt straight-up bored, with each scene having just enough clever script and interesting scenarios to keep me interested. So yeah, definitely an improvement on that front.The John Williams score is still great, of course, and here he adds the brooding, dark and epic Imperial March - definitely deserves to be considered as iconic as it is, and a fine addition to an already great score.Just like with the previous film, though, things here don't have impact on me as much as they do on other people. Yeah, it's an improvement on all fronts, but still not enough to blow my socks off, to make me fall in love with the franchise, to truly win me over. Sorry, y'all. Also, the Leia and Han thing that's going on in this movie has some good moments, but it has some moments that felt a little too cliché for me, or a little too forced. Either way, yeah, I think you get the gist of it - I think this is an improvement, but still far from the masterpiece I was told it is.Sorry to disappoint you, folks, but I have to conclude it that way: The Empire Strikes Back is a big improvement over the previous film, but still didn't amaze me. It's good, more mature, I like the way it focuses on character arcs more, and it's more well-made overall, but it's still far from a masterpiece. Feeling a 7.2/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Best Of All The Star Wars Movies,"The most accomplished film of the whole Star Wars series. Not only is the plot more interesting-darker and technically intriguing-but for once in the Star Wars prequels, the performances are interesting and have at least enough depth to complement the plot.If you have not seen the film, do not read on!! Many set pieces within the film spring to mind, most noteably the battle on Hoth, where the whiteness invades the screen creating a beautiful visceral backdrop for the jaw dropping action. And, of course the revelation that Darth Vader is Luke's Father. Not only is this as big a twist as an avid film fan will find anywhere in film history, but the lightsaber battle involving Father and Son excites and involves the viewer like few movie head to heads ever screened.Overall, it excels Episode IV on plot (although the original lays out the blue prints) and performances, and although Jedi presents us with some phenomenal showboating from Lucas, I simply have to prioritise Empire for it's blackness, it's humour and it's ability to actually involve you with the characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A timeless masterpiece of cinematic storytelling,"Irvin Kershner's *Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back* stands as one of the greatest sequels in cinematic history, elevating George Lucas' original vision to new heights. Darker, deeper, and more emotionally resonant, this chapter expands the *Star Wars* saga with a rich tapestry of character development, breathtaking visuals, and unforgettable moments.Mark Hamill shines as Luke Skywalker, whose journey to understand the Force leads him to the enigmatic Yoda, a character brought to life with incredible detail and charm. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher deliver iconic performances as Han Solo and Princess Leia, their chemistry fueling a romance that adds emotional stakes to the galaxy-spanning conflict. Meanwhile, Darth Vader's menacing presence is amplified, solidifying him as one of cinema's most legendary villains.The visual effects remain groundbreaking, with sequences like the Battle of Hoth and the cloud city of Bespin demonstrating the film's innovative spirit. John Williams' legendary score is at its most powerful here, with the haunting *Imperial March* becoming synonymous with the franchise.At its heart, *The Empire Strikes Back* is a story of struggle and perseverance, delving into themes of identity, betrayal, and hope. The narrative's unexpected twists, including one of the most famous revelations in film history, ensure its place as a benchmark of storytelling excellence.This is a film for anyone who loves adventure, heart, and a dash of the unexpected.

"Dark, moving, and enthralling.","The Empire Strikes Back is the easily the best Star Wars movie.This is mainly due to the amazing script by Lawrence Kasdan. It presents the movie in a much darker context than its predecessor. ""The galactic empire is hunting down the rebels"" is all you need to know about this movie. You are taken in by the vulnerable yet relatable characters, the overall journey of Luke Skywalker, and the amazing special effects which look better than some sfx in 2014.

One of the best in the history of film sequels!,"I liked this film a lot over other movie sequels, and among the Star Wars films this one is the second best to The Phantom Menace. With a huge success like A New Hope, making a sequel worthy to it was very tough...unless the makers put their mind to it...and they did. George Lucas did not direct this and he found a great direct with Irvin K. who made this film more human in nature than the first film. In fact, character expression here is the best and so is the character development...both the best in the series. You get to see just how natural the relationship of Leia and Han develop, you get to see more emotion, feel pain (like when Han got tortured or when Luke learned who Darth Vader is), and so much more.

The ending was satisfactory and compelling with a few loose ends, which made me impatient and restless about how things will unfold in the future (even though I already know). Add to that the Romance, it was the cherry on the top for me. I love Hann Solo. I absolutely I adore his character development, and the tension between him and Leia Was EVERYTHING.

The very best STAR WARS there is.,"My Take: Bigger and surprisingly deeper, this visual fest still stands as the finest offering under the label of STAR WARS.The first ""Star Wars"" is, like what Shakespeare would say, such a palpable hit, that making a sequel will indeed be a big challenge, even for a man who has it all, George Lucas. Yet, Lucas succeeded. ""Empire Strikes Back"" is better than the first film, and that's a great achievement enough. Making a sequel to one of the hardest things, perhaps, even to the most prolific or talented of directors. ""Empire Strikes Back"" rivals and precedes it's predecessor by throwing in a lot of visuals. But stunning visuals that outdo everything in the original isn't just what the public demands. By the time EMPIRE STRIKES BACK hit screens, STAR WARS has already caught with the public. Everyone knows who these characters are. Now, all that's left there is to know who they really are. If STAR WARS is the introduction, EMPIRE is what George Lucas must have really had in mind.Lucas was wise to pass the directorial reigns to Irvin Kershner, a director who knows how to direct, and use his imagination thru filming. I've seen Kershner's other films, and I must say, they're all evident in ""Empire"". The plot this time centers more deeply on an every-growing political conflict. The Republic forces, hiding from a temporarily retreating Galactic Empire, are planning there next attempt on the Imperial forces. Led of course by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), the forces are settling on a secret base on an uncharted planet. The evil Darth Vader (Dave Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) bares a grudge on young Skywalker (after events in the first film), and vows vengeance. After a sudden attack by Imperial Forces at the Rebel base (a visual-effects spectacle), young Luke must follow his very destiny. Now, this is where the real events in the ""Star Wars"" series really turns. At this point, Lucas has earned his place in Hollywood for his terrific storytelling talents.I wouldn't dream to tell the entire story, for I'm not that kind of film reviewer. But I'm pretty sure, you've seen this by now. Be that any version, you definitely have. Lucas has issued enough DVD or video versions of this film to make you see it. Remembering watching ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and the other ""Star Wars"" films when I was a kid is a key to actually enjoying them now. These kind of films are just plain terrific spectacles. One, that Hollywood movies today should be. Pure spectacle in special-effects and visuals and also in plot and story. How many blockbusters are still made this way?THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is probably the best STAR WARS there is. Riveting, exciting, fun but what deeply surprises is the depth and storytelling. Wherever George Lucas may have gone nowadays, we always have EMPIRE to remind us how he, or anyone, used to make 'em.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Empire Strikes Back, And They Strike Back Hard","Out of the four Star Wars films (Only Episodes 1,4,5,and 6 existed when this was written) I feel that this is the most philosophical of the group.  The scenes with Yoda and Luke remind me of those old kung fu movies with the wise, old master teaching the Art (or in this case the Ways of the Force) to his young and inexperienced disciple.   Those scenes and the battle between Luke and Darth Vader are pure classics.Despite this, I did not place this part at the top of my list of ""Best Star Wars Movie.""  After seeing Episode 4, where the underdog Rebels rise up against incredible odds to defeat the all powerful Empire in a beautifully done space battle, Episode 5 seemed to be sharp turn towards the opposite direction.  Han gets captured, frozen in carbonite, and transported to Jabba; the Empire beats the crap out of the Rebels time and time again; Luke gets his hand hacked off; and Darth Vader reveals that he is Luke's father. Totally different than the episode before it.Those who have seen the first one (Episode IV for those who don't know) and haven't seen the second one (Episode V) then I have just this to say...SHAME ON YOU!  But seriously, be wary.  It is not called, The Empire Strikes Back for nothing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best movie ever made!!!!!,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best movie of all time. Star Wars (A New Hope) and Return of the Jedi are both amazing but they don't match up to this masterpiece. First of all, The Empire Strikes Back has the best acting of any of the three. Harrison Ford is perfect for the role of Han Solo and creates most of the character atmosphere. Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher also give out solid performances as their characters change through out the entire movie. I also believe that Darth Vader's part in this one is a bit bigger then the other two.The second best thing in this landmark for movie making is the eye popping special effects. You get to see land battles, ships flying through asteroid belts, and much, much more.(The fighting scene on the planet Hoth at the beginning is the best!) Even the sound in this film is outstanding! Did I mention how good the sound track is? Because it was great, especially the empire tune, which will easily get stuck in your head!If I wanted to I could go on and on and on, so I'm only going to say this once; If you see one movie in you entire life, this is the one!

for me it was Episode I (screen) (vhs) (dad),"Back to summer 80, this was the 2nd movie our parents took us to watch on a big screen and the next day, i got fever because i had been so impressed by this scary bad robot guy ! But things get better soon because i became a avid player of Kenner SW toys and keep making stories with them up to 1987 In a way, this movie (like the 2 others) has imprint my imagination like no others : it was like i got new cells in my brain or 2 more eyes while this universe was as deep inside me as in a galaxy far away And remember, in the 80s, we didn't have the tapes, books, articles and digital things to go on : so the audience was really left alone with its memories !Maybe it's because this movie has mythological stuff, or a Zen director (Kershner) or a incredible cast (Harrison, Mark & Carrie were the Harry, Ron and Hermione of our time) but at the end, it's a amazing space Odyssey from ice planet, to asteroids, to a swamp forest and a luminous city in the air ! Even today no movie can offer such exotic Scifi and that's why i got always a special vibration watching it, and in addition today, it's the special edition !Like Episode IV, the picture is superb with sharp colors ! The new Wampa left me cold while Cloud city is really beautiful : like my previous reviews, we can catch Lucas in deep lying as he sounds like he had all the details right from the start while he found them all along the way ! Also done last time, the radical hero (Luke) goes on with his brainwashing : On Dagobah, he enrolls in a school to forget all the things he learns so far and accepts the only truth ! For sure, his own feelings are forbidden and he must obey the master !

Best film in the trilogy,"After I've watched Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, I started to watched the second movie of the original trilogy and it's considered the best film of the series, its Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.It stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, David Prowse, Billy Dee Williams, Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, etc.The story of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and the others didn't end with the destruction of the Death Star - it continues in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Imperial forces have since driven the Rebels to hide on the ice world Hoth. But even on such an icy, backwater world, they cannot escape the wicked Darth Vader's eye for long, and he devastates the Rebel base in an assault with the gigantic AT-AT walkers. Luke flees to Dagobah to begin Jedi Knight training with Yoda, while Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia and C-3PO run the blockade of Imperial Star Destroyers in the Millennium Falcon. The Imperials pursue them across the galaxy and eventually catch up with them at Bespin. Now Darth Vader plans to use them as bait to lure Luke Skywalker to him, and turns Han Solo over to Boba Fett as a prize to be delivered to crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Luke learns a terrible family secret after losing a swordfight with Vader. Will he - and the others - escape the Empire's clutches?Since the first and the third film made changes to the special editions, I did not see anything that was changed, except for the backgrounds in Cloud City.Probably after this review, I'll review the final film of the original trilogy, Star Wars Episode VI: The Return of the Jedi.This is another great film along with the other Star Wars movies.

Best Star Wars Movie - EVER.,"This is the movie that defined the Imperials.  It is clearly the best Star Wars movie because the effects and gadgets were used just to enhance the setting, not tell the story.

Formidable 5th entry in the stars wars saga...,"1st watched 7/23/2005 - (Dir-Irvin Kershner): 6 out of 10 Formidable 5th entry in the stars wars saga, keeps the story moving pretty nicely with good character building of the friendships between the main three and add a 4th in Lando Calrissian who can only be somewhat trusted. Introduced are many well-done stop motion animation sequences and Yoda created by the Jim Henson people and the voice being his counterpart, Frank Oz. What this movie does(which was originally the 2nd star wars film) is takes the good formula of the space cowboys epic and gets you to care about the people involved. A nice little love triangle is hinted at between Leia, Han and Luke and the bantering between the stars seems more natural than in the 1st movie. We are also setup for the next entry with a rather hokey ending but nevertheless the movie, for the most part, is fun like the original with slightly different settings, and the same battle between the good side of the force(the rebels) and the dark side(the empire) with Darth Vader taking over greater control and becoming more obsessed with his personal issues(mainly the turning of Luke to the dark side). We know this battle will continue and this movie helps us look forward to this if nothing else.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the first for sure!,"Although the First Star Wars movie was fun and full of action, I found that there was a certain depth that was lacking that could have made the film go a bit further. In ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" we see a little bit more character development in all the main characters. We see Luke's internal conflict with the dark side of the force, Han Solo's love for Princess Leia, and Leia's stubbornness but reciprocated love for Han Solo. We see that Darth Vader is evil, but not as pure evil as we might have expected in the first movie. Overall, the Empire Strikes Back goes one step further and not only goes into the back story behind each character, but also their psychology as well. It makes for an interesting watch, and with slightly better visual effects, also makes for a better film than the first instalment of the Star Wars saga.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Perfect blend of sci-fi and fantasy.  Light years above the other Star Wars pictures.,"How do you follow up the most successful science fiction/fantasy film of all time? Make a sequel that's bigger and better than the original. Not only is The Empire Strikes Back better than A New Hope, but it completely blows it out of the water. The first Star Wars film started it all and paved the way for the second installment, but essentially it was a fairly bland and simple space adventure with great special effects. Return of the Jedi, which followed The Empire Strikes Back, was also a weaker film. Empire is clearly the best film of the original trilogy. So much in fact it transcends the other films and it's easy to appreciate the film out of the context of the Star Wars universe. While the first film was too cartoonish and the third too unbalance, the second hit exactly the right note. The story picks up several years after A New Hope. The Death Star is destroyed and the rebels are hiding at their base on the ice planet of Hoth. The Empire is hot on their trail with a zealous Darth Vader combing the galaxy in search of them. From the very start of the movie it's one big giant chase. Unlike the other two films, Empire gets the big battle out of the way in the beginning so that it can slowly build down until the climax. It's a reversal of the typical adventure film arc and it works perfectly. In Empire all of the characters are fleshed out and become as real people, whereas in A New Hope they just served the storyline. There's the classic Greek mythology pathos going on with the battle between good and evil. There are also many shades of gray in the film, as the characters drift in out and of good and evil, and face difficult decisions. Out of the entire trilogy the middle film also features the most impressive and elaborate sets. Over the course of two hours we are taken into four different worlds, the ice planet Hoth, the swamp world of Dagobah, an asteroid field in space, and Cloud City. All four locales are entirely impressive. The lighting is another key factor in the film's vibrant look. Lighting becomes the most flamboyant towards the end of the film during the dusk looking scenes at Cloud City. Finally something must be said of the epic lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader that makes up the film's climax. It's the best duel in any of the films. Storywise there's a lot on the line, but it's choreographed and filmed so well it wouldn't matter how it ties into the story. It's the dirtiest and grungiest of all the duels. It's nice to actually see the physical effects of fighting for a change. In the other films the characters are pretty much stoic but here we get to see Luke grow out of breath, tire, bleed, and have his cloths torn. He stumbles around, expresses emotion, and even gets a few nice on-uppers on Vader when he's underestimated. Ultimately it's a wonderful way to finish a great film. Also I should mention the good performances from Billy Dee Williams, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Terrors. And I wouldn't have it any other way. To start, the production values can not be beat- there is care and craftsmanship in every frame. The filmmakers put together a fully realized world that seems very close to ours. And there's plenty of interesting action to move the story along. Exotic locations serve as a backdrop to the action and we think we've never seen this world before, but we're immediately comfortable there. And the actors at last seem comfortable in the characters, if they are living in fiction, then they believe it- there is angst and passion and humor and sarcasm and it all fits.

Love It!!,"Since this movie has been out like forever and there are over zillion of review on this I will keep my review to the minimum I could and try to review it as the person that watch this movie in the 21st century.I don't know if this happen to you but it always happen to me; whenever I watch a trilogy I always get that feeling the second movie (the middle) is just the movie they have created to make the movie longer and cash in some extra money from its viewer and I also find most of the sequel do not live up the first and the last. Luckily this is not the case with The Empire Strikes Back, I enjoy it even more so any other episode of Star Wars. There is so much transition between the first and this, and I mean the good one. I don't feel like I'm just watching another stepping stone kind of movie so that I could understand the third.The Empire Strikes Back has solved the entire problem that was there on the Episode IV, the best part was the storyline which has just the right pace of action and drama. We get the chance to know the character much better when compare to the first which everything seem to be in rush. You will get the chance to know many new characters specially the person that taught Obi Wan – Yoda. The bad part was, it is not really a surprise anymore since I watch it in the 21st century – I already know who Luke's father was, who is Yoda, who is Princess Leia and so on, but come to think of it, it must have been exciting and really surprise to know ""Luke I'm your father"" one of the famous catch phrase.Anyway I wanted to let people to know that this is an awesome flick, and definitely a must watch. Man, this is 30 years old and still – it is a classic, never get old. The graphic is even better than some of the movie you can find today. Glad George Lucas has gut to let other people carry on his work when he knows he is not good enough to do it on his own.Recommendation: Definitely Worth Every Penny for Its Blue Rays.Reason to Watch: One of the Most Entertaining Sci-Fi of All Time.Rating: 9/10 (Grade: A)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
By far the best Star Wars movie,"""Empire Strikes Back"" is a wonderful example of how much better a movie can be when it's not directed by George Lucas.  Lucas, as witnessed by most of his movies, including the latest ""Phantom Menace,"" is a genius at creating astonishing imageries and forming a spectacular visual setting for the storyline to work through.  However, as far as storytelling goes, Irwin Kershner does so much better.There are two reasons why this should be considered the best of all three; oh no wait, four, if you count ""The Phantom Mess,"" which I'm still bitter about for the fact that it will forever remain as a part of the Star Wars saga -- one drop of ink will make the entire vat of water black, and that's what happened.  Anyway, the first reason: The storytelling is amazing.  It was appropriately paced and appropriately lengthy.  It does much better development of later plot lines than any of the other movies.  The romance between Solo and Leia, for example, is done ever so gently and craftily. Luke is finally acting like a decent actor, as his character goes through major transformation from a reckless, brash jedi wannabe to a man whose identity was completely turned upside down.  And what about Darth Vader, the greatest villain in cinematic history?  You see him here more as a guile, manipulative, tactical, and extremely intelligent character than Episode IV, where he was much more machinelike and brute.And to me, the ending of this movie had so much more drama than the other two; oh, I mean three, I guess (grr...).  One of the most captivating, significant, and shocking lines in movie history, ""Luke, I am your father!"" still sends shivers and jolt through my body.  This is where everything is revealed, and all of the questions presented implicitly in the first Star Wars are answered.Second, this was simply the most difficult one to make, and you have to give due credit to writers, directors, and produces for that (yes, that includes Lucas).  This transition is done ever so perfectly, and that is why I consider this movie a notch better than all others.  Well, that is, if you don't by the fact that it is flat-out the best movie anyway.If you have not seen any Star Wars movies yet.  Start watching from Episode IV, NOT I!  It will make more sense to do so.  Oh, by the way, here's how I rank the Star Wars movies.Star Wars: ***1/2; Empire Strikes Back: ****; Return of the Jedi: ***; (and yeah yeah, The Phantom Menace: **)I'm just praying Episode II is better than the previous!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Sequel to the first famous movie,"Somehow this second movie in the series feels better. Less of a messy movie, but more of an adventure sci-fi with new characters both the master of Darth Vader and Yoda are seen in this movie which has a bit more of a Lord of the Rings and Labyrinth (David Bowie) kinda feelings.The princess from previous movie doesn't feel princess anymore, but more a crew member, although her cool outfits have been sacrificed for this change. The droids from previous movie feel more in place.

The Absolute Best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I saw ""The Empire Strikes Back"" first when it came out in the Special Edition. I didn't expect to like it, so you can imagine my surprise. The entire film blew me away. I was amazed by the emotional impact. Princess Leia became a role model, Han Solo became an object of lust. I knew before seeing it, I wanted a career in movies, but this one helped me make up my mind for certain. I used to have over 10 different favorite movies, including West Side Story and Rebel Without A Cause, but I found that Empire left me breathless every time. In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is the best cinematic experience in history, and will remain the best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
You Can't Beat Empire,"Declaring The Empire Strikes Back to be the best of the Star Wars Trilogy is not a unique opinion.  But then it clearly is the best, even allowing for the fact that without episodes 4 and 6 the whole thing would make little sense.Ultimately it is the deepest and darkest of the three films, with impressive Character development, especially Luke on his Jedi training and the gradual blossoming of the relationship between Leia and Han.  Comic relief comes in the golden form of C3P0 always ready to regale his human superiors with some paranoid babbling about the perils of evading the Empire.Some may think that there is more talking than the other films but then that's the price you pay for plot development, more of this would have been nice in Phantom Menace. The big revelation that Vader is Luke's father turns the triology on it's head. Yet with the Snow Battle, the asteroid chase, the manic storming of the bridge of a Star Destroyer and the Light Sabre conflict between Luke and Vader in the dark recesses of Cloud City we are hardly being short changed of high budget Hollywood action.The inconclusive finale may have been somewhat may have caused a little frustration back in 1980 but that is part of the films strength, meaning it can play out it's plot and character development without having to hurry the story to fit in with the confines of one movie.The Empire Strikes Back is by no means brain surgery, though for elegant science fiction thrills and visionary fantasy with just enough humour you can't go wrong.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
You know what? I didn't like it!,"I wasn't planning to comment on this movie, but after reading nothing but good from all the others, I decided to give you my opinion anyway. The story (if you can speak of one)in this movie is very boring. There isn't any tention-building or climax whatsoever. The movie just stops after 2 hours. There is hardly any character building, and to my opinion there aren't many strong personalities. The only character that has won my sympathy is Han Solo,(Harrison Ford) but after being frozen he just disappears out of the movie, and noone seems to care about him anymore. Luke Skywalker is a w***er who is supposed to be a jedi knight, but instead he needs to be rescued all the time. I wouldn't have cared less if he had crashed in his plane, had been eaten by that snowmonster, had frozen to death, he got shot by the ATATs, if his father had killed him, or he had fallen of that tower. The music score is well composed, though I think a classical symphony isn't very suitable for a sci-fi movie. I believe they should have used synthetic music to create the right atmosphere. On the other hand the effects and sceneries are very impressive. Unbelieve what effort George and his guys have done!6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"One of the Best Sequels in Movie History, and Sets the Bar for Future Entries","Empire Strikes Back starts with a bumpy plot, dialogue, cinematography, and acting. But as the movie progresses, you start to feel that it's a masterpiece. From the beginning of the Battle of Hoth, the movie elevates as it goes on. Every scene feels more mature than what comes before it. The music is perfect in every sense; in fact, it makes the stakes feel more elevated. Darth Vader proves to be the best villain in cinema history, while our protagonists feel much more mature and developed than in 'A New Hope'. For an 80's film, Empire Strikes Back is shot magnificently, and some shots look and feel as modern as most blockbusters today. The performances are a big improvement; every actor or actress plays his or her part extraordinarily, mainly because the characters are put through challenging obstacles. The film drags at some moments, such as the asteroid worm scene, which takes you out of the movie for moments. Everything else earns the movie a deserved ""Movie of the decade"" award (at least from fans).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pure Brilliance,"This movie was a work of art as was the trilogy. It is a trilogy that we will never see the likes of again (though Godfather 1-3 and the Lord of the Rings trilogy have there place in cinema history as well).Captivating, breathtaking, awesome, etc. are the words I'd use to describe this movie. There is the intergalactic battle, and the epic battle of good versus evil, light versus dark, and even better: father versus son. The story was magical and real, and the special effects were nothing short of visual perfection.Lucas did a magnificent job in turning us to a new chapter in the Skywalker story in great style, glory and cohesion. He did not miss a beat. So much was revealed in this episode: about the force, about being a jedi, about Luke, Vader, and more.The heroes were not perfect, nor supermen, as was evident by the capture of Han Solo. And the villain was duly portrayed as calculating and ruthless without being so over the top that you hated him. In fact, you couldn't help but respect Darth Vader, because as cold hearted as he was, he still held on to the ancient way of the Jedi and believed in the Force.From opening credits to closing credits this movie was a masterpiece and not enough can be said about it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Impressive,"Visually, this is easily the best of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. There are reasons for that. For instance, the ridiculous little puppets meant to act as alien creatures. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" uses them the least. And one of them is so surprisingly good in both how it looks and how the plot handles it this creature with big ears feels real and is a great addition to the big picture. Then there are the special effects and the sets that, obviously, were made in a time when making them was a much harder process than in the twenty-first century, but they look real. All this physical material ages well. Even the ""special editions"" are not an obstacle.The plot is structured in a different way than the one from three years earlier. It does not have that clear line between the loud and the quiet parts of the story. Different things are not placed far from one another. They are numerous and aren't given as much room to breathe as the last time. The overall tone of the picture is, apparently, the reason for many to regard ""Episode V"" as the best in the whole franchise. It is dark and bold for a mainstream movie, which isn't something you often find.Still, there are things to criticize, like the battle on the ice planet. Of course, it is beautiful, but the design of the imperial walking machines, as menacing as it may look, makes no sense. They are big, clumsy and slow. Then there is the plot itself. We have this huge imperial fleet of colossal starships with great firepower chasing one little rebel ship because the person in charge of that fleet wants to get their hands on one particular rebel person. Of course, the prior movie is proof enough of how important that one young rebel fighter is, but still, how about the rest of the rebel fleet? The movie has it in the beginning and at the very end. For the most part it is ignored. Of course, one can say that this isn't exactly science fiction, which is correct. But the dark and seemingly serious tone of the picture and some of the stupidity in the plot are not good friends.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Golden Middle Child,"There's a reason that sequels of a certain breed are complimented as going the ""Empire Strikes Back"" route. Often described as 'bigger, better and darker', it's certainly an appropriate description of Empire. It succeeds by taking the most successful elements of A New Hope and minimising its weaknesses, while expanding the world.The main cast of Episode IV returns for Empire, with the major additions being Billy Dee Williams as Lando and Frank Oz providing the voice and charming puppeteer work for Yoda. Wisely, Lucas handed over the direction to Irvin Kershner, who takes up the helm admirably, and Lawrence Kasdan tightens up the screenplay. The latter especially improves the dialogue immensely. Regardless, its a slick production at its finest, with the effects, both CGI and practical, improving as well- the puppet-work being a standout for Yoda's simple yet delightful presence.Empire's narrative suffers typically from middle-film syndrome, serving primarily as continuation and set up. As such, it lacks a coherent beginning and the cathartic climax of the finale. But in doing so, it skips lengthy exposition and avoids the responsibility of tying up the loose ends. As such, it gets to indulge in its traits. Part of Empire's success is how it jumps from set piece to set piece with nary a quiet moment. From Hoth, through the asteroid field, to the finale in the clouds, it rarely lets up. And the few quiet moments either ratchet up the tension (the cloud city), or succeed in intriguing world building (Yoda on Dagobah). What is essentially a glorified training montage works through the interaction between Luke and Yoda and excellent atmospheric cinematography.What is often forgotten, simply from cultural osmosis, is that Empire contains a twist ending. Its such common knowledge that its sometimes forgotten that it even is a twist ending. Nevertheless, it's a sucker-punch that still has a kick even without the shock.Empire does so very little wrong. The characters are memorable, the set pieces are iconic. There's a strong argument for the Luke-Vader duel being the finest fight scene in the entire saga. While it lacks the extravagant stunt choreography of the prequels, the fight has a rawness to it that later flamboyant fights fail to match. And the emotional tension between the characters makes one really interested.It's often said to be the most morally ambiguous film, as part of its 'darker' theme. It is likely true, and certainly touches upon these issues. But to say this is only to bring attention to how idealistic Star Wars as a whole is- a betrayal is almost instantly redeemed, and the importance of friendship is at the fore. And it benefits from being able to set up conflicts without having to solve them.Certainly, it's only real flaw is its middle-child issues. It doesn't plod, but it's still merely placing pieces in position. Chekov's guns are cocked. But damn if it isn't a blast while it does it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The actors are much more comfortable in their roles and there is a natural quality to their discourse. I recall the incredible machinery that must be faced by the heroes.

The pacing of the story is excellent to the extent that the viewer is never bored as the action just keeps on coming.

In no other Star Wars film does the audience learn more about the main characters then in The Empire Strikes Back.It should be mentioned that Yoda in particular is a remarkable creation as he is very interesting as a character as well as being very original in design. In Empire, the direction is first rate as is the acting which is a complement that one cannot honestly pay any of the other Star Wars films. In The Empire Strikes Back, the audience not only gets the usual  dose of action that is expected in a Star Wars film but also a healthy dose of romance and spiritualism as well.

The Best Action Sci-fi Movie Ever Made,"This is by far the best movie in the Star Wars Saga. Irvin Kershner is far superior to George Lucas as a director, because he takes the film seriously. By looking at the prequels it is apparent that if George had control of this film it would have been a lighthearted ""Kids Movie"". This movie is the most dark in the saga, and deals with real emotions and questions. Kershner details the plot, character and mood with beautiful elegance and subtlety. The score is amazing. The action is tense and epic, despite the lack of thousands of CGI robots. The message is deeper and in my opinion is the only Star Wars movie that really gets you thinking in a deep way. Make no mistake, this isn't just a popcorn-munching movie, it is something altogether more important. It is really one of the few movies that extremely successfully mixes nail-biting excitement, epic action and character into a true masterpiece of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Easily the greatest of the ""Star Wars"" saga...","This is probably the greatest sequel to ever come out of Hollywood. Continuing the story of the Rebellion against the Galactic Empire, this film takes place a few years after the destruction of the Death Star. Darth Vader hunts for the hidden Rebels while Luke is given the task to continue his Jedi training under the guide of Yoda. This film takes a darker, more mature path than its predecessor.Irvin Kershner takes the reigns of this film, with George Lucas producing. I personally believe Kershner did an standout job with the characters in this film (and it seems like he had a blast while doing it). The film-making team in this movie really works and I only wish they had gotten together to make the prequel trilogy. The visuals in this movie are some of most gorgeous I've seen (or maybe I'm just biased). My eyes still grow wide every time I watch the scenes on the ice planet, Hoth.The entire cast from ""Star Wars"" returns for the sequel. Once again, we are treated to excellent performances from Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, etc. This film also marks the introduction of Billy Dee Williams to the series as Han's friend Lando Calrissian, and Frank Oz as Yoda. As there is a lot more dialogue in this movie (especially between Luke and Yoda), it is important to really care for these characters. This is made easy as the movie pulls you right in, engrossing you in the storyline.Though sequels are generally looked down upon, it is movies like this that show that there is hope for them. This is easily the best of the trilogy. While I wish I had more to say for ""The Empire Strikes Back"", I find myself with very little. For those who are new to the series, be sure to watch ""A New Hope"" first, but know that you have a lot to look forward to in the sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Trumps A New Hope, but both a damn near perfect","As argued by Dante and Randal in Kevin Smith's slacker classic Clerks, the question of whether A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back is the better movie is one of cinema's most popular debates. Episode IV's introduction to George Lucas' world of aliens, droids and intergalactic war struck a chord with audiences back in 1977, and continues to do so today. It is a fun good vs. evil story that only touches upon the spiritual elements of the 'Force' that we now know so well, and on the vastness of the universe it is set within. Personally, I have to agree with Dante's argument that Empire offers a darker and richer experience, which not only develops the series' mythology even further, but paints its characters with far more layers than seen before.We no doubt have George Lucas' lack of involvement in the film's development for that, as the witty script by Leigh Bracket and Raiders of the Lost Ark scribe Lawrence Kasdan keeps the action both exciting and with consequence, as well as maintaining a firm grasp on the characters' complicated relationships and personal roles in the expanding story. Director Irvin Kershner, who took over after Lucas bailed following a troubled pre-production, also brings the best out of the actors. Empire really transformed what was an interesting idea drawing inspiration from classic sci-fi serials and the samurai films of Akira Kurosawa into the billion-dollar beast it is today. These films are now so deeply rooted in our culture that it's almost difficult to classify the original trilogy as mere movies, they have now become something else entirely.After succeeding in blowing up the Empire's planet-destroying Death Star, the Rebels, led by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), are hiding out on ice planet Hoth while the evil Darth Vader sends out trackers throughout the galaxy in the hope of tracking them down. Smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) wants to repair his ship and get back to his old ways with trusted Wookiee friend Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), but that doesn't prevent him from flirting with Leia (Carrie Fisher). When they are eventually spotted and the planet is attacked, the film does what most sequels do nowadays and splits everybody up. Han and Leia must escape through an asteroid field with the Empire in pursuit to seek refuge in Cloud City with old friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), while Luke seeks out Dagobah to learn the ways of the Force from Jedi master Yoda (Frank Oz).Even though I have seen this movie countless times, the arm hairs still stand up when John Williams' fantastic score kicks in during the opening crawl. From the on, Empire delivers a relentless assault of riveting set-pieces and iconic moments, from the attack on Hoth which still stands up to most modern blockbusters, to the gob- smacking twist at the climax now so routinely, and lovingly, spoofed. It also takes Darth Vader to a new level of villainy, as the helmeted Sith lord relentlessly pursues the young man he feels is strong in the ways of the Force, and brutally takes out any of his own underlings who make the mistake of failing him. It's certainly dark, but it's easy to forget just how exciting and engrossing it is also. Ending at an incredibly low point for most of the good guys involved with only a sliver of hope on the horizon, I can't imagine how much fans were left wanting more back in 1980 as the credits rolled. It will always be superior to A New Hope in my book, but you can't have one without the other, and both are damn near perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Give that man a hand....,"Ice, freezing cold, swamps, a bit of incest and severed limbs, yes its my last holiday alright and by an extraordinary coincidence some of the key points in The Empire Strikes Back.TESK named in the days when Lucasfilm could name a film without causing people to break into fits of uncontrolled laughter, is a terrific sequel to Star Wars. The second/fifth instalment improves on the original in almost every respect. Secure in the knowledge that the film had generated sufficient returns (apparently)to be extended to trilogy form, the scope of the saga both broadened and deepened here.Two things work in the film's favour in this respect. Firstly is Lucas's decision not to direct the second film, apparently due to the on set struggles encountered making the first. Oh happy day. Kersner adds a layer of psychological depth to the characterisations allowing for the darker elements of the story to more fully realised. Dialogue isn't a problem either this time round thanks to Lucas forsaking writing duties in favour of Leigh Brackett and Lawerence Kasdan. Most of what ended up on screen is due to Kasdan as Brackett died of Cancer in 1979, having completed her first draft. Her connection with directors like Howard Hawkes and Film Noir is still evident though, and her contribution to the saga is the dark edge this film has thats sorely missed from other episodes. Kasdan safe pair of hands ensures the proceedings sound as good as they possibly can with a series of highly memorable lines, most of which emanate from Darth Vader.As a self-contained film the only problem with EMPIRE is that it suffers slightly from middle child syndrome. Its too open ended to be fully satisfying and doesn't trouble itself to reintroduce elements from the first film assuming, probably correctly it must be said, that everyone will have seen This New Title is Hopeless. Looking back on the film now you have to wonder how much of the story was really pre-planned. Its often suggested by Lucas that he had it all mapped out in advance but i'm not so sure. Was Vader always Luke's Dad? Was Leia always Luke's sister? The ending suggests yes because they can communicate through the force but hang on, didn't she lay a big incestuous kiss on him back on Hoth? Thank god they didn't have sex! Imagine explaining that away in Jedi. One for the super special edition George?All in all its great stuff all the way from Hoth to the Bespin, via Degobar of course. After this Yoda packed, surprise laden instalment it must be hard to imagine how the series could ever go off the rails but the blue elephant in Jabba's palace was only one film away...oh and Vader's death...oh yes and then there were those teddy bears weren't there?

A classic which breathes perfection,"Star Wars: Episode V-The Empire Strikes Back is just a film that shows how a Sci-Fi should be done but also, how to create a movie that is perfection. With so much so good about this there isn't much stuff wrong with it and criticism does not come easy. It is well acted, comedic but also ultimately reaches extreme new emotions for a film series and a sequel that really touches whatever you already knew about film. Overall I felt it was a masterpiece, and here below is why.The story is an epic one and plots just about everything you want to see when spaceships are flying round perfectly. This one also works so well in the entire series as a whole and without this only really episode IV would be ground breaking, it just combines action, adventure and comedy into a bundle of greatness. On that note of comedy, although the plot is very dramatic, you get that one two between characters that is just superb to see and reinvents old clichés.The main cast return to good form and probably even better than before, Mark Hamill improves and although he isn't as good as he probably should be, he controls the role well. Harrison Ford yet again puts in a sublime acting display and his skills seen here are reason enough why film is so important to some people. I did feel Carrie Fisher also gets a little better from previously seen and when ever her and Ford are on screen there timing is brilliantly done.George Lucas doesn't direct or write this one and it could be said it benefits because of that, Irwin Kershner does direct it well although the real star behind the camera is Lawrence Kasdan who along with Leigh Brackett create a script that has to be one of the best ever seen in film, just so well written all the way through. I even think the effects improve overall and some spectacular space scenes make this also as well deeply dramatic, also heart raising.Criticisms well I said about how hard it is so let's try and find some. The only thing I can think of is occasionally parts can seem rather silly, Vader sometimes has really random sets used with him and overly extravagant ""offices"". At times the effects are not good but it was 1980 so I can't criticise it for that at all.Fans of Star Wars well, this should be there favourite one and although some come close, it is still overall the best movie in the series. If you like Sci-Fi, this is even worth it as a one off watch and even if you have never seen a Star Wars film before, this will still entertain. The only people I think who would dislike this are people who really don't like Sci-Fi as that is the only thing I can think of if you don't at least find it kind of OK.Overall it is more or less a Just About Flawless film and one that is essential viewing for any fan of all things film. It appears on so many best films of all time lists and can even top them at times so don't go in thinking you might not like it, give it a go and Empire may just come out being your favourite film of all time. I also will add that if anyone ever needs to see what the best type of acting is then watch this movie, all the cast just seem perfect and even the extras can seem brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Star Wars strikes back with an Impossible Classic Sequel.,"Star Wars : The Empire Strikes Back (1980) -
Brief Review ;-Star Wars strikes back with an Impossible Classic Sequel. Star Wars Episode IV was a mega blockbuster and the one of the most acclaimed film at its time so people kept very high expectations from the sequel. Logically, it was almost impossible to bring a sequel to such a high acclaimed film especially when you have to make it keeping in mind that you have to match the predecessor and also generate excitement for the next part. Then, Luacs Films brought The Empire Strikes Back and stunned the Star Wars fans again. A New Hope had sort of slow start because it had to introduce the characters but Episode V had an advantage that all the main characters were known so it begun on a blasting note. No further slow start, it begins directly with the explosions and does not stop it till the end. It was far more entertaining and less darker than the predecessor therefore enjoyment factors took over the show throughout the narrative. Empire Strikes introduced some interesting characters like Lando and Yoda yet it remained frontloaded. Harrison Ford looks so cute in this film, the additional humour in his character is Lovable. I loved seeing him flirting with the Princess. Oh my god, how gorgeous Carrie Fisher was looking as Leia but i didn't like the characterisation. She was supposed to have a solid sense of love but actually she was like you know fumbling, i mean she kissed Luke to make Han feel Jealous then confessed her love to Han and then she was fondly behaving with Luke again. Of course, we got the answers in the Sequel (Return Of The Jedi) but still it didn't make much sense here. Overall, The Empire Strikes Back delivered upto the expectations which is enough to call it, 'Arguably, the Best Sequel ever made'. There was no Lucas in director's chair but still Episode V scored merits, unbelievable.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The best Star Wars film of all time,"The Empire Strikes Back is arguably more Space Opera than science fiction, but whatever it is, it's damned fine entertainment and highly re-watchable. The physical and meta-physical training of farm-boy Luke is an important part of this film, and Yoda amazes -- the only Muppet ever to seem like an organic being and not a puppet.""Do. Or do not. There is no try.""SO many things could have gone wrong with this ambitious project, and none of them did. Like the best Star Wars films, the final shot is moving and has great music (the entire soundtrack is excellent).10/10 -- I don't give out such ratings lightly (especially for a sequel).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Episode,"This one is as good as episode 4, but in a different kind of way. The adventure is there, the action also, the comedy too, but this time around the plot contains a lot of tragedy, that's a new one, and it leaves you with a nostalgic feeling, because it doesn't have a happy ending.That's what makes this movie the best episode, it introduces the characters you already know and puts them in a real peril; you do care about them. You travel with everyone of them on their journeys, and all of those journeys are fantastic.The acting is way better than the original and the themes far more darker than before.The plot surprises are... well surprising and the fate of the characters is uncertain.What a movie, what an episode, what a story, 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""You are not a jedi yet....""","The best film of the trilogy in my view. Our characters are damaged, frightened and at their most vulnerable. In contrast to their exploits in the last one, here our heroes are running and just trying to survive, at the end they just about managed it, and this feels like the greatest victory possible. Luke doesn't jump into a turret and start blasting tie fighter like the first film, at several points he's metaphorically and literally hanging on for dear life. The conflict is not just between the Vader and our heroes, but also internal conflict as well as conflict between our heroes.The role of Darth Vader is really beefed up in this one, when he last saw him he was in a small vulnerable tie fighter and was lucky to survive the destruction of the death star. In this new film we first meet him on the bridge of the largest space ship we've yet seen, surrounded by the whole imperial fleet as m.....The rebels have no choice, flee and hide or be destroyed, they cannot defeat that force of battleships.The use of colour and lighting is superb in this film and really helps to pick out the tone. The murky misty conditions on Yoda's planet emphasis the mystery and mythism of Yoda, as the smoky conditions of Luke's first fight with Vader surround him in mystery too. The bright interior of Cloud City in the day offers a sense of hope and safety to our heroes only for them to end up back in the shadows later on.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best of the Saga,"Those not born around the time of Star Wars have no clue how Star Wars impacted cinema and created the ""blockbuster"". So much of pop culture changed once Star Wars came out it was insane, from toys, magazine articles, music, media coverage, video games (eventually), and dance clubs (disco was huge).Three years later came Empire Strikes Back and while it was a better film (imo) it wasn't as loved (by critics and movie goers though less by critics) it was still amazing. Out of the three films, Empire has clearly aged the best and has become probably the fan favorite of all the films (including the prequels/sequels). There isn't much I can add to the long debate and what has already been said, but I can add another voice to the discussion surrounding Empire.The biggest reveal that Empire brought was the revelation surrounding Darth Vader and Luke but for those seeing it for the first time today it will have little impact as it will probably already be known. Even so, Empire offers so much more than Star Wars had including bigger battles, Lando, Boba Fett & bounty hunters, better Darth Vader outfit, Luke learning about the force/introduction to Yoda, and Darth Vader being in charge. The tone of Empire was also much darker though today's audiences will probably not agree as other films under the Star Wars label will be more so.Overall, Empire Strikes back offers so much more than Star Wars and even some of the other films but for those of us who saw Star Wars in 1977 nothing will beat the experience of the original though Empire will always be my favorite.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Star Wars Episode V:  The Empire Strikes Back, the greatest film of all time","I am in shock after reviewing this list of the top 250 films of all-time. Now, the Godfather and the Shawshank Redemption should be in the top 10, but they are the only movies I see in the top ten that deserve to be there. The Lord of the Rings the Return of the King was a great movie, but not top ten worthy, and the same goes for the Godfather Part II. Schindler's List was a good movie as well, but not top ten worthy. I have no say on Cuckoo's Nest and Citizen Kane, but Casablanca should be in the top 20, not the top 10. And then comes the Seven Samaurai, some dumb, stupid, idiotic Japanese movie. That movie does not even have enough votes to be that high, and anyway, maybe it should be in the top 200, but no better. Pulp Fiction is the movie in this list that gets me. This film is garbage that should have never made it past the editors desk. It is just so terrible. Let's waste time talking about a hamburger, what a boring movie. Where is Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes back though. It does not even appear in the top ten. It is number 14, which is totally incorrect. This film has by far the one of the most memorable lines in cinema history. Only the Godfather could beat it, no other. I cannot not believe the fact that this movie is not in the top five and that other not as good movies are. Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back has the greatest score in film history with the Imperial March and has the greatest battles in film history. This is the greatest film ever made and should be number 1.""No Luke. I am your father.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Space Opera Ever!,"'Empire' truly ranks as one of the sequels that surpasses the original and leaves us hanging for another. My mind goes back to when I saw this at age six, being totally mesmerized by the battle of Hoth that found my hands in a continuous rewind/play cycle. Kudos to Phil Tippett for excellent work on the AT-ATs. My only disappointment with the film was that little of Dagobah's ""massive life form readings"" were shown other than snakes and lizards.

STAR WARS EPISODE V,"Obviously it's not only my favorite movie, it's definitely one of the best movies in the world, it's got great cinematography and a perfect pill with music. I'm sure one of the last scenes in particular is one of the best movie scenes in the world, maybe the best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My Favorite Movie,"Although The Empire Strikes Back is the darkest of the trilogy, it encompasses a lot more emotion.  It combines passion, fear, immaturity, betrayal, hatred, growth and love.  The score, I believe is the best ever written, ever piece of music tells a story and the music alone can make my cry or give me chills.  In the Empire Strikes Back Luke has a coming of age, Leia accepts her Love of Han, and even Yoda and Ben learn from Luke.  My favorite character in the Empire Strikes Back is Han Solo.  My favorite line is ""Laugh it up Fuzzball."" and my favorite part is the final scene between Vader and Luke.  When Luke lets go of the structure and falls into the abyss I get tears of joy everytime.

A fantastic all round film.,"This is personally my favourite episode of the entire Star Wars saga. The developments in the storyline are sublime and really engage the audience. The immersion through practical effects, props and character representation and construction are some of the best that I have witnessed. I absolutely adore Star Wars and for me this is the best installation in the saga. The mixture of epic space battles, fantastic character confrontations and the dialogue that ties it all together makes it an easy to watch film with incredible re-watch value. Not many films can capture an audience and retain their attention for further viewings, but Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back succeeds at that very well. Definitely my favourite in the franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nearly a perfect movie,"Since the advent of movies, I don't think any movie ever came closer to being perfect than this one. It incorporates every aspect absolutely brilliant, and doesn't miss a beat throughout its 125 minute running time.The visuals are great, and the special effects absolutely stunning for the time. There are so many iconic shots from this movie, demonstrating that the film crew knew what they were doing very well.Alas, for me personally, the technical aspects are not as important as the story and the characters. And boy oh boy, does this movie deliver on those two fronts.The story is probably one of the best original movie ideas ever penned, and some bold moves from the people working on this film payed off amazingly well, propelling it to iconic status through multiple generations of audiences. It is the characters though, who really cement ""Empire"" as an evergreen movie. Even though the previous installment already established them very well, this one fleshes them out even more and gives them much more humane characteristics, meaning that everyone will be able to identify with his or her favorite.I honestly have nothing bad to say about this movie. The only reason it received a 9/10 from me is because in my mind, there is no perfect movie, as there's always potentially something better on the horizon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Significant progress,"After watching the fourth episode, I was disappointed. It was a primitive story about the confrontation between the good and the bad, without a more detailed immersion in the plot. The characters weren't well revealed, so they couldn't empathize. Darth Vader seemed to be just a toy, not a powerful and frightening villain. All the characters were like cardboard. Often, the action was boring and uninteresting. However, what pleased me was the sound, musical accompaniment, graphics and locations. I thought the next parts would be the same, but I was wrong... the mistakes made in the previous part were fixed, and what was already good became even better.It's worth starting with the fact that the plot has become deeper, the characters are revealed to us, which makes you empathize with them and get into them. We learn the interests, intentions and feelings of each of them, which makes the characters seem alive, and their goal does not look primitively stupid. Interesting dialogues that reveal the goals of the characters, from Darth Vader to Yoda. Darth Vader is a truly sinister and ruthless antagonist in this episode. With each of his appearances, accompanied by music, it becomes uncomfortable, it becomes clear that the situation is becoming tense. Luke Skywalker is a talented and impatient Jedi, similar in character to his father, who did everything to save everyone. His friends, who care about his fate, are bravely trying to help him and the rebels. There are many interesting and surprising moments in the plot.The fighting has improved significantly in this part. She looks epic and active, making you keep your eyes on the screen. Staging scenes in moments, literally hiding behind stalactites, conveys the complexity and danger of the situation. A plentiful number of locations that don't seem dead, with their own history and excellent elaboration. The graphics are on top, after 44 years it looks watchable and interesting. The sound and musical accompaniment were at the highest level, music alone can tell you a lot and complement the atmosphere of the stage. Taken together, all aspects of this part of the film did not disappoint me, it is definitely worth seeing for fans of the franchise and the genre of fiction.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

C3po getting blown up was very funny and seeing him get put back together was also funny as well.

"""Matches and even surpasses A New Hope is every single way""","Disclaimer: I am 18 years old and had never seen Star Wars up until this point. While most people's view on Star Wars is clouded by nostalgia, here is my unaffected take on the 'classics'.When we last left off, I had determined that Star Wars IV was indeed a classic. It had slight pacing issues and a lack of character development. The remaster also had quality issues with it's audio. But it was a classic nonetheless.Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back matches and even surpasses A New Hope is every single way. There is more character development, I hardly noticed any audio issues and the pacing seems just fine, You even had parallel story-telling between Luke Skywalker and the rest of the gang, which worked nicely. The humor, acting and special effects remain as enjoyable and perfect as they were in the previous installment.A worthy sequel to an already classic franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Timeless Allure,"'The Empire Strikes Back,' the middle chapter of the original Star Wars trilogy, stands as a testament to the saga's enduring legacy, especially from the perspective of a fan who leans towards the prequels. The film, released in 1980, seamlessly weaves a tapestry of intricate narrative structure, thematic depth, and technical brilliance that not only captivates its audience but also sets a high benchmark for its successors.The narrative of 'The Empire Strikes Back' is a compelling blend of adventure and emotional depth. It expands on the foundations laid by its predecessor, introducing complex character arcs and a darker tone that resonates with audiences even today. The screenplay, rich in dialogue and character development, offers a deeper insight into the psyche of its characters, notably the conflicted hero, Luke Skywalker, and the enigmatic Darth Vader. The film's pacing is masterful, balancing intense action sequences with poignant moments of introspection and revelation.Thematically, the film delves into the dualities of good vs. Evil and the internal struggle within us all, encapsulating the essence of the Star Wars ethos. It's this exploration of deeper themes that gives the film its emotional weight and philosophical resonance, aligning with the grander vision of the Star Wars universe. The Empire Strikes Back is a reminder of what Star Wars was meant to be - a tale of heroism, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of hope against all odds.Technically, the film is a marvel. The advancements in special effects, for their time, were groundbreaking. The use of models, matte paintings, and the innovative use of the motion-control camera system brought to life the expansive and detailed universe of Star Wars in a way that was unprecedented. The cinematography captures the contrasting landscapes - the icy plains of Hoth, the swampy mystery of Dagobah, and the cloud city of Bespin - with a visual flair that is both enchanting and immersive. John Williams' score, meanwhile, is nothing short of iconic, further elevating the film's emotional and epic tone.As a fan of the prequels, it's evident that 'The Empire Strikes Back' set a high standard for storytelling and cinematic quality - a standard that future installments strived to achieve. While it's unfortunate that some feel the Star Wars franchise has deviated from its original charm and depth in later years, it is heartening to revisit this classic and be reminded of the series' potential and initial vision.In conclusion, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is not just a film; it's a cultural milestone that resonates with both original trilogy purists and fans of the prequels. It captures the essence of Star Wars - a rich blend of adventure, moral complexity, and cinematic beauty. It's a film that not only stands the test of time but also serves as a poignant reminder of the saga's roots and its unparalleled influence on the genre. For anyone seeking to understand the heart of Star Wars, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is an essential and deeply rewarding experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Awesome! But not the Best,"Well I better get this off my chest. I do not think this is the best Star Wars, It's more like 3rd best. Nothing to sneeze at.

If I have to name what the best thing this movie did it's definitely Yoda. Worst thing this movie did: That tiered out ""I am Your Father"" cliché.

The Empire Strikes Back - A Timeless Classic That Continues to Captivate Audiences,"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences more than four decades after its release.

Star Wars:  Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back,"The rather dark of the original trilogy starts on the planet Hoth, an icy, cold planet where the Rebels have set up their base camp, and the Empire goes to destroy it.  After a really cool Snow Speeder vs. Imperial AT-AT and AT-STs, the movie takes an entirely different course from the first, and at the end, revealing a secretthat would rock Star Wars devotees worlds (as to what the secret is, we know it's that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father). This ""episode"", not written by Lucas, but by Leigh Brackett, is, what some may call, the one that broke the rule.  That rule being that ""Sequels are never as good as the original.""  I'll admit, I differ from them slightly.  Toward the end, I found myself anxious for it to end (probably because I had to use the restroom).  Upon further viewing (and time alotted for restroom breaks), I found it much more enjoyable.

The Empire Strikes Back ... Again,"QUICK REVIEW SEPTEMBER 2020
The 4K remaster is in cinemas and I was surprised how strong the movie is 40 years after its original release. The pure inspiration behind the traditional stop-motion, scale-model, and blue screen special effects, as well as the depth of practical sets, sound effects and score keep this film in the top 5 sci-fi/fantasy cinema experiences even today.
In today's industry of movies made with the option for streaming at home, this movie stands out as something designed ... purely ... for ... the ... big ... screen (and sound system!). Everything is amplified and it is just pure epic ... ness!The darker, more adult story elements that spooked me as a child still hold weight today. The humour holds up as well.Something odd that I noticed; as Han and Lando meet again I thought, hey, that standalone Solo movie actually fits in well here. You know, you don't have all that post-prequel-trilogy-extra-baggage of, ""Why doesn't Vader recognise R2D2?"" or ""Why doesn't older Obi-Wan recognise R2D2?"" or ""How come ghost Obi-Wan thinks Luke was their only hope?""

"The force is with you, young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet.","It's often said that The Empire Strikes Back is the greatest Star Wars film simply because it's dark. You've heard it before, people telling you it's the best because ""the ending is so dark"". While I do think this is the best film out of the series, I don't agree with that reason. I think the movie is dark as the result of what actually makes the movie so great. I will attempt to explain my point of view.In A New Hope our heroes were part of a story that was bigger then them. It was about the Empire trying to wipe out the Rebel Alliance. In contrast the story of Empire Strikes Back is driven by the characters. The Rebels are still trying to free the universe from the Empire, it's just not the main story anymore. It's the backdrop of the story. The real story is Darth Vader's obsession with turning Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side. That is the driving force behind everything that happens in this film and suddenly the story is much more personal for our heroes.This of course ends up giving a fantastic character arc for Luke, something that was missing from Episode IV. The heroic and hopeful Skywalker gets put through the wringer and by the end of the movie everything he believes in is now in question. It also leads up to one of the most memorable twists in movie history (which brings into question what order you should be watching these films).Not to be left out though, and maybe something that goes overlooked by some, but Leia and Han have great character arcs as well. The incredibly self-reliant Princess is left emotionally vulnerable while Solo goes from self-serving to selfless. It's done so well you won't notice until it's too late. Of course this also leads up to one of the most memorable cliffhangers in movie history.Character driven story. Great character arcs. One of the greatest twists and cliffhangers in movie history. Some truly iconic film moments. Those are the reasons why Empire Strikes Back is such a great film. The end result of those things make the film dark.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Simply the best,"This is just a great movie. The great thing about this movie is the relationship between the hero(Luke) and the villain (Vader) just gets more and more complicated.

The acting is also great and the introduction to this new character, Lando, is also interesting and well handled. you also get to meet the emperor for the first time, and WOW, what a creepy feller he is. But the thing that really makes star Wars, Star Wars, is John Williams score. It's just Great, and star wars is nothing without it's music.

Culture shock.,"One of the most quotable and influential movies of all time gets a sequel, and who would have guessed, it's extremely quotable and influential. Empire is one of those rare sequels that improves on the original. It takes all the great parts of Star Wars and develops them further. Masterfully crafted from a technical perspective, empire strikes back is just as innovative as the original. Where Empire distinguishes it's self is in the characters. This is where Luke Skywalker becomes Luke Skywalker, Han Solo becomes Han Solo and Darth Vader proves to be the greatest cinematic antagonist in film history. Every character and scene is iconic and memorable, with a story that satisfies while subverting the expectations of it audience. Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones give more than memorable performances with dialogue that come across as cheesy without the right actor behind it. Williams provides music that could inject any scene with intense emotion. With the most iconic movie twist in history, the story takes you on a ride that you can't help but want more of when the film comes to a close. Hopeful and charming, Empire is one of those movies that define a generation.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

All the regulars return Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia etc but there are some new ones too, like Lando Clarissan. In my opinion George Lucas should have stopped at number 3 because it has become more of a money making machine. The Phanthom Menace was OK, Attack of the Clones was bad whilst Revenge of the Sith was an improvement.

This movie is directed perfectly, and is accompanied by such an excellent screenplay. The film starts on a high and progressively builds with even more excitement in every scene. The fact that the characters and storyline had already been established in the first film, it allowed for much more entertaining character relationships and action sequences. The visuals in The Empire Strikes Back are even more impressive, and till this day certain sets are jaw dropping. Also the music by John Williams is outstanding, introducing the iconic Imperial March added a new level of darkness to Darth Vader and The Empire. This film fleshes out its main characters, giving them so much more depth. Luke's training with the incredible Yoda, allowed him to learn important lessons and wisdom. Also learning more about Darth Vader and who he is controlled by makes him so much more complex and compelling. The Empire Strikes Back is my favourite Star Wars Film. Every person working on this movie was at their creative peak, so therefore I must give it a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Empire Strikes Back,"When the original Star Wars movies came out around 30 years ago, they opened the eyes of many generations to come. There was nothing around to match the futuristic insight and it blew the minds of many. One of the most important factors was that George Lucus had studied over fifty religions world wide to get an understanding of the Force. In the early movies they really focused on this point. I hope that the future films really focus on this point more as i believe it is the most integral part of the films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the 3,"Although it is not the happiest of the 3 Star Wars films (I'm not even considering the pseudo-Star Wars rubbish Lucas is putting out now to pre-cursor the greatest trilogy ever concieved), it is my fav.  Perhaps it is the films darkness that make it slightly better than the other 2.  I have never watched a film more times and hoped for a differnet outcome than this one.  Everytime I see it I hope that somehow Luke chooses to stay with Yoda and finish his training.  Anyway.  Best of the 3, no doubt.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent movie!,"This is my favorite out of the original Star Wars movies, and for good reason. There's action, there's drama, and there's Yoda (because who doesn't love the little green guy?). Not to mention the fact that Harrison Ford is in it, and he's a brilliant actor. Mark Hamill does a great job playing Luke Skywalker, and Carrie Fischer is a convincing Leia as well. I'm personally not a fan of Lando, but he's not terrible. The special effects aren't perfect, but it IS an older movie, so it's forgivable. Lightsabers: I really wish they were real. Also, it shouldn't be a surprise to know, but the stormtroopers still can't hit anything. I love all six of the movies, but this one is truly spectacular.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My favourite movie,"I´ve seen this movie...very often. I think it is the best movie of all time because he is very exciting and there is romance and there is magic and there is great music and...in the special edition(which I prefer) there are also very good, modern special effects. I think that this movie is not as overstripped as episode one, but perhaps Lucas wanted to do this in this movie,too, but the technologie wasn´t as far as he needed it to realize this story how she was in his brain. But what he made, is the best movie of all times, the others are very very good, too, but ep.1,4 and 6 don´t have...I don´t now what they don´t have, but this movie has it. I could watch it again and again. I think that this is the darkest movie of the four ones, there are many people killed by Darth Vader only because he doesn´t forgive them mistakes, and the lightsaber duell between Vader and Luke is brilliant. The hunt through the asteroid field is very exciting  and of course the battle in the snow is very exciting, too. I would like to say, that the special edition is not as bad as some people want to make her. It is not a director´s cut where it is possible that the story changes or you see another message. It is a special edition with only one really important new scene, but the story of course doesn´t change. The Sp.Ed. has a brilliant sound, there are some new special effect, but not every old effect was deleted, which I think is so because these effect are part of the legend of star wars. The quality of the picture has improved very much, I don´t understand why people say that the Sp.Ed. is bull***t. They can´t expect to see a new movie, they have to expect a better quality of all, and they get it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
amazing,"This movie proves why the Star Wars series can last. What Lucas did was not just show the most advanced special effects technology at the time, build a complicated galaxy world, but truly become an epic movie. Everything you deserve: The most classic elements of insulting and cursing, rejoicing at your enemies, father and son, and apprentices and apprentices are cleverly combined. Even if the technology is outdated, the true soul of the space opera is still retained",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
When Lucas was still a visionary...,"I am always amazed at the creativity of artists. When Lucas first proposed ""Star Wars"" the board at 20th Century Fox probably thought he was mad, especially since special effects were primitive at best. Who could have envisioned what he had in mind when he first made the original? Who could have imagined what a light saber was?As many have stated, this is much better than the original, and I wholeheartedly agree. After watching a film so many times, people become immune to the amazing innovations shown. A good example is ""Citizen Kane"" which included memorable imagery including ""deep focus"", low angle shots that showed ceilings, overlapping dialogue, and camera trickery. Many people see ""Kane"" for the first time and proclaim ""Big deal!"" In ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" some of original innovations are the Imperial Walkers, the ice planet of Hoth and the Zen-like Yoda who philosophizes with phrases like ""Try not. Do. Or Do not. There is no try.""I won't re-hash the plot since everyone knows it by now, so I will review the intricacies that make this film work so well. I think the humor in this film works tremendously: for one, the interplay between Han Solo and C3PO cracks me up (""Sir if I may venture an opinion--"" ""I'm not really interested in your opinions 3PO.""). Another thing that works is another character not listed in the credits--the Millennium Falcon. The lovable ""piece of junk"" that is forever under repair but always comes through in the clutch, like when Han et al were trying to escape from Hoth. There was a pretty tense moment when the Falcon wouldn't start while the Empire's stormtroopers entered the docking bay (""Would it help if I got out and pushed?"" ""It might!""). And yet, the Falcon came through as always when the laser machine gun appeared. Further, the non-functioning light speed on the Falcon is a great sub-plot of the film.Darth Vader is at his very best (or worst?) in the way he kills off his own men who fail him. The scene when he kills off Admiral Ozzle is priceless not only for Vader's vengeance but for Admiral Piett's trying not to look at his dead former commander on the deck. Another great scene is Vader killing off Captain Needa (""Apology accepted Captain Needa."")I will even overlook the ""borrowing"" from ""Casablanca"": in that film, the Nazis first won't let Victor Lazlow leave Casablanca and then change their minds when they won't let him stay. In this film, Princess Leia was supposed to stay and then Vader ""altered"" the plans.Some of the greatest films are great in part to the score. How John Williams didn't win an Oscar is another infamous slight by the Academy (He did win a BAFTA). The ""Imperial March"" is such a sublime acievement, perfectly fitting for Darth Vader's gang.Lucas ventured into dangerous territory in trying to make a film better than the original ""Star Wars"", but he succeeded. Unfortunately, his luck ran out 22 years after the original ""Star Wars"" was released when he tried to recapture the glory--and money--when he made the infamous prequels. His casting choices that were so inspired in the original trilogy became so insipid 22 years later.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of either Trilogy...,"Not as historic or groundbreaking as the original, this film easily represents the 'Godfather part II' of science fiction sequels.There is up and down, black and white with ebb and flow in film... and 'Empire..' hits them all, in order and without dragging it's feet.Maybe because we know a majority of the story already, maybe because it just unfolds and unfolds and then BAM! carbonite. Scoundrels are lovers, dead men are ghosts, Jedi Masters can be two foot nuthin' and Darth Vader is still the biggest intergalactic bastard around (and not much fun to work for).'Empire..' represents the old-school swashbuckling epic that Lucas had envisioned, the episodic Saturday morning matinée you'd show up thirteen weeks in a row to see. To find a film even close you'd need to rent one of Errol Flynn's early Warner Bros. works, and none of them had an eight foot Wookie.Far from a simple transition sequel, 'Empire..' stands above any other film in the six part series, and contains all the spirit, action, emotion and oomph that the prequels fought to give.Epic.

Awesome 2nd installment to the greatest trilogy of our time!!,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a superb installment in the star wars trilogy. First, lets get started with the snow battle on the Ice planet of Hoth, Excellent!. The Imperial Walkers were inventive and another one of Lucas's great creations. The snow battle is my second favorite battle in the series next to Yavin. This films intensity was great. Vader had such dominate and evil presence, starting with hoth and ending with the best one on one confrontation I have ever seen in a movie, Vader vs Luke up top the most imaginative city of Bespin. Awesome!!!! I love the little green creature of yoda, who teaches Luke in the ways of the force.I love him not becuase he is unique and original but becuase he can act as well.Finally, I thought Boba Fett was an awesome bounty hunter and a great addition to threat of the empire. ""Empire"" focused on the darkness of star wars. It buried down into its mythology and made a strong backbone to the series. When C 3PO, R2, Leia, and Luke starred beyond into the outer rims of space at the films conclusion, never before have I been left with the curiousity and anticipation I felt at that moment. ""Return of the Jedi"" forfilled that anticipation and curiousity quite well may I add. I'll give "" Empire"" *** 1/2 out of **** stars. Classic!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best of the Star Wars Trilogy by far.,"The Empire Strikes Back has remained one of my favorite films since I saw it as a seven year old in a theater on the Ocean City Boardwalk (NJ). It was the first movie I really cared about--its offbeat and dark atmosphere is still a treat--and it introduced me to a wide range of cinema. Few blockbuster movies are as unconventional and audacious. Unlike the other two Star Wars movies, ESB can be taken seriously or not taken seriously at all and still be thoroughly enjoyed.Empire is the only movie of the series in which the acting is uniformly solid. Despite their individual flaws, all three lead actors give convincing (if not quite Oscar caliber) performances. Irvin Kershner, the man who directed this second chapter of the Star Wars Trilogy, was a much better director of actors than either George Lucas or Richard Marquand.The script, penned by the late, great Leigh Brackett (The Big Sleep, Rio Bravo) and Lawrence Kasdan (Body Heat, Raiders of the Lost Ark) is the best written and most nuanced of the entire series. With Kershner's help, the two screenwriters deepen the motivations of the movie's characters. The effect of this is two edged: Han, Leia, Luke and the other characters in the series move closer to us and become mythic heroes at the same time. In ESB, simple facial expressions convey a lot more about the characters than a ton of deadweight dialogue in Star Wars and Return of the Jedi.Empire's pacing is brilliant. Kershner unleashes the excitement early with two unforgettable action sequences, slows the movie down with a beautiful legato middle act, and then picks up the pace again with a moving and fast paced climax.The movie's editing and cinematography are nearly flawless. Like Pauline Kael once said, Empire's cascading and visceral images stay with the viewer long after he or she has finished watching the movie.The Empire Strikes Back has a soulfulness and emotional richness that the other two Star Wars movies lack. Every frame is packed with beautiful, flowing visuals. The picture is a precise, yet heartfelt piece of moviemaking---something that children and adults can appreciate and love.Empire Strikes Back carries most of the emotional load of the Star Wars Trilogy, yet does so with such subtlety and grace that it is often overlooked in the greater scheme of the ""Star Wars Myth"". In fact, I would go so far as to say that what transpired in  this middle chapter of the series allowed the series to gain ""mythic"" resonance with the public.And after all of that it's still ripping good fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best film of the series,"While the child in me loves Return of the Jedi, the adult in me realizes that this installment of Star Wars is, in fact, the most well constructed film overall.It benefits from a razor sharp focus on character development and does that very well tied in with some of the usual Star Wars fun of force moves, space battles, interesting aliens, and laser swords, of course. UNLIKE the sequel films however, these elements are used as dressing added on top of a great story and one of the best reveals in film history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"My Favorite Star Wars, and my fifth favorite movie!","My favorite Star Wars film and my fifth favorite movie of all time.It does exactly what a sequel should do: Improve upon its predecessor!The pacing is slower but it helps the story and the characters to develop.The tone is a lot darker. Sometimes this can work to the detriment but here it helps the movie.The chemistry between Han and Leia is fantastic! It's charming and funny! The ""Nurfherder"" and ""Lazerbain"" lines were stupid but you forget about that scene pretty quickly.The score is superb. The Imperial March is one of the best pieces of music ever conceived.It goes in directions you don't expect. And I'm not just referring to the big twist. I'm also referring to how the movie ends at a low point as well as a cliffhanger.It leaves things up to your imagination. Like Luke's face in the mask. Or the Force, despite it going a little deeper into it.Effects that were impressive for the time are at this point either bad but very charming, or still good.An intimidating villain. This is the movie that turned Darth Vader into one of the best villains ever! In fact, the Empire in its entirety is a lot more threatening.Fantastic performances from everybody.Complex, nuanced characters.Even though Yoda is clearly a puppet he still feels alive. Seeing him as CG in the prequels infuriates me. I do not believe for a minute that he is there.Memorable lines:""I'll see you in hell!""
""I love you."" -> ""I know.""
""No! Do! Or do not! There is no try!""
Out of all the Star Wars movies this one has by far the best script.Intense action. The action also feels a lot more gritty compared to A New Hope.It's super well-shot, especially compared to all the other Star Wars films! This is a movie that really lets you soak in the environment!Sure, it's got some cheese, some dumb lines, and some things that don't make any sense, but that's to be expected from Star Wars. And because everything else is so good you don't really care.Even when I was a kid this one was my favorite. I didn't know why at the time. But looking back on it, I can say that it was because the film is darker and slower compared to the others.I'm also happy that out of all the movies in the original trilogy this is the one that George Lucas screwed with the least. I hate that for changing, ""You're lucky you don't taste good."" to ""You're lucky you got out of there."" Thank you, George, for once again not thinking something through and taking that enjoyably corny joke and changing it to something completely bland that makes Luke seem less witty. However, I give credit where credit is due: You made cloud city seem a lot less claustrophobic, despite the fact that, much like the CG in all of the prequels, and the CG you just had to shoehorn into A New Hope, the CG looks like garbage!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I Agree with you all: Empire RULES!!!,"Having read most of the comments herein, I must agree that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best movie from the original Trilogy. The acting, effects, story and most noticeably, the music, surpass far and away the original (and that is saying a lot!!!). Though it's obvious ""Empire"" would not be the classic it is were not for the first STAR WARS, it still manages to stand high on its own. As a music lover, I must say the the original ""Empire"" Soundtrack has to be John Willimas BEST musical score EVER. The ominous ""Imperial March"" (also known as Darth Vader's theme) was SO strong, that its motif has appeared in ALL subsequent films, including ""The Phantom Menace"". Same goes for the love theme of Han and Leia, Yoda's theme, and the list goes on. On the acting side, Harrison Ford's acting on this one was his most mature performance out of all STAR WARS movies. His performance on ""Return of the Jedi"" looked watered down compared to this one. Same goes for Carrie Fisher's performance. In ""Return"" she looks tamed and subdued, a far cry from the bossy, devil-may-care attitude of the first one and ""Empire"". And Mark Hammil's acting on this one was his most solid and convincing. It's weird that ""Empire"" worked so well, since most of director Irving Keshner's movies are always a bit contrived. He also did ""Robocop 2"", but that was a mess (thanx in part to the plotless script and last minute re-writes). ""Empire"" is a movie that I saw when I was 12 years old, and to this date, it still amazes me. Let's hope that George Lucas comes to his senses and do the new trilogy justice with the upcoming ""Episode II"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

More Powerful Than You Could Possibly Imagine,"Who'd have pegged Irvin Kershner as a likely candidate to take over George Lucas's trashily popular STAR WARS franchise? Luckily, the decision was made and Kershner turned in what is, by a long stretch, the best of the series. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a breathless chase movie but, unusually for this series, plot is allowed to intrude on action and the actors seem to have suddenly found some character. The whole thing is infused with a wonderfully dark operatic quality, greatly assisted by the rich and imaginative visuals. Movies like this need a good hissable villain and Dave Prowse and James Earl Jones as (respectively) the body and voice of Darth Vader turn him into a truly frightening nemesis (rather than the cardboard cut-out he is in the other films), all of which serves to give the whole enterprise a weighty centre that was completely absent from its predecessor.A grand and sweeping addition to both the STAR WARS canon (and sci-fi cinema generally) before the disappointing plunge into 2-dimensional characters and cuteness that was 1983's RETURN OF THE JEDI and the flashy CGI emptiness which became the trademark of the series by the time the trilogy of prequels ended in 2005.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My favorite film of all time.,"I know what you're thinking. ""There are millions of movies out there, what makes this your all time favorite?"" Well the truth is this. I've seen hundreds of movies in my life. When it comes to me and film, there's no genre I don't like and a movie has to have a lot of annoying qualities for me to dislike it. So I'm quite easy to please when it comes to the cinema. I know I haven't answered your question yet but bear with me.There was a time before I saw Star Wars and at that point I never really saw a movie that I didn't like. But once I first witnessed the adventures in that galaxy far, far away, my imagination (for the very first time) was actually pulled from reality and into this ""space opera"". I've never really been one for fantasy. In fact to this day, I can't quite understand the hoopla surrounding Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings. But for some reason I can't really explain, these movies did it for me.You see, the (original) Star Wars trilogy for me is what really made me look at movies as more than just something to keep you entertained on a rainy day. At this point on, it was the basis of comparison to all the films I've seen in my life. I have yet to see a movie that I like better and I doubt I ever will because when it comes to MY taste in movies, this trilogy is as perfect as it gets.Now that I've totally gotten over my little Star Wars love fest there, let me go on to explain why The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite.I didn't see Star Wars until I was 15 so I wasn't one of those kids who grew up with it. Although if I knew then what I knew now, I'm sure it would be different. Anyway, I started seeing all this commotion about it's Special Edition re-release in 1997. It was obvious that there was something special about these movies that stood the test of time. So I went into the basement and found my dad's old Beta copies of the trilogy and decided to check them out. (I'm glad I kept my old Beta VCR, heheh) I popped in the original film and suddenly a whole new world of film was opened up to me. (But that's a whole other story.) I was so captivated by the magic of the original film, that I was kind of afraid to watch the sequels as I was afraid they would be inferior. How do you live up to that kind of masterpiece? I've never second guessed a movie since that day.So the time came to watch The Empire Strikes Back. I wanted to see the continuing adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia and see if they could really bring down the evil Darth Vader. They blew up the Death Star already I thought they won! Until this point, I thought Star Wars was just this happy tale of good triumphing over evil. Well...I was blown away to see Luke attacked by the Wampa Ice Creature when the movie started, the AT-AT Walkers demolishing the rebel base on Hoth, Han Solo frozen in carbonite before the eyes of those who loved him and Darth Vader revealing Luke Skywalker's true parentage. (Of course, I already knew that, but everyone knew even if they didn't see the movies.) At the end, the bad guys won. You don't really see that in a lot of movies, because it wouldn't work. Unless you're creating a trilogy, that just doesn't sit well with audiences. If I saw RoboCop and at the end he was blown to pieces, I would be disappointed. But here it works, because you knew there was another movie coming and there was time to make everything all right.This movie has everything a film buff could love. It has action, humor, romance and characters that I haven't been so in love with until I saw Trainspotting. However, that's a completely different type of film.By the time it was all over, I realized that this film had more of an impact on me emotionally than the original film did. At the end of the first film I found myself cheering for the characters. At the end of this one I found myself worrying about them and hoping that it would all be all right.The Star Wars saga is, and will always be my favorite saga of all time. Because even if I'm having a bad day at work or one of my friends gets mad at me for saying something stupid or a girl decides she's finally had enough of me, the Star Wars saga will always be there to bring back my sanity. Heheh.And that's why this is my favorite movie of all time. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The best of the series,"Pros: Script, story, special effects, characterization, costumes, duels.Cons: Ends on a downer.With the Empire Strikes Back, director Irvin Kirshner brings a veteran hand to the film, and therefore more characterization and a better script which ultimately makes this the best Star Wars film so far. Since A New Hope, Luke Skywalker has become commander of the rebel airforce and Han Solo has joined in the fight to escape the wrath of Jabba the Hutt. Darth Vader has become obsessed with finding Luke because, well it will be expalined later on in the film. The Empire Strikes Back was made three years after Star Wars so it features better special effects and the ILM team really outdid themselves with this one. The special effects are just amazing to look at. Equally impressive are the costumes, the creatures and the puppetry involved with this one. Fans of the Star Wars series like this film because two major secrets are revealed to them. What this film lacks though is a major space battle as it ends with the fans wondering if the faith of Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, Solo, the robot units and the rebels will be good. Irvin Kirshner is obviously good at bringing out emotions from the audience and he is pretty capable of staging a good light saber duel.Premise: The empire seek to crush the rebels and Darth hopes to convert young Skywalker to the dark force.The Empire Strikes Back was nominated for four Academy awards and won two.Grade: 10/10 (Best Science Fiction film of the eighties).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best sequels ever,"Unlike so many unplanned sequels to standalone movies that don't know what to do with themselves, Star Wars Episode V pulls ahead like a champ. It does it by taking the existing universe, expanding it in a logical manner, staying with what worked in the previous film yet adding something new and original as well. You can definitely see that they hadn't planned for this film in advance because there's a lot of new stuff. Suddenly we have the character of Yoda, the reveal of Luke's father, the romantic tension between Han and Leia (you can see pretty well in the first film that she was supposed to end up with Luke) and the continuation of the war between the Alliance and the Empire.But, unlike in so many other sequels, in this case it works because the film makers hadn't painted themselves into a corner with the first film. There was still story left from the original to explore. The Emperor hadn't been dealt with, it was possible that Darth Vader might have survived the destruction of the first Death Star and Luke still had much to learn about the Force. And thus we get a film that might be one of the best sequels ever made, if not one of the best movies in general.The film is also a significant leap forward in terms of technical quality. They had a much bigger budget with this film, plus more experience with the new effects the first film had pioneered, and it shows. From Darth Vader's improved armor and look to the explosions and the spaceships to the lightsaber battles. They all look fantastic and have held up remarkably well over the decades.Furthermore, the story is just as good as in the first one. The Battle of Hoth that opens the film might very well be one of my favourite battle scenes in all of cinema and the lightsaber duel near the end of the film is easily the best one in all of the franchise. Plus, we get a lot of new stuff, as stated, and they all work very well. Yoda's puppetry effects have not aged as well as some other effects in the film, but they're still pretty impressive even by today's standards and the character itself is a lot of fun. Kind of Jar Jar done right. You know, a crackpot local (I know he's not really from Dagobah, shut up) alien who talks funny, messes around, but is still needed for the plot. Except in Yoda's case there's some actual wisdom beneath the initial goofiness.Overall I think I prefer Episode IV to this one, but it's by a very slight margin. This one has better battles, better effects and equally great story, but Episode IV had better atmosphere and sense of mythos. Nevertheless, they're both fantastic scifi epics and well worth a watch if you've been living under a rock for the last half a century.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
