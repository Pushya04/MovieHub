"This is a rare, light-hearted science fiction film.","This is a rare, light-hearted science fiction film that deliberately downplays the most common fears about the future and the unknown universe, focusing instead on human effort and the science that can save humanity.The film has a tech-geek's idiocy and optimism. (Matt Damon, of course, did it perfectly.)Even if the movie is a little bit stereotypical in its emotional setting, it can still touch the audience at crucial moments.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Tasks for your survival,"Although The Martian is set in an indeterminate future I have questions about labeling it science fiction. One of the film's best strengths is that it is based on what we know about the landscape and atmosphere of Mars right at this point in time. It's a desert planet with water and no life as we know it. Compared to what Matt Damon has to go through, Robinson Crusoe was on that tropical isle for a picnic.They never really say just exactly what year The Martian is set in. The film in that sense avoids a trap like so many others fall into. Just this past year we saw 2015 come and go and it wasn't really anything like the 2015 that Marty McFly experienced. That's just one example.Of course you can also never predict what popular trends will be there. That's purely speculative. So you can't have Matt Damon's character listening to current music. His captain's taste in music was 70s disco and that really became a running joke. It's all he heard for the months he was on Mars. Personally I'd prefer a selection of 30s and 40s music with Bing Crosby at the top of my list. But if that's all I heard for months on end, I'd grow to hate Der Bingle.And that's part of the story, the everlasting boredom trying to keep your mind fresh and busy with tasks for your survival. Like Mr. Roberts from tedium to apathy and always boredom.What happens in The Martian is that Damon is part of an astronaut team and gets left behind when a Martian sand storm erupts and the crew flees on the space ship. Captain Jessica Chastain takes when she thinks Damon was killed.The future also brings us better communication and NASA learns that Matt's still there. To say that there's a public relations problem is putting it mildly. Just leaving him there is actually an option discussed. But that goes against the code of a decent civilization which while we're not at Star Trek level yet, we look to be heading that way.Although The Martian splits time evenly with Damon's plight and the efforts to rescue him, Matt's time alone on the screen with the full range of emotions displayed is what got him his Best Actor nomination. Besides the realistic depiction of Mars, his performance is the other pillar on which this fine film rests. I would give mention to Jessica Chastain and her fine performance as a tough and yet humane leader of her team.Besides Matt Damon, The Martian is also up for Best Picture and for a flock of awards in the technical categories. It should take home deserved statues this year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ridley proving himself once again,"Strong, well-executed, moving. Classic Scott-style directing, with its fast pace, yet never leaving emotion behind, keeping you glued to the screen throughout the runtime. Reminiscent of the original Alien, yet clearly proving the director's overall increased maturity and experience. My thoughts on the cinematography are mixed, from the one hand side the movie features a particularly bland color palette, most sequences however are nice, vivid and well-balanced. What strikes me the most is the fact that they didn't account for the reduced gravity on Mars, however not only is the price cut behind this clear, but also you forget it surprisingly easily in the first 10 minutes or so, since everything else is so gripping. The visual effects are simply flawless, realistic to the maximum and beautiful at the same time. The story itself and the characters are simply masterful, not at all out-of-this-world, or should i say the way facts are presented combined with the pacing makes you believe it's all happening at the time you're watching the movie. Though i am probably not meant to make this comparison, it leaves (in my humble opinion) Nolan's ""Interstellar"", a great movie on its own, completely in the dust, simply proving the effect Scott's experience has had on his work. A must-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
pleasantly surprised,"Seeing that the movie was over 2 hrs long, and knowing that the person was going to be stuck on the planet by their self for the majority, I didn't have high hopes for it. Usually these types of movies are boring. Not a lot of writers can pull this off. This movie was really good tho. A group of us watched it and really enjoyed. There were some things they failed to explain, that we collectively came up with our own answer for. Other than that, it was great. I never felt bored or left waiting for more. Overall, I feel it was very well written, produced and acted. Well worth the watching. Some people on here have griped that it was 'predictable', but then, most movies are. Who ever watched Star Wars with the thought that Vader would ultimately win??? Who ever watched Star Trek thinking that Kirk wouldn't find a way to save the day? And frankly, who grew up watching Scooby Doo thinking that someone would actually kill Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne or Velma???",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining and slick enough to make you go with it,"I heard a lot about this film regarding its scientific validity as a piece of fiction. Perhaps as a result of this I assumed that the film would be a dry affair – an impression sort of confirmed by the longer than normal running time. As it happens, this is not the case at all because The Martian has much more in common with the entertaining blockbuster that the starry cast list and presentation suggest it will be. The story wears its science very much on its sleeve, but yet makes it accessible and fun – with the slick presentation making it so. As a result everything seems to be explained with everyday objects, and even the most complex principles are presented in simple terms (references to Iron Man for instance). As a result the film gets to have its cake and eat it – although the film is helped by the knowledge of a lot of this being possible (eg hitting a point near Pluto recently with very tight tolerances on a journey of years).The film itself doesn't really play up the drama in a heavy way, but rather does enough to invest the viewer in it without making it too much of a downer or serious. The soundtrack is hugely upbeat, the content is mostly light in tone, and the science is delivered in a very user-friendly fashion – essentially in the service of the tone and the entertainment value, nothing more than this. The starry cast add to this feeling, and use their screen presence well. Damon is consistently likable, which is just as well since he is alone in the vast majority of his scenes. The ensemble cast has a lot of depth to it, all of which are solidly watchable – Chastain, Wiig, Daniels, Eiofor, Peña, Bean, and so on. The Chinese aspects of the plot serves as another reminder that this film is a blockbuster out to make money, but it doesn't seem too out of place. Technically it looks great and it impressive how convincing the surface of Mars looks.In the end we get to the fist-pumping mission control scenes that we all knew were coming, but along the way the film is slickly packaged and entertaining as a result; even if the oft-mentioned scientific validity of it all is not something it ever seems concerned with itself.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It's hard to imagine Ridley Scott directing a film like this one....,"Ridley Scott is famous for bringing ""Alien"" and ""Bladerunner"" to the big screen. Both have huge followings and both are amazing for their time when they were made. Now with ""The Martian"" he brings a great sci-fi film to us but one with an entirely different mood--so much so that it's hard to believe it's from this famed filmmaker! Why? Because the mood is so much more positive and upbeat--and it's a film that leaves you happy...something you could never say about the other movies!As far as what I liked about the film and what I disliked, I'll make it easy--especially since there are already so many reviews for the movie. What I liked was everything and I hated nothing. There is nothing I would have done differently...and that's something I almost never can say. This is a very intelligent, crowd-pleasing quality picture from start to finish and you should see it on the big screen if you can. Yes, it's THAT good!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I Am The Only One Who Was Not Disappointed,"Having read the book, and being very impressed, I was looking forward to the movie interpretation. I was not the least bit disappointed. I was hoping this movie would not be an overacted, overproduced and sappy version of the original, and I was pleasantly surprised that the story played out without the overblown extraneous embellishment that Hollywood seems to depend on so often.It was great to see how the screenplay added extra material that was not in the book, and it enhanced the story to make it even better. The characters were interpreted with full respect to the intention of the author, Andy Weir, and nothing was overdone. The pacing and editing of this movie was some of the best I've seen, in fact, some of the one-liners from the book are done so quickly it pushed the story forward relentlessly.One thing that struck me is that everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I think that could be a testament to the originality and uniqueness of the book. I believe anyone who reads the book is captivated and involved with the story from beginning to end, and it's possible this comes across in all phases of the production; the acting, the sets, sound, everything. They all knew they had some great material to work with and ran with it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Roasted, Mashed, Boiled, Sauteed? How'd you do your Potatoes?","If you've ever wondered if Tom Hanks went even further adrift in Castaway then this could be the answer you're looking for.An Earth team are on Mars carrying out tests on the surface of The Red Planet, a message comes through from Earth warning of a huge and fast approaching storm. The team quickly assemble and flee, unfortunately Mark Watney is caught in the storm, loses his communication device and presumed dead. Watney has survived and has a harsh realism that he's abandoned on Mars with precious little supplies, no company and little chance of survival. Being 50 million miles away and 4 years away in terms of rescue life seems bleak. Watney has to defy the odds in order to survive.Ridley Scott is responsible for so many wonderful films, and for many The Martian will sit among them.This is a beautifully made film, it looks incredible, I love the realisation of Mars's surface, truly brilliant, wasn't going to be otherwise with the budget they had. The music is interesting, the score itself is quite subtle, but the tunes from Abba, Gloria Estefan etc are so random.The pacing of the film is very cleverly done, never does it feel rushed, and on very few occasions does it feel slow or padded. If i'm honest at twenty minutes I was questioning how the film was possibly going to last over two hours.Matt Damon shows his class, he carries the film on his shoulders, he gives a stellar performance as Mark, cannot be faulted. Some of the others in the film were a little hit and miss, I enjoyed Chiwetel Ejiofor very much. Jeff Daniels was fairly good. Kristen Wiig seemed an odd choice, but she was good too.It was better then I expected, I enjoyed it a lot 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

My favourite movie of the last decade,"I am genuinely amazed at the number of bad reviews there are on here for The Martian. Now I never read the book, but I absolutely LOVED the film. So much so, I watched it twice within a week. It has been such a long time since I have been left with that wonderful sense of satisfaction after investing two hours in a really good movie, and this did it 100%I am usually left highly disappointed after watching this genre of film, so I wasn't expecting much. Something like Gravity I thought, great special affects, dramatic scenes, and an average storyline, but The Martian was a whole different calibre of film and was perfectly constructed from start to finish.I was instantly thrown in to a scene where astronaut Mark Watney and his crew are setting about their mission on Mars. But the sh*t hits the fan about ten minutes in where a storm causes Watney to be thrown from the crew and left for dead. There was no long lingering introduction to the film and its characters, just instant drama and character development. This forcibly got me caring for the entire crew, and got me emotionally invested until the end.Matt Damon has always been good at what he does, but I felt he hadn't really shown off his true raw talent since Good Will Hunting back in 1997. Well he did in this. He was captivating in every single scene, and managed to do what Tom Hanks achieved in Cast Away and single handedly gripped the viewers' attention completely (with the help of a beautifully crafted script). Another reviewer got it bang on when they described it as Apollo 13 meets Castaway. The exact comparison I too had made and a combination, which works superbly.The makers of this film put so much effort in to making it scientifically accurate which made it all the more pleasurable to watch. There was nothing far-fetched or stupid like in a lot of films of the same genre, and the combination of this, with a solid plot made for a truly interesting, exciting and enjoyable film.There was drama, great effects, humour, heartwarming moments, a great soundtrack and a flawless screenplay. If you only see one movie this year, make it this one. An absolute must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Fun but Far From Great,"This is certainly an entertaining film as a formula movie. It's fun like the earlier ""Independence Day"" film with Bill Pullman and Will Smith. We put a poor guy in an untenable situation, trapped on a planet when his colleagues are forced to take off and leave him behind. As a scientist, he does miraculous things to stay alive, including creating a greenhouse where he can grow potatoes (that just happen to be on board providing seed). That's OK. That's a plot element. He also has incredible knowledge of all the incredible stuff left behind on Mars. An amazing rover as well as a nuclear device. That's OK too because we can't have a plot without something for this guy to do. Where it falls down is in the reality of NASA (which we are told are a pack of insensitive boobs or nerds). They are going to do this and then they are going to do that. Jeff Daniels plays a stuck-in-the-mud guy who is only concerned about the politics of the job. I love Matt Damon. I've seen nearly everything he has done. He's adequate in this film but certainly not Academy Award material. He expresses almost no emotions other than a couple little under-control tantrums. What about the loneliness, the sameness of every day? Years of eating potatoes. Anyway, it is candy for those who don't want to think very much. It's very impresstive looking and the special effects are awesome. We've become a bit spoiled, I guess. Things by the formula.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The best of 2015...,"The film is the finest examples of science fiction and science fiction embodies everything required. Matt Damon has given the right role until the end of the case. Besides the fact that one does not really need. All movies have moved on their own. We have seen examples of this, such as the Buried and 127 Hours of very good quality movies. The master Ridley Scott's science fiction after a long separation has made a great comeback with this film case. After this film, Ridley Scott disappointing those who say the sound was cut. Thank you for this wonderful film Ridley masters. Maybe the best in 2015, as I mentioned in the title.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Smart, exciting crowd-pleaser","Exceptional sci-fi drama from Ridley Scott about an astronaut (Matt Damon) stranded on Mars and the efforts made to rescue him. As others have pointed out, there's more than a little bit here that reminds you of movies like Apollo 13 and Cast Away (particularly the former). I fail to see how that's a knock on it but it's being presented as such by some. We all come to movies with our own expectations and baggage. I'm not a Scott fanboy expecting him to wow me (his last two films were not great). I just wanted to be entertained and this did the trick. It's a movie aimed at the masses that is smarter than your average movie aimed at the masses. Maybe it's not for all nerds (a quick glance at some of the reviews shows a lot of inane nit-picking from people who seem to have no concept of dramatic license), but I didn't find the movie dumbed-down at all. I also want to say how much I appreciated that this managed to stay remarkably light and positive while still maintaining the tension, proving once again that you don't have to be depressing to be good drama. If you haven't seen The Martian yet, you should. It's a great film with a first-rate cast, good direction, and stellar effects. If you're just looking for a quality movie to entertain you for a while, this should be something you'll enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Martian: A Classic by all means.,"I read some of the reviews and decided to review this title myself. That's because I'd like you not to miss this lovely movie.It got some very bad criticism (Reviews&Ratings first page hosts at least 4 reviewers rating this title '1', lowest possible value on IMDb), most of which deals with Physics laws bended to screenwriter's desire.Well I just want to reassure you that even though I am among the nerdiest guys on the Internet, I didn't get annoyed from what I saw. Not once. And if you weren't annoyed by Tom Hanks and his boys killing almost an entire German Division before giving up in 'Save Private Ryan' you won't be annoyed too.It's a movie, not a documentary.

A welcome return to form for Ridley Scott.,"The Martian is a science fiction film starring Matt Damon and directed by Ridley Scott. I'm a big fan of Ridley Scott's work as a director, but I feel that most of his recent films have been very hit and miss. However, The Martian serves as a firm reminder as to why I am a fan of him in the first place. Not since Interstellar have I seen a sci-fi movie this thought-provoking or cleverly written.After an intense sandstorm devastates a manned mission to Mars, the crew are forced to abandon the desolate planet and astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead and left stranded. Unbeknownst to the crew, Watney survived, albeit injured from the storm, and tries to find ways to survive the inhospitable climate of the red planet. Being a botanist, Watney figures out how to grow food for himself out of the crew's leftover vegetable supplies and uses his scientific knowledge to create water using hydrogen crystals and oxygen from the crew's base camp. However, these supplies can only sustain him for a matter of months as a rescue mission from Earth will take 4 years to reach him. Watney must find a way to signal back to Earth that he is alive and is in urgent need of rescuing before he runs out of food and water.Despite its somewhat bleak tone of survival in a hostile terrain, the film still manages to have its fair share of funny and heartwarming moments, which are seamlessly intertwined into the film's more dramatic scenes. Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the wisecracking, yet intelligent astronaut Mark Watney and his positive attitude toward his survival is what keeps us invested in the story. The rest of the cast are great too, which includes Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Mara, Jessica Chastain, and even Donald Glover from Community. I was also particularly pleased with the film's pacing, there was never a moment that felt rushed or slow and boring. This is a welcome return to form for the legendary director Ridley Scott.I rate it a solid 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
fun thrilling space adventure,"The Ares III manned mission encounters a sand storm on Mars. Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left for dead as the rest of the crew evacuate on their spacecraft. Mission control back on Earth is shocked when they discover that Mark is actually alive and alone on Mars.Simply put, this is a fun space adventure. There is a good deal of Apollo 13 and Gravity. Damon is humorous and engaging. Meanwhile, the mission control back on earth is doing interesting things. Nobody is the villain. Jeff Daniels is a capable bureaucratic leader. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives the team intensity and has fun scenes with Mackenzie Davis. Almost every side character adds to the group. As for the spacecraft, it's interesting to have Jessica Chastain as the commander. The entire cast is great. The whole story is thrilling. There are unexpected turns. It has the feel of reality. A lot of praise has to be given to director Ridley Scott for a well constructed film. Also it's genius to give it a disco soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"safe,dull and ... predictable","I went to see the martian with high expectations,hoping to get a story that will take you by your throat keeps you on the tip of your seat and thrill you,surprise you...etc etc...i got nothing of the above!! instead i watched a very dull,predictable and very safe movie,Matt Damon,i really love as an actor but he never got to me,i simply was not taken by his acting,it just did not come across,the surrounding characters were so predictable,the young and beautiful captain,another young chick and a science head...the happy Latino...a German...oh please give me a break,who wrote this,and sorry to say but the name Ridley Scott seems to disappoint me more and more the last years.The scene where his garden gets blown away i saw coming from a mile,the science well,that was nicely done for a 10year your kid,but for me it looked like a Sunday afternoon cable movie,safe and predictable.There were so many things they could have done differently,also the music did nothing good for it.the photography could have been done so much better...i am very disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"The Martian: ""Cast Away"" Meets ""Apollo 13""","The Martian is a new Ridley Scott classic, featuring his best work in years, the best performance I've ever seen from Matt Damon, an outstanding supporting cast, a surprisingly funny screenplay from Daredevil creator Drew Goddard, and a great narrative that ties the film together beautifully.As expected with Ridley Scott films, the film itself is visually stunning. The landscape of Mars looks absolutely breathtaking, and the scenes aboard the Hermes and back on Earth are just as sharp in detail and scope. The way he chose to make this film made it almost seem like an exceptionally made biopic. Many times during this film, I legitimately believed that Mark Watney was a real, living person that was actually stranded on Mars for many months alone. It's Cast Away meets Apollo 13, and this marriage is crafted beautifully.Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant in this film. He plays Watney with so much optimism that it actually makes the depressing aspect of the film not as depressing for me. However, when he has to put on his dramatic chops in certain scenes, he truly commits to the drama of the situation, and that right there is true Ridley Scott suspense for you. The supporting cast, everyone involved, all do great work as well. Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor. He is one of the best actors working today, and this movie and 12 Years a Slave shows how far he's come.The most surprisingly element about this movie though was the screenplay. The film is hilarious in some parts, in fact I'd argue that it's funnier than most comedies that have come out this year. What makes to movie unique to me was Watney's optimistic point of view. He believes that he isn't going to die on Mars, and this transforms this rather depressing situation into something comical instead. But when you really think about it, this is a very personal film about some people coming together to save somebody. That's it. And in today's world, it's nice to hear an story about people coming together to save one of their own.I have nothing bad to say about The Martian. It's the best film I've seen all year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Futurism and Nostalgia,"From the earliest days of cinema, films have explored what man can do when cut off from society (and indeed, the interest of the topic pre-dates the art form: think how long ago Robinson Crusoe was written). But in a world ever more monitored, depictions of life beyond borders are often set in space. These include both fictional tales and true stories. 'Apollo 13', for example, is a riveting film, but mainly because of its raw material: in 1971, a manned space mission suffered from an explosion and the astronauts were stranded, thousands of miles from help; amazingly, they managed to fix their stricken craft and make it home alive.'The Martian' is a fictional story, but is in some ways Apollo 13-redux. It starts with a gripping scene where, post-disaster, the hero is forced to operate on himself: gripping, yes, but also not a scene that needs to be set on Mars. And subsequently, it can't quite live up to this compelling start. As I see it, there are three main problems. Firstly, some implausible science (how can you grow plants without carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?) and psychology (the story is set over a period of years, but we never really get the impression that the character is stranded alone for so long). Secondly, the need for the Hollywood virtues where force of character compels eventual triumph. And finally, perhaps, that the remarkable thing about Apollo 13 is not that its crew could have saved themselves, but that they did: the triumph was not one over the laws of physics, but rather a win against the odds. In a fictional story, this is a less compelling narrative structure: why does the character get repeatedly lucky? Simply because the screenwriters wrote it that way.Yet in spite of its faults, the film's basic set up draws you in, and by the (admittedly melodramatic) rescue scenes, one can't help but watch on the edge of one's seat; and keeping an audience interested for over two hours is not such an easy thing to do. Perhaps the fact that in the real world we've basically given up on manned space travel adds to the appeal: this may be a futuristic story, but at the same time, it also feels like a tale of something we used to do, to boldly go beyond the limits of our planet to see what we might find.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"If you don't care about sounds in space, then you might really enjoy this.","My title sounds sarcastic, but I really mean it. If it doesn't bother you when films depict bangs, crashes, rumbles, booms, and pew-pew ""laser"" beams (add Austin Powers finger quotes) in the vacuum space, then load up your popcorn and get set for a wild ride. If, on the other hand, the aforementioned cinematic gimmicks bother you, then you still might enjoy this film but just be prepared for that and more.Although The Martian gives us just an occasional low, tasteful rumble when spaceships fly by, that's the least of its scientific transgressions, and things get pretty ""Mars Attacks"" preposterous in the final 20 minutes. Normally I wouldn't even bring this up since basically EVERY space movie in the history of EVER, except for 2001: A Space Odyssey (1969), has sound effects in space. But the problem is that ""The Martian"" takes a very committed, scientific, realistic tone which sets us up for an extremely scientific, realistic story. It falls short on that mark, and rather than bore you and pretentiously inflate my own ego by pointing out every flaw, I'll let you read the other reviews, or better yet: just accept that there are scientific loopholes so big that you can drive a Quasar through it (and I'm not talking about the car made in 1967).Ok if I haven't lost you, then let's talk about the fun stuff. The special effects are FANTASTIC. Director Ridley Scott (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"") outshines himself once again with a truly magnificent feast for the eyes, and especially if you watch it on a large UHD screen, that alone is worth the price of admission.The story itself is riveting. It's a tale of survival on a barren planet where Matt Damon fights a constant battle NOT against little green men or pew-pew ""laser"" beams but against the cold and sterile reality of space. That was my favorite part of the movie, the fact that it can carry our interest for 2 1/2 hours with the only real conflict being how to survive on a planet where nothing works.Matt Damon does an incredible job of acting, portraying a complex character who realizes he's a dead man but rises to the challenge and pits every brain cell he's got against the universe. Similar to the excellent ""Cast Away"" or even the iconic ""Papillon"", it's a story about never giving up even if it kills you, and that regardless of whether we get a happy ending or a sad one, is the takeaway of this flick.I would group this film with other modern, minimalistic sci-fi flicks that take a realistic (""boring"" to some) approach but deliver a lot of drama. Flicks like ""Moon"", ""Solaris"", or on the older shelf ""Contact"", ""2010"" and possibly even the grandfather of them all, ""2001"" (though don't get your hopes up too high as I mentioned up front) will give you a taste for what's in store if you decide to watch ""The Martian"".",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Great, realistic enough Sci-Fi movie","This is a great sci-fi movie that's realistic enough to not be weighed down by being unrealistic or ridiculous in that way.The acting and plot are great. The story is engaging, and Matt Damon does a great job in playing a character that everyone is trying to save (he always seems to be playing a character that everyone is trying to save or everyone is trying to kill)One thing that I do think weighs this movie down, and why it's a 9/10 and not a 10/10, is all the swearing. I can understand some swearing here and there, but it does get to a point in the Martian that the swearing feels gratuitous and can detract a bit to a lot from the viewing experience depending on how much you do or don't mind swearing in movies.Other than that I'd say the movie is fairly accurate to the book, and it's extremely well done, and is a definite must watch if you like it when movies at least try to put a good effort into being as realistic as possible.9/10 would recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ridley Scott back in form,"The poster for Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi masterpiece Alien told us that in space, no-one can hear you scream. 36 years later, and it would seem that no-one can hear you colonising a planet in a desperate effort to stay alive either. Scott's latest, which has recently invited controversy due to its ridiculous Golden Globe victory in the 'Musical or Comedy' category, takes a refreshingly optimistic view of one man's struggle when left stranded on Mars with only his wits and a never-ending list of obstacles to overcome to keep him from losing his sanity. After the let-down of Scott's recent return to the sci-fi genre with Prometheus, The Martian has the director firmly back in form.In 2035, the crew of the Ares III, commanded by Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), are exploring the surface of Mars when a violent dust storm forces them to flee. Botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by debris and when his space suit reports a breach and no sign of life, the remaining crew reluctantly escape presuming Mark to be dead. When he awakes hours later with an antenna protruding from his stomach and his oxygen levels dangerously low, he makes his way back to the living quarters and quickly sets about calculating how long he can survive on what he has. Discovering he only has about a month left, he ""sciences the s**t"" out of whatever he can salvage and successfully starts growing food.As ludicrous as The Martian's inclusion in the Musical or Comedy category was, the film is still very funny. In one of many efforts to hold on to his sanity, Mark talks to himself while recording a log of his actions, revealing a laid-back and sardonic sense of humour which seems to come naturally to the actor. With little in the way of explosive set-pieces, The Martian opts to be subtly engaging as opposed to outright exciting. Mark's can-do attitude gives a stubborn optimism to the movie's outlook, and with comments such as ""f**k you, Mars"" following one particularly hard-earned achievement, it's hard not to cheer him along.Also absent are any suggestions of puffy-chested patriotism or evil- doing among the people back on Earth trying to bring Mark home. The only person resembling a 'baddie' who mission director Vincent Karpoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) clashes heads with is NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), but even he retains his humanity throughout. If there is a criticism to be had, it's that Mark never feels truly in danger in such an inhospitable landscape. But The Martian takes care to lay out and explain all the science-y stuff going on with clarity and without heavy exposition, and although I wouldn't have a clue if what they were saying was nonsense or mathematically correct, you have to marvel at the detail. A smart and unexpectedly joyous space survival movie, with what is undoubtedly Damon's finest performance to date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Enjoyable, albeit, overrated.","I saw this film on it's opening night, with a group of friends from work. The film's beginning drew me in, and Matt Damon's lighthearted humor was quite amusing.That being said, the formulaic plot, lack of character development outside of Matt Damon's character, and eventually tiring jokes wore me out by the end of the movie. It must've been a decent film, since I did find myself laughing now and then, and I also found myself rooting for Matt Damon. That said, it's a highly forgettable flick, and I don't understand why it's so beloved.Watch it if you have the chance, but don't expect an incredible film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Smart, funny, eventful, and well performed","The Martian, based on the novel of the same name written by author Andy Weir, is an eventful movie that serves both as an epic sci-fi adventure, but also provides viewers with some smart laughs. Those are who not that interested in sci-fi will probably end up liking the movie, because it is not unrealistic. Acting wise, Matt Damon puts in an excellent performance as the lead, and supporting actors such as Jessica Chastain, also put in solid performances. Probably one of the best aspects of the film, is that the mood of the movie is quite optimistic, considering that the situation of being stuck on mars, is quite a scary one, that requires a lot of panic. In Conclusion, The martian is a fun, smart movie, that is likely to be enjoyed by most audiences who watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Clean, precise and not so unique","As always, Riddley Scott delivered another visually beautiful science fiction piece, with all the ingredients to make it a commercial success.From top acting names, to state of the art VFX, there is not much bad that you could say about this movie. Unfortunately, the fact is that this story is not really new. In fact it is really old. A guy stranded on a desolate inhospitable place, who tries to survive against all odds? Come on!!I would go to see this movie with different expectations, it it wasn't so heavily advertised as a masterpiece. Which it really isn't. The movie is just fun, with sprinkle of comedy and heavy dose of pathetic closeups of Matt, Jessica and rest of the crew.I guess all that money spent had to payoff, so what's better way than to make it appealing to wide audience, from kids to grandparents. And that is OK. But I cannot escape the feeling that R. Scott has lost the pace with modern times, and brought a little archaic style to this movie.Satisfied but not impressed. That is my final judgement.Good 2 hrs of fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Total Lack of Emotion and Suspense,"During a storm in Mars, the astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit by an antenna and presumed dead by his captain and crew that cannot find him. Captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) seeks him out and decides to departure with her crew. However, he has survived and finds that was left behind short of supplies and without communication to Earth. Mark is botanic and uses his knowledge to plant potatoes in a green house he has prepared. Meanwhile in NASA the scientists find that Mark is alive and try at any cost to bring him back to Earth. Will they succeed?""The Martian"" is a film with fantastic special effects and cinematography. However there is a total lack of emotions and suspense and it is hard to understand the hype around this film. Mark Watney seems to be a combination of Robinson Crusoe with MacGyver with his ideas and solutions. However, he never feels depressed or in despair with the loneliness or with his doomed situation. His rescue is a rip-off ""Gravity"" that is better and better. If the viewer watches this movie with great expectation, he or she will be very disappointed.

Nice idea but..disappointing,This is partially a Robinson Crusoe story for 21 century.. A man all by himself trying to survive. Or Castaway in which Tom Hank talks to a pair of ice skating shoes.And partially a repeated story about travel to space. This movie is full of technical errors such as: 1. How do the earth people instantanuously communicate with the Martian when it should take the light about 4 min to get there and 4 min to come back. This seems such a basic error that it makes you wonder if Ridley was in sound mind when he made this movie.2. How does the Martian ( Mat Damon) get a spacecraft and fuel to lift from Mars. Didn't the main space craft rocket leave Mars without him? Maybe they had taken two spacecrafts and twice as much fuel to Mars with them which we know is not true.3. Isn't Mars more hostile then they show in the movie?Etc.,,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Movie Vs. Book: The Martian,"During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meagre supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.Andy Weir started writing a book about an astronaut stranded on Mars. He hadn't had any success with publishers in the past, so he begun posting chapters to his website. That was 2011. People really liked it - so much that Crown Publishing made it become a best-seller. Weir tells this story through largely detailed work logs. The Martian is impressively geeky. Smart science-fiction is such a rarity these days. Our parents witnessed the first man in the Moon decades ago and we witnessed the landing of curiosity on Mars: WE are the Mars generation. That's the inspiration. Astronauts really are the real pioneers. They do something incredibly heroic, brave and risky but also incredibly necessary. This book is adapted by Ridley Scott, who transformed science-fiction cinema with Blade Runner and Alien. Once again, Scott goes back to the future, which is a familiar destination for him. Andy Weir and screenplay writers wrote us a love letter to science. They obviously skipped a lot of complications in the film, there's so much in the book but they decide to pick out some bits and leave others which is natural and not a problem at all. You definitely don't need to have read the book to enjoy the movie but you definitely SHOULD read the book because it's fantastic!Mr Weir, from online serial to book to screen, has brought a little appreciated genre into the mainstream: the nerd thriller. This hyper-technical genre, deeply developed by novelists does something that classic thrillers do not: it puts the nerd (female or male) in the centre of the action. The intellectual is the hero. Imagine that instead of Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg was the star of Mission: Impossible. This is an adventure for those of us who believe, deep in our hearts, that the heroes of Star Trek are Spock and Scotty: the science officer and the engineer. And writing about The Martian seems to be bringing out the geekiness even more in your humble correspondent. Still its heart, humour and rousing story of perseverance and global collaboration promise to broaden the film's appeal well beyond nerds. A lot of people - including myself - responded to the characters in the book. The humour and the way he keeps his logical, practical spirit in order to solve one problem at a time; is what makes this character compelling and super duper interesting. Andy Weir admits freely that his character has little inner life. Watney simply pushes forward, putting crises into a mental lock box and figuring out how to survive. ""It could have been a deep psychological thing"", he said ""but that's not the kind of book I like to read and it's not the kind of book I wanted to write"".Engineer at NASA - who are hoping to get people to Mars someday - said Mr Weir has captured something important about what make Humans want to explore. Mark Watney character represents the very cutting edge of humanity and what's possible and what we know we all need someday; which is move some of the species off the planet to ensure the species survival. Nowadays still, there are people working toward that goal. ""Watney's everybody's favourite"" because he's the brave, resourceful American optimist. We all know a smart ass nerd just like him. Moreover, if you're going to be stuck alone with an actor, who guides you through a story with nothing but video diaries, you need someone who can exude the right amount of humour and confidence. In significant measure due to his character's mordant humour, Matt Damon provides a very good company during the long stretches when he's on screen alone. Plus the actor's physicality makes Mark's capability entirely credible.Matt Damon has the charm and wit to land the tricky one-liners. You try making ""Fuck you, Mars!"" sound cool. From there Watney must not only come to grips with the most dire situation any astronaut has ever faced, but also mends his own gory abdominal wound in a scene that is Prometheus-level in its guts wrenching body horror. Watney is supposedly a symbol of hope for all humanity in the final act. Creating at the same time a new Manifest Destiny. This movie is the Die Hard of space film. Matt Damon gets stab, he gets frozen, he gets exploded and even burnt. Scenes back on Earth provide a hectic, densely populated counterweight to the Martian aridity. The rest of the cast is diverse in a way that feels genuinely authentic. In the story the rest of us on Earth have this understanding of what this man sacrificed and the beauty of that. They do everything they can to bring him back because he represents the best of us all.However (...) > Head over to my blog to read more about The Martian",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A True Love Letter to Science and Humanity,"Sir Ridley Scott is finally back on track. There's no argument that his last couple films have not been up to his standard. However, now he has gone back to his roots to bring us an adaptation of the sci-fi novel by Andy Weir The Martian.The story itself is pretty straightforward. Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead when stuck with debris during a storm on Mars. When the rest of his crew decides to abort and he turns out to be alive, Watney must ration his remaining resources in an attempt to same himself and make contact with NASA. Despite the familiar storyline (can you say Cast Away meets Apollo 13?), only a true mastermind behind the camera can give the story so much depth and make it so enthralling.The cast is definitely one of the best ensembles of the year. Everyone does fantastic with the roles given to them, namely Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels. And while everyone does a great job in the movie, the man whose shoulders the film truly rests on is Matt Damon, and he excels in every scene he is in. The audience is always eager to follow Damon's successes and failures on Mars. Damon is so good at playing a wise- cracking scientist and showing us what it might actually be like to get left on Mars alone. With Damon's character, the movie is allowed to delve into themes about what makes us human and our drive to help one another.One of the aspects of the film that truly fascinated me was how much science was explained out in the movie. The science is always intriguing and never makes one feel as though they are in school needing to remember everything they heard.The Martian is easily one of the best films of the year and a very welcome return to form for Sir Ridley Scott. The entire cast excels at bringing the audience a fascinating trip not only of the inner-workings of NASA, but of a man's journey of survival as he is left on Mars.""I admit it's fatally dangerous, but I'd get to fly around like Iron Man""",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I wasn't overly fussy about it to be honest...,"(Credit IMDb)During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.The Martian was a major disappointment for me. Mars looks fantastic and everything looks great, but I wasn't able to ever fully get into it like I wanted to. It never felt like Matt Damon was in any true danger to me despite how it was presented otherwise. It tries way too hard to be epic and that's one of the reason it fails. I also felt it lacked suspense. One thing Gravity did well was deliver suspense, but The Martian doesn't. This surprised me a lot because Ridley Scott is a master at suspense. Even though I didn't really go nuts over this movie like a lot of people did, Matt Damon is fantastic. He holds the film together with his excellent performance. I can't really say the same for the rest. Everybody else isn't developed that well. Jessica Chastain is a very capable actress, but she isn't given much to do as I'd hoped. Wiig, Daniels, Bean, Mara, Ejiofor all do fine in the roles they are given. Ejiofor and Mara shine the most out of the people I listedThis movie has its moments, but I was very disappointed overall. It looks great, Damon is superb, but I wasn't in love with it like so many others. Hopefully I'm not alone6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A low-key triumph on a massive budget,"Ridley Scott's new film ""The Martian"" does not mess around with buildup or anything in the way of expository drama; it gets right to the point and recognizes why you came to see it. It opens with Ares III, NASA's manned mission to Mars, experiencing a treacherous storm upon arriving on the red planet. Debris is flying and visibility is next to nothing, and before the astronauts (Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña, and Kate Mara) can take off, fellow astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by a flying antenna and presumed killed. The group takes off with the notion that Watney is dead.Following NASA head Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) making the announcement of Watney's death, we see that Watney is indeed very much alive on Mars, albeit slightly handicapped after being impaled in the stomach by the antenna. Watney now has to essentially operate on a field of landmines whilst acting as a scientist MacGyver to try and sustain life on Mars, a place where presumably nothing grows and anything can go wrong at any time. In addition to monitoring water reclamation, oxygen, and atmospheric levels, he winds up growing an array of potatoes with the help of the feces of him and his crew and makes a small home for himself. It will over four years for another manned mission to rescue him, but NASA headquarters, comprised of Sanders and assistants like Vincent (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Annie (Kristen Wiig), is determined to bring him back home in a timely fashion.Headquarters is also struggling with the idea of telling the surviving members of the Ares III mission that Watney is alive, which ignites a fiery ethical side to the film's story. With that, ""The Martian"" is essentially a gigantic teamwork exercise where everyone feels human, which is a pleasant attribute for Scott, whose recent films have really lacked in the filmmaking craft and humanization elements. Scott's visual effects and grandscale directing usually never fail, but when these become the focus and human characters and the little touches (the science, the cause-and-effect relationships, and the narrative interest) become secondary or gravely shortchanged, then there's a real issue with his films on a macro level.""The Martian,"" even with its nearly two and a half hour runtime, remains consistently interesting because it's a generally optimistic film, surprisingly enough. Watney is a wisecracker a lot of the time, even in the face of certain doom, and seeing NASA's constant efforts to bring him home show a certain diligence on their behalf works to make this film surprisingly hopeful. Then there's the roundtable of rich performances here; aside from Damon, who does solid work being the only actor on-screen in his scenes for his sheer honesty mixed with vulnerability, Daniels and Ejiofor work off of each other incredibly well together here.Consider the scene following Ares III's escape from Mars during the storm, when Watney is still presumed dead; the two consult one another about what to do with Watney's remains whilst subsequently trying to find a way to turn it into a more positive, caring PR display by sending another mission out to recover his corpse. This is a perfect scene in the way that it shows the way corporations and organizations balance humanity while considering their bottom-line, and who better to play figures in those pivotal positions of power than Daniels, who's work on ""The Newsroom"" has gone on to be acclaimed, and Ejiofor, who, much like David Oyelowo, will likely win an Oscar in the next ten years.Aside from a reliance on montages instead of actual exposition, ""The Martian""'s biggest problem as a film is the fact that we simply do not get enough time with Watney alone. The audience can never get a strong grasp on a relationship with this character simply because we're never allotted enough one-on-one time without the intrusion of mission control. We needed more scenes with Watney ostensibly helpless, trying to farm, or simply trying to get by on what little he has to surround himself and the film doesn't do that.""The Martian"" also makes fairly strong use of its 3D elements, using it as a tool of immersion rather than a gimmick that works to add a surcharge to already high movie ticket prices. Consider the storm scene, which completely floods the screen with indiscernible debris and disarray; the scene is only emphasized with the benefit of 3D and makes the experience that much more horrifying, being that, like the characters, we can barely see a thing.Above all, this is a film destined to please a crowd; in addition, it also keeps its pathos down considerably, doesn't do a whole lot of pandering to a crowd anxious to see action, and never loses sight of its deeply human and remarkable story. It also reaffirms the value of logical problem-solving in the face of a truly unexpected, and granted unprecedented, time of tumultuous uncertainty. It's a low-key triumph made on a nine figure budget.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not as great as I expected,"I was somewhat disappointed by 'The Martian', maybe because I had such high expectations of it. In my opinion the movie failed to really immerse you into the action or make you feel the danger of space, the way that for example 'Gravity' did.Also, it came across as feel-good NASA propaganda. Maybe that one is on me for being so cynical, I am not sure. The attempts at humor never made me laugh and sometimes made me feel embarrassed.I am not saying that it is a bad movie.

It's a long movie, which manages to keep you on full alert the whole 2.5 hours.The 3D effects are nicely done: the scenes look razor-sharp and realistic: the Martian scenes make one really believe that you're on Mars, the space equipment is also very believable and the camera work is very good.The only thing I found missing was that there was no story at all about the family of the astronaut.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
No character development or introspection,"For all the excitement, awe, and energy that are worked up in Ridley Scott's The Martian, the story might just as well have taken place in New York's Central Park with the hero stuck up in a tree. Instead of the sense of mystery and wonder (and terror) that could be expected from being stranded on a different world, what we have are buckets full of the down-to-earth (or up-to-Mars), nitty-gritty practicalities of science and a predictable plot that leaves no room for character development or introspection. In the story, written by Drew Goddard and based on the 2011 novel by Andy Weir, science is the redeemed and the redeemer, the hero and the heroine, the beginning and the end.Shot in 3-D, the film's fictional aspect is established almost immediately when we find out that NASA is actually engaged in space exploration rather than tallying up its budget deficit. Though we are not told the purpose of the Ares III manned mission to Mars, we know soon enough that the crew is forced to abandon their plans when they discover that a huge life-threatening sandstorm is fast approaching. Like Home Alone, the crew takes off for home but - wait a minute - they forgot Kevin. In this case, Kevin is fellow crew member Mark Watney, played with excruciating blandness by Matt Damon. Watney, presumed to be dead after the storm strikes, turns the tables on the departed crew and decides to stay alive, though according to his best judgment, his reprieve will only be temporary.Watney must use his ingenuity and skills as a Botanist to solve his food problems to stay alive, but that is not his only concern. He has no way to communicate with Earth, knows that the next planned Mars mission will not be for four years, and that the landing spot on Mars is 3,200 kilometers away. As Watney explains in his video diaries, to survive he is going to have to ""science the s..t out of this."" He first makes changes to the Rover, his only vehicle, to allow for longer trips and then sets about growing potatoes in an artificial environment. Whether he likes potatoes or not, they are now his only source of nourishment and means of survival. The subject of embarrassingly phony eulogies back on Earth, NASA is shocked when satellite photos of Mars reveal that Watney has defied the odds and is still alive.The crew returning home on the Hermes spacecraft are not informed, however, to avoid distracting them from their flight - a decision made by NASA director Terry Sanders, played by a miscast Jeff Daniels. When Sanders, marketing chief Annie (Kristen Wiig) and NASA mission director Vincent (Chiwetel Ejiofor) find out that Mark is alive, they must find a way to ""Bring Him Home"" or else the film's promotional department will get very upset. Eventually, Watney finds a way to talk to NASA by using communications devices from the Pathfinder probe, dormant since 1997, but the film provides little insight into Watney's character and he seems to be emotionally unaffected by his plight, telling lame jokes as if he was planting potatoes in his back yard.The more interesting story takes place at Houston's Johnson Space Center where plans are underway to send a probe to Mars to resupply Watney so he can last another several years on the planet, then return to the spacecraft carrying colleagues Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean), Rick Martinez (Michael Peña), Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan) and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie). After the launch ends up in disaster, help arrives via the Chinese space program and the Ares III crew itself must now make a crucial decision that has life or death consequences. The Martian has some fine technical achievements including breathtaking vistas of the Martian landscape by cinematographer Dariusz Wolsky and it is an entertaining film, yet all its achievements are subsumed in an atmosphere as exciting as a how-to-manual.Disco music left behind by Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) such as songs by David Bowie and Gloria Gaynor, attempt to enhance the film's entertainment quotient and appeal to younger viewers but they only serve to distract viewers from whatever reality the story has. To its credit, The Martian has a humane message empowered by the enormity of the cooperation required to attempt to save the life of one man and it reminds us of the days when we all had a common purpose, yet the film lacks conviction and never moves past banal dialogue such as ""YES"", ""let's do it,"" and all the standard clichés of triumphalism. While Damon may have scienced the s..t out of his predicament, the film has also succeeded in sciencing the beauty out of it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Quite Possibly the Best of 2015,"During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.Although at this point I have only seen three of the eight Best Picture nominees, I feel confident in saying that ""The Martian"" deserves to win. Although Ridley Scott is not nominated for Best Director (odd considering this is his best film in a long time or possibly ever), and the only acting nomination is for Matt Damon (who will likely lose to Leonardo DiCaprio)... this movie nails it on the story alone.By all means, this can win in the Best Adapted Screenplay category, as well. No, I have not read the original book so I do not know what Drew Goddard put into it. And no, I have not seen all the other nominees yet. I suspect ""Big Short"" is also an excellent script. But again, this film succeeds based on two things: incredible suspense and a strong script. Is all the science strictly accurate? No. Apparently some key things, such as the ""fierce storm"", are not correct. But we believe it. Everyone speaks as though they know what they say, and unlike ""Star Wars"" (or even ""Star Trek"") this is clearly based on reality.In recent years, it seems that a space movie somehow sneaks into the top Academy nominees. After ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar"", we have this. And I dare say they are getting better. ""Gravity"" was a good exploration of visuals, but not a deep film. ""Interstellar"" took everything to the next level, even to the point of being a mind-bender. Here, I think we have the perfect balance: hard science and space danger. What could have been two hours of boring, bland scenes of a man in a desert end up being exciting and you can feel the desperation -- and more importantly the endless optimism and hope.The bulk of the film's nominations are in production design, sound and other effects. These are well-deserved, and it may take home a few. Not being an expert, it is hard to judge sound editing. But this is the sort of movie where such a thing can make or break the picture. There will be some strong competition, but the designs of the NASA equipment are impressive and the sounds are excellent. The visual effects are a harder sell, with some of the low-gravity moments seeming a bit off somehow.The takeaway: expect a win or two in the technical categories. Of the bigger awards, Damon is a contender for Best Actor but will not win. Best Adapted Screenplay ought to be a lock, and if it gets nothing else this is the film's strong suit. For my money, ""The Martian"" has Best Picture written all over it, but the experts are leaning more towards ""The Revenant"" or ""Spotlight""... on that, we will have to agree to disagree.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"""Is there life on Mars"" - yes there is","When I was a 10-year old kid my favourite TV programme was Gerry Anderson's U.F.O. and my favourite EVER episode of that was one called ""Survival"". In it, Colonel Paul Foster (the late Michael 'nearly Bond' Billington) was stranded believed dead on the moon a hundred miles from Moonbase with diminishing oxygen supplies and with the deadly threat of a similarly stranded alien to also deal with. To say it fired my youthful imagination would be an understatement. With Ridley Scott's new film ""The Martian"" we have an almost identical plot, albeit without the alien involvement.Matt Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney who after a freak Martian storm is left for dead by his colleagues in the NASA crew of the ""Hermes"" (led by the excellent Jessica Chastain). By ""sciencing the s**t out of this"" he struggles to survive in the airless and inhospitable landscape. By chance, his presence is detected by NASA and the action switches to the NASA team – principally NASA Director Jeff Daniels, Mars mission director Chiwetel Ejiofor, PR lady Kirsten Wiig, JPL specialist Benedict Wong and ""Hermes"" flight director Sean Bean – and their struggle to save him given the logistical impossibilities involved.I loved this film. In fact, I'll go as far as to say this is my film of the year so far. Matt Damon – never 'Mr Charisma' in most films – is spectacular here, delivering his video logs (which – particularly in 3D – works better than Tom Hanks talking to footballs in ""Castaway"") with a wit and charm that is quite endearing. The supporting cast all bring home the bacon with strong performances, with Ejiofor positively twinkling in the role. The rest of the ""Hermes"" crew, especially Michael Peña and the cute Kate Mara, are also excellent.The screenplay by Drew Goddard (""Lost"", ""World War Z"") and based on the bestselling book by Andy Weir generally works well. A few of the lines, my wife noted, smelled a bit of cheese (some of those from Sean Bean in particular), and there is a largely underdeveloped Chinese side-story (presumably to woo a Chinese audience), but overall the mood of the film carries the script triumphantly forward. (There's a nice nod and a wink to Bean's involvement in Lord of the Rings as well, which made me chuckle).The film also looks marvelous, with the Mars sets and special effects being spectacular, the Mars spacecraft being beautifully realized, and some very impressive long-duration zero-gravity scenes aboard the ""Hermes"" that boggle the mind.In retrospect, the film's success might be deemed to be assured given it is an amalgam of some notable film classics of recent times: the spectacle of ""Interstellar""; the intrigue of ""Moon""; the vacuum-based-perils of ""Gravity""; the hopelessness of ""Castaway"" and the 'world holds its breath' tension of ""Apollo 13"". But after the blockbuster food-mixer stops whirring, the whole thing gels beautifully and despite its fairly long running time (141 minutes) boredom is never close and you leave the theatre buzzing. A key factor in maintaining the tension for the running time is that this is a Ridley Scott film: whilst other directors might insist on a 'Hollywood' ending, with Scott at the helm you can never be sure which way the story might twist in the final reel.(And I'm not letting on here).Unlike last year's ""Gravity"", and the no-doubt accurate but mind-boggling ""Interstellar"", the science all holds up pretty well (although I did have serious reservations about the robustness of polythene sheeting and duct-tape replacing a door at one point).Harry Gregson-Willams' score apes Jerry Goldsmith's ""Alien"" a bit in places, but works well and is massively and joyfully supported by a wide range of disco classics, neatly incorporated into the plot.Go see this film, ideally at the cinema and in 3D: I doubt you will be disappointed.

It's OK but overrated,'The Martian' isn't a bad movie at all but I do think it's overrated. A running time of 2 hours 30 minutes is too long and it could have been 20 minutes shorter.THE GOOD. It looks great. The acting is reasonably solid and the story does keep you watching.THE BAD. Predictable. I kept watching really hoping that the ending would surprise and shock me but it was boringly and disappointingly as expected. A lot of technical talk which went way over my head. I also never really got a sense that Matt Damon was ever in grave danger which I thought would be the main theme of the movie.

The story of hope...,"The story in brief:The man called Mark Watney from NASA's space mission gets left behind on Mars alone as a result of a tragic incident and his teammates believe that he is dead. Mark realizes that he has somehow survived through this accident & decides to survive for some more days. This hope of surviving pushes him to all his limits & come up with insane solutions, which no one would ever imagine.What this movie taught me:Even after realizing that his team has left him alone on Mars, he never blames any of his teammates
->How often we do this? We keep on blaming others for our own situationsHe uses his knowledge as a botanist to the true potential & grows potatoes on the soil of Mars with his own poop
->Did we ever think about our true potential?Once everything was set up & going as per his plan, his small experiment blows all his crops & he is back to zero again. But this doesn't stop him.
->Ups & downs are part of life, they shouldn't shake you up. The right attitude will always get you out of any troubleHe would record himself every single day with a hope that when he dies, someone would listen to his story of surviving on Mars
->Live your life as if you are writing a book, which others would love to read later onHe kept that smile on his face till the very last moment in space, when his team actually rescues him

Grand Sci-Fi Adventure for Kids,"The Martian is a dyed-in-the-wool Hollywood movie of a grand space adventure. The movie's screen-writing and direction is, true to its subject, like an optimized space-craft, which has exactly those components it requires for its singular objective and absolutely nothing else. The objective of 'The Martian' is to be a good family sci-fi space adventure, following in footsteps of E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Zathura: A Space Adventure, etc. , that is specifically targeted at the sense of humor of kids and young teens of this generation. The movie also has elements of nostalgia targeted specifically at the generation of their parents. The Martian serves as a vessel that carries its entertaining feel-good story to its intended audience and does it well, but carries little else for anybody else.It is likely that this movie will disappoint several viewers, not so much because it is inherently bad, but more so because it does nothing to satisfy their expectations. In past decade, many PG and G movies have found massive adult following because movie expected to be for kids have turned out to be remarkably deep and rich in story that appeals to grown-ups. The Martian is totally opposite to this trend, in that, it is a movie expected to be for grown-ups with serious space exploration, marooning, desolation, imminent and impending death, existential crisis, nonchalant bureaucratic space administration - an 'Office Space' in space on a Monday... with car keys missing and presentation document lost! The Martian is 'Office Space' that starts on Friday 4 pm with a bit of issues till 5pm, continues through a balmy weekend with well behaved kids, friendly neighbors, BBQ with BYOB, lots of blue clouds and Sun and ends on Sunday night. There are a few instances of trouble with lighter fluid and getting the BBQ going, but nothing that will erase that smile off your face or place the weekend in any real jeopardy. In the end, the kids learn that getting a BBQ requires some patience, and problems of missing charcoal and pickles can be resolved with an indefatigable cheery disposition and lots of banter with your enormously friendly neighbors. So much so that even the, otherwise ignored, Chinese family in the neighborhood can be invited to join the BBQ. Big things can be accomplished when everyone pitches in and works as a team!Summary: Take your kids and go see this movie as a family in a theater near you. It's good entertainment and inspiration for kids. Every generation of kids should have a movie that inspires them to dream of becoming an astronaut someday. The Martian does this well. Others may want to skip this one or watch it on BluRay on a slow evening.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Optimistic Sci-Fi,"Great and refreshing Sci-Fi movie for the time it was released in. It was fun watching a character like this stay optimistic and hopeful despite the dire situation he was put in. A lot of Sci-Fi movies of the late 2000s and throughout the 2010s were real downers with a lot of stories without a silver lining or hope, such as Life, Voyagers and Ad Astra. I loved seeing Matt Damon in a genuine Science Fiction role and he knocked it out of the park in this one as he was so entertaining to watch.You see him try to keep his sanity for over a year with minimal outside communication, aswell as working everything out on his own and seeing the light side of his dark and seemingly hopeless situation. It feels so good when he works out challenging problems and have his positivity remain in tack. It's compelling acting and a really great character!Overall it's one of Ridley Scott's best in a long time and is my third best film from him behind Gladiator and Alien.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A sci-fi not only for sci-fi fans,"The Martian is one of my most favourite films. It is a Ridley Scott's action sci-fi film which is based on the book by writer Andy Weir. Matt Damon stars as an astronaut Mark Watney - ""the Martian"".
The plot starts at the end of the research mission on Mars. NASA astronaut, a botanist and mechanical engineer Mark Watney went missing in a dust storm during a mission on Mars. The rest of his crew left the planet, thinking he is dead. But Watney survived and he must find the way how to survive alone on the foreign planet and how to send signal to the Earth to say that he's alive.
Although the film is quite slow-paced and there are not many action scenes, it is still immersive. That's because the place of the film set as well as the special effects are outstanding and make the film realistic and credible. The soundtrack is also good, the music can be heard almost during whole film because there are not many dialogues.
In my opinion, this film is really gripping and spectacular. Every aspect of the film is really good. However, I found Matt Damon's performance the best thing about the film. Overall, it is a really enjoyable film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Going Mars is now fun,"The movie started just like any other adventure movie. The trailer promised a really intriguing story line. This movie is based on a book and for me many things were made differently than the book. Matt Damon was usual a perfect choice for the role. He had to portray the struggle and willingness to survive alone in an absolutely no mans land. I liked the acting of everyone but the plot line was not very interesting. It was very common and obvious that the crew who left him will go and save him at some point and everything will be alright at the end. I watch the 1080p version (i think) and the VFX was magnificent and was true to the story. All in all, it was a good time pass movie, not at all boring and fun to watch",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Interesting Sci-Fi film.,"The Martian is a Science Fiction adventure film with Matt Damon in the lead role. Directed by the most famous world acclaimed Sir Ridley Scott, the film details in scientific scenarios and it's future endeavors. From red-planet's environment to the common techniques, it's an engaging experience, which not only entertains but also educates us about knitty-gritty of space science. It's definitely one of Ridley Sir's best.The Martian tells the story of an Earthling, who gets trapped in the red planet due to stellar accidents. How he manages to survive in the red planet by combining all forms of scientific knowledge is the storyline. He attempts to survive which turns out successful. From biology to electronics he does it all just to return Home safely. And after many life critical attempts he is faced with life-death situation in the cosmic space. With the help of his crew members, using raw techniques, which is not recommended in cosmos, he lands safely in Earth. Later on returning he becomes the survival strategist in the cosmic field. Depicting an event of survivalism with happy climax does satisfyingly ends the film.It's a thilling film from start to finish but ends in positive tone. The protagony is not only a man of science but also a practially moral person. He even forgave his crew members for leaving him behind in Mars, forcing him to be a Martian for 90 SOLS. Technically it's a bright film, with fast paced narration with all brilliant characters. NASA's internal workings and the scientific situations are all properly shown, implying well revised cover ups. The film will keep you invested through its entire run-time, despite its boring background. Rating wise it's will be an 89/100.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Amazing,"Very good movie. Terrific graphic scenes of Mars, as far as I known true to real Martian geography and landform. But I get very sick of watching Matt Damon eating and drinking, and what I take as a boastful attitude: ""I am selfish enough to want all the credit"" he says near the end. Usually I like him a lot, but in this one, I find him irritating, despite his very good acting. I wish he chewed less, and swore less.
Everything that happens is a ""long shot"", but with enough setbacks thrown in to make it realistic. Astronomy is amazing. By the way, many many discoveries Nasa have made about the planets and moons in our solar system suggest strongly that the solar system is relatively young, way less than the oft quoted 4.5 billion years.

"Great movie, good adaptation","I'm a huge fan of the book by Andy Weir. I read the entire thing in two days and had trouble putting it down. So when it came to this movie I was skeptical they would be able to live up to my expectations. Turns out I didn't need to worry. Obviously the movie is a simplified version as there is just too much in a book to transfer it all to film. But they nailed the overall feeling and ""vibe"" perfectly and about as well as is possible. Matt Damon does an amazing job in the lead role especially as almost the entire movie revolves around him and him alone. He had very few actors to lean on throughout and still did great essentially carrying the entire story on his shoulders. If you love the book you will love the movie.

Entertaining Space Adventure Overseeing A Spaceman Fighting To Survive,"Pros:
1. The costume and set design are are incredible and intricately designed.
2. The futuristic score and Disco soundtrack does a great job at suiting the space setting, as well as helping the film a lift when needed.
3. Matt Damon (Mark Watney) gives a fantastic performance.
4. The comedy is inserted well, and does an amazing job at preventing the movie from becoming too dark.
5. The cinematography is really eye-catching, especially the stunning and breathtaking shots of Mars.
6. All of the characters make intelligent and deep character decisions, which makes every decision hit harder, in addition to fully empathising with the characters and their ordeal.
7. When Mark Watney is finally reunited with Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), it is a genuinely emotional scene.Cons:
1. There is some dodgy shaky cam in the beginning.
2. There are a couple plot-holes. For example, If NASA hates fire (including items that can contribute to fire), how come they let Rick Martinez (Michael Peña) bring a wooden crucifix to Mars? Surely they would check personal items taken by the astronauts? Another example would be the Chinese choosing to sacrifice their technology secrets to save an American astronaut; they would never do this in the real world.
3. The movie doesn't focus enough on the psychological impacts that being left alone, with very little hope of escape, on a strange planet would do to a person.
4. When narrating messages, the film bizarrely has the receiver and the sender both read out the message. You only need one.
5. Some of the characters are given very little, if anything, to do. This includes both Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) and Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The Martian,"A sudden and violent storm causes the team of the ""Ares"" mission to hastily abandon their camp and return to the relative safety of their orbiting spacecraft and a journey home. Giving the command to leave, their commander ""Lewis"" (Jessica Chastain) is informed that one of their number has been killed. Thing is, once the dust has (quite literally) settled, we discover that ""Watney"" (Matt Damon) is anything but. Impaled by an antenna needle he is alive and alone. Now a sort of space-bound ""Robinson Crusoe"" adventure ensues with ""Watney"" trying to ensure he repairs the damage to his body the uses his training - as a botanist - to find a way to survive. Everyone back home assumes he is dead - it is only when an eagle-eyed scientist notices that some of the equipment is moving that they try to re-establish contact. Now, with NASA Director ""Teddy"" (Jeff Daniels) and ""Mitch"" (Sean Bean) it's a race against time to cobble together a rescue plan before poor old ""Watney"" turns into one of his life-sustaining potatoes! I found this at it's most effective when it is just Damon using his guile to find innovative ways to survive. I can't swear to the plausibility of the science, but peppered with some pithy pieces-to-camera in a video diary style and his favourite (not) disco music Damon ensures that the film builds nicely allowing us to invest in his survival. I began to lose interest once the political melodrama kicked in, though, and but for the last exciting twenty minutes, I felt the film lost it's way as the scientific responses all just became a little too predictably convenient and oddly enough for a science fiction film, far-fetched! Some spectacular visual effects are put to great use complementing a strong, visionary and speculative, story of a man using his wits to survive and the all but 2½ hours really does fly by.

"""Surviving Mars: The Martian Triumph""","In the inaugural frames of ""The Martian,"" Ridley Scott's directorial prowess unveils a mesmerizing, desolate Martian landscape. This visual spectacle, coupled with the film's enigmatic allure, sets the thematic stage for the unfolding narrative. The story introduces a cadre of astronauts on a mission to explore Mars, their expedition interrupted by an unforeseen storm compelling their premature departure. The inadvertent abandonment of Mark Watney, portrayed by the stellar Matt Damon, forms the crux of the ensuing survival saga.Watney's resilience amidst the inhospitable Martian terrain becomes the linchpin of the film, and Damon's performance is nothing short of exceptional. The actor adeptly navigates Watney's emotional spectrum, rendering his highs and lows palpably relatable within the alien circumstances. The narrative places Damon in a formidable position, often isolated, compelling him to execute solo scenes that demand extraordinary finesse.Central to Watney's plight is the creation of video logs, a narrative device masterfully executed by Scott and writer Drew Goddard. These logs, ostensibly a one-sided communication, transcend mere exposition, assuming the verisimilitude of a scientist's documentation in such an extraordinary setting.While the film successfully imbues a sense of realism into fantastical scenarios, it grapples with the challenge of incorporating a plethora of characters essential for Watney's return to Earth. Despite a stellar cast featuring Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Donald Glover, the introduction of numerous characters somewhat impedes the film's pacing.A notable portion of the narrative unfolds on Earth, introducing characters like Mitch Henderson, played by Sean Bean, engaging in a compelling argument with Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) and Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor). This interplay serves to dissect the moral and emotional ramifications of abandoning a comrade, enriching the thematic depth.""The Martian"" excels in character development, humanizing the supporting cast. However, the dedication to this endeavor inadvertently disrupts the film's momentum, occasionally sidelining the central character, Watney.In its totality, ""The Martian"" is a cinematic triumph. From impeccable sound design to visually stunning sequences, the film seamlessly weaves logical problem-solving with emotional resonance. While not flawless, it possesses a rare blend of emotional depth and intellectual engagement. Matt Damon's performance, navigating seamlessly between humor and poignancy, elevates the film to a must-see status. Amidst comparable films, ""The Martian"" emerges as an extraordinary cinematic experience, leaving an indelible mark on the genre.#MartianTriumph.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Fascinating and enthralling tale of resourcefulness, ingenuity and survival","Fascinating and enthralling tale of resourcefulness, ingenuity and survival.After a massive storm forces his crew to leave the planet, an astronaut, Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon), is marooned on Mars, and presumed dead. Figuring that it would be at least four years until someone can rescue him, he sets out, though often ingenious means, to survive..A very well thought-out and made movie from director Ridley Scott. Engrossing, engaging plot - the odds are against our hero, and you feel his plight, yet he finds ways to keep going. The resourcefulness stretches beyond a single man though, to the NASA, and other, people on the ground trying to get him home. This engenders a great feeling of a community of specialists working together.While I can't validate the science in the movie (I'll leave that to Neil deGrasse Tyson!), the science FEELS right - there are no obvious plot holes or inaccuracies.Good performances all round, especially from Matt Damon in the lead role. Only sour note is Sean Bean's character, which came across as cartoonish.A must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"a thoughtful, exciting, crowd-pleasing movie about problem-solving","It's great to see characters think and actively searching for a solution to a problem. That was one of the driving forces of Apollo 13 (remember, ""fit that, with that, using nothing but that""), and other films dealing with survival often have that as a crux of the narrative. But The Martian isn't something where the filmmakers are trying to do a lot with a little dialog, like All is Lost or Cast Away. There are stretches without talking, but not as many as you'd expect; as the audience we're filled in often about what processes are going on and how things keep evolving (or, sometimes, breaking down miserably) in the search for how to keep astronaut/Botanist Mark Watley a) alive and b) bring him back home. It is a splendid piece of big, mainstream entertainment because it really digs in in ways that invite the audience in, while constantly keeping things entertaining and amusing.The Martian is about a man left behind by his crew (not their fault, they genuinely thought he was a goner), and how he has to find ways to stay alive, to give himself food and, most importantly, send word to NASA that he's alive and well and can they maybe send some supplies and oh does the crew know yet? It's got a lot of science to it - as Damon says in the trailer that most have seen, ""I'm going to have to science the s*** out of this"" - but, more often than not, it's accessible and easy enough to understand. That is, of course, if you're not too scared by science fiction (or, as the filmmaker and actors have talked about in press interviews, science 'fact', as everything, save for us presently going to the moon with men/women on a ship, is plausible).It's a movie about how to keep humanity in all its dimensions going through the perils of space. And, as we see, space is nothing if not indifferent; it acts, particularly on Mars, as a place where nothing really grows, storms can knock the hell out of things if items or persons aren't fastened tight, and if anything comes loose, watch out for the air and pressure to possibly kill you. On the level of threats, director Ridley Scott and especially screenwriter Drew Goddard (taking, from what I've been told, faithfully from Andy Weir's best-seller), it's high and pretty constant, and there is always that sense even when things are going well that they can break down at any time. While I never thought watching it 'Oh, maybe he won't get back or might die', as the conclusion seems clear since we are meant to like this guy and want to see him live/return, the threats and obstacles are presented expertly, with a lot of excellent pacing giving us breathing room.The 'breathing room' part is what I mean by this being a crowd- pleasing, entertaining flick. Goddard, previously of Cabin in the Woods, is adept at giving actors funny things to say, and The Martian is just good but basic sci-fi without the wit. Some of it may seem obvious - Watley is saddled with one of the other astronauts' musical selection (disco, which he grows to kind of like in a begrudging sort of way) - but a lot of it is due to personality, from him as well as those at mission control (Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, a very funny Donald Glover, Jessica Chastain and Kate Mara are part of what is actually a giant supporting cast). These are serious scientists and people trying to do their jobs in (mostly) responsible ways, but how they talk is closer to how one might see people talk in, say, the real world; this isn't the tone-deaf wit of Prometheus, and it's funnier than what Gravity previously tried to do. I was surprised how much I was laughing during The Martian.But it's deep down a drama, and led by Matt Damon in a performance that makes this director-writer-actor triangle complete for the audience. He has to hold down major chunks of the film, albeit there is a lot with NASA and the other ship with Chastain and so on, and without making this man believable in his serious scientific intellect, his ways of making things light (or cursing, which is interesting that they get away with a PG-13 here by the way through bleeps), and real pathos, the movie won't work, or nearly as well. He delivers up to what the script asks, and it, plus Scott's visual scope and control of the pacing, make this an exceptional Hollywood movie. We get to see how process works in a crisis, and that's always character-building and interesting (when written well) in a movie; that it's at this level of A-list makes The Martian a special film, and one of Scott's best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A unique, visually styled film that's still not the sum of its parts","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDuring an outer space mission around Mars, astronaut Matt Watney (Matt Damon) is separated from his spacecraft, and is presumed dead in the immediate aftermath. Stranded many light years from his home planet, Mark is forced to use his survival training (including fertilising faeces for food!) in order to survive, before managing to contact Earth and bring news of his survival to NASA president Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), who desperately works on Earth with scientist Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to get him home, while re-assuring a frantic public.Having made his name in a landmark sci-fi classic many decades ago, Ridley Scott returns to the genre for a film where the only alien appears to be in human form. His ability to create an impressive visual spectacle doesn't seem to have diminished with time, and The Martian features some sets and designs in outer space that could quite blow your mind. The director oversteps any meaningful character development, and plunges us straight into a story that serves as a lengthier rendition of 2013's Gravity, with elements of Tom Hanks's Cast Away chucked in for good measure.For a film stretching at nearly two and a half hours, it really needed not just an interesting story, but an effective screenplay to match it. While the 'one man stranded in space' plot still has some life in it, Scott seems overly preoccupied with stuffing Damon's Watson character full of insightful technical jargon and waffle, to reassure us he's highly intelligent and 'NASA's finest', to the point of disconnection. To try and balance the script with some humour, Scott has displayed an affection for '70s disco music, which Damon must awkwardly eschew. It's a welcome touch, if not truly effective.Performances wise, Damon must carry the lengthy film almost singlehandedly, and it's his varying degrees as an actor that make as little or most of this. While a better actor could have made more of it, by turns a weaker actor could have made it worse, and so you're grateful for small mercies. In what could be the main supporting role, Daniels is grounded as the head of NASA but, in a film determined to have as much humour as drama, that role he took with Jim Carrey all those years ago (and recently reprised) can never get out your mind. A further colourful supporting cast further make it up, including Michael Pena, Sean Bean and Ejiofor.Overall, it's not an entirely unsuccessful film, just one without the genuine tension and suspense to really make it last as long as it does, and so the cracks do appear at times. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The another ordinary movie with claims of a masterpiece!,"Disappointment - this is what i felt while watching ""The Martian"". I had been waiting for the movie since spring 2015, and i was expected a lot, but as it turned out, i got nothing. There is no atmosphere of solitude, fear for character's life, feeling of happiness when he managed to do something. I consider ""The Martian"" is the fail of the year, because you are waiting for a lot of things but gets nothing.First the script seems very fascinating. The astronaut appears to be on the deserted planet, because his crew left him by accident and he is fighting for his life with the desolated land of Marc. After reading this, in my mind immediately came presentation of something which could touch the soul, something like Tom Hanks's acting in ""Cast away"". ""The Martian"" obviously loses itself not just compared to the well-known movies about the universe, but also to the movies which demonstrate the loneliness of the person, who stayed alone in the inclosed place.The scientists who says some foolish things by TV, the another science guy who is making choice between food or his ideas every time, the crew which shows theirs heroism at a very low level, all this will make me not to watch this ""masterpiece"" again.And just Matt Damon is trying to pull the movie from the abyss. His jokes are very strict, his emotions are deep, but it isn't enough.Overall, ""The Martian"" is the another blockbuster, which pays more attention to the special effects, than to the atmosphere.

Realistic account of trying to survive on Mars while awaiting rescue,"In 2035 an astronaut (Matt Damon) gets stuck on Mars after he is presumed dead and his team departs without him. When NASA eventually finds out that he's alive & well they have to find a way to save him. But can he survive for the next couple of years until they arrive? Jeff Daniels plays the director of NASA while Jessica Chastain plays the leader of the vessel. Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor and several other notables are on hand.The only way for Ridley Scott's ""The Martian"" (2015) to work is if it can convince you that Damon's character is actually on Mars, which it does spectacularly and realistically (minus a few forced dramatics or stabs at humor here and there). If, like me, you're fascinated by Mars or the potential of living on another planet in the real world, ""The Martian"" is a must.It's reminiscent of movies like ""Armegeddon"" (1998), ""Mission to Mars"" (2000), ""Gravity"" (2013) and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), albeit without the fantastical elements of some of these. It even brings to mind the first acts of ""Planet of the Apes"" (1968) and ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970).The movie scores pretty well on the female front with Chastain, Mackenzie Davis, Kate Mara and Kristen Wiig.

Set in 2036, The Martian centres on the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut presumed dead and abandoned on Mars after a violent storm separates him from his crew, forcing him to survive for up to four years on the surface of Mars with limited food rations and contact to Earth. The Martian certainly shines throughout and delivers a fun, intriguing and at times extremely tense sci-fi adventure, with many thought provoking ideas and scenarios presented throughout. It is also visually stunning and features perfect accompanying scores. However, my flaws with the film are mainly with the 'attempted comedy' dialogue. Far too often many characters were cracking jokes in life or death situations, destroying the tension and ruining the experience slightly. On more than one occasion the script came off as silly, childish and cringeworthy. I also felt there wasn't enough varying personality within the characters, with the exception of Sean Bean's performance, again this may hinder on the script as some of them come off as 'failed comedians' rather than top scientific astronomers. The Martian is still however superbly acted and following Damon's journey and the obstacles to he had to overcome was exciting and engaging. Overall, The Martian is a great sci-fi film with gorgeous visuals and special effects, brilliant, well-fitting scores and an engaging interesting plot with unique and revolutionary ideas. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Martian -- Great film!,"A film that has a story, great acting, fantastic visuals (and sets) with humor sprinkled throughout is my kind of movie. The Martian starts off with an engaging story. As usual, Matt Damon is impressive. The man has a knack for becoming the character he is playing. This movie really is the package deal. There are twists and surprises (that I greatly appreciated) but I did find the scattered humorous lines really make the film engaging. It was great to walk away from viewing a movie and think it was a fantastic way to spend the past two hours. I plan on reading the book it was based on now too. Personally I found this film to be MUCH more interesting than Gravity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Not very entertaining, and not very exciting","I'm an engineer, so I enjoy science in my science fiction. But more than that, I most enjoy a science fiction movie that's exciting and entertaining. ""The Martian"" is mostly neither. ""The Martian"" must have been sold to investors as ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" meets ""Gravity"". Ultimately, though, it is not as entertaining as either of those movies, and here's why.What I really like about ""Gravity"" is that they took an otherwise rather slow-moving and potentially boring space story and turned it into a roller coaster ride. I thought the movie had good pacing and good effects. The film excelled -- was perhaps groundbreaking -- in its look and feel of being in space.""The Martian"" presents itself as science that could really happen, almost a documentary of this guy's life on Mars. But the story is full of holes -- see many other reviewer comments -- just as ""Gravity"" is -- many pointed these out as well. ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" (1964) is a silly tale, with not much scientific accuracy, yet I found it (still do) to be entertaining -- even endearing.""The Martian"" comes off as full of itself. Everything is so melodramatic. The writers feel they have to throw dialogue at us to make us understand just how amazing something is that is about to happen or already happened. I do think Matt Damon is a fine actor and does a good job with his role. It's just that the writers and director chose the easy route of letting their actor's ability and the Mars special effects sell the movie. They made an okay movie, but not a very entertaining or great movie.If it were me, I wouldn't nominate the director or writers for this one. I've always had a fascination with Mars, so for me it was enough just to see the fantastic landscapes revealed in the movie through some nice special effects. Wish there had been more of that and less gratuitous dialogue.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"The Martian Features Striking Visual Effects, Matt Damon with a Brilliant Performance and is Surprisingly Humorous","If the latest movies didn't reach the expectations, The Martian comes to solidified Ridley Scott's genius. The film is breathtaking, the tension will surely keep you on the edge of your seat. Ridley Scott is well known for being a master in set design and in The Martian, he did not disappoint. To distinguish the ones which graphical computing are used from those that are real settings is challenging. The scenarios are outstanding and the level of details is impressive, making them quite immersive and leading you to believe that they actually filmed in those places. To ease the burden brought by the solitude of the astronaut, the synergy between the soundtrack and a very clever sense of humor make the scenes much more amusing. Throughout the movie, there is a good distribution among the most tense scenes that are visually fantastic and the others which are responsible for the development of the characters and this is something that leaves no wish unfulfilled as we have the opportunity to really get to know the personalities of each individual. Despite significant changes, The Martian is based on a book by Andy Wier and an aspect that is very similar is the constant use of a more scientific language. This feature does not make the movie hard to understand, quite the opposite, makes it more realistic and believable. Many of these explanations Mark Watney himself does, in order to keep a record of his journey on Mars. By doing so, there's the impression that he speaks directly to the audience and using a more friendly and humorous tone, these explanations don't become too didactic or boring.The entire cast does an extraordinary job. The actors and actresses responsible for both astronauts on the spacecraft as NASA scientists play their roles marvelously. From the work done in the creation and development of these characters, the cast manages to build them in a way which makes it easy to find them more interesting and convincing. But the one who I have to take my hat off is Matt Damon playing Mark Watney. Matt Damon delivers one of his finest roles of his career. With his charisma and talent, he is able to hold the screen and makes Mark Watney a character that gains the audience sympathy very quickly much due the combination of his nerd, lively and comic sides that pulls the character to a spot much more closer from the public. Reading the synopsis of the movie, it is assumed that due to solitude, the film would have a more depressing tone. On the contrary, much due to the optimism and sense of humor of Mark Watney the loneliness is far less depressing. Of course there are moments when the situation gets worse and he almost gets at the edge of losing hope and accept his fatal destiny, but his perseverance makes him keep fighting for.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Riddley Scott picks a winner.,"Every good story has 3 major components: A beginning, a duration and an end, somethings many Hollywood writers are afraid to do anymore. Studios have their fingers in so much of the creative/artistic development of a project, it certainly explains why so many movies are considered critical flops. However, the public speaks, and box offices like making money.This being said, The Martian certainly seems to please most people, even the critical. I don't think I'd be spoiling anything by saying the plot of the movie is about an astronaut left for dead as the crew evacuates from the planet surface of Mars only to find out the crew member didn't die. You have the story from a bureaucratic side, a scientific side, a social media side and engineering side all interwoven around the subject's story; the guy they left behind.I personally don't think many people outside the enthusiast would know the difference between Mars and Wadi Rum in Jordan where the principal filming took place, and seeing even my understanding of the terrain is limited it was quite convincing. You get comfortable with the associations pretty quickly when you add all the environmental supplements that add to location that dispel the earth atmospheric conditions. I think most people have accepted the way Hollywood deals with space and give it a great deal of flexibility, so space travel is somewhat forgiving, but mixing the tech that got the various crafts into the air and the ship its self ""Hermes"" (Check your Greek mythology – very appropriate name) builds this story into one congruous epic. Obviously, the whole story revolves around Mark Whatney, a botanist who is left for dead and between his skills and ego are able to survive the elements until he is rescued. One of the nicer things about the story is that unlike other Ridley films, is that it isn't one emergency after another. The strong point to the screen play is that it breathes so well when mixed with the various sub-stories that the movie never gets tedious or overly long.Using the word ""Mix"" is a very appropriate term to describe this epic scifi movie. An experienced recording engineer know when to emphasize a specific instrument when doing the final edit to enhance the focus and listeners experience. Harry Gregson-Williams score is not intrusive but well integrated (Credits include Shrek, Man on Fire and Cowboys and Aliens); Dariusz Wolski cinematography translates Ridleys vision to screen, and all the various departments all seem to come together to culminate in a perfect ""Mix"" for this compelling story. This movie has a great beginning, an absorbing duration, and satisfying ending.So, I give this a full 10 our of 10 for experience. The audience was totally engrossed in the film, fully responding to the humor and horrors, empathetically sensing the singularity of being stranded but ultimately making the best of a bad situation.

Not Brilliant And Not A Musical,"While exploring Mars an expedition get caught up in a sandstorm and have to beat a hasty retreat leaving behind the body of a dead team member . As it transpires he isn't dead but soon will be as it'll take too long to mount a rescue mission and his supplies will have run out long before thenA return to form from acclaimed director Ridley Scott . Oh hold on I'll use quotation marks because that's not really my opinion ""A return to form from acclaimed director Ridley Scott"" . I'm afraid I found this rather boring . Matt Damon finds himself trapped on Mars struggling to survive . Early in the film Matt takes off his spacesuit and glancing at his inhuman well buffed torso you know every hetrosexual woman on the planet will want to use him as their own personal lick toy if he makes it back to Earth . Remind me and 3.5 billion other mortal men why we want him to survive this ordeal ?I'm afraid I'd forgotten his characters name because my disbelief was never suspended long or hard enough to think I was watching a real life character trying to survive a real life situation but more of an actor appearing in a Hollywood movie . ""Luckily I'm a botanist so I can grow things"" he states. Wow , how fortunate is that ? Very fortunate I'd say and this type of good fortune reminds you you're watching a contrived story . It does try and bring science fact to the narrative but at the same time when you've got the actor who played Boromir in THE LORD OF THE RINGS explain why the rescue mission is called ""Operation Elrond"" this tends to underline the fact that you're watching a movieOne puzzling thing is that it's picked up several Golden Globe nominations - in the comedy/musical category ? This is ridiculous since the film is in no way a comedy or a musical . Its style is somewhat reminiscent of these films in the 1980s with either a diegetic or non diegetic musical soundtrack blasting away . Anyone consider APOCALYPSE NOW a musical ? I didn't think so . That said I did slightly respect THE MARTIAN more than the rather overrated INTERSTELLAR . It's just that when you compare it the breathtaking achievement of GRAVITY a couple of years ago or the thematically similar THE REVENANT then you'll probably find THE MARTIAN a bit lacklustre in comparison . I also think because of voter politics - Inarritu won best director at the Oscars last year - the Academy Awards might just give Ridley Scott a long overdue Oscar in 2016 , but to be honest he's made better films than this one",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Science got right.,"As a science and movie geek, this was a gold mine.The movie starts with a bang, doesn't waste that many minutes and goes to full thriller mode. Even the 'medical' scene of him taking out the rod was well acted and intense. Got so many goosebumps when Matt's first discovery was found by NASA.The concept of Cast Away meets Apollo 13 is great. Props to the original writer and adapters to faithfully keeping most of it.Cinematography was great, made boring desert Mars look stunning, praises for the direction by Ridley Scott has nothing to add more for his rich career.I thought it was only ganna be Matt Damon but boy was I wrong. Movie nerd inside me brust open when I saw that humangase of a cast.Jessica Chestain,Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan(Bucky) and Micheal Pena(Luizzz) in the main crew. The relationship set up between the crew was well executed without that much scenes, build up, at the start.Chiwetel Ejiofor is fantastic, his protrayal of helpful and caring person was phenomenally done. Jeff Daniels as NASA Director stole some scenes for me at the start with his rude caricature. Wong and Donald Glover had short but very effective scene time. Sean Bean not dying has no scientific explanation.All the NASA scenes, Mars scenes, JPL, China & Hermes working together felt great. Everybody uniting to save a human life.The movie had great sprinkles of comedy. Protagonist humourous approach to every trouble and optimistic characterisation served the themes of 'not giving up' pretty well. Looking for best in the worst of things. Hence he came back alive, cuz science.Now the sciennccce, 'The greatest botanist in this planet', 'Botany isn't science.' Using radioactive decay to solve cooling problem, using own waste as fertilizers was fantastic, making H2O from N2H2 and blowing himself up for miscalculation got the science right. Even astronomical science, rocket science had some realism in them. Blowing up Hermes and poking space suit for thrust as Iron Man, superb. Mars is the name of Roman God of War, and his Greek version is called 'Ares', hence the name Ares3 4 for Mars mission. And Hermes is the Greek god of travel (also Mercury but travel seems more right)Scientists are not always crazy old dudes in white coats, they work together and solve problems.

Matt Damon - Space Pirate,"What a brilliant movie. It is one of those films you can watch on repeat over and over and still enjoy just as much each time.Matt Damon is in his element here. Combining good humour and some clever one liners with the sense of hopelessness and loneliness that comes with living on an entire planet on your own. His performance helps you believe you are there with him struggling in those harsh Martian conditions.I personally love Interstellar when it comes to my favourite space related sci-fi movie of all time. But if Interstellar is a 10/10 the Martian is a 9.999999999/10. Terri would not agree with this statement as it is tough to split the two.Decent book too if you have the time to read it.

"A smart, nearly flawless sci-fi.......","Science fiction has been one of the genres churned out many times, most turning into capers with few exceptions like Apollo 13 or Gravity. ""The Martian"" isn't a caper nor does it delve into the sentimentality of ""Apollo 13"" or ""Gravity."" It's simply a clever and entertaining sci-fi drama that contemplates the scientific facts meticulously. The story seems more for pleasing the crowd rather than accomplishing a rich literary work; but whatever it does seem flawless and detailed for which the film becomes gripping throughout despite its over length. Based on a novel of the same title, the film pretty enriches your knowledge on astronomy for which it can serve a very good resourcce. Matt Damon in the title role steals the show using much of wit to his role, avoiding sentimentality, and above all, tries something different than the desolation portrayed by Tom Hanks in Cast Away or Leonardo Di Caprio in ""The Revenant."" His role is pretty fun filled and amusing; a memorable performance he has given in recent years after 'The Departed."" A superb narration, brilliant camera work, and a nice performance definitely make it a smart and entertaining movie of the year though the subject and treatment might not feel a regular Oscar worthy material.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An entertaining thrill ride from start to finish,"Ridley Scott is without a doubt one of the finest film directors of the last 45 years and in that time he directed great movies such as ""Gladiator"" (2000), ""Alien"" (1979), ""American Gangster"" (2007), and ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001), and with ""The Martian"" he has not only added another great film to that elite resume he has also directed one of the finest science fiction movies of the decade. The movie is based on Andy Weir's novel of the same name (which I did not read prior to seeing this movie) and stars Matt Damon in one of the finest performances of his career as Mark Watney who is on a mission to Mars with Captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) who is in charge of the mission, Major Rick Martinez (Michael Peña) the mission's pilot, Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara) the mission's systems operator, and Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan) who is a surgeon on the mission. At first everything seems fine on Mars but goes horribly wrong in an instant when a dust storm forces the crew to evacuate and in the process leaves Watney behind after not being able to find him. After Watney finds himself left on Mars he has to resort to his wits in order to survive on Mars for as long as he possibly can until help arrives while also try to figure out a way to tell NASA that he is still alive and well. The movie is not only one of the best sci-fi adventures this decade has to offer but it ranks with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) and ""Apollo 13"" (1995) as one of the greatest movies about space exploration ever put on film. The movie features excellent performances throughout especially from an excellent supporting cast which includes Jeff Daniels as the president of NASA, Chiwetel Ejiofor who plays the man in charge of all of the missions to the red planet, and Sean Bean who plays the flight director for NASA. Scott's direction is on point and Drew Goddard's screenplay places tension at all the right moments to the point where you are actually there with them in this uncomfortable situation.

Bring Him Home !. Help is only 140 million miles away !.Science fiction, adventures on the edge of survival and an intense drama of a man abandoned on an inhospitable planet with little chance of being rescued alive, give shape to this film. Based on the book: 'The Martian' by Andy Weir, this is a love letter to survival, serenity, patience and fight for live against the mosts dangerous circumstances. Ridley Scott stated: ¨this is a story of extreme survival, something like the science fiction version of Robinson Crusoe. Mars is not a particularly welcoming planet, its temperature varies between 153 degrees below zero and 22 degrees, the air is composed of 95% carbon dioxide, the soil does not have the necessary bacteria to grow anything, and water does not exist, just a form of ice. But the protagonist is a botanist, and he will try to find a way to make the soil of Mars fertile, although that will be only one of his problems¨. In addition, its almost absolute protagonist Matt Damon explains: ¨This enjoyable film is intertwined with the experience in loneliness of the protagonist on Mars and that of the team on Earth trying to find a way to solve it¨.Despite the extremes of story, The Martian is an exciting and, above all, fun film in which there is dry humor and black humor everywhere.

The motion picture was competently directed by Ridley Scott, at his best and as stylish as ever. Scott has directed a lot of notable films, such as: ¨Someone to watch over me¨, ¨Blade runner¨, ¨Black rain¨ , ¨Legend¨ in which his visual style is impressive . And his speciality , is the historical genre, such as: ¨Robin Hood¨ , ¨Kingdom of heaven¨ , ¨Duelists¨, ¨Black Hawk down¨, ¨1492¨, ´Exodus¨, ¨The Last Duel¨, ¨Napoleon¨ and Sci-fi genre, such as: ¨Alien Covenant¨, ¨Prometheus¨, ¨Blade runner¨, ¨Alien¨, among others.

How to singlehandedly colonize a barren planet...,"I had some reluctance about sitting down to watch ""The Martian"" because it is a movie starring Matt Damon.

You know what happens and what is around the corner a mile away. The movie was so predictable that even a blind man could foreseen what would happen next.With that being said, don't get me wrong, because ""The Martian"" is still an enjoyable enough movie for what it turned out to be. However, it just wasn't a groundbreaking movie in any sense, nor was it a particularly outstanding movie, to be bluntly honest.And a whole movie with almost nothing but Matt Damon was a serious test on my durability. I am not a fan of him at all, but a friend said that this is a really great movie, and that was the selling point for why I actually sat down and watched ""The Martian"".The movie was fairly well paced, but running at over two hours and just watching Matt Damon struggling to survive on Mars for the majority of two hours was starting to become a drag.While ""The Martian"" certainly is entertaining enough in itself and for what it was, then it is hardly a cinematic masterpiece, nor a movie that is likely to become a classic movie. In my opinion, there are far better movies that revolve around the Red Planet compared to ""The Martian"".While Matt Damon had the majority of the screen time, then there was a handful of good casts to assist him as well. And I think that Jeff Daniels and Sean Bean were doing good jobs, just a shame that they didn't have bigger parts and more time on the screen.My final score, once the red dust has has settled, comes down to a six out of ten stars.

The Martian - worth spending time with,"I must start this review with a confession - I LOVED the book that this movie is based on. So it was with some trepidation that I approached the movie - it couldn't possibly match the thrill and joy I experienced while reading the book, could it?I was right, it couldn't.But it still was a darn good movie.THE MARTIAN tells the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut stranded alone on Mars. Can Watney use his wits and knowledge of science to survive on an inhospitable planet until rescue can be completed? Or will he die trying?Watching Damon, as the charismatic Watney, the answer is not nearly as important as the journey. Damon's self-effacing portrayal of the stranded astronaut gets us instantly rooting for him to succeed and solve problem after problem. We are alone with Watney on Mars, but I never felt ""the stunt"" of him being alone (unlike, say, Tom Hanks in CAST AWAY), so when we finally cut back to Earth, I was somewhat disappointed.But not too much, for the supporting cast is strong and is populated by fine actor after fine actor. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mission Control guy! Jessica Chastain as the Commander of the Mars Mission! Look there's Kristen Wiig and Sean Bean and good ol' Jeff Daniels!!! And, hey...isn't that THE WINTER SOLDIER guy (Sebastian Stan) as another Astronaut?And I didn't even mention the always fun Michael Pena, or Kate Mara or lesser known actors such as Benedict Wong, Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover...It was fun that all these really strong actors took on smaller roles, it gave the film some heft and importance that it, otherwise, might not have had.This because director Ridley Scott, did something unusual for him in a space movie - he gave it hope and positivity. Instead of a dystopian future where it is ""each man for himself"", Scott's view of the future (and screenwriter Drew Goddard) mirrored the author of the book (Andy Weir)'s view of the future - hopeful and helpful. Everyone on Earth pulls together to bring their man home from Mars.It was a nice change of mood for these kinds of pictures, one that I was ready for.It is a very good time at the cinema and I cannot recommend this picture strongly enough. Though I would recommend the book more. You'll enjoy yourself - and your time with Mark Watney - whether it is on the screen or on the page - or both!8 (out of 10) stars - and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Spoiler Free Review of one of Damon's Finest Efforts in Years,"I came into viewing this film with modest expectations. I hadn't even seen a video trailer for 'The Martian' and in many ways I'm glad I hadn't. Often times it's best to be surprised by what happens as a movie progresses, and this film provides a few surprises, but isn't immune to predictability either.It doesn't take long for the plot to thicken and you'll be on the edge of your seat for most of the movie. Humor is injected intermittently and it keeps 'The Martian' from becoming too intense to enjoy. I found the pace to be balanced and just right for viewing, considering it runs just over 2 1/4 hours.The scenery is simply awesome. 'The Martian' holds it's own when compared to recent and similar Sci-Fi films such as, 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar'. The views are breathtaking and the ones responsible for the visuals in the film should be applauded.I was pleased with the cast overall. Jessica Chastain puts in a great performance. Matt Damon was at his best throughout the film. In my opinion, it may be his best performance since 'Good Will Hunting'.In conclusion, I say this. Don't even read the description or watch any trailers. You just may spoil one of the year's finest films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Awesome movie,"I watch a lot of movies. And when I say ""a lot"" I mean it. This movie just went through the ceiling of my ""great movies list"". This is what a drama-comedy movie should be like, a bit of both emotions. I read the book and was amazed by how well written and specific it was, especially if you consider the fact that this was the first novel of Andy Weir (the author of the book), the movie doesn't explain every single thing but still makes sure the viewer can understand what is going on. Also, Matt Damon's performance in this is incredible, he was born to play Mark Watney. And not just him, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor and the whole cast was great. Basically, what I'm saying is go see this movie, you won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Gravity set the bar -- Martian does the Limbo under the bar,,,","Well this is embarrassing.IMDb members have the right to expect that their ""top reviewers"" will at the very least watch a movie to the very end, to better review it, whether or not they like it....? And this reviewer let you down. After the first 80 minutes I became so annoyed with this film that I packed up and left.So please accept this partial, somewhat hobbled, review:1. If I had not recently seen GRAVITY, I might have been more impressed. But Gravity showed me how this sort of film SHOULD be written, should be cast, should be directed. So I am not in the mood for a wannabee2. When your reviewer was still a toddler, Playboy Magazine reviewed an Italian Western starring Henry Fonda and referred to his role as ""ludicorusly miscast."" I never forgot that phrase. I don't get to use it often, but I never forgot it. Well today is your lucky day. Damon was ludicrously miscast. On paper he must have seemed perfect. In the film however he is too calm, too smug, too muscular, too assured, too cocky and just too ... the wrong actor for the part. In the gratuitous scene with his shirt off -- for the ladies -- he looked nothing like an astronaut-cum-botanist and everything like a guy who keeps waiting for someone to offer him the next Bourne film before he hits retirement age.I suppose the film might have become stunningly better in the last 25 minutes but I have seen a lot of films, reviewed a lot of films, so I play the Vegas odds and say, not ^(*&^(* likely.Sorry if I let you down.I promise to do better next time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Amazing!! Destined to be one of the best space movies ever made!!!!,"This movie rocked the house!! What can I say? The only movie I truly was astonished by this year was Ant-Man, and this one is up there with one of the best movies of the year. I recently saw Hotel Transylvania 2, and while the animation was imaginative and there were some really funny scenes, I kind of thought, ""eh, it's not bad, just so much potential wasted"". With The Martian, the potential is realized and fulfilled, and a whole lot more added to that. The main surprise in this movie is the fact that it has more optimism than any other thriller I've seen-and I love it when movies strive to avoid predictability in emotion of the characters. Matt Damon was excellent in this because of his huge amount of likability and charms, but was frightened and tense when he needed to be. Jeff Daniels is definitely the best performance of the movie other than Damon in my opinion. I saw the 3D screening of this movie and the opening scene and the vistas of Mars landscapes and planet overviews immersed me into the intensity of the suspense shown. Awesome 70s soundtrack. I'd recommend this piece of art to any movie buff, Ridley Scott fan, or space movie fan any day. Definitely a Blu-ray collection addition in my book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I Will Survive,"Yet another movie that has recently become eerily prophetic anticipating life under lockdown is this long but effective remake of 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars' (1964), with Matt Damon forced to endure seventies disco music in confinement the way Roger Livesey had endured nineteenth century French comic opera in 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp'.It faithfully follows both the look and mood of the original, but with the addition of scenes back on Earth creating a ticking clock to generate suspense of the sort only too familiar to anyone who's ever had to instal a feature on their laptop or iPad while being directed by phone. While Shu Chen has been shoehorned into the plot with the Chinese market in mind as a resourceful lady scientist whose last minute inspiration helps save the day.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"This is the most fun we've had on Mars since the Rover's excursions and the science behind it all, checks right.","In a not-so-distant future, when NASA is still around to send a 3rd manned mission to Mars for research, a freak storm rips through the station as the crew desperately try to abort and escape its ruthless fury. Blown away by flying debris, one crew member goes missing and is tentatively presumed dead as the Captain makes the call to take off. However, the grieving crew and shocked humans back home are completely unaware of Mark Watney's chance survival. Thereon, science fiction borders reality in a race against time and depleting resources as Ridley Scott ('Aliens', 'Blade Runner', 'Gladiator', 'Hannibal', 'Black Hawk Down', 'American Gangster', 'Prometheus') comes to form after a couple of recent disappointments such as 'Robin Hood' and 'Exodus'. Along with a career best performance by Matt Damon, 'The Martian' descends into a zone that makes it far more entertaining than Michael Bay's space adventures but not as personal and deeply engrossing as Interstellar. It makes for an engaging, funny and credible adventure as it was set out to be in Andy Weir's best-selling novel, adapted here by Drew Goddard;s ('Lost', 'Netflix's Daredevil') entertaining screenplay. This is the most fun we've had on Mars since the Rover's excursions and the science behind it all, checks right.18 Sols have passed since Mark Watney (Matt Damon) stapled his wound after the storm and his crew's departure. He has calculated his rations, improvised on the limited resources and come up with an survival plan that involves generation of water and cultivation of potatoes - on Mars. Soon enough, the scientists at NASA notice movements around Mark's station through images and reach out to him through the Pathfinder's camera. As the communication links are established, plans are set in motion to rescue Mark even though its execution will challenge several development and launch teams on Earth and himself physically and mentally to survive up to 4 more years. The scientific ideas are comprehensible, making Mark's improvisations with his resources all the more credible. It isn't just about his existence in an inhospitable environment but about pushing one's capabilities and resources to the utmost levels in order to prolong survival. Rescue being an uncertain number of months away, Mark has to keep recalculating provisions while maintaining the constant, entertaining communication. Those lighter moments in such trying times are what make The Martian such a good film compared to the darkness in Prometheus. Time, in essence, is the only villain in this story.Jessica Chastain plays Captain Lewis, who struggles to get to terms with her decision to abort the mission. She convincingly portrays the compassion for her crew and audacity when she must alter the mission itself. Michael Pena's comic timing is always an asset in a film and as Martinez, he keeps things light and relatable. Kate Mara and the rest of the crew members do an adequate job while some of the stronger performances are by actors back on Earth, including Jeff Daniels as NASA's overly cautious director Sanders, Benedict Wong as the director of JPL who leads a team that is tasked with achieving the impossible, Sean Bean as Mitch who heads the mission with complete dedication to the safety of the crew and of course, Chiwetel Ejiofor's Vincent Kapoor, the engineer whose diligent efforts in tracking Watney led to the agency's serious consideration for launching a rescue mission. His, is perhaps the best performance among the supporting cast. As Watney explains to us, although he is just addressing the camera for recording purposes, the math behind supplies rationing, potato cultivation or simply, the odds of his survival with every changing circumstance, we are completely engaged in his efforts and genuinely want him off the red planet. As an expert botanist whose wit comes in handy in most of the scientific applications on Mars, Matt Damon delivers his most compelling performance that makes science and engineering more entertaining. That is precisely where The Martian succeeds.The film's ability to convey the scientific and human challenges while being stranded on Mars, but with easy understanding and witty humor that keeps the grip on the audience while they witness a miraculous rescue attempt that is planned and executed to a meticulous degree. Against the backdrop of disco music, Watney gently trudges along the Martian landscape in his rover as the engineers at NASA refer to his rescue mission as Elrond. The nerd quotient here is at a sublime level that doesn't overpower the narrative. The cinematography and visual effects simply make Jordan look more credible as the surface of Mars while the sfx in space are refined enough for certain thrilling scenes. Technically, Ridley Scott has abstained for over-burdening the entertaining narrative with unnecessary special effects. He relies heavily upon Drew Goddard's screenplay of Weir's book and on Matt Damon, whom America has repeatedly sent on missions only to lose him. The Martian is a complete exercise on problem solving. You solve one and another one surfaces. You solve that and there's a new one. Up until you solve enough to just stay alive. A rescue is only a fool's hope or a miracle. In Matt Damon's case, we'd rather keep sending him to faraway places just so we can watch him being rescued again.9.199 on a scale of 1-10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Gardener out of space,"It's almost impossible to not have seen at least glimpses/clips from this movie. But just knowing what this will be about, does not mean you won't enjoy the ride. It may be true with some other movies, but this works quite good. Even though we do know more and are expecting the inciting incident to happen to Matt Damons character.And while everyone else does not know about him and his status, we do know. And I think everyone can at least relate to some parts, when it comes to feeling lonely. Even someone who has a lot of people around him/her, has moments where you only have yourself (to rely upon). And Damon has a lot to do. You could say this is predictable (and maybe has an agenda, depending on the outcome always), but the tension still never lets up. Entertaining and funny too, even when Damon breaks a couple of rules of filmmaking (not talking to oneself, but then again, what else can you do? Plus he's not ""just"" talking to himself ... well you'll see).",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ridleys Redemption,"Despite some recent missteps Ridley Scott will always be one of my all time favourite directors and The Martian just further solidifies this for me because I believe this stands up there with Gladiator and Blade Runner as his best and was my favourite movie of 2015. Matt Damon is incredible in this movie with out a doubt the best performance in a Ridley Scott movie since Russell Crowe in Gladiator and in my opinion should have took home the Oscar for this movie he's amazing with the comedy and the emotion the little moments where his armour starts to crack no you think he wants to give up but he never does, that's what makes Mark Watney such a great protagonist he's easy to get behind and never bores the audience. While nobody steals the spotlight from Damon, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jessica Chastain both hold their own in supporting roles they're more than able to keep the audience invested while we're not on Mars. Speaking of the Red Planet it looks incredible, life like even. You truly care about Mark Witney getting home because you realise how hard he is fighting to survive every time he succeeds you hope it last but quickly realise that it won't and that makes for some truly heartbreaking scenes. The special effects are also amazing in this film their not overused their used sparingly only to advance the plot and put you more into the situation. The arc on earth, while definitely not as interesting as Mars, is still great to watch your behind them 100% to succeed and you truly believe that everyone is important in the rescue mission and that nobody is expendable and with a cast this big that is truly impressive.The Martian is a masterpiece it's got amazing performances, direction and production design it's a perfectly balanced movie that never leaves you bored and leaves me hoping that Ridley Scott will keep that up.A+/100%",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The movie had ironically about as much atmosphere as the planet Mars did.,"THE MARTIAN (My Film Review)Stuck on Mars possibly forever, no biggie I guess...I was a bit disappointed, I kept wanting it to be meaningful and powerful and extraordinary... but it just wasn't... it was too calm... I felt GRAVITY in my bones... how incredible it is that we exist, and thrive... I felt her journey like the journey of birth... it moved me... I liked the scene in this movie when he looks at the first little plant he grows... but felt little else...He's just too calm and cool throughout... so I could not relate with him on a human level at all.The movie seemed to really lack depth, it didn't challenge itself or the audience... except our patience and ability to listen to bad music and hokey dialog.The idea of being the only person on a planet is compelling...I wanted more though... some human emotion... I understand he's a trained professional, but he's also a human being... and the movie lacked depth, introspection, philosophy, humanity...I enjoy the testament to human ingenuity, and the movie had its moments I really loved... a nice touch at the end seeing the little plant, the little things perhaps he used to take for granted... yes that is a good lesson. The monologue at the end makes sense, but the map is not the territory and I feel he was perfect in its execution to the point of it being detrimental to the heart of the movie.The movie had ironically about as much atmosphere as the planet Mars did.My Rating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Finally a manned mission to Mars has taken place and a group of astronauts are conducting tests on the planet. When a storm hits the crew tries to make it back to their ship but Mark Watney (Damon) is struck and lost. With no other choice the crew leaves without him and they fear the worst. When Nasa receives a message from Mark a plan is needed not only to retrieve him, but to find a way to keep him alive on a barren planet. Mark must see how resourceful he can be. Every once in a while a movie comes out where you want to tell everyone you know to see it because its that good. This is one of those movies. To me the sci fi genre has had a strong showing the last few years with movies like Gravity, Intersteller and now this one. This movie has suspense, drama and a ton of comedy.

MacGyver on Mars,"If you are not a fan of MacGyver, this two hour plus movie is going to feel like five hours.

If you love the science and math behind space exploration, the Martian is a marvel. If you like your space odyssey to have aliens, laser fights and chase scenes, this movie is not for you. Unlike Sam Rockwell's Moon, Matt Damon is not completely alone. Half the movie is Matt only while the other half is filled with a colorful cast that you often see in comedies.

"Predictable, immature dialogs, artificial heroism, non-innovative action.","I believe this is one of the overrated films on IMDb. While it has a high user rating and for some reason totally mistakenly in the Top 250, user reviews are mostly bad. And they are right. This movie is boring, unrealistic and totally not entertaining. I mean, what makes a movie a good movie? We all know that a movie is not real. We still feel entertained, why? Because we can feel the main characters struggle in a difficult situation, we suffer with him, we have empathy. None of these are happening to the audience when you watch this one.It was actually the sappy behavior of the characters making you feel bored watching. I would have accepted the fact that he grew potatoes out of the feces of his buddies and they have left them there, okay why not ... he a botanist (how exciting by the way).Just a few examples: For reasons unknown, he starts taking Vicodin with his potato - I actually had to look it up what Vicodin was, and then did not understand the message of this.The captain of the ship blames himself immediately ""I left him there"" after they have received the message. Come on guys, give the character some time to emotionally apprehend the situation, before she starts blaming herself! Nobody does that immediately... not ever!Who is this stupid moron looking like a drug addict in his totally messy office, where no one should have taken seriously? A total loner-loser, who works for NASA, doesn't even know the directors name when he is in his office... and then performs an act of a 3-year- old? What is this, are you kidding me? Why should the audience take this seriously at all?Ridley Scott has totally failed to give the crew them some meaning. They could have just robots as far as I am concerned, wouldn't make this movie less worse.There is just no excitement the whole time. He was deserted. You know exactly that his own crew will go back to help him at about in the middle of the movie. You know the attempt with the first rocket will fail, because you have already understood, some heroism with the ""we won't let anybody behind""-message is actually the main story here. But you had to watch all that story of building that bogus rocket – I was bored to death! And then it explodes and fails, what a surprise!So after that, you beg for a plot where something miraculous will happen. Instead, something totally ordinary happens, again! He flies to the crew. An astronaut goes out, he flies out of his capsule. I was asking myself... this is it?For a moment I thought I was watching a Roland Emmerich, but I had sworn never to watch an Emmerich again.

I'm going to have to review the sh*t out of this,"THE MARTIAN follows botanist Mark Watney who, during a manned mission to Mars, is hit by a fierce storm and left behind by his crew who presume that he's dead. But little did they know that he's still very much alive, stranded on the hostile planet. With limited resources at hand, Watney must draw upon his ingenuity in order to survive.Having only seen the trailers, I went into this film unaware of how much humor there would actually be. In that regard, it's quite faithful to the source material; Drew Goddard was able to inherit author Andy Weir's snarky dialogue and translate it from the pages of a novel onto the pages of a screenplay, while Sir Ridley Scott brought it all to life.Speaking of Ridley Scott, it looked as if the legendary director's best days were behind him, entering a career slump of sorts with The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings, both of which were dull and uninspired chapters of his otherwise impressive filmography. THE MARTIAN, however, marks Ridley Scott 's return to form. It's captivating from beginning to end, enjoyable from beginning to end, and is full of personality from, you guessed it, beginning to end.A lot of that personality, if not all of it, is due to the incredible group of actors that have been rounded up here, most notably Matt Damon. If not for him and the way he charismatically delivers his lines the sarcastic dialogue, which is really just Damon talking to a video recorder, would 've just ended up being really awkward. Chewitel Ejiofor and Jessica Chastain both make strong impressions as well, along with the rest of the cast who have small, yet potent moments of their own.Despite having convincing performances, the film didn't do as good of a job trying to get me to naturally invest in these characters. Sure, you care for Mark Watney's life but that's only because of the situations that the story places him in and forces him to face; there was no real emotional through line for me to grab hold of.But the thing that stops me from calling THE MARTIAN ""great"" is that it's a very safe, by the numbers, sci-fi film. It doesn't have the technical drive of Gravity or the emotional punch of Interstellar; it's very good, but it could've been so much more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

CHAPPY WATCHED: The Martian,"I had no real interest in seeing this movie, I probably would have watched it once it was released to own but there was no immediate hurry.After the constant barrage of positive reviews and the fact that there was nothing else on, I ended up seeing it at the cinemas.THIS MOVIE IS F*CKING FANTASTIC!I left the cinema completely flabbergasted at the movie itself and how much I loved it.I knew of the impressive cast so I knew it didn't just focus on Mars but what I didn't expect was just how much of the film cut between Mars, Earth and in between and how smooth and effortlessly it was done.The story is brilliant and entertaining throughout but also a lot funnier than I thought it would be. The special fx are awesome and they don't try to overdo it with what Mars could be like.Now let's talk about the cast; this may be one of the best group of actors in a film.

I was especially excited about my first experience at seeing Kristen Wiig in a serious role and I was not disappointed.Even the soundtrack of this movie is awesome with artists like David Bowie, Donna Summer and ABBA.Immediately after seeing this movie, it has made its way into my Top 5 of 2015 and probably also my Top 10 of all time!See this movie – it's brilliant.CHAPPY THINKS that the potatoes may have been made from sh*t but this movie wasn't!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""I'm the first person to be alone on an entire planet""","I'd heard nothing but great things about this film beforehand. After seeing it, my verdict is ""Good, but far from great."" It certainly keeps your attention, and is an interesting mix of science fiction, survival tale, thriller-diller, and political intrigue. What it shows about NASA's dilemmas in how/when they tell the public what is happening, how they assess the respective risks in their various options, and so forth is pretty convincing. Still, I have to wonder if NASA would really go to all this expense and trouble in trying to save one person whose odds of survival are stacked this high against him.A few other random points:*Some breath-taking Martian and outer space scenery. I would have liked more in this department, particularly on Mars-in-general, but I suppose that one of the film's strengths is that it doesn't try too hard to bedazzle us. The primary mission here is to show one fellow's fight to survive in a distant and hostile environment.*Some real surprises and turnabouts which, particularly toward the end, descend into yeah-right unlikelihoods and too-easies. Many people, it seems, would rather have big stretches and reaches than boring predictabilities, and the whole story is, of course, pretty unlikely, though not impossible. Nevertheless, the makers of this film could have tried a little harder in several key places.*Though I've never been a huge Matt Damon fan, those who are should enjoy his performance as marooned exobotanist Mark Watney. Jessica Chastain, Sean Bean, and a couple of others steal the show insofar as acting goes: It's just unfortunate that we don't see more of them. Much of the dialogue, particularly Watney's—""In your FACE, Neil Armstrong!"" etc--is rather hokey and not quite as clever as intended.*While I'm a novice in these areas, some of the science and technology here is obviously implausible, and I would guess that most rocket scientists and physicists would find it downright ludicrous in a number of spots.*Last but certainly not least, the zero-g scenes are a lot of fun. Trying to leave the stadium-style theater at the end, I was so marvelously disoriented that I walked UP toward the camera portal instead of DOWN toward the exit.

Well done!!!!,"I wondered whether this movie would be able to live up to the hype and I'm pleased to say it sure did from my point of view.I think Matt Damon was perfect as the lead in this sci-fi/sci-fact gem. I did find the story very believable for the most part.I have some minor concerns over the casting of some roles - in particular Sean Bean. If you need a Brit accent, you can find someone with much better acting skills (and accent too!!!). But as he's in a smaller role, it doesn't detract from the good points of this movie.It appears to me that a lot of thought went into the geographical locations and probably some input from NASA to give the movie authenticity.I saw the movie in 3D and was pleased with the effects. If you enjoyed Gravity, I think you will enjoy this even more. It's a long movie, but well worth sitting through. Personally I really enjoyed the whole concept and the well crafted story. The pace was good. It worked for me.I feel sure this will get a few nominations in the Oscars - I'd vote for Matt Damon as Best Actor.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Not taking in consideration scenes where cuts don't sync. Like for ex the scene where he miraculously find the exact spot where an old communication device is buried.

The Martian is absolutely worth checking out,"Mark Watney: ""F**k you Mars"".The story is about astronaut Mark Watney is separated from his party following a fierce storm and left behind after being presumed dead. But he has survived and with few supplies, he will have to rely on his own ingenuity to survive and figure out a way to Earth that he is still alive.You can slap Ridley Scott's name on anything and everyone (including me) will go see it. It's so awesome that you still can go to the cinema today and see a new film directed by the guy who brought us Alien, now that's freaking awesome. But Ridley can be a hit or miss with the movies that he's releasing recently such as: Robin Hood, The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings, but Prometheus (In my opinion) was pretty good and I know a lot of people may not like that movie and that's okay if you didn't like it, but I did. When I first heard about The Martian being directed by Ridley Scott, I was exciting but nervous at the same time, because as I said before about Ridley being a mix bag recently. But I kept a positive and open mind, I mean this might be the film that Ridley Scott finally went back to he's roots from the good old days.After seeing The Martian on my first viewing I liked it, but I wasn't amazed by it. It's not until the movie actually started to grow on me as I thought about it more and more, and now after thinking about it for awhile now, I can safely say that The Martian is a great movie. Ridley Scott's back everyone.Matt Damon plays Mark Watney brilliantly in this movie and this might actually be the best performance I've seen from Damon. He's hilarious, always positive and never gives up even when a lot of things don't go quite as planned, he always finds away. I also love how Damon's character can crack a joke there and then even when he's in this horrible situation; and to me it made he's character more relatable and likable. This is Matt Damon finest work as he was terrific in this movie.Ridley Scott's directing in this movie was absolutely magnificent and this has to be one of he's best films in years. The movie isn't all hilarious as there were some real suspenseful scenes in this movie, but what I thought was so brilliantly well done is that Ridley Scott mixed the humor and the suspense perfectly together. Nicely done Ridley.The rest of cast: Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ekiofor were all freaking great in this movie. Everyone in this movie was great.The writing has to be the biggest strength in this whole movie, because it was clever, funny, never lost me attention and it had a fantastic sense of humor to itself. It matched the tone of the movie perfectly as I felt that The Martian needed this type of tone.Now for the problems: My only flaw in this movie is this 25 minute sequence where it cuts back to earth with the NASA crew talking about different ways of bringing Mark back, but the stuff on Mars was more interesting. I'm not saying it was bad as the earth stuff scene was handled well and it was very well acted, but I was more interested on the stuff that was happening on Mars with Damon's character.Overall The Martian is absolutely worth checking out.

"Brilliantly Adapted, And A Lot Of Fun","I remember seeing this on cinema release and simultaneously finding it a load of fun but somewhat over-praised. A Best Picture nomination? Really?Rewatching I'm less inclined to think it's over-praised and that it's still a load of fun. It's quite an achievement to make a science-heavy survival film fun and entertaining, but Ridley Scott and co pull that off in spades; it's the inverse of the reason I've thus far avoided seeing Castaway, which from this distance I've always assumed to be a bit dull.The opening scenes are impressive but lack tension, mainly due to us all knowing Matt Damon has to survive - the other side of how Alien scored so big on first release by having the relatively unknown Weaver as the final girl. That it's science-heavy but accessible is probably as much down to the original book and the screen adapter as anything else; I haven't read the book, but recently read the author's latest, Project Hail Mary, which is similarly fun, exciting, and science-heavy. It's obviously dependent on Matt Damon, who's excellent here, along with a talent-laden supporting cast and Ridley Scott on top directorial form; I think a British director making a film about a NASA rescue (which doesn't go all according to NASA'S plan, of course) means it avoids much US nationalism (as well the original text once again), which would have been turn off for me.I see Project Hail Mary is in the works. That'll be even tougher to adapt ... but another large dose of fun if it's pulled off.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Bring him back...,"""The Martian"" is a Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a manned mission to Mars trying to explore and study it. After a huge storm Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead and his team leave him behind while they leave to return to Earth. However Mark Watney survives from the storm and finds himself alone on one of the most hostile planets trying to survive by himself with a few supplies.I liked this movie very much because of the plot which was very interesting. It remind me the movie ""Interstellar"" at some points which I believe that is an also good movie. The interpretation of Matt Damon who played as Astronaut Mark Watney was simply outstanding. At this point I have to say that the direction which made by Ridley Scott was very good and I did not expect anything less from him. In addition to this I found the combination of some humorist scenes with some more harsh scenes very interesting.Lastly I have to say that ""The Martian"" is an interesting movie to watch with a well written script and equally good plot. In this movie you can watch the true aspect of survival and the obstacles that a person has to go through in order to survive alone with no help from anywhere and anyone. One mistake of his and everything may finish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Average In Every Way,"There is much hype around The Martian. Ridley Scott, Matt Damon and a dynamite supporting cast that features a story about a man trying to survive on Mars armed only with his intellect and will.When I heard this, I thought the picture would be similar tonally to Cast Away. An unforgiving environment, brutal conditions, desperation and watching a character grow in order to survive his ordeal.Instead, Damon is cool under fire the entire time. There is never any sense of desperation, change or arc to speak of (at least that is significant). When things go wrong, they're easily fixed and the tone of this picture is inconsistent with its scenario.Jokes abound. Whether it's from NASA on Earth, Damon's crew that left him behind or Damon himself, they just keep on rolling with what feels like a three jokes a minute standard screenplay formula in a movie about a man trapped on Mars!It just doesn't work. It's not bad. The performances are fine, Scott's direction is fine, the writing is fine and it's technically fine. But that's about it. No risks or ingenuity, no real heart or emotion. No stakes. It takes about as unique a scenario as you could conjure and makes it flat, predictable and tonally inconsistent.Humor here and there is fine, but Drew Goddard's effusive use of humor is tiresome and takes you out of the film.No characters are really developed here and you sort of just wait around for the inevitable conclusion of the picture. Maybe this would have worked better as a short.With the last two years, two incredible space pictures (especially technically speaking: Gravity and Interstellar) came out and did some bombastic things. Each had fast moving stories, top notch special effects and were unpredictable in their conclusion. They had their main characters grow and place them in diverse scenarios that kept the tension high at all times. There was a sense of danger regardless of their shortcomings (Interstellar's ending and Gravity's Sandra Bullock).In this film there's none of that. While the solutions Damon's character comes up with are smart, you don't get a dramatic sense of struggle throughout the film. Lack of struggle equals decreased tension.I'm not sure why this movie is so revered by movie goers and critics. I feel left out. Maybe it was just my expectations and wanting to see the movie I wish it could have been that left me feeling cold. Still, a tensionless film with such a good cast and crew is a terrible thing to waste.6/10- Average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A shallow Hollywood adaptation,"Having much enjoyed the novel, I was eager to see how the film would handle it. Sadly this is at best a decent children's movie. The only real positive is its high production values.The tone is compltely off. Important swathes of the story feel completely rushed, with the result that the events of the story have limited or no emotional impact. Any suspense is lost as Mark immediately solves every problem the moment it is presented. This is cemented by the choice to replace all the scientific work Mark does (the bread and butter of the novel) with goofily upbeat montages set to cheesy songs. Important scientific elements of the story are left unexplained in an apparent effort to appeal to a wider audience by dumbing it down further.This is only reinforced by the decision to strip the story of profanity, leaving an over-sanitised, superficial, jarringly unrealistic tone. This is not how adults speak in crisis situations.Matt Damon's performance was mediocre - the novel's Watney is a very sympathetic, charming character because he is humble and both vulnerable and positive in the face of extreme adversity. By contrast Damon's Watney is cocky and superhumanly unfazed or shocked by his circumstances, in other words a generic Hollywood protagonist. And far from being charming his delivery of gag lines is unfunny enough to make him slightly annoying.Most of the supporting cast is also wooden and uninteresting. Rich Purnell is supposed to be a highly intelligent if antisocial, difficult person. Instead he is a clownish goofball played by a comedian.Overall the film isn't *bad* but is a missed opportunity for a sober, thoughtful space adventure and is instead mostly just another shallow, by-the-numbers Hollywood thriller.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Title should be: ""Another triumphal success of the NASA"".","Title should be: ""Another triumphal success of the NASA"".Big names like Ridley Scott doesn't automatically mean great movies. Once proved again.The movie with the premise of the successful rescue of a stranded man on the mars in fact does not give much space for an elaborate story. But in the movie even that limitation seems to be undercut. Soft-footed straight forward to the rescue, which is never in doubt, on the waves of the 70's disco sound. Does not really make the big thrill. As criticized in other reviews, no slightest signs of loneliness, despair etc., the movie goes on in a completely positive attitude. Le cliché US par excellence.CGI and settings are nicely done, Damon's acting job is OK. Surely watchable, but nothing to be remembered. 8.2 rating ATM seems still quite overrated for me. However, better than ""Gravity"", I still have not recovered from the fact how may Oscars that dull movie has won.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Predictable and disappointing,"I don't really understand all the hype behind this movie. Maybe it's because I've heard the book was so good that this movie created some buzz before its release. I normally enjoy sci fi movies and I am generally a fan of Ridley Scott. I enjoy being moved by great acting performances and being awed by the mysteriousness and the unknown this type of genre is able to project on the big screen. However, this movie did none of the above for me. Although Matt Damon is an excellent actor, it was difficult for me to fully buy into his character. Despite being alone and stranded on Mars, he lacked emotion and credibility. The other characters in this movie fell flat, too. The biggest disappointments were Kristen Wiig and Jeff Daniels – it was too one dimensional, lacked versatility, and was to cliché. Actually, the plot was very cliché and was very predictable. And the special effects and action sequences were far too similar to what we saw in Prometheus. I guess I expected more with this cast and director but was left wanting so much more.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Seriously - this is what movies are supposed to do...,"""The Martian"" was a phenomenal film, score, acting and source material.Movies are magic, they are and can be transcendent, a showcase of human potential and chapter mark for a brand new idea. How about showing someone fighting mans oldest foe (nature), with his greatest weapons (hope and knowledge)? This movie is a textbook example of borrowing source material and breathing full blown life into it.There are dozens of critical analysis of either, but this film can reach out to people and show people, literally, where we could go next.Its a lesson for grade school, high school and college - instead of giving young people impossible, nonsensical lessons in the use of mathematics, advanced mathematics, botany, rugged outdoor survival, - solve for X and get Whateley home!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Solid Watch!,"Based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel by the same name, 'The Martian' is an Epic Sci-Fi Adventure, that offers solid entertainment. Its a gripping film, about about survival & hope. Legendary Director Sir Ridley Scott & Actors Matt Damon & Jeff Daniels are at their finest!'The Martian' Synopsis: During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.'The Martian' is about human willpower. If one has the courage & belief, He/She can conquer any difficulty, even if its beyond planet Earth. Mark Watney (Played by Matt Damon) is a fine, fine protagonist, who's spirit to survive & fight against all odds, makes his unbelievable journey, all the more engrossing. You are with him throughout the turbulence & you never stop rooting for him.Drew Goddard's Adapted Screenplay is top-notch. Its a challenging, inspiring & throughly entertaining Story, that hardly misses a beat. I was glued to the screen from start to finish. Sir Ridley Scott's Direction is exemplary. 'The Martian' is among his best works, as the Master Storyteller handles the intensity, with precision. Dariusz Wolski's Cinematography is perfect. Pietro Scalia's Editing is razor-crisp, despite a running-time of over 140-minutes! Art & Costume Design are excellent. Graphics & 3D Effects are top-class. Harry Gregson-Williams's Score is soulful.Performance-Wise: Matt Damon is at his peak here. Emboding Mark Watney from head to toe, he leads the narrative with a forceful performance. He gives us a protagonist, we'd like to remember for a long time. Supporting him superbly back home is Jeff Daniels as Teddy Sanders, head of NASA. He's flawless. Of the rest, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor, a NASA mission director, Kristen Wiig as Annie Montrose, NASA spokesperson, Jessica Chastain as Melissa Lewis, Ares III commander, Kate Mara as Beth Johanssen, an astronaut & Sean Bean as Mitch Henderson, a NASA mission director, leave a strong impression.On the whole, 'The Martian' is a ride that needs to be experienced!

Excellent !!!! holds your attention from start to finish.,"Wonderful photography, incredible Matt Damon acting.This film makes us think how difficult and same time possible the colonization of other planets, and how the water discovery would make much difference. It is a film that holds your attention from start to finish.Ridley Scott has changed a lot the climate of this space movie, does not follow his classic style, it is not dark and do not have much suspense, if any, the film is quite optimistic, the difficulties encountered by the characters are very realistic and plausible solutions, reaches one point that we feel it in mars along with them and that it is not so much difficult than an underwater exploration or climb mount everest.In my opinion the only weak point of the film is the speed of the progress in the third act, it is very fast, losing the pace.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Another masterpiece from Ridley Scott,"First of all,the review is spoiler free so feel free to read it if you haven't seen the movie yet.Firstly,the cast. They are all excellent and experienced actors and actresses and they did their job on the level that it should be done.Starting with Matt Damon who plays astronaut Mark Watney.His acting ability is great and he made 100% effort to role.Certainly one of his best roles. Jessica Chastain plays the role of mission commander Melissa Lewis,which suits her just fine,knowing that she has experience with movies about space.She played in the Interstellar last year which was one of the best movie of the year. Not to mention Sean Bean,who is absolutely amazing and most likely one of the best actors in Hollywood.Although he plays a minor role in this movie that hasn't stopped him to act so well. One of the biggest pluses in the movie is surly acting. A bit about the plot(without spoiling anything),most of the time atmosphere is very intense and serious,but there are several scenes with good sense of humor which helps the viewers to relax after very intense scene.Visual effects and CGI. Mars looks as it should look because of all the CGI effects of the place where movie was shoot and it is really nice to see,especially in 4K resolution and 3D technology.All rocket launches,explosions and martian storms are done perfectly.It really makes you feel they're real.In conclusion this is definitely Oscar worth movie and one of the best movies of the year,if not the best.Space fanatics(like me) will enjoy the movie all the time and will feel the tension as it is supposed to be felt.If anyone thinks they won't understand a single word in the movie,I can tell they're wrong.The movie is made for everyone,children,teenagers,adults and scientists so everyone will be able to understand what're they talking about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"It was good, but it wasn't anything new.","I enjoyed this movie, but I didn't love it, not like I loved Gravity. That doesn't go to say though that the acting wasn't amazing, the science wasn't well thought out and the graphics and CGI weren't all very well done, because they were!I think what was missing for me was that complete sense of loneliness and that eerie feeling that I feel being alone on a massive planet, with barely any communication with anyone, and no life besides him and his crops, honestly, that part could have been done better. Think about it, how damn scary would that be, knowing that you won't see anyone or talk to anyone in many many years. I know I would feel pretty scared.It was a great movie though, and I assume it will be up for some awards. I recommend seeing it at the movies so you can get that atmosphere from watching it on the big screen, and when a movie with space is involved I always recommend seeing it at the movies as it creates that whole sense of a large space, a very large space.Most viewers will love it! Matt Damon was amazing as per usual and it's worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Competently Made But Felt Empty,"This film made me feel neutral. I found the using-science-to-solve-problems aspect interesting but that isn't what makes a film resonate with me. It's the characters. The characters in this film do not feel like people. They feel empty. Sure, Mark Watney, the lead played by Matt Damon, has a personality I guess. We learn early on that he is an easy-going guy who can remain calm in most stressful situations. However, there isn't much else to him. I had no reason to connect to him. No one bothered to give him any sort of arc or background. He doesn't change or grow as a person at all. I know not every protagonist has to go through some sort of change but this character could have with at least a little bit of internal conflict.This applies to the rest of the cast as well. Only four characters in the film stood out to me in anyway: Watney, Rich Purnell (Donald Glover), Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Michael Peña's character. Watney because he is, I suppose, more well rounded than the rest of the cast; Purnell because an archetypal quirky genius character is better than no character at all; Kapoor because his skills in communication and persuasion make him stand out which is a required quality for his job (Mars mission director, I had to look it up on Wikipedia); and Peña's character because of the two tiny moments of banter between him and Watney. Everyone else is defined by their jobs (which I've forgotten for the most part anyway) and what actions they need to do for their job.When it comes to technical aspects, nothing was really done badly but nothing was done exceptionally either. The direction served its purpose but didn't impress. The cast did a pretty good job in their roles but no one made up for their lacklustre* characters. The visual effects are good. Granted, nothing stood out but that wasn't the purpose. They're supposed to make the spectacle look convincing, and they accomplish that.Lastly, I would like to mention the score. Throughout most of the film, I didn't really pay attention to it but in the first few scenes when Watney is stranded on Mars, I felt that the music was too overdramatic. This probably isn't that much of a problem as I forgot about it quickly but it's distracting when the score is too intense or emotional for the scene it's accompanying.Overall, this film neither impressed nor annoyed me. It's competently well made but it feels empty. If either the premise or the problem solving aspect interests you, you might like it. Otherwise, you can skip it.*That's the British spelling of ""lackluster"" apparently.http://letterboxd.com/lloyd_morgan/film/the-martian/",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Best Movie I've Ever Seen,"I thought it was the best movie of 2015! I'm not overrating on this, but it's truly a genius movie. If a friend or someone ask me, ""Do you find this movie is good? Do you recommend it?"" I'll answer a hundred percent yes. Perfect cinematography (why did only r-scott, matt, and the editors who get the nominees, it's should've been the cinematography). I didn't read the book yet, i don't even know that there is the book of The Martian. But i thought it was amazing.The film is very emotional, and Matt live it perfectly (i cried a lot) so if you guys are a sci-fi fan you have to watch it or you're wasting your time as a sci-fi fan (it's too much :P) It's the combination of drama that will make us like touched but also frightening sci-fi plot.Yes, it's exactly to pick Ridley Scott, i mean he's a sci-fi 'god' look at his film!

It takes a quarter hour to figure out. Or it's just me who has a stinky brain :DNB: Watch it, take my words, you'll NEVER regret my suggestion. Oh, don't watch it with kids under 13.

Blew me away,"This is one of the more memorable movies I have seen, in some ways it is very hard to describe how good I felt it was. Matt Damon shows what I always thought about him, that he is an intelligent actor able to give any role that special touch. He is playing a very intelligent character and he does it seamlessly. He also gives the character a sardonic sense of humor, which means this is not cold or pure hard science. Likewise, when he finally interacts with the rest of the crew of his ship, the interplay is what you would expect.The movie is a rare thing, it is a hard science fiction movie that has the human touch, the casting was fantastic and you see the humanity.It has touches of Apollo 13 where the nerds with the pocket protectors and slide rules pull off a miracle, but it also has a lot of the human emotion, humor and at times sadness, that make it real. John Campbell, considered the founder of modern SF, said that science fiction was not about the technology, but about how human beings react to it, and that is the core of this movie. The fact that the technology here is not star wars level, but technology that either does or potentially could exist in the near future, and it makes it come off as something that might happen.It is also nice to see a movie where the heroes are not all white nerdy guys, plenty of those, but plenty of other people, the mission is commanded by a woman, women play major roles, and you have a lot of non white people as scientists and such. I think that helps give the feeling of awe the movie generated in me, that it was a mish mash of people working to have this happen.The movie is long, yet it didn't seem like that, and where you have a movie where a single character is on the screen most of the time and it doesn't drag, that says something. The filming is well done, and this has elements of a lot of Ridley Scott's work, though I personally think it is his masterpiece, if this is his last movie it is a doozie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Don't miss this movie,"The Martian is my second favorite book of all time, so I was very worried Hollywood would find some way to mess this up. While they left out plenty from the book, the character of the book was very faithfully interpreted and the movie actually brought me to tears.This might be the only time I've ever seen Hollywood reduce the amount of danger, action, and vulgarity to make a movie that appealed to a younger audience. It's really out of character for Hollywood to downplay an explosion, but hey, the movie is already 2 hours and 21 minutes.Everything about this movie is top notch, from the A-list actors, to the special effects, to the soundtrack, to the directing, to the extras. I'm extremely proud of Matt Damon on this one, since he's been successful enough he could have coasted. Instead, he knocked it out of the park, even becoming visibly emaciated at the appropriate point, which goes to show the level of discipline a true professional really has.Read the book, but don't miss this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
No masterpiece here,"(Full disclosure: I was a little torked during the movie due to drinking a whole flask of bourbon rather quickly, but with some popcorn.)It's hard to watch a movie like The Martian without trying to put yourself in the hero's shoes. I've read some studies about total isolation suggesting everyone goes crazy without some meaningful human interaction. I know people have lived hermetic lives in deserts, so clearly someone with enough mental composure could survive alone for a couple of years, even if being unable to ""science the sh*t"" out of anything in particular. My first reaction to solitude for the first time in months would've been to engage in a masturbatory marathon, but our hero instead spends time thinking about mundane projects like trying to grow enough food to survive until he can be rescued.Our hero is Mark Watney. He's a hero because he gets hit by some space stuff and everyone else on his team does the French goodbye. I have a hard time hearing ""Watney"" without reminiscing over Watney's Cream Stout, but I did have trusty bourbon at hand. The Martian imagery surely recalls Prometheus, especially the scenes involving roving around in rovers. However, we get horrible running jokes about (bad) disco music, which differentiates it wildly from Prometheus. There's nothing predator gross or alien scary running around Mars (this time).It's a triumph of the spirit (will, even, if you will), slightly jingoistic and Americanly exceptionalist, until NASA needs help from China. Instead of the annoying just-in-time saves we see all too often in disaster films, the Martian is riddled with just-in-time disasters, much like every episode of Gilligan's Island (except I'm pretty sure there was some later TV movie where they get off the island or go back and start a hotel with the Harlem Globetrotters). The movie is too long, I didn't care whether they saved our hero, and the special effects of space movies still have yet to outperform 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey.The good: The Martian reminds us that Sean Bean should be in every movie, Matt Damon is in too many movies, and Kristen Wiig can adequately do non-comedy. Michael Peña survives without being too campy or loud, and Jeff Daniels can cash a check with the best of them. Impressively, this might be the first movie I've seen all year that is pro-science.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Sci-fi at its best,"""It has been seven days since I ran out of Ketchup.""SPOILER FREE ZONEThe Martian is a book adapted sci-fi adventure about a man being stranded on Mars (the planet not the chocolate) and him trying to survive until NASA can figure out a way to bring him home. It stars Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and Jeff Daniels, and is directed by Ridley Scott.I've been a fan of Ridley Scott for a while as have a lot of people who love the sci-fi genre, but his movie list lately isn't impressive mainly due to the lack of emphasis on character. He's always been able to shoot beautifully as he does in The Martian, but maybe due to the material and the screen writer the characters shown on screen stood out. They were all believable in a situation that could possibly happen a few years from now and none of them were one dimensional. Matt Damon is the stand out for me. Not many actors can hold a movie all on their own, and sure Damon had others with him, but without him the movie would never have worked. He entertained and drove the story forward. I'm not one who watches out for the Oscars, but he is pretty much a shoo-in for a nomination.There was a lot of hype around The Martian due to the book having only come out a few years ago (a book I am a few chapters into currently). The premise behind it was simple; Man stranded waiting for rescue (Wilson!!). But the way all the problems were shown and solved by the main character as well as NASA, are very original. The attention to detail and the thought process as you follow the lone man follow logical sense; something that can't be said for a lot of films. It's fantastically made and written. The Martian will probably go down as one of my favourite movies and easily my best of the year.GO WATCH THE MARTIAN!!SCORE: 9.5/10SPOILERS GALOREThe first time I went to watch The Martian the fire alarm went off midway through so I went back the next day and happily watched it all from the start. What this movie did so well is find the balance between being nerdy science and entertaining. This could have easily been a drama and have straight faces and tears throughout. But it was far from that. Sure it had its more serious moments but they worked well with Mark's hilarious video logs on Mars. He has some of the funniest lines, some I use pretty often now; 'I've got to science the s*** out of this.' From a movie making stand point there isn't many holes you can poke, but scientifically there's a couple. None of these take anything away from the movie what so ever.I'm going to get a little nerdy in this paragraph so stick with me. I loved the way The Martian started. No need to take 30 minutes to set the scene *cough* Interstellar *cough*. But Mars's atmosphere is very thin as was pointed out towards the end of the movie with the lack of aerodynamics in the escape pod Damon flies to space in. So how was there a huge storm that could blow over the shuttle on Mars? Also, Damon should probably have died a few times but its a movie so its fine. But what took me out of it, was the end sequence of him poking a hole in his suit to thrust him towards the ship. There is no way he controls the release with such ease. This is all just me nit picking the science of a Hollywood movie. Out of all the things, I think the biggest surprise came from Sean Bean actually surviving until the end!The Martian is ultimately a celebration of problem solving. A lot of movies brush over aspects thinking the audience will be bored by the science and skip to the action. It's what this movie did so well. It explained everything perfectly without making us go, ""That's just stupid."" The Martian has a 140 minute run time but at no moment did I feel it dragging. Its a must watch for all movie fans out there.Also I think Matt Damon is our most decorated fake astronaut.

'Every human being has a basic instinct: to help each other out',"'Every human being has a basic instinct: to help each other out' Odd that everyone is raving about the acting in this film. Yes, it is a good idea to watch the survival of a lone man on another planet, but the acting and the dialogue are so flat line and the actors seem so uninvolved with this read-through of a script that after a while all the fancy special effects even get more interesting than the story. Some are remarking how far better Andy Weir's book is in comparison, but even Ridley Scott has slow moments in trying to keep this space venture airborne.The story (brief as it is) – 'During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring ""the Martian"" home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible, rescue mission. As these stories of incredible bravery unfold, the world comes together to root for Watney's safe return.'The cast includes such winning actors as Michael Peña, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean and others but there is little to no development of their characters until the very end.

In fact I've just re-watched it this weekend for the umpteenth time, and it still holds up exceptionally well, from the beauty of the Martian landscapes, to the ingenuity and humor of Watney, to the beautifully scripted dynamics in NASA offices and laboratories.Do you want movies with strong female characters? Here you have a commander and a computer scientist on a mission to Mars, a competent PR executive and a lowly employee who rises through the ranks and gets into meetings with the top guys - NASA is an equal opportunity employer.There's no tacked-on love story aside from a chaste kiss through a spacesuit helmet; on the other hand you get plenty of technical details made interesting and funny.And, maybe it's just me, but this dialogue cracks me every time (Daniels' and Glover's acting is spot-on):

"It's Too Bad, But I've Already Seen Classic Sci-Fi Survial Films Like Robinson Crusoe On Mars(1964) and Enemy Mine(1985).","But as a time-pass film it's definitely worth a watch. This is Matt Damon's second science-fiction horror film film following Elysium(2013).This film is directed by the highly acclaimed director who is best known for the cult science-fiction horror film film Alien(1979) The film is about a stranded astronaut Mark Watney who is left behind on Mars. The first part of film is about how he manages to stay alive while a rescue mission is planned. Mark Watney is a botanist by profession, and as his food source is dwindling he decides to grow some potatoes in Mars's soil.The second part of the film deals with the planning essential to his rescue. NASA director Theodore ""Teddy"" Sanders(veteran actor Jeff Daniels) debates whether the lives of Mark's fellow astronauts is worth risking to save one life.Public concern increases as Marks plight is televised back on Earth. Mission commander Melissa Lewis(Jessica Chastain) deliberately disobeys her orders and plots a course to rescue Mark.Will Mark be rescued or will further disaster ensue? Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: Cast is decent. The photography is by the acclaimed Dariusz Wolski(The Crow 1994, Crimson Tide 1995, A Perfect Murder 1998, Hide and Seek 2005, Prometheus 2012). Harry Gregson-Williams has directed the music for the film. He has worked in films like The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, X-Men Origins: Wolverine and the Shrek franchise.Supporting actors Sean Bean, Michael Peña, Chiwetel Ejiofor(Amistad 1997, 12 Years a Slave 2013), Benedict Wong and Donald Glover give professional performances.There is one more thing I must mention, earlier I saw The Europa Report(2013) which I consider to be the best modern science fiction film ever made. I sincerely recommend you to see this film in theater, online or through DVD/BLU RAY rental.More films to see: Journey to the Far Side of the Sun a.k.a. Doppelgänger (1969), Mission To Mars(2000), Red Planet(2000), Gravity (2013), The First Men in the Moon (1964) and lastly the superb film based on the true events of Apollo 13 made into a 1995 film directed by the acclaimed Ron Howard.Thank you for reading my review, live long and prosper.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The man on Mars,Ridley Scott's The Martian was wonderfully realised on 3D for the big cinema screen. It probably will not come across well on the small screen.Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is separated from his spacecraft and crew on a mission to Mars. Instead of panicking he overcomes the obstacles in his way by thinking outside of the box to survive as long as possible.When NASA find out that Mark is still alive his former crew mates turn around for a rescue mission.The film is essentially a lone survival film without the protagonist not exactly getting too lonely or crazy. There is the parallel story of NASA and other agencies working together on the rescue mission as Mark's predicament catches the public's attention.The problem with this type of movie and it happened with Gravity is that you can be blown away with special effects the first time round but it might lack rewatch value.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Original idea surrounded by clichés,"""The Martian"" is futuristic yet plausible, which makes it bold but not necessarily original, the entire movie is surrounded by space clichés. Not just in details like in ""don't let go of my hand into space"" but a lot more have already been covered in other movies, like having the help of another country in a complicated mission, you don't wanna compare but they force it, makes it impossible to give them a break.The slow timing makes it boring, when watching a space movie you expect more thrilling scenes. The entire story takes place in over a year and that's not very well played. Because everything takes so long to happen... When it does... it's almost as if nobody cares anymore. So the movie lacks that timing tension that is important in cases like this.The acting is good, the story line is digestible, very scientific, Matt Damon's character talks cool nerd all the time, I'm satisfied with the experience but I wouldn't recommend it as a great (must see), mainly because it did not reach my expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Unexpected Good Fun,"The Martian was deemed a comedy by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for the Golden Globe awards. It is definitely one of the most fun Ridley Scott films to date, even if it doesn't reach the sophistication of his films Alien and Blade Runner. This film is definitely not trying to be a comedy, however - it is a drama with a fun tone to it.Contributing to this fun tone is an ensemble made up of actors with great comedic chops such as Kristen Wiig, Donald Glover, and Michael Pena. Matt Damon recording his log while on Mars also proves to be funny throughout most of the movie. His character is great and shows a wide range of personality - he is a smart-aleck and sarcastic when he is optimistic, and he is rightfully ticked off the next moment. In both of these situations Damon plays it so perfectly to come across as funny in both instances.His performance does get more dramatic though. As he spends more and more time on Mars he becomes desperate yet optimistic that he will be rescued. It is also unclear whether Damon had to lose weight for part of the performance, as weight loss in the character was noticeable but seemed almost unnatural upon viewing - heavy chance cgi was involved. Either way, Damon's performance in this film proves to show talent on a wide range of the spectrum.The shots are constructed very well in this film. The editing proves to be interesting as well. A lot of point of view shots are used and are labeled as such - most notably there are shots that represent directly the video log Damon's character is recording, and shots from inside his helmet and over his shoulder are used and labeled along the lines of ""suit camera - Watney.""There's also a huge focus on technology - most notably screens - in this film as well. It is how NASA must communicate with Watney - first by satellite images, then by a camera on Mars with Watney, then through what is essentially e-mail. When NASA is communicating with other people on Earth the communication is done through the use of screens as well. It is unclear whether this is simply because technology allows for this way to communicate in our day and age, or if this is a commentary on the way we use technology. Or perhaps this is to compare and contrast to Watney's struggles - he is constantly recording video logs, but those logs are not used for communication.In the third act of the film it seems very similar to Apollo 13 since the focus is to help an astronaut come home. Since the struggle is to retrieve a lone survivor rather than to figure how to land on Earth safely, it proves to be more interesting and a lot more complex. Looking over the other great films of 2015, this film is amongst them, but not quite towards the top. This was an unexpectedly really fun movie from Ridley Scott.3.5/4.0",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining but not realistic,"The movie was an entertaining ride and Ridley Scott is a good director. The Martian as a movie is interesting since Mars travels is not that far into the future and it deals with some interesting questions like how to grow crops on distance planets and also the danger if somethings goes wrong. It was not over the top unrealistic but as an educated engineer I felt some parts where questionable. The duct tape ""savings"" is probably not working on the surface of Mars and some other things like how he could move the 400 kg hatch from the rocket by himself etc. And why did he not write something in the sand or anything if he knew Nasa could see a photo of the station from earth every day? However, the most questionable thing is how Nasa handles the situation. The first contact they have with Mark is broad casted live to the public, really? Nasa's engineers can't come up with any way to rescue him before a flimsy young guy explains it with a stapler, really? They did not tell the other crew because they would be distracted in their mission, really? Nasa's engineers is rushing a start of a rocket launch so fast they miss to do critical safety testings and blows the rocket, really? And so on.. Entertaining at least, not educational.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
What a ridiculous waste of time. A true insult of a viewer's intelligence.,"1st of all, the premise is all wrong, so there is no suspended disbelief effect here. Therefore, the rest of the movie becomes less than believable. BTW, I ""appreciate"" the whole re-use and abuse of the ""Aliens"" concepts and designs in the initial titles and the crew quarters appearances. Awesome. Reuse/Recycle. No new ideas there.A whole manned mission to Mars couldn't include a way to observe the Martian weather (this being possible for tens of years as we speak) and to land safely at a nice, wind-safe crater or to anchor a return vehicle securely enough? REALLY? And once a bit of a storm blew, the entire crew had to hurry back to Earth? ALL THE WAY BACK? They could not stay in the Martian orbit for a few hours even to make sure that they didn't leave anyone behind? WHAT? The orbit became dangerous too because of some storm? Am I the only one who could not believe that the hatches would seal nicely in a sand/rock/what's not storm? There was no two-way comm with any crew members? Once someone got blown away, then it was the end for him/her? Even on Earth this sounds dumb. Cool crappy, unrealistic suits! No real protection, funny boots, no visible means of backpacked life-support, lots of light blinding the users inside helmets and no light (as well as no two-way comm) for the actual work?! Then, no one could keep a communication satellite in the Martian orbit? So that no one would have to reinvent the wheel it order to communicate between the surface and the command center??? No further comments here.Kudos to the political correctness lawyers. They didn't miss one single detail. The manned mission to Mars includes the politically correct balance of males and females, they got a Mexican, a German (seriously???), and then the entire NASA's Martian program has the necessary number of very respectfully black Hindus and other African Americans. Good Job! Then there is the necessary number of Asians gets involved. And the Chinese government decides what's wrong with the whole rescue mission. Nice.Considering that neither NASA nor the Chinese can STILL fly anything worth a rat's jazz into space without the Russian-made tech, it is funny to see the whole story without any Russian involvement. Even the privately funded SpaceX program seems more effective these days than NASA! Nice political BS, holly-crap-wood.Look. I have given up expecting anything even closely serious from Hollywood. Yes, this movie is another all-time-low. Thank you for producing another piece of expensive garbage intended for people who practically kill one another on each ""black Friday"". I hope that those zombies enjoy this kind of BS. Ridley Scott, you, Sir, are a talent-less waste. Please, retire already. O&O.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It's Hard Not to Like This Movie!!,"I opted not to see ""The Martian"" when it first hit theaters some months ago. Sure, I heard at the time that it was good, but how good could it possibly be? It looked like someone just took the cast of ""Interstellar"" and mixed that movie's plot with ""Cast Away"".Well, it turns out that's not quite accurate. Instead someone took the cast of Interstellar and threw them into a plot that is a mix of Cast Away and ""Apollo 13"". Yes, if one is to be quite picky, there's only so much originality here--or at least that's true as far as the overarching narrative of this film is concerned. If you've seen the two latter movies, you basically can figure out the plot of, ""The Martian"".Still, what I didn't reckon with is that both ""Cast Away"" and ""Apollo 13"" are each extraordinary movies--and as such, this movie, which emulates each of the two in its own way, is a likewise extraordinary film.Again, it is unfortunate that basically the exact same cast that appeared in the ""2001""-inspired ""Interstellar"" sci fi flick a year or two back are all featured prominently here in this film (Matthew McConaughey the one notable exception). As such, at times it almost feels like you've seen the movie before--Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain get lost in space, we get it.Still, the reality is that as much as I want to nitpick at this movie, I just can't really throw anything out there that really greatly takes away from the film. It's just simply well made and fun. Yes, the film's climax is a bit overdone (this time channeling ""Gravity"" more so than ""Apollo 13""), but all in all there's just too much to enjoy here to be truly critical. Indeed, having seen all the Oscar nominees for Best Picture now except ""The Revenant"" (saving the best for last, perhaps), I'd have to say that this may be my favorite film out of the lot.I'm demoting the one star for the reasons listed above, but all in all this movie is fantastic. 9/10 stars!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An excellent example of the art of being a director,"Ron Howard famously made audiences fear that the Apollo 13 astronauts would not be able to guide their damaged spacecraft back to earth, a pretty neat trick given the film told the story of a well-publicized event where the fate of Jim Lovell and company was well-known. Ridley Scott maybe on-ups him by translating the science fiction procedural ""The Martian"" into a film that makes you (in your less mindful moments) wonder how much the film reflects the real events (perhaps these are real but future events?). Also credit Scott for making a ""Castaway""-like story of one man isolated and trapped into a compelling narrative. The challenge all the greater than Castaway given the amount of straight up math involved in the book (what's is a hexadecimal anyway and how does one help you communicate?). So no Academy Award nomination for Scott? Well it is up against ""Room"" where Lenny Abrahamson faced the challenge of recreating 2 people stuck in a room. Anyway, Matt Damon does get a best acting nom basically for being a likable guy who is good at math which required Damon to stretch - at least as far as the math part goes. He's favored to win largely as The Academy's way of saying: ""Suck it Leo"". The remainder of the cast is not terribly consequential, the writing is decent if a little math-heavy and the story satisfying.

The Martian is a must watch,"The Martian (2015) directed by Ridley Scott, is an adaptation of the novel by Andy Weir. The film stars Matt Damon as Mark Watney; Matt Damon's portrayal of the character was excellent as he clearly depicted the mental struggle of being left on a planet alone. You could see how Watney felt, the hope when things went right and the pain when everything was stacked against him, this added to the film by making the character multidimensional and truly adding a human aspect to space. The film also looks at many aspects of space travel, including the political and corporate side of space travel by showing how the commissions and the people at NASA dealt with finding out Watney was alive and how to move forward. This made the film even better as it allowed multiple aspects of the story to be examined and flushed out. The movie was very strong in how it showed the story from all angles, you could see Watney and his struggle, the crews processing the fact that Watney was alive and how NASA and the world dealt with the news of Watney. The film also excelled in its use of humor, the humor provided great contrast to the harsh reality of the film and really helped the film. There were also beautiful cinematic shots of mars that added to the film and provided great imagery as there was stark emptiness to mirror how alone Watney was, but also add a bit of irony as the beautiful place is very treacherous. The use of different camera shots added to the film, from the long cinematic views of mars, then the helmet cams, and the video ""diary"", all of these different techniques made the film come to life. All in all, the Martian features great acting, stunning cinematic work along with an excellent plot and is a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Most boring movie of the year, by far.","2 hours and 21 minutes of Matt Damon gardening, and people at NASA discussing how to rescue him. Seriously. That's the whole movie.

A 22-year-old hot model-type woman is the only one at NASA smart enough to locate Damon. And a 22-year-old slob who looks like he's strung-out on drugs (rolling out of a bed in his FILTHY MESSY office, twitching, shaking, stuttering) is the only one at NASA smart enough to think of using a slingshot-effect for the rocket. But they're SOOOO smart that they can attend high-level, and I'm talking the highest level on a national scale....they can attend these meetings in street clothes, while everyone else is in suits and ties.I know Damon is extremely politically-correct, and so are most Hollywood movies these days. But this one goes too far. Literally every scene alternates between a person of a different race. White, African-American, African, Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern.

Loved the visuals and Matt.,"As expected with Ridley Scott films, the film itself is visually stunning. The landscape of Mars looks absolutely breathtaking, and the scenes aboard the Hermes and back on Earth are just as sharp in detail and scope. The way he chose to make this film made it almost seem like an exceptionally made biopic. Many times during this film, I legitimately believed that Mark Watney was a real, living person that was actually stranded on Mars for many months alone. It's Cast Away meets Apollo 13, and this marriage is crafted beautifully.Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant in this film. He plays Watney with so much optimism that it actually makes the depressing aspect of the film not as depressing for me. However, when he has to put on his dramatic chops in certain scenes, he truly commits to the drama of the situation, and that right there is true Ridley Scott suspense for you. The supporting cast, everyone involved, all do great work as well. Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor. He is one of the best actors working today, and this movie and 12 Years a Slave shows how far he's come.The most surprisingly element about this movie though was the screenplay. The film is hilarious in some parts, in fact I'd argue that it's funnier than most comedies that have come out this year. What makes to movie unique to me was Watney's optimistic point of view. He believes that he isn't going to die on Mars, and this transforms this rather depressing situation into something comical instead. But when you really think about it, this is a very personal film about some people coming together to save somebody. That's it. And in today's world, it's nice to hear an story about people coming together to save one of their own.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"More Familiar Than I Expected, It's Still an Excellent Nail-Biter","Matt Damon is left for dead during the rushed evacuation of a small-scale Martian expedition. It's like Apollo 13 on steroids, mixed with short dashes of 127 Hours, MacGyver and Survivorman. Much less of a one-man show than I was expecting, which gives the film a little more spirit but also a more conventional structure. I think it would've been a far more interesting, daring picture if we'd seen more personal video journals from space and less debate around a round table at NASA, if just because we've seen the latter film several times already. Damon is excellent, bringing a blend of hopeless desperation and punchy good humor that gives him credence as both a technical expert and a likable, relatable everyday guy. The supporting cast is scattered with some strange choices, though - Kristen Wiig in a dead-serious role and Sean Bean as a kind-hearted supervisor are particularly out of place - which left me enjoying the scenes with Damon alone in the red landscape much more than the rescue effort. Still, the epic moments far outweigh the sub-standard ones, there's a strong sense of humor beneath all the suspense, and the visuals are really pretty incredible. Bonus points for getting so much of the science right, too. I'm conditioned to expect a lot of flaws when I dig deeper into sci-fi like this, but apart from one notable exception (the weather on Mars), the experts looked at this one and said ""Yeah, that could actually work.""

Simply put, if you read the book, you will be disappointed.I am sure adapting a novel to a movie is hard. The audio book was 10 hours, so they had to cut out 8 hours of content. The movie script kept a lot of the major story points, but cut everything that made the book so great. Almost all of Watney's trials and tribulations were cut out of the movie. All his great log entries, dialog, thoughts, especially the science! Almost none of it is there. The only pieces left of his witticism is shown in the trailer. There were some shreds of subplots in the movie, which stick out if you read the book, but none of it made the final movie.Unfortunately, knowing how much better the book was, I cant give this movie more that 6 stars out of 10.

surviving,"A mission to Mars has to be aborted when a massive storm hits the surface. One crew member, believed killed during the storm, is left behind.

It is 'Castaway' in space, but less concerned with existential crisis. It is also not as po-faced. At one point Damon says ""We are going to science the sh*t out of this,'"" his emphasis on 'science' and 'sh*t.' Yes, less rigorous authenticity in the science department, but despite the less than subtle sub-text - Damon practically winks at screen when he says the line - the Internet is full of finger-waggers who have scoured their A-level Physics textbooks to trump the screenwriter. Don't watch this if you want a science lesson, but do come for some great acting, gentle amusement, and a good cry at times. And if mid-70s pop is your musical bag, you are in for a bonus.

I hadn't seen Robinson Crusoe On Mars for decades either and to see him brought up to digital date was the next best thing – although continually and sometimes hopelessly incongruous 70's disco music kept taking me back to the ye olden primitive days when NASA actually had some of their employees cavorting about on the Moon.Damon is left for dead on Mars after a big storm and disaster and has to survive and fend for himself until death or rescue. It's all extremely well done, with the usual seemingly minute attention to detail looked after, and is sufficiently gripping and entertaining. All of us millions of news-hungry space fans cheer Bravo! from Times Square, Red Square and Trafalgar Square for CNN to cover this opinion as Breaking News.

"""Red Planet, Resilient Spirit: 'The Martian' Triumphs as a Homage to Human Ingenuity""","In the vast expanse of the cinematic universe, there occasionally emerges a film that dares to reach for the stars. ""The Martian,"" directed by Ridley Scott, is such a film-a celestial ode to human ingenuity and resilience. It is a tale that unfolds on the desolate plains of Mars, where astronaut Mark Watney, played with a charming blend of wit and vulnerability by Matt Damon, finds himself marooned.The film is a testament to the indomitable spirit of mankind, as Watney, presumed dead, must marshal all his scientific knowledge and resourcefulness to survive. The screenplay, adapted from Andy Weir's novel, is a tightrope walk of tension and humor. It crafts a narrative that is as much a survival story as it is a love letter to the problem-solvers and dreamers who look to the stars and see not a void, but a challenge.Scott's direction is a masterclass in pacing, deftly weaving moments of solitude with scenes bustling with the collaborative fervor of NASA's finest, back on Earth, working tirelessly to bring Watney home. The Martian landscape, rendered with breathtaking realism, serves as both a canvas and a character - beautiful, alien, and unforgiving. Damon's performance anchors the film, his portrayal of Watney's isolation is palpable, his humor, a beacon in the Martian storm.Yet, for all its celestial aspirations, ""The Martian"" is not without its earthly tethers. The film occasionally succumbs to the gravity of genre conventions. Certain plot points feel engineered for dramatic convenience rather than organic development, and the supporting cast, while competent, orbits Damon's star turn without quite shining themselves. The scientific jargon, though often thrilling, can at times alienate those not versed in the language of the cosmos.Despite these terrestrial flaws, ""The Martian"" soars. It is a film that reminds us of cinema's power to transport us beyond the confines of our world, to make us believe in the impossible. It is a story of triumph, not just of one man against the odds, but of collective human endeavor. In the end, ""The Martian"" is not just about going to Mars; it's about coming home. And it is in that return journey that the film finds its heart and reminds us that sometimes, the most extraordinary adventures are the ones that lead us back to each other.In the grand tapestry of space-faring cinema, ""The Martian"" is a vibrant thread, woven with care and colored with the hues of humanity. It is a film that, despite its occasional stumbles on the red dust of its setting, stands as a beacon of hope - a reminder that the final frontier may be vast, but it is not insurmountable. And in the echoing silence of space, the human spirit shouts loudest of all.""The Martian"" is a film that captures the imagination and ignites the explorer within. It is a cinematic journey that, while it may not be perfect, is undoubtedly worth taking. For in the story of Mark Watney, we find not just a tale of survival, but a reflection of our own boundless potential.

I love this movie a lot, and often times, I find myself thinking about it, especially when I hear David Bowie come on the radio or my playlists. I love the fact that Matt Damon acts phenomenally with only himself to react toward, which can be hard to do when you on't have anyone to react with. I also love that traditionally known funny people, like Michael Pena and Kristen Wiig get to show off their more dramatic chops. And while this is a dramatic film, there are several times where funny bits sneak in when needed (Lord of The Rings and Ironman references were particularly funny given some of the actors in the movie) that perfectly balance each other route.

Matt Damon Steals the Show,"Over the past few years, space has been a subject a few directors have really tried to take on, hoping for a major hit, which can be really hard. Space is tough to master because it has to be somewhat believable, it has to have great visuals and it needs great acting.Matt Damon does a great job in this movie along with his crew, but that's about it as far as the acting goes, most of the other characters just felt very one dimensional or boring that I didn't really care what they had to say and just wanted to see more of Matt Damon do his thing on Mars.The visuals are great in this movie, just like most space oriented movies these days, I still think Gravity takes the top prize in terms of visuals in space.As for the believable factor, I know not everything can be perfect, but cmon, you could read this movie like a book (if you hadn't read the original already). You know going into it to expect a major turn of events somewhere, but not knowing exactly what it could be. The Martian exploits every which way a problem arises and can be solved, after a while you have a feeling of what's going on and ruins the suspense factor which space movies depend on to hook viewers in.Overall, still a well directed movie, but I feel like out of the space movies it's not the best over the past few years. Gravity was a great movie, Interstellar was intense, even if you count Star Wars that had much better action in it. For me, Matt Damon made this movie good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ridley Scott proves once again he values story more than visuals.,"I am a sucker for sci-fi big spectacle and CGI fest films, even if many of them are predictable, unoriginal, and boring. However, The Martian brings both and intriguing space travel mission mixed with a commentary on modern society in terms of morality and survival. This is balanced out by a beautifully done script that manages to be both suspenseful and comedic, the performances by the whole cast, and obviously the amazing visual effects and cinematography.The only complaint I have is that it is too long, and at times it becomes repetitive and therefore somewhat boring. However, it is only for a short amount of time and it does not become prevalent in the whole film.A",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One For The Collection!,"I recently checked out the book this film is based on, after reading glowing reviews in a group I'm a part of. To say that I LOVED the book is a colossal understatement! From the very first profanity-laden lines, I was hooked. 😁 This was by far the funniest and most thrilling book I've read in years, maybe even in my entire life!That said, I knew that if the movie were even HALF as good as its book, I was going to enjoy the hell out of it - and boy, did I! The book is (naturally) better, but not for the reasons you might think. Onscreen, we only hear what Watney narrates aloud for his video log. On the written page, we hear every thought as certainly as he does himself. There's a wealth of sheer information we get as a reader that it simply wouldn't be possible to put across into live action. A movie with that much talking would bore us straight to death. 😂 Also, Watney is freaking HYSTERICAL 24/7 with his inner monologue, but they had to clean that up a bit for Hollywood in order to avoid issues with the MPAA. 😒 So in that way, the movie suffers. But it is far from a pale shadow of its paper counterpart! This movie is pure dynamite! I especially enjoyed the cameo of Donald Glover playing Rich Purnell. 😋 Frankly, aside from the oddity of a wishy-washy Kristen Wiig playing the barbarically no-nonsense and fiercely witty Annie Montrose, this was superbly cast! I deeply enjoyed the experience, and will absolutely be adding it to my personal film library.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It is not a interstellar movie,"Good film. It has an ordinary but enjoyable scenario. Dialogues are fun. But sometimes there are very compelling events. Especially towards the end. While the scenes on Mars are very beautiful in visual effects, scenes in space are not visually, but physically ridiculous. Matt Demon played very well. There are already very famous actors in the cast, even in the smallest roles. Ripley Scott exhibited above-average directing. But it's not like an Interstellar movie.

Interesting landscapes are the main attraction,"Cold, emotionless sci fi/ adventure, about years-long attempts to rescue an astronaut, stranded on Mars following a freak accident.We (or at least, I) never feel as though Damon's character is in any peril or danger, despite being stranded for several years on a foreign planet, with almost no resources. He never loses weight, or even needs a shave, except in one later scene. The plot does address that issue briefly, explaining Damon's character realises that one integral part part of his survival is keeping his sense of humour, to avoid depression, and hopelessness, but it's just too upbeat for its own good.Most problems are solved relatively quickly, and too easily overcome by Damon, without hardly any signs of fatigue.The cinematography (with Jordan substituting for the unforgiving Martian landscape) is well done, and that, in and of itself, makes this worth watching, but for me, this is a fairly hollow, empty shell.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Not what you would expct,"Based on the novel of the same name 'The Martain' failed to meet the expectations and plunged in the hype of promotions.The novel deploys a fun and hilarious (which the movie makers forgot to take into account) Mark Watney on the journey to Mars where he is stuck for years and uses his brilliance to remain composed and sane and survive in deep space. It seems as if the movie makers were so focused on filming each and every scene of the novel that they neglected the crucial elements of the fiction. It'S a fiction damn it!Direction was lousy.When it comes to casting I guess the director lost his mind. Actors seemed monotonous and in despair where the novel is based on hope that nothing is impossible.

Blah,"Personally didn't like the movie very much. In my opinion there was way to much Humor for a Sci-fi drama. I felt like the main character ( Matt Damon) didn't capture someone actually stranded in a life or death situation. Compared to Interstellar this movie was a flop. Had no emotional attachment to any of the main characters. This movie was extremely "" Hollywoodized "" with an unreasonable amount of impossible ""WTF"" moments.

Yes the movie is predictable as most movies are. What can you possibly write in a script with a plot of leaving a person behind in a planet. All the lead actors did their part convincingly to pull this insane ride (Mostly it was Matt Damon, a one man show i would say). The visuals were great.

I just Need A Helping Hand,"Hey I'd say this is probably one of the best if not the best science fiction movies I've ever seen. I'm no Astro physicist but everything seems pretty scientifically sound (except for on ship gravity). That realistic science aspect makes the movie a lot more interesting.But not only is this a good sci fi story it's a story that poses some pretty thought provoking questions. Could one person unite the world like this? Would an organization/country really spend billions of dollars just to save one man? How much is a life worth? These are all question I found myself asking. So I'd say it's a pretty though provoking film, not only in the science realm, but in the socio-political realm as well. Look at me overthinking the film, all in good fun though right friends?Very well done might I add some good comedy, fantastic visuals, excellent pacing, great actors. Except for Kristen Wigg... sad to say this ain't her type of film. I think she was kinda awkward at times. Also Donald Glover is kind of a goof. But I suppose that was the character.

A classic tale of man against nature - set on the planet Mars,"Much like Gravity did a couple of seasons ago, The Martian explores realistically how to survive in space when something goes wrong during a space travel. Instead of unknown and unpredictable scares and adversaries, our protagonist here must battle nothing but the laws of nature and time. Matt Damon is Mark Watney, a botanist on a manned mission to Mars who is left behind when the rest of his crew deems him perished in the midst of an unusually strong sand storm which threatens to tip over their ascent vehicle. He wakes up deserted on Mars with only their base of operations to cling onto for survival - and if possible, rescue.Space is familiar territory for director Ridley Scott (Alien, Prometheus), but he is now an ageing man who seems more interested in the human side of things than he has been before. This is without a doubt an advantage for a script such as this, and Scott elegantly eludes the risk of letting his film become too long-winded and flat by more or less making the laws of nature into a character of its own. We can really feel the tension when Matt Damon's character must put all of his scientific knowledge into giving himself one chance of succeeding, whether it's about farming potatoes using his own excrements as fertilizer, or modifying his rover into being able to cover exactly the distances he needs it to, risking to freeze to death in the process.Mark Watney's long stretches of coping, planning and hoping, which could have been a weakness for a film such as this if it were handled differently, instead becomes the film's greatest strength. It's a classic tale of man against nature, only set on the planet Mars. And the film toys reasonably realistically with scientific possibilities and scenarios, inviting both the average Joe and more science-minded people to delve into the story and/or discuss the factualities. The Martian is one big advertisement for science, physics and space travel. And I suspect the filmmakers, and novelist Andy Weir, will be quite satisfied with that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Excellent What If... Movie,"This is a movie that I saw originally on DVD. I'm not sure why that I did. If I had to guess, my sister recommended it or I just heard how good this was. I'm a fan of space travel movies as well so there is that. It wasn't until later that I learned that this was based in as close to fact as you can with the science behind it. Jaime and I watched this as she was on a kick with these movies and Matt Damon.We start this on Mars. There is a manned mission that is led by Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain). Working with her there is Mark Watney (Damon), Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Rick Martinez (Michael Peña), Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan) and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie). A storm builds and Melissa is alerted. She knew about it, but it gained power and is much stronger than they expected. It is so bad that they need to abort the mission. As they try to make it to their ship, Watney is hit. They cannot see and it appears that he was killed. The rest of the team leave the planet and start their journey back to Earth.The problem is that Watney survived. He has limited food and water. Since he is highly intelligent, he knows he needs a certain amount of resources to survive until the next mission arrives. He then goes about growing potatoes with what he has. His next goal is alerting NASA to his presence.This happens earlier than anticipated when Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis) notices changes around the command center on Mars. She brings this to the director of NASA, Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels). He comes off cold when he tells his team to not alert the rest of the mission. He believes that Watney will die before anything can be done.That isn't the case though. He is able to make contact with them and relays what he is doing. Little by little, information is released about his plight. Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig), Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean), Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Bruce Ng (Benedict Wong), do what they can to save him. It won't be easy and not everything goes right, but Watney won't give up without trying everything.That should give of enough of a recap to the movie. What I think makes this work the best is the real science put into it. From my understanding, Andy Weir wrote the novel and the science behind everything is as close to true as possible. That is amazing to me. I would also say that having Drew Goddard and Ridley Scott as a team to bring this to life works. The former does well with science fiction elements and Scott can create such amazing worlds that are in the future but feel like today.Having a great cast helps as well. Damon works so well by himself for a long stretch of this movie. Jaime commented while we were watching this that I'm similar to him. I'm sarcastic and a problem solver. Not to this stretch since he's a botanist and smart enough to be an astronaut as well. It is fitting his knowledge base when it comes to surviving. Along with him though, we have Chastain, Wiig, Daniels, Peña, Bean, Mara, Stan, Ejiofor, Wong, Davis and Donald Glover. This is a strong cast across the board.I'm going to circle back and then bring up the effects. I've already said that Scott does excellent things with making a futuristic world feel normal. We get effects in this movie, but they're done where they are believable. I mean this had the budget so the CGI looks good. The cinematography is also good. I love how they make Mars look so barren since it is. I believe this is a well-made movie. It is one that despite its length, it pulls me in and I don't notice it. I would recommend this movie for sure.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Great combination of Sci-fi and Entertainment,"The Martian starring Matt Damon. He plays Mark Watney. He's a botanist-astronaut on the crew of what appears to be a workaday mission to Mars, one of many on the NASA schedule. Beginning into the film, where we notice when a massive dust storm descends on their operations base and living quarters. In the chaos, a piece of satellite equipment breaks loose, hits Watney and flies off with him attached. Assuming he's dead, the rest of the crew takes off. Though of course he's not dead. But he knows he will be, and soon, unless he figures out how to survive using only the stuff the crew left behind. His mission now is to solve a series of problems.What make the film great is how director Ridley Scott makes use of Damon's character. We see him how he records his efforts on video, which he assumes will be found after his death by the next crew to land on Mars. It's a useful and mostly credible narrative device that allows us to follow Watney's thoughts without the deadly intrusions of voice-over. The film is roughly over two hours and twenty minute long, but it is an exciting ride and the pacing is great. Matt Damon certainly delivers one of his finest performances, which gave him an Oscar nomination. The Martian will most definitely be considered a classic and future classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

If not, go see a doctor!It's definitely not a very accurate or 'how it should have been' movie, compared to something like Interstellar. But it is a great watch nonetheless.

Entertaining but too dissimilar from the book,"I enjoyed it but Matt Damon's portrayal of Mark Watney was emotional without the counterbalance of his great positive attitude. I just enjoyed the scientific approach of the book a lot and was disappointed that so many things were taken out or changed. The book focused on Mark being able to break problems down into steps and solve each step one by one until he could do something that the average person would find impossible. He has to be clever and quick and determined. He does so not begrudgingly but almost resignedly. He just goes and goes and goes, like the problem itself is the reason to solve it, not just that he's trying to survive. He trusts his mind and abilities. In the movie it's just disaster disaster slap some duct tape on it and luckily that works.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Full of tension but I preferred Moon! 7/10,"Review: Now that I have finally got to watch this movie, after listening to all of the hype and seeing loads of footage, I can actually say that it was quite enjoyable but I personally think that Moon was better. I've tried to watch Gravity again but I get bored after the first few minutes, and I've got a funny feeling that, that might happen if I try and watch this movie again. That doesn't mean that it's a bad film, because I did feel the tension throughout the movie but for some unknown reason, I can't see myself sitting down for 2 and a half hours, watching a film were I know what happens at the end. There isn't any outstanding performances, like Sam Rockwell in Moon, and the storyline is very straight laced, until his potato stash becomes contaminated. The film does look great, and so it should with such a big budget, and the crew was a great variation of characters which brought different elements to the team but I still feel that it lacked a certain something, which would have made this film an all time classic. Matt Damon (Mark Watney), played his part well and he made his character feel real, especially when he used his scientific knowledge to stay alive but I still felt a bit empty when the movie finished. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch, for a tension/drama point of view but I personally was expecting more. Watchable!Round-Up: Is there anything that Matt Damon, 45, can't do! After his brief roles in Mystic Pizza and Field Of Dreams, during the 80's, he first came to light in Courage Under Fire in 1996 after starring in Glory Daze and School Ties alongside his close friend, Ben Affeck. He then played a lawyer with Danny Devito in the Rainmaker but his career really kicked off when he starred and wrote Good Will Hunting with Ben Affeck, and also won an Oscar for Best Writing. Since then, his career has gone from strength to strength and he has the ability to cover any and every genre with ease. The fact that he doesn't take himself to seriously and he treats people with respect, makes him a liked person in Hollywood, and with his return to the Bourne franchise and a movie about the Great Wall of China in the pipeline, proves that he's not one to be type-casted. Its amazing how a free book, from Andy Wear, which eventually went on Amazon for $0.99, became such a blockbusting success. Ridley Scott's amazing attention to detail, made him plant a real potato farm so the audience could see the different stages of growth. He also got detailed information from NASA which was also used in the film, so a lot of the scenes in the film, are not made up. Anyway, I think I would have appreciated the movie more, if I didn't see it so long after its release but with that aside, it's still a well made film which I found quite entertaining.Budget: $108million Worldwide Gross: $630millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/drama/sci-fi movies starring Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Aksel Hennie. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Really?,"I like sci-fi as a genre but I completely hate it when film makers assume a general level of dumbness in their audience and resultantly try to peddle whatever they think can sell. I am appalled both by the movie as well as the number of people here on IMDb who actually found the movie worthwhile. I am not even going into the scientific aspects of what Whatney did and whether or not the fiction was any close to truth. In general, I don't like to poke holes in sci-fi, simply because the second word is 'fiction'. What got me was just the childish and rather superficial treatment accorded to everything. Not once did you feel for Whatney or any of the other crew members. The dialogue is gcheesy, bordering on inane. Clichés abound - there is a half-hindu (a separate dialogue was introduced in the movie just to highlight this fact) good-natured scientist and helpful Chinese space agency to boot. Even the special effects are underwhelming. There are instances where you can quite clearly see and feel its a toy car on the red soil.

Stranded On Mars,"When a dangerous windstorm threatens, the crew of the Ares 3 mission must quickly abort and leave the surface of Mars. They mistakenly leave behind Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who decides to find a way to survive in the harsh environment with inadequate supplies. Watney is a botanist who uses his problem solving and resource management talents to their best advantage.Meanwhile, people back on Earth are celebrating Watney's sacrifice with a large memorial and plenty of hoopla.Matt Damon gets most of the screen time of ""The Martian"". As in other castaway stories, his experience is the focus of the film. Viewers can identify with his everyman qualities and project themselves into his situation, making the film a one-man adventure. As someone who prefers first-person video games, I found this to be very relatable and enjoyable.Though there are a few (notable) errors of science, this is good science fiction. It also includes enough humor to keep the mood somewhat light.One running gag is that Watney dislikes disco music, but it's the only music available to him on Mars (after he rifles through the belongings of his fellow crew members). As a viewer, I began to share his opinion by the end of the film, but only because the recordings were all of the pop-disco style (e.g. Gloria Gaynor, Miami Sound Machine), which rely more on their lyrics than the pounding, driving beat that is the hallmark of truly inspiring swing dance disco. It's a distinction few viewers will key on.Instead, focus on the enchanting story and you will survive.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Enjoyed the scenery, but didn't meet any new friends","We enjoyed this trip to Mars and hanging out with some folks in the space station, but we really didn't get to know anyone well enough to say it was a great time, or to want to go back and watch it again. This is the primary problem with the Maritan- it is 95% plot with just a nod to character development. We all know that most story lines are recycled, and the Maritan is your classic stranded on a desert island scenario. What makes each story different is who is in this situation and how they respond. Unfortunately the Martian just doesn't reveal the background, thoughts, motivations or emotions of the characters. The sparse dialogue is utterly expected- the least you could say to move the plot along. And for a movie that depends so much on plot, the final solution to the big problem has been done before, even recently. I won't say where- no spoilers from me, but really, was not surprised by it.There were touches that I enjoyed. The theme of the rule breaking maverick saving the day, or causing the trouble was avoided. Scientists of all sorts were portrayed in their most interesting and exciting light. And I liked that the movie reminded us that space is still worth exploring, lets get our act together and keep being the pioneers that humans are born to be.I probably would have give this a 7 instead of 6, except as an Oscar nominee, I am holding it to a slightly higher standard. By all means, watch the movie, enjoy the movie, but there are a lot of elements missing for a truly great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This is a disastrous movie,"John Carter... Oops, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is part of the team of astronauts on Mars. Due to unplanned high winds, the mission is scrubbed.

I could not wait for the movie to hit the rentals so I went ahead and read the book first.They did an excellent job of following the structure and feel of the book. Each scene was played out well enough that you didn't have to guess what they were doing.Including most of the potty mouth; this is not necessary and distracted from the movie with maybe one or two exceptions such as where he broadcasts a negative word throughout the world.The acting was excellent the seams were spectacular Mars never looked more real. The technology was very close to real; you will not find yourself saying that's impossible.Naturally being a movie though they dispensed with a few of the disasters; however, because this is a disaster after disaster movie you won't notice the missing ones unless you've read the book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"What lacks in character development, compensates in visuals","An interesting movie, but not very original to be honest. While I cannot discuss the science behind it, although I assume it must be somewhat correct since NASA helped, they failed miserably in the psychological side of the story.At no point our hero shows us the despair of being stranded alone in a planet deadly for any form of life. In fact, it seems like he's having some kind of vacation in there. Only at the end it kinda shows some emotion, the rest of the time it's like ""lol disco music"". MOON captured this a million times better.While I do appreciate the fact that everything seems to go wrong, most of the problems are solved inmediately by some conveniently placed object: duct tape, a piece of plastic, whatever. Mark is not just a botanist, but also an engineer, electrician, chemist, surgeon, and anything else the plot requires. The guy has more knowledge than Wikipedia, it's amazing.Still, an entertaining movie, although it's longer than necessary. The Mars landscape is gorgeus!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
boring unlikely politically correct,"OK, this is really a very very bad movie. And on several levels. Matt Damon plays awfully bad. Well this is no news, he is an awful actor, but stillHe is in this movie so emotionally numb. The scenario is really not suspenseful. Most of the scientific facts are just thrown at your head like if you were totally stupid and know nothing. All the scenario is totally unlikely. And I don't speak about the political correctness (black, Chinese everybody is there) that is really an insult to intelligence. Finally I can say that the film had beautiful images. This is the only thing I can say positive. That's all. Conclusion : this movie is a waste of time. I have already forgotten it.

Solid Landing by The Martian,"I had my doubts that a more or less single-actor film would be successful, but The Martian proved me wrong. Matt Damon was terrific in a Hollywood-esque storyline. He plays a botanist who is on the Ares mission to Mars. I guess this was the third mission. Mars is apparently prone to major storms, and one strikes the team, forcing an emergency evacuation. In the midst of the evacuation, Damon gets lost and seemingly is dead. The crew takes off.The rest is a story of survival against the basic human needs, like food, water, and air. But also a battle to touch the planet he left behind. There was actually a lot of comedy in this film. Damon jokes at being the first for so many different activities there. Well shoot, he's the only living being on the planet.The scenery / graphics were excellent. The co-actors deliver their roles - space jockey pilot, stoic commander, a-hole mission commander back on Earth. They all fit into a nicely scripted screenplay.There are some twists and turns as you would expect, and a Hollywood ending that leaves you cheering, despite the improbability.

Not Equal to the Hollywood Hype,"If it's a cold rainy night and you have nothing to do, curl up with a bag of popcorn, and you'll find this film is an OK diversion, but if you're expecting the next Apollo 13, or Stanley Kubrick classic, you will be disappointed.The basic plot is the typical adventure, action, suspense formula with rather predictable turns and barely enough of predicable problems which the scientists will have to solve just in the nick of time.The real problems with The Martian are centered around the script and character development. The script could have been written by seventh graders who were given bonus points for trying to write as many cliché lines as possible. What's worse, is the fact that none of the characters including that of Matt Damon's have any real development as people with whom you can empathize. Good dram is always more than the actions of the plot. Good drama is about people and their relationships, conflicts, struggles, etc. We know nothing about these people and therefore can never develop the empathy necessary for good engaging drama.Lots of great visuals, some bad disco music, and an OK story line.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Damon Delivers a Powerful Performance,"This film packs quite a different punch than what I initially expected. I came into this film expecting something that was Interstellar-esque. While there were similar aspects, y'know, space and everything, (along with Matt Damon) it is a wildly different film. Just when you think things couldn't get any worse, they somehow do. But Scott certainly knows how to deliver on every type of scenes, and with his cinematics and the writing, it culminates to make quite an enjoyable watch. People may call it predictable, but everything is. A separate reviewer on here states, ""Who ever watched Star Wars with the thought that Vader would ultimately win? Who ever watched Star Trek thinking that Kirk wouldn't find a way to save the day? And frankly, who grew up watching Scooby Doo thinking that someone would actually kill Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne, or Velma???"" and I think that sums it up perfectly. Of course it's predictable! But in the moment you're so sucked up in the film that you don't think about that. Overall a phenomenal film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
interesting,"This is a rare and easy science fiction film. The film deliberately weakens the most common fears of the science fiction film about the future and the unknown universe, but talks about people conquering the sky and science to save humanity. The film has the stupidity and optimism unique to the technical house (of course, this is also inseparable from Matt Damon's excellent performance). Even if the film is a bit too routine in emotional settings, it can still impress the audience at a critical moment",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Worth watching,"Somehow this movie felt special among all of the other science fiction movies I have watched. To start, it is not full of scientific references that could end up making you feel bored or confused. Second, the main character is a regular man who strives to survive, he is not the typical genius scientist or the fortunate guy who succeed in everything he does. And third and most important, I loved the fact that it is not a love story, instead the movie is a portrait of a mans will to see another day on earth. I really liked that he is fighting because of him, and the fact that there are so few romantic references is kind of refreshing nowadays. If something, there are some silly jokes that are just very silly for the tone of the movie. But overall it is very good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Another fine Space movie comparable to Interstellar and Gravity,"Matt Damon gets the main role as an accidental lone survivor on the planet Mars. For several months (almost a year I believe), he makes a traditional living with himself until he's finally contacted, then much later until NASA can actually get there. Decent music score. It had an interesting track selection. I didn't really feel as much of the ""outer space edge"" like I did during Gravity and Interstellar. This one I felt had more casual movie directing for its genre, but it had a good follow-along story and included some very neat visuals of the red planet itself and where it was filmed. It had some decent humor as well to keep much of the hype going. Judging by my overall rating, I may be a little bit spoiled by the craftsmanship of Interstellar for one thing, but this one still does deserve some good credit for a well-made movie with an interstellar theme.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Food crops,"Warning...food supplies/survival assessment. It's essential to his survival, but when assessing his potato crop, there is no way he could have reaped 400 potato on the first harvest. Also, when they showed shots of his potato crop, there are way too many plants based on what he started with. The bag looked like it had 12...2 potatoes each for a crew of 6, or 12, and 48 plants. If successfully grown, 4 large potatoes from each plant, and smaller ones to replant would give him 194 from first harvest...OR,Take the Thanksgiving meal...at best, 3 potatoes each times six people would give 18 potatoes. He was quartering them...that would give him about 72 max. The next crop would be bigger, as he used several small potatoes from each plant, so ideally, 72 x 4, or 288 plants. It took roughly 35 'Sol's' to grow and then harvest, so it would still take awhile for him to produce 400 potatoes to eat. He'd need to have 3 or more successful harvests to get enough to last the 3 years needed before the Ares IV mission. Important for the movie, but a bit impossible in real life. Also, potatoes need at least 2 feet of dirt to grow, and he only had a foot or so...it would matter if that last crop was still edible after the surface plants died...since they were underground, they might have survived, which would have given him about 6-8 from each plant, small and large. He should have tried to grown more...somehow, even if it was a smaller operation...and holding a breathable atmosphere in the HAB behind tarps is another question.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The Martian,Its an amazing movie and I would be going to mars on 2033.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""Apollo 13"" Meets ""Interstellar""But Not Quite As Good As Either","""The Martian"" is a solid movie. It has an interesting plot, some good character development, and (in a complete departure from most Ridley Scott films) contains a very hopeful, at times even light-hearted tone. Most people viewing this will find it a very enjoyable experience all-around.Here is the problem, though: About a year ago, ""Interstellar"" was made by Christopher Nolan. It shares many similar character types and themes with ""The Martian""but manages to beat it in nearly every single area. So, I have to say that it was a little weird seeing this movie and thinking that not only it wasn't as good as ""Interstellar"", but now it is chronologically second-fiddle too.For a basic plot summary, ""The Martian"" primarily tells the story of a member of the Aries III crew exploring Mars sometime in Earth's future. A violent windstorm picks up and astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is flung off into the eye of the storm and presumed dead, his fellow crewmates having to make a tough decision and a quick getaway. Due to some incredible luck, however, Watney is most certainly not deadjust stranded on Mars with few supplies and not enough food to last until any sort of retrieval mission can be furnished. The catch? Watney is a scientist (a botanist, to be exact), and must tap into all of his ingenuity and wits in order to survive until NASA can pick him up again.Like I said, ""The Martian"" is a pretty good movie when looked at with tunnel-vision. It has all the right ingredients for a great sci-fi drama, and those ingredients do indeed gel together to form an entertaining final product. It has some high-concept themes, impressive visuals, and that sense of gravitas befitting films like ""Apollo 13"". Damon turns in a great performance, and his scenes are the highlight of the entire experience (had the movie focused on him even more exclusively, I probably would have liked it even better!).There are indeed two major problems that keep this film from being a classic sci-fi adventure, though:1. The casting besides Damon is very poor. Jeff Daniels is terrible as the head of NASA, as is Kristen Wiig in a similar corporate role, and Jessica Chastain's character is inexplicably under- utilized. As such, the scenes where Damon isn't front-and-center really drag the fun to a halt.2. Maybe this isn't 100% fair, but it still stands that this movie can't really hold a candle to Nolan's masterful ""Interstellar"", and that turned into kind of a problem during the viewing experience. I mean, think of it this way: A film featuring Chastain, Damon, space travel, space anomalies, and all set in a very hopeful tone. Where have you seen that movie before? I know that ""The Martian"" is based on a book and thus it is difficult to scream ""plagiarism"" too loud, but having not read the book I really don't know how closely it was followed. To me, then, this sure seemed like an opportunity to capitalize on the success by using the same general themes of the previous ""Interstellar"".Bottom line: Had I seen this movie a year or so ago, I may have liked it considerably more. However, once one has seen movies like ""Interstellar"" before it, it kind of feels old-hat. Not a bad movie by any means (and hence the four-star rating), but also not all that close to being one that will be remembered for years, either.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

This is science fiction for sophisticated audiences,"I love scifi and I love sci-fi movies, and I love scifi movies made by Sir Ridley Scott so suffice to say I liked the Martian a lot. This is a Matt Damon show and the actor is pretty much in the frame all through the running time as an astronaut stranded on the red planet. This is neither an action-oriented motion picture nor a special effects extravaganza. It's an introspective story about what it might be like to be the sole inhabitant of a distant world and knowing that instant communication isn't possible, and a rescue is at best a year away. It's also an examination of how necessity truly can be the mother of invention - not only for the survivor but for those on Earth seeking to find a way to save him. Those who crave nonstop action and seizure-promoting editing may find this film's pace too deliberate.

A million miles away, stuck on a foreign planet alone, but he still somehow manages to muster up the strength and will to think his way out of an almost definite damned situation.

Jeff Daniels was also is his very likeable Newsroom authoritative, slightly cocky character.Where I feel this is a let-down is the script: the book has a lot of funny passages and jokes that are sprinkled between technical details and the protagonist's inner battle to keep sane while dealing with disappointment. Like any other script, most of the action was summarized, while most of the humor made it. This makes the story feel more silly than it really is.

Thought-provoking survival film,"""The Martian"" (2015) directed by Ridley Scott, is a film about an astronaut surviving alone on Mars. It has a hopeful tone. Although it uses a lot of CGI that might not always be needed, the movie is still impressive in terms of story. The movie's music is also impressive.The soundtrack combines classical orchestral tones with modern upbeat synthesizer rhythms, matching the film's emotions and energy perfectly. 'The Martian' skillfully combines humor with a tense plot, making the protagonist's determination to survive even stronger. This mix makes the story better and helps the audience like the main character even more.I found the performances of the actors to be highly entertaining. Notably, the film Interstellar (2014) featured respected actors such as Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain in key roles. Matt Damon effectively portrayed film's main character with his witty humor and survival skills, and Jessica Chastain also delivered an outstanding performance in her role.In conclusion, ""The Martian"" is a film that is worth watching because it conveys a positive and determined message about the strength of human beings, as well as an emphasis on hope and survival skills. Despite the fact that it is not perfect, it tells a story that recognizes our ability to keep going regardless of the challenges humans face.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Tense, humorous and visually rich","Thought to be dead an astronaut botanist has to live in the dangerous conditions of Mars, relying on his ingenuity to survive until the next mission arrives.Matt Damon doesn't understand why he was reduced to only saying his name in Team America, maybe it's because the makers were being ironic, never more so in The Martian is this highlighted. Under director Ridley Scott's auteur eye Damon shines here as Watney in Drew Goddard's adaptation of Andy Weir's novel. It's tense, humorous and visually rich including planets, Martian landscapes, space crafts and NASA control rooms. It's also smart and thrillingly realistic as they plan rescue attempts and Damon hones Robinson Crusoe on Mars, Grativy, Apollo 13 and the like. The sets, props, costumes and special effects CGI for the most part are excellent the locations both on Earth and the red planet really sell it.The acting is aided by Goddard's credible script. Both Jeff Daniels and Kristen Wiig are notable here in serious roles. Memorable are Sean Bean as Mitch - a mission director, Benedict Wong plays Bruce Ng an engineer of the rockets for the rescue mission and Chiwetel Ejiofor is Vincent, a director and the first person to establish contact with Watney. There plenty of disco tracks as that's all Watney has to listen to, but Harry Gregson-Williams' Martian score is solid. Watney's uses all his skills an intellect, stapling a wound, he rations food and grows his own in seemingly impossible conditions and uses different NASA equipment to aid him. Damon's Watney at times is very witty and you warm to dryness and invest in his survival, rooting for him in his highs and lows. Back on Earth Scott offers digestible politics and PR but there's a positive aspect with countries, individuals and departments working together with each other.Goddard and Weir's offering doesn't contain any sci-fi metaphysical and/or horror tropes with The Martians realism and by default Scott remains focused on a humane elements and visual effects never delving into what made him a household name. It's about human beings tackling problems and the exploration of Mars' barren environment and like similar space disaster movies there's plenty of emotion, even with its long running time it moves along at pace.Overall, if red planet sandstorms, potato growing and space travel is your thing, it's a must.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

What It Would Be Like to Be Stranded on Mars with a Frat Boy,"I seem to be perhaps the only person in the world who didn't fall in love with Andy Weir's novel ""The Martian."" In fact, I didn't make it through. Partially I was undone by the heaps of technical detail about how to make dirt, breathable air, etc. on Mars. I appreciated the research that went into it, but it felt more like reading a technical paper than a compelling story. But I was equally turned off by the book's tone, which is really the same thing as the narrator's tone since the part of the book I read is comprised completely of his journal entries. It had that painful quality writing has when the author thinks he's funnier than he is, and the whole cocky ""bro"" attitude might have been realistic in a character like this (after all, he does have to have the fortitude and the balls to want to eek out an existence on Mars) but doesn't make him any more pleasant to spend time with.For the film, director Ridley Scott, writer Drew Goddard, and actor Matt Damon unfortunately for me but fortunately for the millions of others who enjoyed this story as it was told retain that tone. There's a jokey frat boy quality to virtually every scene that's like nails on a chalkboard, and the detailed realism of the books early chapters gives way to increasingly improbable set pieces that end with one character or another working in a witty quip while the director practically winks at his audience. I can imagine fans of this movie giving each other chest bumps as the credits roll.The film looks marvelous, though, I'll give it that. The effects (at least those on Mars itself) are so seamless that you almost forget they're effects.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"One of the best films ever, you will have to be careful not to become an addict.","I had huge expectations for The Martian, i just love this kind of movies, and of course the combination of Ridley Scott and an ensemble cast like this is just pure perfection. And it was too bad that the film wasn't in Imax theatres. But, did the film meet my expectations? Well, it sure did!The film has this feeling, a feeling so unique that it's like nothing i have ever seen, and it's definitely one of the most addictive films i ever saw. From the very first frame, it grabs you with such a force it never lets you go, even when you leave the theatre. It just stays with you. And its impossible to take your eyes off the screen.The story is just perfect, the setting is unique, the cast is beyond perfect, and i don't know if this can be a spoiler but if it is, **WARNING** SPOILER AHEAD: Sean Bean doesn't die on this one!I Know, its insane! Obviously Matt Damon shines brighter than the sun in here, but the other actors also shine a lot. And Ridley Scott is in top notch, while i would change some camera shots (as usual in his films) i understand his perspective.Basically this is a film about one man trying to survive in Mars and get back home after it was left there because everyone thought he was dead. And even if we get a lot about the people that are trying to get him back home and a little about his crew that left him there, this is basically a biography about Matt Damon's character, and i really would like to have seen much more of the crew, but i understand what The director and writer did.This film is unique in every way possible, but i guess ultimately what makes him so unique is the main character, because instead of the usual depressing character in this situations (understandably of course!) here, we get an above normal optimistic character that simply put doesn't want to die and deals with problems with an optimistic way that delivers tons of gold comedy. This makes for a much more different narrative, but of course makes the character feel a little off, because it doesn't have those depressed moments, or looks like his suffering with the loneliness or the problems. While i would enjoy some of these moments, or to know a little more about this character, i also understand the goals here.And is here that i think the film should have some more complex emotional moments, that explored more and deeper, some themes and characters. And to me this is why after only one view, that the film isn't perfect, even though i probably will give it a 10 because i think i loved the film so much it makes me forget that.The film has a rushed feeling, that it would be overcomed if the length were bigger, and the ending, particularly, isn't among my favourites because of this. But its nothing that compromises the quality of the film.The production values are just beyond perfect of course, or this wouldn't be a Ridley Scott film. From the hauntingly beautiful visuals, to the insanely realistic production design to the thrilling score, it's just pure perfection!This is one of the most original and unique films ever and it is instantly a favorite, it has such a strong force that you are pulled to its orbit right from the beginning. And it will make you think a lot after you leave the theatre. Thrilling moments abound, comic moments to spare, and plenty of drama makes this one of the best films ever, And is insanely realistic you just forget you are watching a film, and think that this is a documentary about a real life event.

Visually stunning with excellent acting,"Ridley Scott's The Martian is a straight forward, yet visual alluring movie about a man stranded on Mars and the team effort from Earth to bring him home. From the beginning, it gets straight to the plot and beautifully illustrates Mark Whatney's long, arduous and painstaking tale of survival and the NASA/JPL's (with some help) persistent and tireless team effort to bring him home.Ridley Scott directs the film with beautiful storytelling and stunning visuals. The plot does not meander and the scenery and visual effects are exemplary. Mars looks and feels real and the satellite imagery is used appropriately. The humor is intoxicating and keeps the audience entertained. Most importantly the human determination and strong spirit is the key to the film's success. We all aspire to be the best we want to be and when we run into trouble, we should always try to remain hopeful of the situation and never ever give up.An excellent cast consisting of comedic actors like Kristen Wiig, reliable character actors like Jeff Daniels and Michael Peña (the former who doesn't let his character become a caricature and brings a bit of Gregg Popovich in him and the latter who is great as always), Marvel characters like Kate Mara and Sebastian Stan, new names that some of the audience may have never heard before like Aksel Hennie, Benedict Wong, McKenzie Davis and Donald Glover and those in the background elevate the film from being an ordinary film. Jessica Chastain is wonderful as the commanding officer, portraying her character's reactions with great naturalism. Sean Bean is a delight as the Flight Director who eschews PR distractions by using his practicality and common sense to bring the crew home.But the film belongs to Matt Damon and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Damon is brilliant as the main character Whatney who tries to do the best he can to survive on Mars. Each aspect of his acting does not feel forced and his deadpan is hilarious. Most importantly his will to live drives the film and we feel as if we are with him and we want him to return home. He can add this performance to his personal top 5. In my opinion, Ejiofor is at the peak of his acting prowess and he is fantastic as Vincent Kapoor who is deeply involved about the fate of the crew and will do anything it takes to bring them home. He is to be lauded for making Kapoor a strong willed humanist who is compassionate to everyone and views them as equals and simultaneously as a no nonsense engineer who wants things done at the best of their capabilities in order to save life. To him like Ed Harris's portrayal of Gene Kranz in Apollo 13, failure is and will not be an option.Background music is good, but the 70s soundtrack is even better much to the annoyance of Whatney.Overall, this movie with its simple storyline, arresting visuals, and excellent ensemble led Damon and Ejiofor with honorable mentions to Chastain and Bean is something to experience. Most importantly, the human determination and spirit is the most memorable aspect of the movie and will linger with you as you leave the theater.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"The MartianThe best thing about commercial space travel is the black box is easy to find in the floating wreckage.Fortunately, all the astronauts in this sci-fi movie made it back safely – save for one.Believed killed in a Martian dust storm by his crewmates (Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Michael Peña, Sebastian Stan) and left behind, botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) must learn to survive on the inhabitable planet.Once communications with Earth has been reestablished, NASA (Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor) begins work on retrieving Mark before his food supply runs out.Rich in hard science and unique in its narrative, director Ridley Scott does an exceptional job of harmonizing the two. While Damon's lighthearted one-man performance deserves accolades as well.However, these positives don't make-up for the film's improbable premise.Besides, NASA would only return for a marooned astronaut if they were impregnated with an alien.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

And all the other cast also shine too. And seeing them struggle trying to bring him home. Jeff Daniels and Jessica Chastain among the others who really great here.

One of the best in 2015,"Ever since I watched the trailer I knew it was going to be a good, fun movie to watch. Did not know it was going to be one of the best movies 2015 would have to offer. High Oscar chances.Great directing, equally good and interesting screenplay are followed by first class acting. Writers managed to put just enough of that comedy element in a non-comedy movie to make it perfect. Does not get boring for a second, always keeps it interesting.If you like ""Interstellar"" by Christopher Nolan make sure to go see this movie.

Great movie,"I am not a fan of either Sci-Fi movies or Matt Damon, but I have to say, this movie was great! It was so well made and had a very interesting storyline. The film touched upon many typical themes like survival, man's fight against hopelessness and the classical ""how far are we willing to go to save just one person"". Next to that the film had a lot of humor as well, which was very wise , since the plot at times was kinda slow.... This made sure you were never bored.Matt Damon was perfect for the role.I also wanna add that it was great for me as a Norwegian to see one of my countrymen star in a Hollywood movie.

"Home Alone, but on Mars","I watched The Martian last night and just had to take 10 minutes to tell you how awful it was. It was like a remake of Home Alone, but on Mars. It felt like the script was written in about 3 hours, it had no structure and probably not even three acts – No intensity, no urgency. So predictable. Not one great performance, just two good ones from Benedict Wong & Chiwetel Ejiofor. Kristen Wiig was a joke. I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters. There were more attempts at comedy than drama. If anyone ever mentions this film in the same breath as 2001, Contact, Apollo 13, Interstellar, or Gravity – I will slap them in the face. And if Matt Damon wins Best Actor, I'll never watch another movie ever again. How this movie got nominated for Best Picture is beyond my level of comprehension. Even the special effects we're average! It's like they used the same footage from Red Planet with Val Kilmer for cryin' out loud! If you care about film and consider yourself a critic, watch it just to say you saw it, but that's all it's worth.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Sir Ridley at his best,"Ridley Scott knows science fiction. The director of iconic and cult crowned sci-fi flicks Blade Runner and Alien, Scott is no slouch when it comes to futuristic or outerspaceish type scenarios played out through his keen direction.Scott last dipped his toe into the sci-fi waters in 2012 with the love it or hate it Alien prequel, Prometheus. The film was met with varying degrees of acceptance and disapproval but no one could deny the film was visually spectacular. In 2015, Scott brings Andy Weir's novel of the same name to audiences in the inspiring, The Martian due to hit theatres early October.Matt Damon plays NASA botanist Mark Watney. Watney along with a small group of other scientists are stationed on Mars when a storm prompts their evacuation. Through a series of events, his colleagues believe Watney dead as they execute their evacuation. But Watney is very much alive. Alive and alone on Mars. With little resources and materials, Watney sciences the poop out of his working assets in an effort to survive. He manages to relay a message back to earth but he is very much aware of the realization that any rescue effort or further mission to Mars is years away from actualization. Watney must live on his wits and faith in hopes that he may one day be reunited with species.The focus is clearly on Damon's character but maybe more interesting are the team of humans back on earth lead by Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels that attempt to science the poop out of things themselves in an attempt to orchestrate a spectacular rescue. Their pooling of minds will draw reference to NASA's brain trusts in Ron Howard's Apollo 13 and is riveting the exciting to watch unfold though the emotion of the colleagues.We'll leave the final chapters of the film to your viewing pleasure but make no mistake about it, The Martain is Ridley Scott's best film in years. Damon excels in the lonely character left abandoned. He carries the film with remarkable poise and the intelligence of the script by Drew Goddard (Cabin in the Woods, World War Z) is a marvel as to what man has and can accomplish when faced an unfathomable situation.The 3D imagery is spectacular and the special effects are sometimes toned and other times on the scale of a blockbuster big-budget extravaganza. But the film is rooted in the triumph of the human spirit. It's hard not to cheer or cry when we see a balls-out effort to what it takes, to use what it takes, to work tirelessly in what it takes to save one human life.The Martian is destined to be box office hit. Smart, funny, tense and drawing on emotion, it is easily one of the best films of the year and it is the type of film that might just have children once again naming 'astronaut' as the profession that they most aspire to. Yes, it's that good.http://theintestinalfortitude.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Good acting and story, Tried too hard on Visuals","Honestly I did enjoy the acting and could tell the cast were serious about their roles. The story was solid and convincing. What ruined it for me was the visual effects. Please note I saw this in 3D, so it may be better visually in 2D. The CGI popped out way too much. It is almost as if the effects were a layer hovering over the picture. This issue was notable in the rocket exhaust, storm, and breath vapor. Another problem was the ""soap opera effect"". The movie, at times, looked like a soap on daytime television. I actually laughed once during a scene where astronauts are supposed to be weightless in a space station; it looked way too fake. Also there were times that it felt as if scenes dragged on a little longer than they should have.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Technically Great and a Wonderful Performance by Damon,"The Martian (2015)*** 1/2 (out of 4)On a mission to Mars a crew of astronauts get caught in a brutal storm when one member, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit with an object and apparently killed. The commander in charge (Jessica Chastain) decide to leave the planet and NASA must announce that Watney has been killed but soon they all discover that he survived. Now Watney must find a way to try and survive on the planet with a lack of food and water.Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN is an extremely entertaining movie and it's easy to see why it became such a box office hit. The idea of a man being trapped on a different planet and having to decide whether he wants to live or die is such a simple idea and there's no question that Scott knows how to handle drama and tension in space. The film has a very good story to draw you in but I'm not going to lie and say I didn't have any problems with the movie but more on that in a bit.A lot of credit certainly goes to Scott who handles the material extremely well and most importantly is the fact that he makes you believe that this man is actually trapped on Mars. If the viewer thought they were just looking at a set or just some fake CGI then it would pretty much kill the story. By Scott creating a real environment you have no problem believing that you're seeing a man trapped on a planet with his closest help millions of miles away. On a technical level the film contains some wonderful cinematography, a great and rousing score and of course brilliant sound effects and set designs.Damon's excellent performance is another very important factor because we need an actor who we're not only going to believe in the part of a brilliant astronaut but we also must be entertained by him and care for him. Damon certainly makes you believe that he's this brilliant mind and there's no question that his one-man-show is something the actor nails. We get a strong group of supporting players including a very good Chastain plus strong work from Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Donald Glover and Chiwetel Ejiofor.As I said, I did have some major problems with the film including the fact that it just seems like everything happened way too easily. I understand this is a mainstream movie that couldn't get into great detail because it might confuse or bore the viewer but I just thought the film would have worked even better had it been more realistic. Of course, I'm no space expert so perhaps what happens here is 100% believable. I'd also say that the film is also a tad bit too predictable. Either way, THE MARTIAN is certainly a very good movie.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Martian,"First Saving Private Ryan, then Interstellar, and now The Martian. Matt Damon's the one to find. The go to guy. The one worthy of being found thrice over. Damon is Watney, a man stranded on Mars after his crew believe him dead. This film is about his survival. Suspension of disbelief is steady and highly believable, to the point of utter astonishment. It's incredible how Watney's time spent on Mars feels so real. No one has landed on Mars before, and no one probably will in our lifetime. Ridley Scott and the team behind The Martian have kept the physics clean. Watney painfully produces food and water for the long haul. Damon is mesmerising. Open spaces and long/wide angle shots create a feeling of solitude. He's supported by the likes of Sean Bean and Chiwetel Ejiofor, but when the screen's off Damon, it needs to be. We need to know how and what he's doing. Visually stunning effects add a balance of beauty and ambiance. The contrast is definitely felt between Watney on Mars, his crew on their ship back home and the NASA workers on Earth. The Martian is a gripping blockbuster, even if it's a wee bit predictable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Science Porn,"The Martian quickly begins with the crew aborting their mission and abandoning Mark Watney after being hit by a debris during a storm on Mars, presuming he was dead. And for this impression, this introduction seems sort of contrived, but this film happens to be one of those that gets better and better. As we see this lone astronaut stand up and try to grow plants on this lifeless planet. Everything comes to life when it's just scrutinizing the protagonist's survival on Mars and NASA's rescue mission for him with a delightful dose of science and humor. People might be bragging for more atmosphere of oblivion around this environment, but apparently, it's actually not needed. The upbeat tone of the film is a terrific choice. Not everything has to be a tragedy, The Martian aims to make science look fun and it triumphs from top to bottom.Survival films like this tend to be about self-discovery, life regrets or other personal ordeals, but how this astronaut deals with his own situation is applying his skills; which is botany. So he strategically find ways to grow plants out of potatoes which were stored in their base for food, by collecting soil and fertilizer, even producing water out of chemistry. It's gripping stuff. But the science doesn't stop there; the plot shifts to NASA finding out Watney is still alive and trying to gain contact to rescue him. This rescue plan also consists plenty of scientific strategies; you still won't find any villain in this point, either. Because they're facing the same conflict as the stranded astronaut, which is the probability of failing, even if they carefully planned their ideas. Because every experiment could go wrong, even in something as simple as planting potatoes in a foreign planet.While much of it is discussing their plans and studies, the movie never becomes boring, mostly because it establishes its own personality; especially with its main character. Maybe if the movie is only about Mark Watney surviving on Mars, it would still be a pretty good film, because this character is given a real down-to-earth charisma and Matt Damon justifies all of it. Even when he is just talking for his log explaining his experiments or just driving a rover, it's already a quite entertaining movie to sit through. But having the full story is just equally as important as the Mars alone, because even outside the planet, the other characters are also given enough humor and witty dialogue to make their scientific explanations entertaining to watch. The supporting cast is filled with excellent talents as well that definitely helped making their every moment quite engrossing as Damon's.Of course, the movie doesn't lack impressive visuals, and this merit now comes from Ridley Scott's direction. We've come across with some ambitious space movies in the last two years; either it showcases amazing CGI or amazing practical craftsmanship, but here, those technical methods don't matter. It could be just balance. The simple exterior of Mars already looks impressive in detail, even the scenes in space where how it breathtakingly shoots the interior of the spaceship, it creates an exciting scale of adventure with these angles. There's many to be dazzled here visually, even without acting like an ambitious technical magnum opus. The direction also sharply displays their practicalities which makes every detail easy to comprehend from the fast pace. And the chaotic results of their plan can either be depicted with realism or just a thrilling ride.The Martian's straightforwardness is what made it utterly interesting and supremely entertaining. There is no personal life dilemmas involved in the Mars scenes or any cynical commentary at the NASA side. They're all seeking for the same goal, facing the same problem; they just want the crew to come home. And this doesn't need anything more than their knowledge. Some people might be looking for any sense of humanity in this realm of scientific jargon, and luckily, this movie has plenty of it: isn't Watney's determination of surviving enough? Or his constant sense of humor? How about his loyalty to his crew or everyone's longing of having them return to Earth and reunite with their loved ones; even if the latter is only briefly explained, it's already crystal clear, even without putting up any inspiring monologues or pickup lines. How these characters do their work is already uplifting, anyway. And of course, the soundtrack! Everything else, it's just human beings dealing with nature and time outside their own atmosphere. Their deliberately scrutinized plans are fifty-fifty in this cruel world. It's everything you would ask for in a smart Sci-Fi movie. Its flavor just made it more exciting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Martian focuses on the triumph of human ingenuity under duress.,"Is The Martian science fiction or science fact? Well, it's set in the near future, in 2035, so it's not easy to call it science fiction, although it's technically science fiction. It's not entirely science fact either because some of the science on display in The Martian is questionable. What matters, however, is that the film is entertaining and memorable. There's no question that Ridley Scott is one of the best directors working in Hollywood. Prometheus (2012) marked his return to the science fiction genre, and now we have The Martian, which is even better. Prometheus is a visually impressive film that, unfortunately, has a confusing plot, poor characterization, and pacing issues. It was an attempt to repeat the formula of Alien (1979) and maybe even Aliens (1986), with mixed results. The Martian, on the other hand, isn't dark and confusing. It's straight-forward and upbeat. It centers around an astronaut (Matt Damon) who gets stranded on Mars and has to survive. His struggle to get in contact with NASA and to return home is what keeps the film running. I was surprised by how entertaining the film is. Firstly, the characters in The Martian make rational decisions. They're not a bunch of degenerates and fools who run around and get into trouble, like in Prometheus. And the performances from the cast are all solid. Leading man Matt Damon did good work playing Mark Watney, someone who's often funny and hardly ever depressed. Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, and Chiwetel Ejiofor are in supporting roles. Secondly, the science that's on display in the film is interesting. Some of what is shown makes viewers think, and wonder what's going to happen. Viewers can actually learn a few things from the film. This is due to the fact that the film is based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel, which was adapted into a screenplay by Drew Goddard. And, of course, The Martian is visually impressive, something that's to be expected from a Ridley Scott film. Some of the scenes set on Mars are stunning. The designs of the suits and vehicles are excellent too. So, The Martian is definitely worth recommending. It's a great example of crowd-pleasing cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Greatly Disappointing for Any Space Buff,"I expected the movie to be somewhat real with all the hype. The physics in this movie are laughable.

If you ever seen a space launch, there are a bunch of old people at the launch control who have PhDs.The script was boring and filled with plot holes.

Scott is back from nadir,"A 3D-screening of the Sci-Fi picture of the year, after GRAVITY (2013), INTERSTELLAR (2014), the momentum of the hard science fiction sub-genre is going pretty strong, and for director Ridley Scott, whose career is badly in need of a revival, THE MARTIAN proves to be a timely global hit to his succour, a return to his most competent genre, and brings him out of his career nadir after THE COUNSELOR (2013) and EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS (2014).As its movie posters plainly assert, the film is about to bring Matt Damon's botanist Mark Watney back to earth after being left alone on Mars by his crew, since they presume he is dead during an unexpected storm during their mission. Based on Andy Weir's scientifically specific source novel and with the official support of NASA, the film adopts a more down-to-earth method to tell the story as realistic as possible, at least meets the basic criterion of today's scientific level.There are two parallel story lines at first, one is on Mars, concerning, the only man (might not be the only living creature thanks to the recent discovery of water) on a foreign planet, completely alone and how he strives to survive, fortunately he can avail himself of his professional know- how to successfully cultivate potatoes on the Mars' soil (which might not be realistic, then again, no one has ever been to the Mars, so everything can be ascribed to the imagination license) and produce water. Meanwhile, he is seeking a way to contact NASA, to let the earthlings know he is stranded, in hope of a rescue mission. And beyond our imagination, he manages to do that too, through the defunct Pathfinder, the roving probe launched on Mars in 1996. On earth, the narrative is centred on Teddy (Daniels), the Director of NASA, Vincent Kapoor (Ejiofor), the director of Mars mission, once they realise Matt's quandary, how they creatively sustain the communication with Mark and collect their wits to a rescue plan.But odds are not in favour of Mark, after a failing launch of a space probe aiming to resupply him for sustain until the next mission, and an airlock disaster destroys all his plants, a third party enters the picture, as the only hope is hinged on Hermes, the spacecraft on its way back from Mars to Earth with Matt's fellow astronauts, lead by captain Lewis (Chastain, a female captain!!), Hermes must extend its mission by another year in space, and firstly it must receive a booster proffered by CNSA (China National Space Administration) on the earth orbit, to resupply the Hermes, so they can return to Mars and get Mark back, and But if you expect some discord among its crew members, you will be disappointed, they are as united as ever, to risk their own life for the risky expedition. This is the final attempt, which unfortunately evolves into a public stunt not just for NASA, for America, but for the whole human race, to affirm that every one and single life counts, as in reality, we know it is not the truth.The film doesn't flaunt its visual grandeur, on the contrary, everything seems subdued for its accuracy, or at least verisimilitude, only the final rescue paragraph, propels us for an adrenalin drive like a less compelling re-take of Sandra Bullock's space yank-and-tossing with George Clooney in GRAVITY, but to an uplifting upshot.Matt Damon delivers a substantially absorbing one-man-show, generates optimism and gives wisecracks through a series of video logs, not an Oscar-bait performance but if he can get a filler nomination for INVICTUS (2009), it means nothing is impossible for him. Considering Mark's situation, facing his despair and loneliness in a lone planet, the most probable denouement is dying there alone, 220,000,000 km from home, his mental journey is short- changed nevertheless, since the film contends to be a satisfactory tale of a man-made wonder, it is understandable they try to whitewash the sombre facet of the ordeal. All the supporting roles are portrayed level-headedly through their professions other than 3-dimensional characters, a guilt-driven Chastain could have been a potential scene-stealer, but that never gonna happen and her crew is too harmonious to allow the captain to risk any emotional turbulence.Fairly speaking, THE MARTIAN is less visually-innovate than GRAVITY and less theoretically- sophisticated than INTERSTELLAR, but for a Ridley Scott's vehicle, it hearteningly reaffirms us that sitting at the age of 78, he is not ready for retirement yet. The film is extremely audience- friendly, roundly constructed, and most admirably, with no calculation to cater to audience's rapacious appetite of hollow special effects.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Could have\should have been better,"While the plot and special effects were gripping and spectacular, the mood of Matt Damon's character made the movie very unrealistic. I cannot fathom anyone being left millions of miles away from home on a planet with no breathable atmosphere, being so positive and jovial. I found his video monologue messages back to Earth, to be so void of any fear or apprehensiveness regarding his dire situation, that it was next to impossible to believe. It's an entertaining movie worth watching, but better script writing would have greatly enhanced this movie's credibility. There were other believability issues with this movie as well. Jeff Daniels' performance as the Director of Nasa, also left me with inconvincible notions. His portrayal came across as over-confident, non-charismatic, nonchalant, and pompous. Overall, more work should have been devoted to the script, not just the special effects.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
So touching!,"This film tells the remarkable story of an astronaut stranded on Mars during a space mission.

The plot is simple but it has all the right elements to capture the viewers' hearts. To see Mark survive against all odds is very engaging and touching. In addition, the Herculean efforts to rescue him back to Earth is even more touching because there are almost insurmountable technical difficulties. The risk of failure is so high, that death seems almost certain. That of course brings about an poignant ending, which surely leaves me in tears. I enjoyed watching ""The Martian"".",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Scott's Best Since Alien,"Ridley Scott has made some of the most enduring classics of all time in his 40-year career (Alien, Gladiator, Blade Runner). On the other hand, he has also managed to totally wet the bed in many of his productions, especially in recent years (The Counselor, Robin Hood). This big-hit-or-big-miss track record keeps him surprisingly vital for a 77-year-old man, with his successes often directly relating to their source material. With his most recent, The Martian, an adaptation of a hugely popular novel, he uses that original story to create a beautiful and spirited stranded-planet adventure that rivals anything Scott has done in decades. The survival tale of a NASA astronaut accidentally stranded on Mars begs comparison to recent space disaster films Gravity and Interstellar. While Martian is comparable to those movies high-points in visuals and sheer thrills, it surpasses both in sheer personality. Even though much of Scott's galactic epic focuses on hard science, botany theories, and public relations problems, it far exceeds its inherent dryness with a lively and sharply funny script, and a wonderfully believable turn by Damon. His brainy and silly performance is backed by a deep sense of fear and awe, as he reconciles and even revels in his newfound heroism while never forgetting its colossal danger. This epic tale is told surprisingly economically, never reaching too far past its focal points and keeping us completely engaged. Martian's parable of ingenuity and the will to survive is a smart and fully entertaining science fiction outing that reminds us what great big movies can be: funny, uplifting, transporting, and exhilarating.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A contender for Ridley Scott's best since Blade Runner.,"In 1979, Ridley Scott made the quintessential space film with Alien, and he hasn't topped it since, though he ventured back into space earlier this decade with the intriguing prequel Prometheus. It didn't scratch that itch. Just 3 short years later, that itch is now thoroughly scratched with The Martian. Uninterested in indulging in mysteries, The Martian is focused on a series of compelling obstacles and just as fascinating solutions. It's much more of a procedural picture than conventional sci-fi, more in line with Apollo 13 than Gravity. Despite its length, the pacing never dulls. It's not too far from the derided The Counselor in tone, but this benefits from a more lightweight approach.Sometimes we'll leave a set of characters for a long time, the film just trusts that we can imagine what they're thinking and feeling and it results in a much fuller picture. This is clean and refreshing filmmaking. It utilises some very American themes of redemption and the idea that everyone can be saved and it's wonderfully cathartic. It's rock and roll science with sharp wit and and sharper brains. Matt Damon gives one of the best performances of his career bringing effortless gravitas where it may have otherwise been neglected along with an easy- going sense of humour. The quality of the production itself is stellar, thriving on having few locations to deal with. The Martian is far better than I expected, and maybe Scott's best since Blade Runner.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A nice rocket ride while it lasts,"(68%) A well made space survival adventure that mixes Apollo 13, Castaway and Interstellar in a very watchable treat that marks a lighter entry into Ridley Scott's filmography. The pacing is sharp, the performances from the strong cast are solid and this never becomes anything other than a likable sit. Unlike something such as Castaway the plot is more required to follow both the captive (Matt Damon) and the rest of the cast who's only objective is to try and help rescue him, so there is a fair amount of switching between the two focal points rather than pure Matt Damon in space trying to get by. Without doubt this is a band apart from the lesser films of the year, but I doubt it will top my list mainly because for me it came and went without hardly any lasting impact. So by the end it is enjoyable while it lasts with plenty of heart and entertainment value, but it didn't send as many shock-waves upon me as it did so many others. Nice throwback soundtrack though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A good concept that failed to reach the hall of fame,"If you have watched ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar"" then you may not find ""The Martian"" so interesting to watch. But if you are new to science fiction movies, The Martian s worth a watch. Very well made. But somewhere fails to engage. The ending is too predictable. Matt Damon was very good but somehow his character lacked intensity. The overall experience was okay, not too exciting. Visuals were no doubt awesome. The vast desolate Martian landscape leaves a mark. But somehow this movie reminds of many other science fiction movies. The vast expanses are so much a reminder of ""Oblivion"". A good movie to watch one time. Most probably it will not find it's place in the science fiction hall of fame.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The Most Overrated Movie of the Year,"Imagine if you took the movie Cast Away, stripped away all the humanity and excitement, and set it in space. You'd have The Martian. This movie is an uninspired mess full of dull performances and idiotic characters. Jeff Daniels does a great job at playing the professional idiot, Sean Bean plays the cool dude who undermines his superior, and Matt Damon plays the most annoying protagonist of all time. If you like movies consisting almost entirely of an irritating character talking to you through a webcam about mundane activities or events you've already seen, then buy a ticket immediately.There are literally no redeemable qualities to be found here. The script is laughably bad, the science aspects of the movie don't dazzle the eyes, and there's no tension due to Damon's terrible performance. Just when you think it can't get any worse, the film wraps up with one of the most hilariously terrible climaxes in cinema history. No spoilers, but you'd assume a scientific movie would have a basic understanding of the laws of physics. Anyway, If you like pedantic movies that serve no purpose other than to throw science at your face, without any heart or intrigue, then go see this. Otherwise, I'd advise you look elsewhere.

A hit by Ridley Scott!,"Outstanding performance by Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, and Kate Mara, teamed up with Ridley Scott's directing and stunning cinematography makes this film a must see!I also feel this one was one of my favorite Matt Damon performances, and he portrayed his character perfectly - with a side dish of humor!All around great flick that could have not been produced any better!A perfect 10/10 from me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of the best sci-fi's ever.,"""I admit it's fatally dangerous, but I'd get to fly around like Iron Man."" Mark Watney (Matt Damon)The above quote encapsulates the qualities of The Martian that allow it to be spoken about in the same breath as Arthur C. Clarke's 2001. Not only is Ridley Scott's sci-fi adventure filled with humor and pop cult (wait till you hear Gloria Gaynor's ""I will Survive""), but it also has enough smart but accessible science to please the geekiest fan.In other words, in some respects it trumps the great sci-fi icon by overcoming the cold Hal as a bad-guy computer and creating space as the formidable opponent: ""This is space. It does not cooperate."" (Watney)Gone are Scott's desolate landscapes of decaying cities and dripping monsters-- it's an entertaining and uplifting film that exalts human ingenuity and the need to be humane. Mars is merely a dry, rock and sand stage for mankind to do its scientific and cooperative best stuff. And it serves to remind the world of the necessity to adventure despite the danger: ""Every time something goes wrong, the world forgets why we fly."" Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels)That the world is engrossed in the drama of bringing back stranded astronaut Watney from Mars is a testimony to the need for human connection to its great enterprises and the glory of team effort both on the ground (even China gets to play) and in space. Scott's achievement that goes himself one better from Blade Runner and Alien is depicting the inherent drama in people working together for a common goal, ready to make the sacrifices so that mankind can survive.Watney's formula for survival:""You just begin. You do the math. You solve one problem and you solve the next one, and then the next. And if you solve enough problems, you get to come home.""",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Another great sci-fi offering in this decade,"I don't like sci-fi films that much, but these days we have films, which what I thought to have a good combination of creativity and realism such that they are too good to ignore. Both ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar"" have been considered iconic films in this genre, and this year, we have another one, albeit not as iconic, under the title of ""The Martian"". Although it doesn't have the technical novelty in the same degree as that of ""Gravity"" or the edgy plot that we have encountered in ""Interstellar""; nonetheless, ""The Martian"" manages to be as amazing. The plot is simple, but yet we are treated with a good, if not impressive, execution of the simple and subtle things in the story. It is simple yet brainy. The story basically deals with the humanity's way of solving problems in order to survive. Solve the bigger problem by decomposing it into smaller problems, and then solve them one by one until you have solved enough problems that will probably enable you to survive.It revolves around a scientific expedition to Mars, which was unfortunately hampered by the inaccurately predicted Martian storm. That storm was strong enough to destroy their launch pad, and this forced the crew to leave the Martian research unit. However, during the untimely evacuation, a crew member was hit by debris and was left behind. He was presumed dead, but was later discovered alive through the satellite images received by the Earth. The surviving crew was already on their journey back home when they learned that he was still alive. However, they were facing a difficult logistics problem for his rescue, given the expensive space mission and the distance between Earth and Mars. It would take at least a year at best for a supply or rescue to reach the planet, and perhaps, by that time Mark Watney was already dead.The film focuses on the survival efforts - sounds tedious and depressing for a film to depict - but like the case of other great films, the journey was rather engaging and enjoyable, kudos to the performance of Matt Damon as Mark Watney and the achievement by Ridley Scott as director. Furthermore, the experience was enhanced by the excellent use of visual effects and music. Although, the approach can be considered minimalist, the thrills brought by this film are satisfying. I found the survival process in itself enjoyable, and what makes it even more interesting is that it is not all about the efforts of one man alone, but also the efforts of the people in the Earth to bring Mark Watney back home alive. Matt Damon was surrounded by a compelling supporting cast (to name a few: Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels), and of course a compelling combination of different subject matters: astrophysics, rocket science, botany, chemistry, mathematics, and supercomputers.However, for those who expect a big dose of action and emotions, they may rather find this film disappointing or a bit unfulfilling. There are lots of powerful scenes wherein the director should have managed to bring the experience into full blast but rather chose to ""soft-pedal"" them. Not bad though, but I thought it could have been more amazing. Moreover, the first two-thirds of the film tried to avoid the cliché often associated with films under this genre, but unfortunately it sort of fell to the ""Hollywoodish"" formula in the end, e.g. the scene with the big crowd in the New York Times Square. However, I still say it was an amazing film. This is one of Ridley Scott's best, and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a lot of attention in the awards season.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One more reason not to give up on humankind,"I first saw The Martian in 2015 in a movie theater and I remember enjoying it.
After giving it a re-watch 4 years later I can say I enjoyed it even more.
The best part about this film for me is its emotional package. I love it when a film shares its emotions with you through good screenplay and acting. And The Martian does a great job at this.
The film also deliveres a very hopeful message. There is still good in humankind and as Sean Bean said it in the film - a single life is worth it.
It feels great to see people dealing with the situation through science one problem at a time (as Damon's character put it in the end of the film). Human intelligence and cooperation can work miracles, and as I've said, even one human life is worth all the trouble.
The characters were also great, them being more human (all the humour and interactions) but still logical and thoughtful helped the story.
It is also great that they have made it technical enough to be believable.
Some of the comedy timings and mentions made me burst into laughter (especially the Project Elrond announcement with Sean Bean in one scene).
And while I do think that making this a little darker would've made it better, I still think that The Martian is one of the best movies about human spirit, survival and problem solving.P.S. It was interesting to see how some of the ideas and vistas of The Martian made it into other Ridley Scott's projects like Alien Covenant.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Who Doesn't Like This Movie?,"The Martian is a clever, sophisticated movie, designed for the viewer who knows how to read!

good fun,"Since i've seen Interstellar (2014) it is understandable that i would be skeptical about another SF movie happening in outer space and on another planet. However, The Martian was made with such amount of self-depreciating humor that the scientific and ""scientific"" facts didn't disturb me at any time.And this is exactly how i suggest to watch The Martian. It is an unassuming SF pastime without the ambition to share with us some higher truth. Not reading the book is no hindrance, besides i prefer the movie to talk for itself independently from the book.My experience suggest that The Martian doesn't necessarily need to be seen in 3D. Despite some shots, scenes and scenery that are impressive, 2D would to the trick just as fine.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Like everyone else has already said...it's Scott's best in a few years now.,"""The Martian"": This was one I wanted to see in the theater because I'm a pretty big Ridley Scott fan, unfortunately never got the opportunity; like most people who got into sci-fi, I can thank Scott for that since he's contributed so much to the genre. I won't claim that this movie is his next big contribution to the sci-fi genre that will change things forever like his past films ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"", but this is pretty good. I thought that this was a good time, I don't know if it needed to be two and a half hours long; when it comes to the length of a movie I would kind of prefer that if a science fiction flick has a runtime over two hours long that it be a little more innovative or provocative than something like this, but it was consistently entertaining so I can totally give it a pass for that.I don't really want to get much into the story because the plot is pretty simple, rather not spoil what happens. If you have seen the trailers then it's pretty easy to gather what the movie is about; Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is stranded on Mars with very limited amounts of food and somehow has to find ways to survive alone with all these extreme scenarios happening to him until a rescue team hopefully makes it to him in time. This isn't Scott's typical dark sci-fi film though; I mean yes, you can tell he's in the director's chair but this is a bit brighter and a lot more of an optimistic film in comparison to the rest of his filmography. I say more optimistic because the lead character that is stuck on Mars, Mark Watney, stays completely positive for most of the obstacles that come. He does have his occasional moments of despair and even anger, but he keeps his chin up so he can solve the problem and move on so he can survive. It would be so easy to make this character such a downer; not doing much except brooding, which is understandable for the awful situation dealt to this character, but they don't do that and it makes this character a bit of a stand out and more interesting. Makes me like the character easier than if the writing had gone the other route to darken up his character instead because of how his whole being stranded situation starts almost from the very beginning. If he wasn't as likable as he was, then this movie could have been a long drag to watch someone to brood instead of being proactive like he ended up being. Not much else to say really; the acting was really good, the writing was solid, the direction and cinematography were of course great and I was entertained and invested the whole time. I liked it. I don't know if I would say ""best of the year"" like it seems some of the nominations from the various award ceremonies this year are announcing, but I still think it was a really good movie. This was a movie about hope, keeping a positive attitude in harsh times and being as proactive as humanly possiblethis was the anti-""War Room"" movie. If you've seen ""War Room"" then you might know what I'm talking about here, just think about it for a second. ""War Room"" when things get tough it tells you to sit in a closet, don't do anything productive except submit to your verbally abusive husband and pray about him because God will step in to take all of your problems away. Here, he doesn't just sit and wait for something hopefully good to happen or for NASA to rectify the situation. He does what he can, almost right away, to survive and improve on his bad situation. I know they are completely different scenarios, but the message is still the same. Do something yourself if you want things to change for the better, don't expect others to always do it for you. So go see this movie, it is pretty friggin' good!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This could be Ridley Scott's comeback,"Ridley Scott is definitely one of the most hit or miss directors out there. ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"" are clearly his most praised works. ""Gladiator"" is definitely a classic and it has a pretty big fanbase. Also, some people argue that ""Black Hawk Down"" is even on the same level with ""Apocalypse Now"" and other classic war films (which by the way, I agree with that statement). However, he has also produced many hated films in the 2000's which have been called major disappointments by many. However, I still had hopes for this one because sci-fi tends to be his strongest genre. My anticipation definitely paid off and ""The Martian"" is clearly the best film he's made in a while and it proves that it might be his comeback.After an astronaut gets stranded on Mars after a storm hits his crewmates, he finds out that he must find a way to signal Earth that he is still alive and he has to figure out how to survive until then.There have been a lot of comparisons to last years ""Interstellar"". Unlike ""Interstellar"", this film doesn't contain any expositions and it gets right to the inciting incident. Despite this, we never get confused during the film as it doesn't expect us to have read the book. It explains things nicely and the plot flows along smoothly. ""Interstellar"" is also very heavy on science. However, this film doesn't focus too much on intricate science concepts and it is a film which can be enjoyed by more people on the first viewing. Also, it is much less bland and its pacing makes it an easier film to watch. So for this reason, I enjoyed it much more than ""Interstellar"".Also, I really enjoyed the visuals. The outside shots gave a great feel about how Mars looked and it made it look like a barren and desolate area. The shots from the ship looked very futuristic and it made the living quarters look super advanced and high tech. The atmosphere in the movie couldn't be much better and it really makes you feel that this film actually was filmed in space. It may not be anything new or groundbreaking in terms of space visuals but I usually don't ever mind that as long as the visuals are not underwhelming and this movies visuals are most certainly not underwhelming at all. They interested me greatly and they looked very realistic.Most of the screen time is focused on Matt Damon in this movie. I felt that he gave a great performance. It may not be anything Oscar-worthy but he still gave a realistic performance. He was the only actor I really noticed for the majority of the movie but that didn't bother me at all because he carried the movie very well by himself.Like most great movies, however, it isn't flawless. The pacing was a bit too slow for me at times and I felt that it could have been cut to 2 hours instead. I also felt that some scenes carried on longer than they had to. However, this didn't bother me all that much and I still enjoyed it a great deal.After ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar"" grew very popular, it seems that the space survival genre is starting to become popular and we might see more films like this in the next several years. Hopefully, Ridley Scott learns off of what he did right in this movie so he can apply what he learned and make more great films in the future. I'm not completely sure if this is true but I think that this film might be his comeback into fame and he might make good films again as he once did. This is one of my favorite films so far this year and make sure you see it as soon as possible. You will not be disappointed at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A refreshing recreation of one of cinema's most enjoyable genres,"Ridley Scott is one of those directors who require no introduction for anyone remotely familiar with cinema's greatest achivements. As the creative mind behind two universally approved science-fiction masterpieces, it's hard not to get excited about his new return to the genre, even if his previous couple of works have been somewhat lackluster (looking at you: ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"").
As great as it was to hear that he'll be working with Matt Damon, one of the most instantly likeable and relatable actors working nowadays, it was also a bit disconcerning to realise how ordinary the premise is, especially in comparison with at the time revolutionary space-horror claustrophobia of ""Alien"" and the fascinating philosophical futurism of ""Blade Runner"". After actually seeing the film, however, one of the most ecstatic realisations I had as an audience member was how aware Mr. Scott was of the mediocrity of the films' ""what"", which allowed him to concentrate on a truly awe-inspiring approach to its' ""how"".
Some of the negative reviews have pointed out how the film's tone is either lacking or inconsistent. Those who hold that grudge are, to my mind, missing the point, for it is exactly this consistent inconsistency that makes this film so refreshing, compelling and entrancing. The humour here is incredibly powerful, in a way that's impossible to achieve without a skilled execution by the actors, but the biggest contributor here is the script which rises to screwball/buddy film level of wittiness that's incredibly difficult to find in modern films, let alone science-fiction ones. The protagonist refuses to spend the film reveling in the cliched mental processes of depression and contemplation expected from someone in his situation; he approaches every problem he encounters knowingly, analitically and scientifically to the best of his ability, dealing with the potential for failure with a humoruous easiness that's inherent to his refreshingly optimistical personality. The banter of our Earth characters is mixed with detailed explanations of the plot which creates a near-perfect combination of exposition and entertainment.
This in no way means that the film is, as the Golden Globes would have you believe, a comedy (or better yet, a musical, although its pop-heavy soundtrack is also unexpectedly inspired); it creates some deeply emotional and intense sequences (especially at the beginning and the end) in which nothing is funny and everything is investing exactly because of how they are contrasted to the films' frequent easy-going moments.
But what truly completes this experience, in between all the great work done by actors (especially Damon, Bean and Daniels) and the writer, it is the visuals which truly cement this film in your brain, for the yellow, red and orange colours of the fields and mountains of Mars have rarely been more enchantingly poetic. Like the music becomes its own character in Leone's westerns, here the planet acts as a vast and powerful force of self-assured emptiness, constantly reminding the viewer of the fact that this film does, in fact, have a villain, and it is just as compelling and relentless as some of cinemas' most clearly motivated monsters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Can't you just not see it's a sci-fi made for your pleasure. I also know that the whole story would be completely impossible in real life but do I care about that? No because first of all I'm not a scientist, I don't work for Nasa or whatever space project. I just watch a movie to be entertained. And The Martian is entertaining. You hope everything ends well. You do live with the movie. To me that's the essential. Beautiful shots with Matt Damon that proves us again that he is a great actor.

"A Fun, Hopeful Piece of Sci-Fi (with Emphasis on the ""Sci"")","I would describe Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN as ""infectiously hopeful"". Astronaut Matt Watney, played with irresistible charm by Matt Damon, rarely succumbs to the near hopelessness of his situation. I think he only ever loses his composure twice in entire movie. It's hard not to smile along with him, cheering him on as he proceeds to outsmart the red planet at every turn. Damon finds support in an all-star cast in this bright bit of science fiction, including Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, and more. As you've probably figured out, Damon's Watney is the titular MARTIAN. He is stranded when the Mars mission of which he's a member is forced to abort their expedition and evacuate in the face of an enormous wind storm barreling down on them. Believing him dead as a result of some flying debris, his team launches for home and Watney awakens later, injured and alone. He's a little bummed at first but, almost immediately, he becomes determined to ""science the sh*t"" out his situation and survive until the arrival of the next Mars mission. To accomplish this, he will need to overcome his limited food supply and the overwhelming odds stacked against him on a planet unsuitable for human life. Meanwhile, those in charge at NASA become aware of Watney's unexpected survival and immediately start crunching the numbers in hopes of determining the fastest, safest means of bringing him home. It's a race against time and Watney will have to use every ounce of his ingenuity if he's to succeed.It's always a nice treat when Hollywood gifts us with some real science fiction. So many ""sci-fi"" movies anymore have to deal with alien invasions, epic space battles, or fantastical pseudoscience. THE MARTIAN, based on the novel by Andy Weir, makes an effort to be as grounded in reality as possible. Granted, this is still a big budget Hollywood film and there are time and story constraints that won't let it embrace the full extent of the science behind the action but it goes above and beyond most other films of this nature. Seeing as how Watney is alone on Mars, the filmmakers used a series of video journals that Watney keeps for the duration of his stay as a means of delivering a lot of the exposition and the explanations behind what he's trying to accomplish, whether it be establishing communication with Earth or growing potatoes in a blend of Martian soil and human waste. It also gives Damon, as an actor, someone to talk to, even if it's to the imagined future viewer of his video logs. Damon spends the vast majority of his screen time alone in this movie and it's a credit to his charisma and, again, optimistic nature that he pulls it off so well. Throughout the movie, we intercut between Damon with his latest problem and the NASA staff putting together their own plan to save him before his food supplies run out, with Jeff Daniels' NASA director Teddy Sanders given the rough task of preparing a rescue operation under the watchful eye of the public.Sanders and his team have a massive endeavor ahead of them, but at least he's got a great crew of minds behind him. Ejiofor is Vincent Kapoor, seemingly the team's voice of reason and the driving force behind the think tank. Kristen Wigg has a minor role as NASA's public relations officer, and Sean Bean is the mission commander who insists on informing Watney's fellow crewmembers (who are currently en route home to Earth) that he survived. That crew, by the way, consists of Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña, Sebastian Stan, and Kate Mara. I wasn't kidding about the cast; this movie is packed to the brim with talent. Ridley Scott has created his most entertaining movie in years with THE MARTIAN. It's got everything I love: talented cast and crew, an engaging plot, and the aforementioned sci-fi with an emphasis on the science. If I had one problem with the movie (and unfortunately I do) it's the final act where everything I enjoyed about the movie is set aside for a more traditional thrill-ride climax. It was also the only moment in the film where I wish Damon's character would show a little more fear and uncertainty. The plan to get him off Mars in insane (but just insane enough to work, I suppose) and his continued quipping at that point felt inappropriate. But a stumble at the finish line isn't enough to ruin the fun everything that preceded it. As much as THE MARTIAN is great sci-fi, it's also a real good time and that's what's important.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A great space movie,"A crew of six astronauts are in the middle of a sample collecting routine on Mars when they are taken by surprise by a massive storm. In their struggle to reach shelter, one of the members gets hit by debris and considered dead. The crew leaves for Earth only to later find out that their colleague is still alive, struggling in a desperate attempt to survive until a rescue mission is sent back to get him.It's a very emotional story of a man, stranded on Mars, which must survive way over his current resources allow, in a desperate hope that someone will hear his cry for help and come to save him. It's very interesting how he manages to overcome many difficulties in order to obtain food and, at the same time, also fix or upgrade his devices, vital for the many days which are to come. It's intriguing, sad, funny and also thrilling, making it addictive to watch most of the time.The main actor does an incredible job in describing the efforts of his character, making the whole plot very credible. As a downside, it is way too long for my taste, especially when the action is very static as it is in this film.

Yes but ...,"Maybe it's the ""too high expectations"" syndrome but as the end credits rolled, all I could think of what I disliked about the Martian. In no particular order & without spoilers:strange pacing.

The Martian's Saturated Space Frontier is Far From Cinema's Usual Blank Spaces!,"Space is an endless stretch of deep, unfeeling, obsidian black that swallows up the curious and adventurous and spits them out without remorse. Space is exhilarating, mystifying, and ultimately terrifying - or at least that's what we've been led to believe by space disaster movies. The Martian throws all of that out the window with a wink and a mischievous grin.Set in the near future, 'The Martian' opens on Mars, where a team led by Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) is wrapping up a month-long space mission. Soon, a fierce sandstorm catches the astronauts out in the open, and they barely make it to the Martian lander that will return them to the orbiting mother ship. But one of them, botanist Mark Watney (Damon), gets hit by a rogue piece of debris. Believing him dead, Lewis has no choice but to take off without him before the storm makes liftoff impossible.But Mark isn't dead. He awakens to a beeping alarm in his helmet telling him he's almost out of air. He struggles out of the sand in which he is half buried and discovers that he has been skewered by a shard of wind-blown metal and barely makes it into the now unoccupied housing module. Meanwhile, back on earth, NASA and the rest of the world are mourning Mark's loss; at least until satellite surveillance of Mars shows signs of activity at the outpost. Faced with the incredible possibility that Mark is alive, the best minds on the planet get to work on an ambitious plan to bring him home before his supplies run out.At this point, The Martian could have become just another grim, white-knuckle-tense space disaster movies. Instead, The Martian does something unexpected. It embraces comedy - balancing knuckle-biting suspense with dollops of humor. It presents Watney as a fairly cocky, genuinely funny, easygoing everyman who just happens to be the only living thing on this entire planet. This big screen adaptation (by Drew Goddard) of Andy Weir's best-seller has just about everything: laughs, thrills, visual splendor and a rousing endorsement of the brotherhood. Ridley Scott directs with nerve and verve, delivering an almost perfect piece of popular filmmaking. Bringing optimism, nerd-itude and a touch of crazy to his character's solo ordeal, Matt Damon is the key to the movie's exuberance. Damon has never seemed more at home than he does here, millions of miles adrift, shouldering the weight of the role with diligent grace. In the face of incredible odds, he ensures Mark Watney remains an endlessly charming protagonist. The rest of the supporting cast also pitches in noteworthy performances.But the Martian's greatest asset is that it remains relentlessly, hopefully human. It takes all the romance out of Mars, but substitutes in its place science, cooperation and perseverance – a fair bargain that results in an intimate sci-fi epic that is smart, spectacular and stirring.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Preachy, sanctimonious bull crap","People go to the cinema to be entertained, not to be schooled by people who have no idea what are they talking about. And on top of everything: why do you have to add politics and forced multiculturalism to every movie?! Is there a committee in Hollywood who demands that every single movie has to include multiculturalism, forced, not funny jokes, American flag, American nationalism, women who are good leaders?! It's like all the movies were written by the same people, all the effects done by the same crew, time to change Hollywood! Ridley Scott how could you? This movie is not entertaining, it's full of politics and preachy bull crap.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Of Miraculous Science and Sheer Human Ingenuity,"In truth, The Martian's sentiments may come across as old-fashioned and impossibly conservative. The film's notions subsist in a territory less explored in the ever expanding immensity of the space sci-fiction genre, somehow deviating from the category's more standardized form, but it makes a clear point, one that strongly testifies to humanity's incredible capacity to survive.The hero is Matt Damon's Mark Watney, who, after presumed dead by the rest of NASA's Ares 3 crew, was left in Mars, alone in the hostile red planet. He has at least four years to endure before a possible rescue mission arrives. But with limited rations left that may be good for only a few months, and persistent fatal conditions around him ever present, the witty Watney decides to ""science the sh!t out of it"" for him to survive, declaring he is the planet's greatest botanist, after all.For most of his chunk of the screen time, Watney shares his daily struggle in seemingly endless monologues through a confessional Vlog, running through diverse subjects that go from things as random and simple as Donna Summers to those of unfathomable scientific and mathematical depths, like thermodynamics and hexadecimals. And if you're not really into such stuff, you would thank him for throwing punchlines every now and then, which sometimes may be corny and flat, but nonetheless enough to keep us away from getting bored. And with the rest of the cast mostly standing in front of screens monitoring him,y Damon singularly shines throughout the picture. That's not to say the rest of the frame is invaluable, but Watney's struggle itself creates an emotional connection between the worlds, relaying a cathartic sentiment that the audience would impossibly not relate to.This may not be your no.1 sci-fi film, no thanks to a not- so- impressive finale, a bunch of supports whose functions mostly never go past just being stare-at-the- monitor standees, and some persistent logical leaps in the narrative, but it should be enough to shake up your list. Not only it pays with utmost reverence to science, it also explores its endless possibilities, which may not be within our grasp at the moment, but still scientifically possible.With all that said, 'The Martian' is an exquisite cinematic gem, its sentiments reminiscent of familiar campaigns pulled off by countless previous films aiming to enforce humanity and its miraculous capacity. It's a celebration of human spirit and our species' ingenuity. And while everybody's abuzz about the recent discovery of existence of water in the red planet and the possibility it might be capable of supporting life, 'The Martian' has somehow delivered a compelling argument about how the planet probably can, one I believe, is worth checking out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"The power of great storytelling, and the magic of real science","When was the last time you knew the ending of a movie, but still found yourself gasping with anticipation, clenching your teeth in fear, and generally being in lock-step emotionally with the main character. Not talking sympathy - feeling for them, but empathy... experiencing the ride along with them?I can't even remember. But what's more, being a geek myself I was totally thrilled with a movie that treats science not as something magical, but something absolutely pedestrian - something accessible to everyone. Science is a tool that lets humans do amazing things.By refusing to create fantastical tools or solutions to routine difficult problems, the book The Martian and the movie challenge us to think about the concept of a 'super power' differently. Try to convince me that the ability to make water out of non-liquid elements isn't a super power - it keeps you alive, and makes food grow! How cool is that?Rated PG-13, I think easily this is a movie that even a 9 year old will appreciate, though of course there's a bit of course language and a bit of blood, but compared to most video games there's nothing to concern yourself with. And the 'brief nudity' mentioned is not going to be a problem for younger children, please trust me.This is a movie that reminds ALL of us, children and adults, to not just look up from our iPhones and game consoles once in awhile, but to look UP... all the way to the stars, and consider our place in the world, and to marvel at the capacity of humans to not just destroy things, but to MAKE things, too.I loved Interstellar - but this is fundamentally a more intimate and personal movie, and I cannot recommend any movie more highly.BTW - skip 3D... it doesn't need it. Sit closer to the screen than you normally do, and that's enough.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Beautiful scenery, a great cast and a down-to-Earth story makes a genuine cinematic experience.","The Martian sees Matt Damon play astronaut / botanist Mark Watney as he survives stranded on Mars after an accident during a mission leaves him presumed dead. The Martian is a sci-fi thriller and adventure, showing a return to form for Ridley Scott. This shows space is what he does best.As soon as the film begins you are just immersed by the scenery. Some of the wide shots and the detail put into the setting of Mars is phenomenal. It is honestly stunning and almost makes you think ""how did they film on Mars?!"". Mars' rich red and stark desert is captured in beautifully composed shots and polished cinematography. The 3D adds a layer of depth that really stood out for me.The cast is spectacular. Great performances all round. Some examples that stood out in particular was Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor and even Kristin Wiig who obviously comes from a comedic background naturally fell into her character and gave a solid performance. But overall this movie would be no where without the leading man Matt Damon who is exceptional. He drives this film. When he's on screen you are with him surviving Mars. When the film cuts back from Mars to Nasa back to Mars to Nasa again it doesn't feel boring or that you like a certain plot better, the film meshes and blends well because these characters and actors deliver stellar performances.Which brings into the writing. The writing is witty, smart and without a doubt hilarious. This movie could have been mopey and very emotion-driven throughout, the film has time to fit in humour here are there and it works! Watney seems to find the funny side in his situations and I had numerous good laughs. I did not expect the film to be this funny and it'll come as a pleasant surprise to people.You are rooting for Watney the entire film. Damon's performance accompanied by witty writing makes for a likable protagonist. The supporting cast elevate the emotion of this event and how it effects everyone and all can relate. Beautiful CGI and directing makes for the aesthetic that is the Mars landscape is really one of the main reasons this movie is so good. A classic and unexpectedly groovy soundtrack too make one of the most entertaining and well-rounded cinema experiences this year. You will be cheering in your seat praying for Watney to make it home!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of the best sci fi movies i've ever seen!,"I just saw the Martian today at the cinema and i must say i really enjoyed it!I thought it would be a really sad, depressing movie, but i was pleasantly surprised at how uplifting, and at times funny the movie was.I truly believe, this is the sci fi movie, along with Alien that will define Ridley Scott for many years to come.The imagery in the movie is absolutely amazing. Mars actually looks like Mars!Everyone in the movie does a great job, but i think Matt Damon steals the movie with his performance. His character could so easily just be a sour-puss and give up and let the planet take his life, but he does the opposite. He pretty much tells the planet that he's stuck on, that he won't fold up his tent but instead stay strong and on top of that be proactive and find solutions to his problems.I am almost tempted to see it again, and i don't think i've ever felt that way about a movie before. Put it this way, i saw Avengers Age of Ultron, and once was more than enough for me.I truly hope this film gets the good reviews it deserved and help cement Scot's place in movie history as one of the great directors of all time.I give it 10 out of 10 and would be more than happy to recommended anybody to go see it. You will not be disappointed!! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Out of the world experience,The Martian was a very highly anticipated movie and i believe that it has truly lived up to its hype - well at least for me.The storyline is just plain awesome- only made better by funny one liners and superb acting. It is both a visual and technical masterpiece which one can watch again and again. I honestly did not find a flaw that bothered me in the movie was left amazed by what i had seen. It was a very exciting two hours(and 20 minutes or so for me) and i will recommend this movie to anyone reading this review. The movie on the whole is not the best movie ever types but it is a movie that will leave you satisfied and content. The acting does complement the movie well to some extent and the movie(in my opinion) is a worthy successor to the book.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
an honest disappointment,"I like Ridley Scott, I like Matt Damon and I like Space. A film with all three of these things was exiting. But sadly all of these things were there in spades, but the film lacked something. A survival story in space seems like an interesting idea but while I was watching it, I felt like I had already seen this somewhere else, in Interstellar and Gravity to an extent. Some shots felt exactly the same (because the technology is the same (realistic) there are only few ways to shoot a docking scene) and I felt more invested in Interstellar movie where they go and rescue a scientist (played by Matt Damon. The feeling of deja vu reminded me of how more i had enjoyed interstellar which I then reflected cant be much because I had felt like Interstellar hadn't been a good movie. Some things i Didn't like about the movie itself. I felt that because of the nature of the story, we were only really seeing the highlights when we would see Matt Damon talk to the camera. I understand that it seems more realistic but I would've preferred less time between scenes on Mars. Time passes unnaturally, sometimes at normal speed an then we jump four years in the future. So that the movie is realistic, these time jumps have to be included but it just felt too long. Matt Damon was a pleasure but we didn't really spend enough time with anyone else for a lasting impression.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A great looking feel-good scifi flick,"The film is NOT called Bring Him Home in case you were wondering. 78 year old Ridley Scott returns to science fiction, the genre he is best known for (Alien/Blade Runner/Prometheus). Though this scifi is much more based on real world science of the near future (2030) than the aforementioned movies. The book on which it's based got a lot of critical acclaim but I didn't read it so I can't say how well the story made the translation to the big screen. The Martian is a rather uplifting -yes dare I say feel good- film despite the apparently grim fate that befalls Mark Whatley (the astronaut stranded on Mars played by Matt Damon). You could say it's a testament to the resourcefulness of humans in dire situations and how you have to keep a positive attitude and not give in in spite of all the hardship that comes your way. Visually the movie is -as most Ridley Scott films are- pure eye-candy. The VFX looks hyperreal and are top of the line and the cinematography is superb. The music is mostly disco music but there is a reason for that in the story and it actually works well as a comedic effect. The film is actually similar to Apollo 13 which was better but was also based on true events. The Martian is a bit long at 141 mins and there is maybe a bit to much problem solving and sometimes not enough character background (e.g. what motivates Whatley to survive?). A very good film and worth the trip to the cinemas. It does however feels like it is lacking something to make it to classic status.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A long movie with little suspense,"This movie is rated highly on IMDb and features Matt Damon in space, so I thought it would be worth a watch. Unfortunately, it wasn't very good. The main problem is that you only rarely feel that the main character is in any real danger. He is pretty upbeat about the whole thing and keeps making trite comments/jokes, such as ""I'm gonna have to science the sh*t out of this"". And when there finally is some crisis, he fixes it very quickly and the suspense is killed again. The use of disco music also adds to the silly atmosphere in the movie.Maybe I'm not supposed to compare this movie with Gravity and Interstellar, but those two movies are vastly superior in my opinion. They both deliver experiences that makes you hold your breath and feel the danger and harshness of space and foreign planets, whereas The Martian just feels long and boring.The acting and CGI is fine, for the most part.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Much more than I expected.,"I read the book when it came out in 2011 and I when they announced they where going to do the movie I was thrilled:The book is not your typical Sci-Fi drama, it has touches of humor I really liked and it was written in a close and relatable way (as wired as it may sound talking about a not so far plausible futuristic scenario)I think Ridley Scott transferred it brilliantly to the screen with spectacular visuals and special effects ( I recommend you watch the movie in a dolby atmos cinema for the full experience).Is it the best Ridley Scott movie?

"A Combination of Great Intelligence and Surprising Laughs,","The Martian is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. I was very surprised with how good this film really was, it may look like a clichéd Ridley Scott film at first, but it had a very compelling story that sucks you in almost immediately, you are drawn to these characters and their adventure from start to finish. It is difficult to comprehend how logical it is, even though you may not know whether it is possible to survive on Mars, you can tell that Scott and Goddard did their research and made sure that Mark Watney's methods of survival made sense. One thing that I think could have improved was the sense of losing hope, there is never a moment where Mark or any other NASA employees completely lose hope in succeeding in their journey, no part were all of their plans completely fall apart and there is no sign of their problems being solved, this is an aspect of storytelling that should certainly be evident in all movies, it builds the audiences care for the characters. The films cast is fantastic, Matt Damon shines in the lead role and I could easily say this is one of the greatest performances of his career, Mark is very funny, I was surprised at how much he made me laugh, he was also likable and charming. Damon also has a lot of depth, there's certainly two sides to him, though he always seems confident he will make it home, we can always see doubt and frustration in his eyes, in his voice, the characterization of Watney was phenomenal and he deserves huge praise. He is also joined by an outstanding supporting cast that are just as inspired, I can not possibly name them all but I have to mention Jessica Chastain, a fabulous actress who is slowly becoming one of my favourites, Chiwetel Ejiofor steals every scene he is in as usual and Jeff Daniels really impressed me playing a flawed character who somehow never loses likability, Kristen Wiig also deserves praise, while this movie is funny, she surprisingly never delivers a single humorous piece of dialogue and is a very impressive dramatic actress, I look forward to hopefully seeing her in more dramas in the future. Intriguing, terrific effects, stunning character development and a flawless cast, the Martian is one of the best movies of the year, not to be missed by any fans of Sci-Fi or Adventure.After being presumed dead while on a manned mission to Mars, Mark Watney tries to get in contact with NASA, shocking his crew and the rest of the world in the process by discovering he is still alive.

"""Pretty"" Hollywood Cliché Flick Without Depth","This is a ""pretty"" movie that's great for an afternoon at the movies, one of those that I call ""children's birthday movies"".While the movie is very watchable with brilliantly and credible rendered CGI and some amazing scenes and visuals, it is lacking any kind of depth.The movie is full with Hollywood clichés, with easily digestible, predictable plot and Hollywood cardboard-cut-out stereotypical characters akin dumb ""entertainment blockbusters"" like ""Independence Day"". Including the ""nerd"", the super-heroic heroic crew, the NASA boss and whatever stereotypes Hollywood is always using and re-using.(It's like that Ridley Scott decided that for once, he wants to make an entertainment flick that will make some good cash at the box office, RATHER than a movie that would be memorable and intelligent in any way).As someone called it, ""American feel good movie"". Heck, even ""Aliens"" back in the day had more depth or drama than this movie.As for drama, I was amazed that this movie didn't convey any sense of drama whatsoever - something which is astonishing given the fact it's about some guy stranded on another planet for more than two years. You sit there and watch and simply accept how the counter on the screen tells you how long the guy is there already, and everything he does seems easy, without a sense of danger or urgency.The (very few) moments in the movie where something bad happens, you immediately KNOW when it'll happen since the movie ""thank god"" (sarcasm) guides you Hollywood style, assuming that the average movie-goer has an IQ of 20 and needs help, explaining him in advance that a situation in the movie might possibly not turn out as expected, and low and behold, exactly THAT happens in the next 20 seconds.""Well he's doing great, unless of course something bad will happen"".And of course, as predicted, it'll happen right away...The entire movie I was amazed how great the guy was doing for being stranded for so long and how flawless everything went he was attempting to do...sometimes border-lining the credible, with the only excitement and drama in the movie that I was wondering how long his potatoes might last...That being said, it is an entertaining and ""watchable"" movie when you can manage to turn off your brain for two and a half hours and just accept it as the Hollywood family blockbuster it actually is. Just don't expect a smart SciFi movie, interesting plot with twists, complex characters or anything the like.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A comeback for Ridley Scott,"The Martian was directed by Ridley Scott and stars Matt Damon,Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels,Kate Mara. First off, I've readied the book before seeing the movie so I had high hopes going into it and I have to say I was not disappointed. The Martian wasn't only a great movie but a great come back from Ridley Scott. He did a fantastic job and handled the big cast great. His last few movie had a big cast too and those movie turned out pretty bad. This wasn't the case, the acting, cinematography, everything was great. You would think a man by himself on a planet would get boring but it didn't at all. Matt Damon played the role of Mark Watney fantastic. Seeing this person surviving was so interesting and at times very funny. Just like the book there's lot humor and it works well. Jeff Daniels did a great job also, he's be doing a lot of movies this year that might get him best supporting actor. Overall was a great movie and a great comeback for amazing director Ridley Scott.

"Amazing, visually stunning gift from Ridley Scott","From director Ridley Scott, the amazing visionary behind the sci-fi classics such as Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982), and Promtheus (2012), comes any visual stunning science fiction survival flick with splendid visuals and superb storytelling. Matt Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney whose team is sent on a mission to Mars. The mission goes terribly wrong when an intense dust storm hits and Watney is hit with debris and presumed dead by his team. Before too long, Watney wakes up and reveals to be alive, but is now stranded alone on a deserted planet . Watney must put his skills and intelligence to the test in order to survive, while NASA and his team work together to rescue him and bring him back home. This involves planting crops with Mars soil to grow a yearly supply of food. This film features the talented cast of Jessica Chastain, Kristin Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.Upon seeing the trailer, I was quite excited for this movie. This is the best science-fiction I've seen since last year's Interstellar. This film runs for two hours and 21 minutes, but Ridley Scott always keeps it captivating from start to finish. There is very rarely a dull moment if any. Matt Damon's character Mark Watney manages to reduce the intense atmosphere with his optimistic and sarcastic attitude, spitting out hilarious one-liners here and there. In the trailer, he presented some of the most clever one-liners such as ""I'm gonna need to science the s**t out of this"" and ""In your face Neil Armstrong"", probably some of the best lines I've heard in a long time. So the film carries a comedic undertone to it in the amidst of the seriousness. The supporting characters have their witty moments of hilarity as well. The performances by Damon and the rest of the cast were pretty solid and deserve big thumbs up.The visual effects and cinematography are the biggest attention grabbers here. With Wadi Rum Valley in Jordan serving as a backdrop of Mars, audience are treated with the most realistic depiction of Mars ever shown in cinema. With the red-tinted saturation and lighting, it gives them the look like the film is actually shot in The scenes set in outer space are quite eye-popping. Another delightful aspect is the storytelling. Unlike most sci-fi films where there is a frequent sense of urgency, this film carries a very hopeful tone and the characters remain optimistic about their goals to save the main character after he gets stranded on a planet where no life exists (yet!). While it may disappoint some due to the lack of surprise elements, it stays very human-like and engrossing to where it keep the audience glued to their seats.The Martian is a must-see for all sci-fi fans, and perhaps everyone else. Matt Damon is amazing in this and the story never disappoints. I believe this film has some Oscars on the way for Best Visual Effects and Best Cinematopgraphy (possibly Best Sound editing).

This is basically a modern version of Apollo 13 for a broader audience,"The setup is a little bit different (stranded on mars instead of drifting in space) but the plot is basically the same. Staying productive / positive facing fearful odds. Matt D. character seems to be partly based on Professor Randy Pausch (The last lecture - google it!). His jokes, his almost naive stay positive attitude and the few scenes where you can see his fear overcoming him, make him somewhat boring to me, but this a personal taste thing.

Courageously gimmick-free and measured look at deep-space exploration,"Given the ambition of the ""Star Trek"" universe and other film and TV space genres, sci-fi fans may well need pinching from time to time if they are to recall correctly that no human being has yet been further than 401,000 km from the Earth, while Mars lies out there at a minimum distance of 55 MILLION km. Thus - in real life - even unmanned missions to our external neighbour continue to push our species to the limits of its abilities. The fact that that might be a shame, given humankind's basic drive to explore, and the way that our species really might unify to swing behind such an effort are clearly among the aims of this film, whose mainly-supportive portrayal of the space agencies and what they stand for is nevertheless (one feels rightly) an eclectic mix of the awe-inspiring and the Heath Robinson. This is a film that clearly qualifies as sci-fi in some way, but is nevertheless no ""Mission to Mars"" or ""Red Planet"". Rather this is a space-mission story told straight, relying a lot on technological details, and (mostly) accurately encapsulating some of the real-life difficulties that operating manned missions at the limits of our range might really bring; and even slowing the pace at many points to strengthen our awareness of those distances, and the loneliness and apparent helplessness they denote. Ridley Scott's love of detail comes into its own in such a context, while Matt Damon handles the starring role well enough, injecting the sceptical and humorous notes we have come to expect from real-life astronauts, as well as the toughness and resourcefulness. The Mars his character has reached is as staggeringly impressive and beautiful as it is utterly hostile, yet still - in some way at least, as ""The Martian"" makes clear - ""out there waiting for us"", should we prove up to the challenge of near-limitless flexibility and adaptability.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Amazing movie... Matt Damon was excellent!,"Excellent movie.. Absolutely loved it. My 13 year old son and I were counting the days till the movie came out and this instantly became one of my all time favorite movies. I was never a Matt Damon fan, didn't dislike him, just never really was into anything he was in. He was absolutely amazing in this role. Although there are less scenes with other people in Castaway, I put Matt's performance up there with Tom Hanks. Having to carry close to an entire movie on your own is not an easy thing to do and Matt did a great job. I am now a fan and will be looking into past movies of his to see what I have been missing.

The Martian,"I really do not care what the movie is about, if Ridley Scott is directing, I want to see it. I mean, how cool is it to be able to go to a movie theater and watch a movie directed by the guy who made Alien, Blade Runner and Gladiator? It's so awesome. The problem is Ridley Scott has been inconsistent over the years, with some less great films, like Exodus: Gods and Kings. I am happy to say, however, the Martian will probably be another Scott classic.The Martian is a very intriguing and smart movie, the cinematography is absolutely stunning and I have no idea where they shot the movie, but one could actually believe they are on Mars. The desert wastelands are just breathtaking. The movie is also very funny, surprisingly and features great performances by a huge cast, especially Matt Damon, who is just awesome in this. Chiwetel Ejiofor is also great, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean and others do a great job as well.I love movies like this that incorporate real science into the plot, but it also makes it clear to the audience what it all means. It's a great way to make the plot of the movie believable and it worked great in the Martian.Now, there are flaws in the movie, particularly for me it was the pacing. Every single Matt Damon scene is great, the movie feels like Castaway on Mars, and I loved that. But sometimes the focus shifts to the people on Earth and NASA trying to solve the problem and bring Damon's character Mark Watney home. I understand the things that happen on Earth have to be explained in order for the movie to make sense. However, the pacing of the movie slows down a lot and we get to see less of Watney's epic quest for survival. Some sequences towards the end feel slow because of this and there is a very long stretch in the movie that doesn't even show the main character of the film. Once you've established who the hero in the movie is, well, we should be able to follow him in his character ark. And the movie doesn't really let us do this, because it shifts focus so many times.Despite its flaws, The Martian looks great, the effects are pretty good, the cinematography is beautiful and the acting is solid. I didn't particularly enjoy that much of the sequences on Earth, but they were necessary. The Martian, I believe and hope, will be regarded in the future as a very funny Ridley Scott classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

techno-survival,"I expect something special when I go to a film by Ridley Scott . In his long and remarkable career Scott approached many genres from space horror to historical sagas, from road movies to gangster comedies and succeeded exceptionally well in many of these. The secret is of course professionalism, the talent to tell a story, and to build (sometimes) greater-than-life characters which are credible in extreme situations. He tried to do the same with 'The Martian' but in my opinion he did not succeed too much.Maybe the problem lies in trying to build too much on the combination of two successful genres - the sole survivor story and the big space drama. The second genre was pretty successful in the previous two Academy Awards seasons (with 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar') and Scott and his producers may aim for a similar fate for 'The Martian' - the saga of an astronaut believed dead and left behind on Mars, to be rescued in an extreme action of inter-planetary dimension. We'll see if he succeeds, but on my scale he rather failed.The sign of such a film not really succeeding is when the day or the days after you remember more the technical aspects. This exactly happens to me with this film. Planting potatoes on Martian soil and sealing a space vehicle with adhesive tape has some fun of itself, but it dangerously competes with the human dimension of the story, with the fight of the lonely astronaut to overcome the elements and his own despair. Matt Damon is a fine action movies lead actor but he's no Tom Hanks (not yet, at least) and his role here may not get him even an award nomination. This techno-survival story leans too much on the technology side.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

But so much of the science that was so interesting to me was omitted, and a lot of unnecessary stuff that bored me was inserted to get butts in the seats. Not much to do for Matt Damon as Mark Watney, the stranded astronaut on Mars, so Hollywood did what it does so well, it added emotional scenes not in the book to get the heartstrings going, but not so much the brain. Some of it was too silly for credibility, from a science perspective.Great visuals and NASA-type sets though, and I enjoyed those, even as the story was very lacking for those who read the book before.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A tale of survivalist,"I have an idea of why the Martian has been so successful at the box office. It's not because it's a remarkable movie, but because of the times we live in. See, the Martian is a success story. It's a story about a man who is placed against insurmountable challenges, which he beats. It's a story of how other people are doing their best to safe the man in trouble as well, going as far as showing how other nations, which might normally have cold relations, are willing to help each other in order to safe one of us in need. Simply put, the Martian makes it easier to feel good about humanity and the state of the world, while in the real life we life in a world where we are not threatened only by political unrest, but terrorism and continuously freezing relations of modern superpowers. What I want to say is, that the Martian stands out for its own benefit from among the movies that try to be more grim and bleak.So let's tackle the basics. The Martian tells a story of how an astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left stranded on Mars after a hasty evacuation the Mars team has to make due to a storm. Believing that Mark is dead the rest of the crew blasts off, only for Mark to wake up to find that he's now the only human in Mars, with very limited means of making a contact back to NASA or his crew mates. But with some scientific ingenuity he doesn't only manage to solve his food problems, but also establish a new contact to Earth. The Martian is not a complex story. It's a kind of a take on Robinson Crusoe, but with people knowing where they can contact him, while planning his rescue.As the Martian is directed by Ridley Scott, it's also technically well made. The plot, while simple, works well under the steady direction of Scott and as usual his style looks very nice and the actors perform well. So all around it's just as steady of a movie you'd expect a director of Scott's caliber to do.So that's the Martian. It's a feel good movie and that's pretty much it. It's probably not a contender in the category of future classics, but it is a nice movie none the less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Light.,"This is a curious trend going on: each year the space movie comes out on October. Gravity in 2013, Interstellar in 2014, and this year, The Martian.This year, like in 2013, I wasn't disappointed. The Martian begins quite fast, without any cliché exposure, but directly in the action. So fast, actually, that I wondered how the movie was going to last its 140 minutes without being boring at some point. When the screening was over, I realized that I never encountered any second of boredom thanks to a great storytelling and a perfectly managed rhythm.The Martian is kind of a humble movie. The pitch is quite simple as is its development. If the movie doesn't hesitate to explain and vulgarize the science used by the main character to survive, it never slips in psychodrama nor philosophy. It is very down to earth (I mean, down on mars) and only references current knowledge. This is quite refreshing when compared to some other space movies heavily loaded with speculations and vast reflections.The cast is massive and impressive. I never thought I was going to see Sean Bean and Donald Glover (Troy from Community) in the same scene in some movie some day. Matt Damon deliver a solid performance which illustrates very well the emotional roller-coaster that its character is living.What I liked very much with The Martian is how it promotes science. Basically any character in the movie is a scientist or an engineer or an astronaut, and they're all cool, fashionable or charismatic. This is one of the few movies with Apollo 13 which really put the scientists and engineers as the heroes and science and rationality as the true way to solve problems. Even though The Martian goes a little wild with the realism at the end, the rest of the movie convinced me to forgive and even enjoy these final elements. I read that it was a liberty that the movie took with the book, and I'm glad they did so. Another good difference with the book is the lack of exposition (cf. §2). While I didn't read the book, these two known differences make me think it's a great adaptation overall.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Intense but Fun Ride,"""The Martian (2015, Ridley Scott)"" is pretty good overall, but riddled with enough flaws you want to warn people about.It is occasionally more intense than pleasurable. (For example, Matt Damon's injured astronaut performing desperate surgery on himself. We get prolonged looks at the bleeding gut.). Also, it is often a tepid music video, particularly during the schmaltzy sequence when David Bowie's ""Starman"" is heard.The propaganda elements are also all over the place. The head of NASA (played by Jeff Daniels) actually cares about whether a lone astronaut stranded on Mars lives or not. What a nice guy. Also, nearly every woman working at NASA is really hot. I also get a kick out of the plot turn where an odd, reclusive wonder kind uses a supercomputer to verify a gravity assist algorithm--and he's the only person at NASA who had thought of using what would seem to be a common maneuver.The science is interesting but dumb in crucial places. What confuses me the most is how initially it takes hours to communicate to Astronaut Matt Damon on Mars, when later that communication is instantaneous. (As evident by the Times Square euphoria.) Did Matt build a new Internet?However...the good side is The Martian shows us a doomed character using his wits to postpone his fate. There is also a lot of admirable teamwork, and resistance to authority when necessary.The acting is very good. Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain really show up. They both are larger than life; just what we expect in movie stars. (But isn't Matt Damon a bit old to be an astronaut assigned a Mars mission?) I wasn't keen on Ridley Scott's direction, but the Martian landscape is always enjoyable.If you can handle the shocks and intensity of a modern US movie, you will like this. Otherwise, avoid.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Space Pirate,"I had moderate expectations for ""The Martian"" and the film exceeded them. It wasn't a perfect movie by any means but, at least for me, it was entertaining and worth-watching. The scrip is fairly well-written and the direction is quite good too (specially in the Habitat/Mars set scenes) but what really stood out to me were the delivered performances.Starting with Matt Damon. He is an excellent actor! He was a so-so for me(I never completely saw the Bourne trilogy nor Good Will Hunting) until yesterday. I knew he had the chops but I didn't relate to him as much as I relate to other actors and actresses. He is so good playing the part of Mark Watney. You believe in him and you care for the character and you feel the sense of desperation when everything seems to go wrong. Above all, I related to him. I don't know if any other actor could pull this specific role off and I believe Damon was the perfect casting choice.Then we have Jessica Chastain. She is having a meteoric rise since 2010/2011, specially after Zero Dark Thirty. I find her to be an amazing actress, from ""Mama"" to ""The Help"" she is just superb. Whatever role she plays, we know we're in for a treat.Aside from these two we have an ensemble cast filled with A-plus performers. Jeff Daniels as NASA director turns to a more serious and darker role, Michael Peña is the film's comic relief and he does it extremely well, Chiwetel Ejiofor is as good as always, Kate Mara and Sebastian Stan, take a huge part in the movie climax and they're performances are flawless. Aksel Hennie is also quite good, washing away his performance on ""Last Knights"",Despite having less screen time is always amazing to see Kristen Wiig and Sean Bean. I was not aware Bean had a role in the film until I saw him sitting at a desk and it was a lovely surprise.The technical effects are well-achieved, at least for me, although Matt 's body near the end seems really CGI and wasn't as polished as I think it should have been. The end to me was a bit ""fairy-tally"" but I'm good with it.""The Martian"" shines due to the performances of its cast and through some breathtaking scenes in Mars (Watney's performing surgery on himself was gasp-taking). An good effort from Ridley Scott on the sci-fi genre but I don't quite know if it should be recognized as an Oscar Contender.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A little too cheesy and pathetically crowd pleasing!,"'THE MARTIAN': Four Stars (Out of Five)The sci-fi blockbuster from director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard; based on the 2011 book, by Andy Weir. It tells the story of an astronaut, that's left behind on Mars, after mistakenly being presumed dead; that desperately struggles to stay alive, while NASA tries to save him. The movie stars Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Mackenzie Davis and Donald Glover. I found the film to be very well crafted, and ultimately entertaining, but it's also just a little too cheesy, and pathetically crowd pleasing.A horrible storm, on Mars (which isn't scientifically possible), wipes out astronaut Mark Watney (Damon); and he's presumed dead by his crew. The commander of the mission, Melissa Lewis (Chastain), decides to take off, and leave the planet without Watney (assuming he's dead). We soon discover that Mark survived, but his communications equipment was destroyed. Being a botanist, Watney begins growing food, in an artificial habitat his crew created. NASA later learns of Mark's survival, and plots to rescue him.The film is technically very well made; it looks great and it comes to a thrilling conclusion. It's somewhat involving, and you do learn to care about the characters, but in a mostly gimmicky way. The constant video log scenes, that Mark films of himself, seem incredibly forced and clichéd. I never believed that any of the characters, in the film, were real people, and the entire movie has a very contrived/corny feel to it. I haven't read the book but I expect a lot more from Drew Goddard. I also expect a lot more from Ridley Scott; this is the man who brought us such science fiction classics as 'ALIEN', 'BLADE RUNNER' and 'PROMETHEUS' (all much better movies than this). 'THE MARTIAN' kind of feels like a cheesy US military propaganda film, except it's made to support NASA instead.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/NdWU81GeyN4",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Future Best Picture Winner,"First off, it gets you right into it. The movie starts off on Mars, and introduces the plot immediately. The story is good, although Screen Junkies on Movie Science were able to prove that it's not accurate. Regardless, I almost feel like they could've used a minute to set up, even though it is a 2 and a half hour movie. Matt Damon pretty much carries the film, and honestly, as good as some actors are, NOBODY could've made this as good as he did. Not Tom Hanks. Not Leonardo DiCaprio, not James Franco. Damon is so likable, and makes all of these jokes while remaining serious about what's actually going on. The rest of his crew are all very well performed as well. Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Aksel Hennie, or even Sebastian Stan - nobody is miscast! The real amazing performance was Jeff Daniels, the head of NASA. And he absolutely breaks your heart and should definitely get Oscar nominated. And while Donald Glover and Benedict Wong are all good, Chiwetel Ejiofor is phenomenal. Really impressed from a guy I've never heard of. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, and the visual effects help a lot, because I felt like I was on Mars with him. The music is very well chosen too. Loved the LOTR name drops too. My friends all tease me and tell me this is predictable, but some parts, I was actually thinking the opposite way. I said a few weeks ago that Everest should just take the Best Picture award right now, but I take that back! My money is on The Martian to take it all home!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Like Gravity, But Ridiculous","Firstly I'll say this film was a complete surprise to me. I very much expected a very serious survival film with lots of fairly blatant philosophical points to hammer home. This doesn't buck the current Sci-Fi trend of constant science discussion, there's a hell of a lot of that. Despite this the film is not dry at all, it's a very fun and easy watch. There were moments of self awareness that were very funny, and the light hearted humour throughout was much appreciated and unexpected from a Scott film.My main issue with the film is how it can't quite decide what it wants to be. Is it like Gravity, an endless sciency human battle against the elements? Or is it an entertaining, yet rather ridiculous romp? For me tonally it leans toward the latter. This is fine, but it does mean that the film runs a little long. Since I wasn't sucked into the drama, my interest waned towards the end, at the time I should be most invested. The film also feels very constructed due to endless plot conveniences.I'm being kind in giving this film a seven, but I genuinely enjoyed it, so there you go.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Speed Review,"The Martian is simply put, a phenomenal film. The story follows Matt Damon as astronaut Mark Watney, who while during a violent dust storm on a mission to Mars, gets separated from his crew on the way to their ship. They believe him to be dead and leave him on Mars as they return home to Earth. Now stranded, Watney has to find a way to survive till he can contact NASA and coordinate a return home. You might think I just spoiled the whole movie for you, but this is literally the first 5-10 minutes! Now, I wouldn't blame anyone thinking that a movie like this might be a downer, but it is not. The Martian is a movie that balances all of the intensity of the situation with humor and heart. Matt Damon's performance is comforting even when things get rough and the character personalities are all so great from every actor involved, that you care what happens. In short, The Martian is a movie about the triumph of the human spirit (I know, a cliché), and the ability of the human spirit to problem solve in order to survive.I give The Martian a 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This is what Gravity should have been,"Ridely Scott is back in his masterful elements in this movie, recalling what what made Alien and Blade runner so great, but was not great in Prometheus , and that is captivating and exciting story. How exciting do you think it would be to watch 2 hour 40 mins of a man stranded on Mars? Not very exciting. In gravity we had to watch Sandra bullock bounce around for 1 hours 20 min, which is exactly half of the Martian running time, and it is Martian which felt faster and shorter.The key is the brilliant screenplay of this movie that always keeps the story interesting. When our man(Mat Damon) gets mistaken for dead and left stranded on the red planet by his team. He must use scientific knowledge, training and acumen to survive. This is actually far closer to real science, not your Star Trek ""warp-core- manifold"" variety. He has to use whatever is at his disposal to grow his own food, produce water and to find ingenious way of calling home. To watch him come up with one ingenious idea after the other is a treat to watch and never too unrealistic, as we repeatedly learn he is good at what he does.Technically, this is a flawless production cinematography, VFX, sound, production design all work. The VFX are seamless and do not draw attention to themselves, making it look as if they really shot the movie on location -- on Mars!This is a Matt Damon vehicle all the way, supported by an competent supporting class, but their characters barely get the screen time to grow. But that is OK, because Matt Damon is so brilliant and deserves an Oscar for making his lonely stay on Mars so entertaining for the viewer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Impressive,"Movies about space seem to be the new 'dystopia' movie with its rising popularity. We had Interstellar and Gravity, and both were very heavy and intense films. So it was a nice change for The Martian to have a lighter mood while still having space complications. The humour of Watney's character complements the film nicely and helps to lift the mood of the seriousness of his situation.Damon plays his role superbly and delivers his lines perfectly. His delivery is very natural and the vlogs that he does (which ultimately speaks directly to us) is informative without being too obvious of a tell. The chemistry between him and the rest of the crew members are well formed, especially with Chastain and Pena. There was even a hint of something else going on with Chastain and Damon's characters but that might just have been too much of Hollywood's influence that made me think that. Glover does a fantastic job as a sort of 'mad scientist' of the computer generation, and there is a hint of Troy (from Community) in there too. Ejiofor too does a great job as the communication link between NASA and Watney. Pretty much all actors and actresses held their own. The inclusion of so many characters with quite equal screen time (save for Damon) shows how the people working in NASA all need to collaborate in this highly sensitive atmosphere.The visuals of Mars are impressive, and according to my friend those Mars scenes were shot in The Grand Canyon. The desolate landscape and reddish brown colour of the dirt is convincing as an alien planet and the structures and equipment used there seems quite realistic. The design of everything is great, down to the visual effects and soundtrack.I am not really concerned about the physics and mathematics of the film, and choose to believe that what happened in the film can be done. The collaboration between NASA to help Watney figure out ways to survive is also shown in a montage which was cool to watch. What was not realistic was Watney's body transformation. I realize that weight loss would have been tremendous, but there are a few shots of a very skinny body with the face hidden which was definitely not Matt Damon and that bothers me.Overall, an impressive film with an engaging story, great acting and cool visuals that will transport you away.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Apollo 13 meets Robinson Crusoe,"Set in the not so distant future, The Martian tells about one of the first manned missions to Mars and how one of the astronauts gets left behind when an enormous sandstorm forces the crew to abort the mission. The story is about him trying to survive with extremely limited resources until help can arrive. For it takes about four years to get from Earth to Mars - they have to build the spaceship from scratch and all that - yet he only has food for a few months.Matt Damon plays the lead role here and even though he has been in many good movies previously, I'd still claim that this is one of his finest yet. His range and his skill for acting out complex emotions without verbalizing them is what keeps us grounded, what keeps us with him throughout his ordeal. A nuanced, brilliant performance, deserving of the highest praise. Yet the film also has a very good supporting cast and I like that they focus on the happenings on Earth as well. NASA has rarely looked better on film than it does here.I was also pleasantly surprised how captivating the movie was, given its style and story. Much of the film is really nothing more than constant, endless problem solving, with Damon's character Mark Watney having to overcome problem after another, likewise with NASA. It's a great movie about science and for science. Studying engineering or getting a Ph.D. in something else has never looked more inviting. Yet the movie is never boring, like some of you might think based on what I just said. The emotions are always there, the atmosphere is without a flaw brilliant and the characters feel so real that they will pull you in without a doubt.If I had to name one problem with the film itself it's that you can definitely see that they had to cram a long, long novel full of detail into a single film. Because it really is nothing more than problem after another. So much so that it starts to feel a bit unrealistic. Sure, Mars is a hostile environment, but come on. Even Murphy of the famous Murphy's Law would say that this is a tad extreme.Nevertheless, it's a very good movie. It has a clear identity, excellent story, fantastic cast, good music and is at its core exactly what cinema is all about.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Let's make another astronautmovie....,"Coz' they're popular right now. Interstellar and Gravity worked, so let's make another one. Why? Well, who cares, it will sell anyway. A plot? OK, what about The Revenant on Mars. Astronaut needs to survive under terrible conditions and returns to earth? Does it need to be believable or scientifically realistic? No, not really, we'll get a star actor, let's say, Matt Damon, put in some great special effects and boom...it'll work. It's a good movie, little boring half way through. What's really annoying is the need to explain everything to the audience. Since we're dumb and it's too difficult to explain science stuff not using words. So Matt talks a lot to himself. An annoying scene was at the end as the astronaut stands in front of his class and utters some hero like corny American epilogue lines.To summarize: not very original or realistic, sometimes dull. Not really memorable, just a good, albeit not great, movie. The music is the best part.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
super overrated crap,"I just wanted to watch a sci-fi with some good action, and -who knows?- maybe something new to learn there. And I got nothing at all.In The Martian almost half of the movie is about CNN correspondents, people in Times Square cheering and partying for Mark, and meaningless NASA dialogues with Chinese Space Agency.I almost had the feeling that the most serious problem of the lost astronaut was that he couldn't update his facebook profile. And all those calculations about the days left to save him... Like anyone watching the film gives a damn about the days left before his food ends. It becomes so predictable that one way or another he will try to escape instead of waiting and starving.I cant believe the director of Aliens and Promitheus is the same with the one who did the martian.

Mars commercial?,"As a real Ridley Scott fan, I hate to say this, but the director has lost his spark and talent in recent years. In other words, do you remember ""A Ridley Scott movie"". You can't feel this anymore which is sad for fans like me. The Martian is another disappointment, so if you don't know about the fact that this film was shot by Scott before watching the film, you cannot understand until the end credits. As for the problem of the movie, the movie is not ""Cast Away on space"". I wish it was, but it is not. Why? Because there is no suspense, no mystery and no horror. The film ignores the psychological nature of the character and he doesn't face with any real challenge or trouble. Do you remember? When After Earth was released, it was mostly criticized for not being ""too dangerous"". The Martian is much worse. You cannot feel the danger, so does character! Because there is no real danger in the film. The main character behaves like John McClane at times, but he is not John McClane though. I mean a witty John McClane perfectly fits Die Hard franchise, but here it doesn't work. Most of the time, our man alone is ""happy"". And this ""happy"" mood defines the tone of the film. I would even prefer Red Planet over The Martian, because despite Red Planet was just a passable popcorn flick, it was mysterious, dark, suspenseful and interesting. The story in The Martian is not interesting, because it is not a survival type of a movie! I am a Matt Damon fan, I can watch him peeling potatoes and onion for hours, I am such a fan, but even he was dull here. The Martian is also a talky film, in fact too much talky, but the story needs more visuals than chatting, in other words more silence than words. 3D was just fine except for a few dazzling Mars images. The film reminded me the masterpiece Silent Running and I wish it would have been as great as that movie. The final chapter of the movie becomes lazy, dull and cliché unfortunately and it cannot add something fresh to the story. And do I have to say the film lacks emotion and real entertainment which is weird. Additionally, some supporting characters were supposed to be funny, but actually they are not. I can prefer even Prometheus over The Martian honestly.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Kinda been done before.,"There have been a lot of movies and TV shows about the red planet. Most of them I've enjoyed. I also like Damon. He's a good all round talent. Had me believing the story in a matter of minutes. Likewise with Ridley Scott. Always find myself engrossed in his imagined world almost immediately. You may be asking yourself if this is building up to a 'but' here?' No not really. But (haha!) whilst I really enjoyed this movie, I did think to myself that this had been done before in a round about way. I'm referring to the 1964 movie called 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars' starring TV Batman Adam West. Of course without the monkey and man/alien companion 'Friday'. News has been floating around about Scott developing screenplays for a couple of classic sci-fi books. Notably Larry Niven's 'Ringworld' and Joe Haldeman's 'The Forever War', both award winning reads and firm fan favourites. Judging by his previous efforts including 'The Martian' I'd say Scott is more than qualified to turn these fabulous classic stories into first rate movies. Especially since Scott relies a lot less on over the top special effects (think Transformers 4 Age of Extinction) and more on script and good casting/acting.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Thrilling Journey Into Deep Space,"The Martian is a thrilling journey into the deep space anchored by amazing visuals and great acting. In the recent past Ridley Scott had been struggling to make a great movie, but he went back to his basics, and churned out one of the better Sci-Fi movies not just of this year, but of the past few years. While all actors are good, this movie is the Matt Damon show, and he shines as a desperate man stranded millions of miles from home. The film will undeniably be compared to Interstellar, because the cast and some of the premise are similar, but these are two very different movies. The amazing special effects, and constant obstacles make this movie truly thrilling. The Martian is my favorite of the Space Sci-Fi movies in the recent years, more than Gravity or Interstellar.

Great movie..worth the watch,"This movie isn't full of non stop action, but its about a man stuck on mars, and his survival. I had the pleasure of reading the book before hand, and was hands down better than the movie, but the movie was fantastic nonetheless.The story takes place in the near future, and humans are able to travel to mars. One on the the missions, a dust storm hits the crew members and while trying to prep for emergency take off, Mat Damon is hit with debris, getting separated from the group. His crew members lose his vital signs, and risk all dying if they stay to look for him, so they leave, presuming he is dead. But, he isn't, and he must survive until NASA can come get him. But living on mars for years is no easy task, and he must ""science the f*#$ out it."" The movie has some very beautiful scenic shots of Mars, with the full array of stars at night, but the movie is mostly an adventure film with comedy, as Mat Damon was solve one problem after another if he is to survive. Food, water and atmosphere are all constant problems.The book had A LLLOOOTTT more problems, like every chapter there was a new problem to solves, so the movie toned it down a lot more, almost too much for me, it made it look a lot easier then it was in the book. They also missed a few big problems, and instead, focused on one big one and then several small ones that were easily solvable. In the book, it took him a lot of time to solve problems.But without comparing to the book, the movie had some gorgeous scenes, perfectly added humor, and was mostly evenly paced. Sometimes it did feel like it was going bad too quick, but thats a movie for you and i don't remember once where it felt like it was going too slow. There were obviously things i would have done differently, but overall, the movie was fantastic. The acting was A+, the comedy was A+, there was a slight uniqueness to the filming which made it enjoyable, switching between Mars, Hermines (other crew) and Earth, and it all came together with a fantastic ending.Do i give it a 10/10, no, i mean it was amazing, but perfect. A 9/10 is better, but i blame myself for reading the book, and although i think they did a great job following the main story and adding some fun stuff, i think they did make it seem too easy for Mat Damon to solve problems, and so i would have liked to see more problems arise. I gave it an 8/10, it was a good movie, probably one of the best of the year, but i gave Mad MAX 9/10, and it is no Mad Max.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A very hard film to watch. A story of a man who fought to survive!,"Sorry for the late posting of this review, but The Martian is one of this year's unexpected best films for this year. Directed by veteran director Ridley Scott, the film mixes with sci-fi, comedy and drama elements as it explores how far man could survive in space.The plot follows a manned mission to Mars, astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.Scott is back in the director's chair and in top form after his previous films (The Counselor, Prometheus and Exodus: Gods and Kings) weren't as successful and failed to grab attention and critical reviews. There are no aliens in this film, but he chooses to explore the humanistic elements that drive us to survive in the world, but in this case on an isolated planet.The casting here is stellar and all actors and actresses involved give 5 star performances, but it's Matt Damon who steals the show as the sole survivor Mark. He gives humour, emotion and will to make his character likable and the supporting talents from Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wigg, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena and more all prove to be Oscar worthy candidates in the upcoming award season.The music score is great and it's soundtrack of 70's and 80's music provides an uplifting mood for the film. Not too mention as well, the film isn't as heavy or dark as the great films Gravity and Interstellar carry but manages to juggle adventure, comedy and character development all at once and the result is really impressive. Cinematography and the locations are all beautiful and captivating and it's bound to get Oscar and various award nominations.Overall, The Martian for me is an unexpected great film that deserves the hype and attention. No faults to say but I will say it runs at an 2 and 1/2 hour running time but it goes smoothly and keeps all plot holes closed and sealed. If you have loved 127 Hours, Cast Away, Gravity and Interstellar, this is for your 'To Watch' list.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"A definitive, eye candy  success!","The Martian was a great, fun science fiction staple in Ridley Scott's career. Of all genres of films that he's tried, this one was definitely spot on where it needed to be. Visuals were great, acting was very warm, and appealing to the audience. In short, the film is about an astronaut stranded on mars with almost no way of contact top earth.Be prepared to have your mind positively blown by the visual effects in this film. This film takes the effects in Gravity, shuts them off, and tears the switch off. The setting literally looks like mars. A perfect red sky, red desolate sand, and lots and lots of red barren mountains. Zero gravity in the film is practically flawless, however Scott is really picky and choosy with Martian gravity which is about a third of earth. One aspect of gravity effects that was rather impressive was the shift from zero gravity, to earth gravity all on the same ship. Nothing like that has been done before.Scott was for the most part pretty solid on keeping the science reasonable. The facts about the martian soil were correct, the rocket science was pretty much correct, so expect to be even more amazed that a lot of what happens in the film is pretty much possible! However, the time delay for radio signals would be about a half an hour, and that was pretty much ignored in the film.The film had an all star cast. Matt Damon did a fantastic job playing an astronaut scientist who knows what he's doing, and can keep both his sanity, and his sense of humor even though he could die at any moment. A good actor knows how to make every character different than the other he played, and Matt Damon showed no trace of his previous roles, and carried out his own phenomenally. Be prepared to fall in love with Damon's performance.The plot was very linear, and was super easy to follow. The screenplay wrote enough not to make obvious exposition lines, but also made it clear to the audience what was going on. The screenwriter didn't just throw you into the dark and expected you to make sense of the universe on your own. cough* Christopher Nolan. However, he used way too many sour jabs at humor. There were so many pointless jokes and gags that made the plot seem less serious. It really takes away from the suspense.Definitely go see the film. Definitely worth seeing in theaters. Be prepared for a fun, epic joy ride from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Red Planet Drama,"Rented this movie because I heard that it was fun. I enjoyed this flick and I think that Matt Damon was perfectly cast. I found that some of the dramatic scenes were filled with tension and the lighter scenes filled with humor. This movie, to me, had all the things that ""Gravity"" should have contained. The scenes containing the rocketry were brilliantly filmed and added the necessary element that made this a complete movie. I would recommend this to a friend, and if one were to rent this I would suggest the blue ray option because this movie deserved the crisp sharp benefits that blue ray offers. I thought that Mark Damon's performance was one of his best. I don't know how much of the science this picture contains is in fact authentic, but I really did not expect it to be. What it did contain for me was good castings and great cinematography.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
What an awesome movie this was,"I'm not a critic who tries to compare the book to the movie. Just a frequent movie goer who simply decides if I enjoyed the Show. And I really enjoyed this movie more than any other movie I have seen in a long time. There were many reasons to love the show. I loved the humor included in the script. I went expecting this to be like any other sci-fi movie, but it really was much more. I loved the characters, I enjoyed the beautiful martian scenery, I enjoyed the mystery of not knowing how they would solve each challenge. I enjoyed the suspense and I found myself crying in the end. And so was most of the theater as well. IT is a movie I will watch over and over again, and make part of my DVD collection when they issue it. As pure entertainment I did not find anything I did not like about this movie.

Robinson Crusoe on Mars,"The plot of THE MARTIAN, unlike SPECTRE's, is not a closely guarded secret. We know the storyline: space botanist Matt Damon is left for dead on Mars when his fellow astronauts evacuate during a vicious storm. But Matt's not dead. Will he survive? Will they they rescue him?You kind of know the answer to these key questions, so director Ridley Scott has to work extra hard to generate suspense. Matt's survival skills are given some stringent challenges, and a lot can (and does) go wrong with the rescue mission. Damon's powerful screen presence manages to hold our interest during the Robinson Crusoe parts of the story - even better, I would say, than Tom Hanks in CASTAWAY, one of the many films that are unavoidably echoed here (GRAVITY being the most obvious).Despite all the CGI I found Ridley Scott's Mars less visually enthralling than Paul Verhoeven's in the original TOTAL RECALL; it looks like (which it is) a rose-tinted version of the Jordan valleys where LAWRENCE OF ARABIA was filmed. The space scenes are awesome and possess some of the pure magic of Kubrick's 2001. Hugely enjoyable as THE MARTIAN is, it's one of those movies that you realise afterwards reminded you of other fine movies. GLADIATOR's magnificence dims when you take note of how much it borrowed from BEN HUR. ALIEN wasn't actually all that original, but what a great movie it still is whenever you remember it! (PROMETHEUS was epic but disappointing somehow.) THE MARTIAN is a good movie, even a very good movie, but it falls short of being a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

It's pretty amazing.,"When Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit by a satellite and presumed dead on a manned Mars mission, he has to find a way to survive on the planet and signal to earth that he is alive. I'm not a scientist so I don't know how accurate everything is, but the movie itself was really good. It almost behaves like a documentary at times as their are parts where Mark talks to the camera giving the status of his situation. We also see all the drama in Washington, DC with NASA officials trying to bring Mark back home. The acting is good. Damon is really good in the role and it's really not easy to imagine anyone else in his place. The story is great. Even though for the most part we're just seeing Damon stranded on Mars, we're emotionally invested and we want to see what happens next. I highly recommend The Martian.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Pure enjoyment,"This is a remake of a sort. The year was 1964. The film was Robinson Crusoe on Mars. We didn't know much about Mars then and there was still some fantasy that the atmosphere on the Red Planet would be thick enough for water to be found.The passage of time has made it a classic of the science fiction genre. Fifty years later, we'd think a remake would be atrocious by comparison, like it was for The Day the Earth Stood Still or War of the Worlds and many other classics of the fifties. But this is not so. The Martian is magnificent in all aspects. This time around, we know what Mars really looks like. Ridley Scott has it pinned down pretty well. No standing water. A thin, unbreathable atmosphere. The sun is farther away, thus less light at least for our human eyes. Lifeless world with a bluish-grey sky or orange tint as red oxidized dust fills the atmosphere. Put in a few dust devils and lightning in the distance and you are definitely there, on Mars. The lone Martian has to survive. His crew has left him for dead after an unlikely freak dust storm has forced them to take off. Had to happen for the movie to take off, so to speak. The rest is made of ingenious solutions to survive, not to mention ample use of duct tape. Really, don't ever leave Earth without it. Everything is kind of believable until the end. Of course, so many things would have to go right for the abandoned astronaut to survive that, in most likelihood, he would not. But this is science fiction. Matt Damon puts in a great performance as astronaut Mark Watney and the rest of the cast pitches in believably. I wasn't expecting the movie to be so hilariously funny at times, but it is. The Martian never felt long to me and was enjoyable to the end. The science aspects of it was top notch and made you believe that it could be done. Kudos for the writers. This is excellent work. All in all, the best new movie I've seen in many years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
If you do not think too much while watching it was fairly entertaining.,"This is a movie that I have to say that I have a bit of a difficulty in rating. Quite honestly I was sorely tempted to remove a star, or even two stars. Why? Because it is full of Hollywood nonsense, scientific errors, it is rather predictable and it did feel a bit like a Apollo 13 rip-off. Why did I not remove those stars? Well, it is rather entertaining even if, at times, I squirmed in my seat.The movie starts of with a somewhat implausible event where a unexpected storm hits the Mars camp which forces the ground crew of the Mars mission to hurry back to the launch vehicle before it tilts over. The launch vehicle gradually tilts a degree at the time. Is it just me finding this strange? Would storms on Mars defy the usual rules of weather dynamics that they would exert a constant pressure which would cause a slow but constant tilt of a construct like that. No gusts, no change in pressure? And why would it gradually tilt at all? Once the force would be enough for the landing struts on one side to leave the ground it would pretty much tilt right away. Okay, I am being picky so lets give that a benefit of a doubt for the time being.Obviously one guy is lost during the dramatic events. This is equally obviously 100% predictable. The fact that the guy is still alive after the rest of the crew blasted off is obviously also 100% predictable but then, this you should have pretty figured out from the title of the move after all.A lot of the rest of the movie is following this guys quest for survival on Mars using the left over equipment at his disposal and the NASA crew on Earth trying to rescue him. Yes the NASA crew on Earth does discover that he is alive which, again, is pretty much predictable. Of course this gave Hollywood the opportunity to add a utterly dislikable political bureaucrat that is pretty much in the movie for one reason and one reason aloneto be dislikable. Personally I just found him tiresome. But then, Americans seems to like these kind of people given the kind of trash that we see being pushed towards the upcoming presidential electionsfrom both sides! There are a lot of good stuff in the movie. Even though it is rather predictable there are some suspense in it, there are a lot of good scenery, and even though you pretty much knows what is going to happen you do feel like cheering for the hero. Given the script I think a lot of the actors did a rather good job of their roles.If the script writers would have brought on some decent scientific advisors I would say this would have been a great movie but it was frequently goofed up with issues that was just stupid. Like digging down a nuclear reactor a few feet in the ground. What the f good was that supposed to do? And the constant use of simple plastic and duct tape to seal the environment. Yeah, right. Sure, Mars do have some atmosphere so it is not vacuum we are talking about but then in other scenes they seemed to assume almost zero atmosphere and made quite a bit use of explosive decompression effects.Okay, okay I am probably nitpicking quite a bit here but, unlike many Science Fiction movies, this one tries to give an impression of being within the realms of realism and it is just too full of classical Hollywood mishaps for my taste.As I wrote above I still think it is a movie worth watching. It has some suspense, it is well done from a photographic point of view and the actors are doing a decent job. I think 7 out of 10 stars is a fair rating but it should certainly not have more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Catch this one on the big screen,"Initial trailers did not stir my interest in Ridley Scott's latest endeavor, especially considering his string of misfires in recent years (although I did like the generally sloppy Prometheus) but the early word-of-mouth bested my lack of curiosity and got me excited. Turns out everyone was right.The Martian appropriately begins on Mars, where it spends most of its runtime. A group of astronauts are attempting to take off from the planet in the midst of a terrible storm, which knocks out Mark Watney (Matt Damon), and the crew leaves him, believing he is dead and unable to find his body in the storm. As we all know from the trailers, however, Mark Watney is alive and he intends to keep things that way. But things look pretty dismal; he is on a planet where nothing grows, has only enough supplies to last him a few months at best, and has no way to communicate with NASA or anyone else on Earth. But he does not give up hope in the face of adversity.Putting his experience in botany to use, Mark successfully begins to grow food and increases his chances of living. He also develops a system of communication using only the still camera available to him. He doesn't have many resources, but he puts each of them to the best of use. Mark Watney's early success can be chalked up to high intelligence, resourcefulness, and a little bit of luck.Such is the case with the film. Drew Goddard's script, based on the book by Andy Weir, takes every factor into consideration to make life on Mars seem plausible, albeit extremely challenging. Despite it's high level of scientific exposition, The Martian also doesn't forget to have a sense of humor. Mark Watney is the type of person NASA would want in space (unlike Sandra Bullock's character in Gravity), and he seems like the type of guy almost anyone would want to hang out with.So it comes as a surprise that Watney is unmarried, without children, leaving no real emotional connection to Earth. Yet all of the other members of the Hermes ship have family, so it begs the question; shouldn't they have written Watney to have a family, or should they have made someone else the main character? The movie only scratches the surface of loneliness, yet it's tagline is ""Help is only 140 million miles away."" The Martian might feel real in its scientific approach, its blend of humor and action, but it lacks much drama beneath the main plot.Still, The Martian's script is carried well by an excellent performance from Matt Damon, who feels fresher in this film than he has in years; he has an energy that most actors would not have been able to carry on screen. Its supporting cast is full of big-name surprises, most who perform well (Jeff Daniels is great, for example, while Donald Glover is a touch too comedic all things considered). Ridley Scott has always been a director to summon impassioned performances, but doesn't always have the right material, but the stars line up here, and it's a spectacle to behold.Other great things about the film include:  The Martian landscape; extremely picturesque and rich in color  The pacing; at 140 minutes, The Martian never feels overlong or boring, thanks to snappy editing and a tight script  The soundtrack is selective and funThings that don't work:  The CGI; the VFX looks a few years behind in design  The final action sequence; the movie loses some of its scientific credibility in the final moments  It's standard Hollywood formula and it doesn't really break the mold in any wayThe Martian might suffer a little from emotional depth and its conventional structure, but the movie is extremely entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat even if you know what to expect. It is a fun Hollywood blockbuster full in its development, and it's a great comeback for director Ridley Scott. I highly recommend catching this one on the big screen before it's gone; the screen on your laptop won't do it justice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A nice survival movie,"In The Martian we get to watch how somebody stuck in a unique situation fighting for his life with everything he has, which is mostly his intelligence. This is one of those rare science fiction movies where they tried to respect the science part. Everything was explained and seemed plausible. With a lot of luck, but still plausible. This inventive problem solving results in a satisfying watch. This is a long movie, yet it managed to stay somewhat interesting during the whole time. The plot is not that strong, most of its weight comes from the interesting nature of the situation.Acting was okay. Picture did a decent job in being immersive and delivering a world you can feel, but nothing outstanding. One of the biggest mistakes was neglecting all the philosophical questions around the mission. They barely argue about the decisions they make let alone their deeper implications which is a big deficiency given how long the movie is. The story is too busy documenting the problem solving process while forgets about the deeper questions. Same can be said about the soundtrack as about the visuals: it helps in conveying the story, but that's it...All in all, it is an enjoyable movie, but it doesn't raises to greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Good Story. Fantastic Visuals,"Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead on Mars when a deadly surprise storm comes upon the crew and they are forced to leave without Watney. However, Watney does survive the storm and must find a way to subsist and contact NASA.For some unknown reason this is billed as a comedy. This is not a comedy. There are some good lines spouted by the characters but they do not a comedy make. See? This is a drama.This is okay, a little long perhaps, but the rescue mission near the end is loaded with hopeful anticipation and tension. The visuals including the Mars landscape and inside the ships throughout are spectacular. The cinematography and photography are truly fantastic. Since Mark Watney is a Botonist he is able to feed himself by growing potatoes and he finds a way to communicate with NASA to let the world know he is alive. Everything Watney does is recorded by him for posterity. And it's also a way to keep himself occupied without going mad. His dialogues are concise and logical. The pacing is very good. We don't see Whatney having many ""down moments."" There is always hope and work to be done to survive. Matt Damon as Watney does a very good job in this survival mode and we don't get bored watching him Gerry-rig many things and sometimes making humorous comments. Kudos.Back on Earth there are plans to rescue Watney. They talk of a future Mars mission that will land the ship 3200 Kilometers away from where he currently is. This part didn't make sense to me. Why not have this Mars mission recalculated to land where he is and not so far away? Huh? Why make Watney make a 3200 kilometer trip when something bad can happen on this planet? Remember the storm that caused all this in the first place? And - by the way - we never see a storm like that again after all the time Watney spends on the planet. Was that one storm an anomaly? A one-time thing? Huh? (it's only a movie, Bob)Also, the Chinese say they will help with supplies using their new secret super rocket to give the supplies to the Hermes, the rescue ship. However, we never see this exchange between the Chinese ship and the Hermes. The cutting room floor did thisor maybe it was a given and we didn't need to see it. (ya think?)Dialogues back on Earth debating how to do the rescue are good, real and made sense.Notables: Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kate Mara, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Jeff Daniels and they all did credible jobs.Yes, this is somewhat long, but It's the fantastic visuals, Watney's survival work and dialogues and the rescue mission near the end will keep you engaged.

A stupendous film that gives a good visual representation of Andy Weir's novel.,"I, for one, am excited that space travel is now a topic regularly covered on the big screen. If the general public becomes even a little bit more interested in interplanetary travel, perhaps I can see man stand on the surface of Mars in my lifetime. The Martian (2015) is merely the latest in a string of space-themed sci-fi movies that brings the excitement of outer space to theaters. While not nearly as continually intense as Gravity (2013), or as epic as Interstellar (2014), what The Martian does right is give a sense of scale to the challenge of returning to Earth from being abandoned on Mars.Gripping and just humorous enough to keep it from being dour, director Ridely Scott uses many cinematic techniques, including several montages, to tell the story many have already read from Andy Weir's novel of the same name. While many sequences and scientific explanations were obviously cut for the sake of time, the ones that remain help maintain the ebb and flow of victory and tragedy. Like many films based on books, I saw the movie first before committing to reading the book. After now having read the source material, I can say that each version has its merits, and both are equally as spectacular. Sure, there were some elements I wish were in the film, but that's why reading the book version is great too: it has ""deleted scenes.""Matt Damon's portrayal of Mark Watney was spot on, and the rest of the cast certainly did a great job of filling in their respective roles. The pacing was great and the CGI looked incredible. Considering the current array of NASA equipment, the ships and shelters used for a Mars mission certainly seemed realistic in this film, which should help with my aforementioned desire for the general public to become interested in interplanetary travel.A stupendous film that gives a good visual representation of Andy Weir's novel, I give The Martian 5.0 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"If you solve enough problems, you get to come home","Directed by Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Blade Runner, Alien) from a screenplay by Drew Goddard (World War Z, The Cabin in the Woods) based on the best-selling novel by Andy Weir, The Martian is one of the best hard-science scifi films to hit the screen in decades. Remarkably faithful to the novel and thoroughly engaging for its entire 144 minute length, this film is definitely worth taking in. It's also worth seeing on the big screen for the cinematography - courtesy of Dariusz Wolski (Pirates of the Caribbean, Prometheus) - particularly the vast Martian landscapes (Wadi Rum in Jordan) and the later scenes that take place up in space.The film opens on Mars where we see the third manned Mars mission crew carrying out their duties. Their activities however are cut short by a sudden Martian sandstorm that shows up, a storm so severe that the mission is scrubbed and the crew must leave the planet. In the process of heading to the MAV (Mars Ascent Vehicle) though, one of the mission crew, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by a piece of flying debris and blown away from the others, the debris piercing his suit in such a way that it damages the part of the suit that gives out his biometric readings and his location. Believing Watney to be dead and his body lost, and with the storm threatening to tip the MAV over at any moment, Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) reluctantly gives the order to take off. But, as Watney later gamely says in the film, ""Surprise!"" He's not dead. Seriously banged up, but very much alive. And very determined to stay that way.That, however, is going to take a lot of doing. In his daily video log, Watney sums up his situation thusly: ""If the oxygenator breaks down, I'll suffocate. If the water reclaimer breaks down, I'll die of thirst. If the Hab beaches, I'll just kind of implode. If none of those things happen. I'll eventually run out of food and starve to death."" On top of all that, his only hope of rescue is the next Mars mission, which isn't scheduled to reach Mars for three years. And he needs to find a way to let NASA - and the rest of Earth - know that he's still alive. ""In the face of overwhelming odds,"" he concludes, ""I'm left with only one option: I'm gonna have to science the _sh*t_ out of this."" And that's what makes the rest of the movie.There are of course scenes where the action jumps to NASA on Earth as they discover first that Watney might have survived, then confirm that he is alive, and then start to figure out what they can do to get him home. And other scenes where the action jumps to the spaceship Hermes where the other members of the Ares 3 mission are making their way back to Earth, still thinking that Watney died on Mars.Aside from Scott's smooth, sure-handed direction and Goddard's nicely-paced screenplay, it's the excellent cast of actors that really make The Martian work. Some valid questions have been raised about certain casting decisions where the ethnicity of the actor doesn't match the character, but in truth the choices made don't get in the way of the how the film comes across as the actors in question were all fine actors. Jeff Daniels (The Newsroom, Gettysburg) is in fine dry form as Teddy Sanders, the Director of NASA who has to balance the life of one lone astronaut against the safety and morale of the returning Ares 3 crew, while figuring out how best to accomplish the seemingly impossible task of mounting an actual rescue and keeping Watney alive long enough for it to reach him. Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty) is quietly convincing as Commander Lewis who has to make a lot of hard choices to do what she feels is needed, and more than anyone else, to carry the weight of those decisions on her shoulders. Kristen Wiig (Bridesmaids) hits just the right tone as Annie Montrose, NASA's official spokesperson, who has to publicly keep things positive while personally knowing just how long the odds are. And Sean Bean (Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings) is suitably stubborn as Mitch Henderson, the Hermes flight director who knows his people better than anyone and knows what they'd want to be told.And of course there's Matt Damon (Invictus, Good Will Hunting) who manages the doubly difficult task of carrying fully half of the film's screen time while conveying both Watney's desperate situation and the quirky sense of humor that is a big part of what enables Watney to keep dealing with his situation without giving in to despair. This is no small thing. The humor in the book is a big part of what makes it such a good read, but reading and seeing on the big screen are two different things, and to make it work Damon has to bring out Watney's humor but keep the audience always aware of how vulnerable his situation is and never let things slip into outright comedy. I'm happy to say that Damon pulls off this delicate balance with a superb yet subtle performance, making Watney's quirky but resolute determination to survive the true heart of the film.The musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams (Shrek, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe) has just the right touch, adding to the http://www.rlsscene.com/category/movies/ feel of what's unfolding on the screen but never overpowering or distracting from it.Highly, highly recommended for anyone who likes action/adventure/scifi in general and especially for anyone who likes their scifi realistic and believable. And for anyone who remembers what it was like when the space program captivated the world with Neil Armstrong taking ""one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"" and Apollo 13's ""Houston, we've had a problem.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Perfect Movie,"After yet another viewing of The Martian, I think I can safely say it is one of the best movies ever made, hands down. Countless viewings seem to do little to make this movie feel dull, and every time I watch this masterpiece I'm just as entertained and fulfilled.One of the biggest positives about The Martian has to be it's technical achievement; it is a masterclass in story, script, cinematography, casting, direction, acting, humor, VFX. I could go on and on, but you get the point. All the metrics by which we judge movies The Martian satisfies to an expert level.The second great thing would have to be it's message; it's all too common for us human beings to be drawn to and steeping ourselves with drama and negativity, to the point of actively seeking out in every aspect of our lives. The Martian brings a heartwarming and hopefully message of us all being in this thing together, and that we can only succeed individually when we think about the collective and what good we can do for others.I cannot recommend this movie enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining space-adventure flick.,"Lost on the red planet, an astronaut begins to look for ways to survive on the surface of Mars, while on Earth, everyone tries their best to bring him back.With fantastic special effects, beautiful shots like any Ridley movie, The Martian is a film that wonders the eyes with its incredible presentation, expressing itself through tense scenes, hilarious, entertaining, moving and fantastic, showing scenarios in high quality. An entertaining movie and able to put itself as a high quality space adventure film. The solid performances of the cast present us with a tangible story, especially Matt's acting ability that never fails to give us some scenes hard to forget.An entertaining movie that manages to consume his time quickly without us thinking about it, even though it is not totally a master touch. The movie doesn't have a lot of tense scenes, well, it does, but it seems to be more like a situation where we already know what will happen, so the tension is quickly removed. The structure of the film is also somewhat fast, moving completely, and features a large cast of actors who act wonderfully, but don't have as much time on screen as we would like. Still, The Martian is a wonderful space adventure movie worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Self-sufficiency on the red planet,"During a service mission on Mars astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) finds himself separated from his crew after a fierce storm on Mars. Due to the severity of the storm the crew and personnel at NASA presume that Mark is dead. However, Watney does survive the storm (barely) and must now try to survive on Mars until he is rescued against seemingly impossible odds.Adapted from the novel by Andy Weir The Martian is another 'big' film which uses space as part of its theme and follows in the footsteps of both Gravity and Interstellar (although the Martian is set mostly on Mars as opposed to being set in space itself). I found both Gravity and Interstellar to be impossibly overrated and not particularly engaging story-wise. Therefore I was pleasantly surprised to discover that The Martian is actually a worthy entry in the science fiction genre.OK so the concept of one man surviving against the odds isn't particularly ground-breaking or original but sometimes putting a slight twist on an unoriginal idea can have the desired effect. The key thing with an unoriginal idea is that you need to make sure that the narrative is engaging and this is where The Martian does work well. We all know that Watney is forced to try to survive on his own, but it's discovering how he achieves this and what desperate measures he has to take in order to survive this seemingly impossible ordeal - as someone who hadn't read the book I had no idea what to expect.I also liked the fact that a 'tongue-in-cheek' approach was used in order to deliver the material. I remember there being one moment where one of the NASA crew says something along the lines of 'God knows what sort of hell he's enduring up there'? and then we see Watney dancing and enjoying himself in the next scene. It's the sort of thing that you can see coming a mile off, but it's still funny. Watney's generally positive approach to his ordeal prevents the film from being too depressing and actually makes the picture more enjoyable. Watney's behaviour here is also probably more believable than you may think - sometimes remaining positive in the face of adversity is what keeps people going!!! The picture is quite suspenseful and tense but perhaps not in an 'edge of your seat' way but more in a sense that you're left intrigued as to what Watney will do next? How will they rescue him? Etc. It isn't a particularly exciting film, but the story has enough flesh on it to keep it engaging and considering its generous running time it very rarely hits any lulls.The only thing that perplexed me a little about this film is the music; whilst some of it is understandable and fits quite well with the film (I think Bowie's Life On Mars played at one point), but then later in the film we had Waterloo by Abba which just seemed rather random. This isn't really a criticism, but I just thought that some of it was a bit strange.Yes you can pick holes here and there in The Martian but at the end of the day it never tries too hard and seems happy telling a relatively interesting 'one man' survival story with fairly linear delivery and for that I am eternally grateful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Robinson Crusoe on Mars,"Movie: The Martian(2015) Director: Ridley ScottLeft for dead on the red planet following a windstorm, botanist Mark Watney(Matt Damon) must hunker down for the long haul, knowing that any rescue mission is years away. Luckily, he is quite literally ""the best botanist on the planet"", and after declaring that he'll have to ""science the s**t"" out of his Robinson Crusoe situation, he discovers that it is indeed possible to grow potatoes in his own poo. This is just the first of many self-help survivalist discoveries that find Watney entertainingly facing up to the challenge of ""not dying"". Armed only with recordings of Happy Days and his captain's collection of old-school floor-fillers, this lonely guy pitches his skills against the inhospitable elements, counting the solar days (""sols"") until help arrives even as mission control fight their own battles, practical and geopolitical.The cinematography is so beautifully done that it provides the film with a fundamental documentary reality while also making a thing of great beauty. Extra attention is amply on display in all creative departments. The most fascinating thing about the film is how it leans into predictability rather than make a show of fighting it. Of all the stories you've seen about astronauts coping with the aftermath of disaster— including ""Mission to Mars"" and the visually superior and more aggressively melodramatic ""Gravity,"" which is more of a self-help parable with religious overtones—""The Martian"" is the most relaxed and funny, and maybe the warmest.This science fiction is for sophisticated audiences and, as such, a fulfilling and satisfying experience.

My new favorite Sci-fi movie!,"I first watched The Martian soon after it came out in theaters in October 2015 with some friends after classes were over for the day. I thought, ""Oh hey, it's another sci-fi movie, this will be great,"" but I had no idea what was in store. Mark Watney is stranded alone on Mars after a mission gone wrong. His methods of survival will leave viewers feeling inspired and also laughing a bit, too. From the minute the film began, it had me hooked. I felt like I was really there with the other astronauts. There were times during the movie when data about little detailed things like the oxygen level and alerts would come up inside the astronauts' helmets. It made the experience very real. I was impressed by the way this movie juxtaposed many things: from feeling big because of achievements to feeling small in the grand scheme of things, feeling like you've conquered to feeling like you've been conquered by a foreign planet, feeling like you've been left behind to feeling unbridled joy. If I could choose my career all over again, I would want to become an astronaut because of this movie. It is very powerful, amazingly designed, and reminds you that with some quick thinking, anything is possible.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Formulaic & Predictable. Intense-Intellect Movie Turned Into Half-Comedy & Young-Aged Sci-Fi Movie.,"Firstly i must say that the martian is one of my awaited-movie this year. You know, it was Ridley Scott.. One of the best sci-fi director which Hollywood had of all time. The originality he had in blade- runner and intense plot-maker in alien were really mesmerize me. I know he was something.After the martian shot the theater, well.. it's a bunch of promotion and marketing for the movie. it's like this movie gonna be exploded in the way that interstellar did. But no.. This movie too disappointing for me and only mediocre to a known-director.The shape of the movie follows all of nowadays movie formula. It's straight to first-climax at the start of the movie, then cooling down a little bit, then going back to second-climax (with some forced sentimental-scenes added), then easy-cheating solution for the ending. This formula sacrificing the performances of the actors and actresses. It changes the way how the character should behave in the movie. Well, most of the audiences even didn't realize if Chastain's performance much way better than Damon's. It's because audiences nowadays never care about the performances, they only care about visuals and easy-enjoyable story-shape, yet fast-climax, and of course some unworthy jokes.. Thats what happened to the martian.The second problem that happened to the martian, Scott add too many easy-jokes on it. Please.. This is a horribly serious and intense movie, but too much jokes where one man's life was in danger. Scott, are you serious to work this ? This movie can be a lot more.. Even when i see Damon, i don't know what to say. Well, this actor was not capable to play this role, yet the plot didn't support him either.Then the science was a total mess up.. Too much cheating to the plot. Everythings that related to space and astro-science were extremely calculated and was a life-and-death decision. It's not like i choose that way or i choose this way or i think it's better to do this idea. I don's see any psychological pressure even a little bit to Damon's Character. It's totally failed in character depth.Well.. I know that Scott trying to follows the other young directors to pull the audiences.. But please, you're a respectable and legendary director as well as we all know. Just don't use any nowadays formula and i know Scott will be scary as what he did in blade runner.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A movie I could watch over and over,"I have few movies which I'd be perfectly fine watching over and over again. One of them is Apollo 13 starring Tom Hanks, and I'm so glad I can add The Martian to the list, right next to Apollo 13.Both the book and the movie exceeded my expectations with flying colors. In the past Matt Damon wouldn't have been my first choice for the role of Mark Watney, but I have to admit he did a brilliant job. Now I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Watney as he managed to bring through every emotion of a man who realizes he's alone on a giant red planet, and nobody knows he's there.But of course the best part of the movie is the story and the book behind it. The story could've gone so many different ways, but somehow it managed to do things just right. It makes you gasp, hold your breath and - sometimes - burst into laughter when you least expect it. The brilliance lies in the humor of Watney and how he handles the situation, even when it's more or less clear he's alone and all odds are against him.This here is a story of survival at it's best.

Scott Brings Forth His Astonishing Talent,"'The Martian' is a hard film to analyse and critique. When a film is already held with reverence how can one hope to accomplish their goals? 'The Martian' was not the masterpiece I had been told to expect. Yet it is entertaining nonetheless that fails when drawn up in comparison against '2001: A Space Odyssey' and in more recent years; 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar'.Astronaut Mark Watney is having a bad day. He is stranded on Mars, help only 140 million miles away. He will have to put his survival skills to the limit as he tries to figure out how to survive on Mars and make contact with NASA so that he can eventually go home.Unfortunately, 'The Martian' is a troubled film. Its main problem is Matt Damon as Watney or rather just the character himself. In a film of this type, essentially a survival story against the backdrop of space you need a compelling and likable character to reach out and root for. Watney comes across as a snide and arrogant person, far too sure in his approach for his own good. Remember when characters used to have arcs, a la Phil in 'Groundhog Day', he changed from insufferable to a good person. The same cannot be said for Watney, which makes it increasingly hard for me to like him. I've said it a great many times and I will say it again. If the main character does not grab my attention, why should I care?Tone also remains a flaw. Should I really be laughing in a life or death situation? Would Watney be as cynical and witty if he knew for sure that he was not being observed? I doubt it.Still there's plenty of fun to be had with 'The Martian'. Especially if you are far more forgiving than I am. There are terrific performances across the board, most notably Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The production design is astounding and the sets are creative and well thought out. The cinematography is gorgeous and highlights the vast wonders of Mars and how truly alone Watney is in this savage wasteland.'The Martian' could be termed the last chapter in the unofficial space exploration trilogy that began with 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar'. 'The Martian' may not possess the tension of 'Gravity' or the wonder of 'Interstellar' but it makes up for it with sharp scientific knowledge and an interesting take on the genre. Even if it's not my favourite film from Ridley Scott, it's a hard film to dismiss and dislike at the very least.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Refreshing, unique, inspiring and highly recommended.","A 6 man crew on Mars is forced to cut all ties to their mission and attempt a quick getaway before all likelihoods of a successful takeoff are completely diminished. Leaving the audience at the edge of their seats within moments following the opening credits the crew led by Commander Lewis (Jessica Chastain) manage to get off the red planet in the nick of time, but one crewmember lighter. Marooned on Mars Mark Watney (Matt Damon) displays the epitome of perseverance and now has to figure out how to survive and make contact with anyone that could come to his aid. Will they be able to bring him home?Paced fairly slow but never with a missed beat THE MARTIAN gathers pace and flow right from ""Go"". Well-adjusted with subtle humor, momentary heartfelt banter and an upbeat soundtrack allow the mammoth 132 minutes pass by faster. Ridley Scott once again has resurfaced with a notable project since PROMETHEUS from 2012. This man certainly loves his missions into outer space and he most certainly knows his way around particulars of his Sci-fi. There is never a moment where the audience would question the reality behind his interpretations. The cinematography as always with him is on point. Ridley Scott will in your mind effectively place a man on mars! Ridley Scott isn't the only one who shot back into the spot light with THE MARTIAN. As his Jason Bourne days become a spec in the history of Hollywood Matt Damon hasn't been able to resurface for sometime, not in this magnitude. INTERSTELLAR cannot really be considered a Matt Damon breakthrough although the movie can be spoken of otherwise. With trifling parallels to Tom Hanks in THE CASTAWAY I thoroughly enjoyed watching Damon at work. He was spot on. There isn't anything that will astound the viewer in terms of playing the character, however Damon is adequate and undeniably effective. The poster to the movie makes us feel that Matt Damon is all that is to the movie. Well this isn't the case. Whilst Watney is out there fighting the good fight there is a greater ensemble of people trying to get this astronaut back home. Jeff Daniels stands out in my mind as the director of NASA. His authoritative performance is what made bringing the astronaut back home even more enthralling and I could not stop having flashbacks of Harry.Is this the best sci-fi of 2015? I think it is. Will it find a spot at the awards in February 2016? Best picture? I think not, however the visual effects are more than worthy of a nomination. While I wouldn't consider THE MARTIAN a must watch and I wouldn't dare to put it up with productions such as GLADIATOR & ALIENS (Both by Ridley Scott), it still is refreshing, unique, inspiring and highly recommended.TITLE: THE MARTIAN DIRECTED BY: RIDLEY SCOTT STARRING: MATT DAMON, JESSICA CHASTAIN, KRISTEN WIIG, SEAN BEAN, Micheal PENA & JEFF DANIELS.

Not exactly a psychological sci-fi thriller,"The good: 3D has matured to where it enhances the film instead of being the main feature of it and The Martian is a good example of just that. It does not do it as well as Gravity, but it's close. You seldom get the feeling that the 3D actually consist of 2D layers between the foreground and the background, and objects don't too often fly towards you and out of the screen, thus breaking the immersion. All in all the images are really great. The movie is packed with beautiful landscapes and some enjoyable planetary shots. Moreover, the installations and space ships are actually convincing to a certain degree and don't break the realism too much, as often happens in this genre.It's well worth the cost of a visit to the movies or (later) your time in front of a good television just for the visuals.The bad: First, what is up with the Chineese suddenly lagging 50 years behind in train technology? Sure the U.S has the upper hand when it comes to space tech, but I'm not convinced that will last till 2035. Second, victory comes too cheap in this film. Third, I really wish the script had dived into the psychological tension of the main character's solitary confinement in space a lot more. There is really only a couple of times in the plot where you wonder for a quarter of a second whether our man can take it or not. Although it would have been deeply interesting, the movie never delves into one of the yet unsolved issues of space travel, namely how humans cope with them selves and their inner demons when they are out there alone. Instead it goes for a comic relief every 10 minutes and ends up becoming a sort of MacGyver in space. It makes for great, albeit shallow entertainment, but if you are looking for a psychological science fiction thriller you need to check elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Some of this Martian stuff is better than a lot of Earth bound crap, except Star Wars.","I wasn't even going to bother watching this because I'm not the biggest fan of the genre but after watching the reference to it as a comedy in the Golden Globes I thought, why not.It's not a comedy, thankfully. Being humorous doesn't mean comedy. It's a really well done piece of work and I have to tip my hat to the casting department for the line-up. They all worked well. However, this is obviously Damon's best role, to date and I get the impression he was quite comfortable to play himself and it seems he might be OK, marooned on Mars.This is nothing like a lot of other generic types, which is why I wasn't going to watch it, originally. Instead it doesn't dwell on morbidity, which lifts the film far beyond my original preconceptions.It runs for 2hr+ but I think they got the timing just about right, whereas they could have turned this into a real yawn and I'm glad they resisted the temptation.All-in-all, a very good film and worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Boring, unemotional, but beautiful.","The Martian is another big budgeted blockbuster by Ridley Scott, who I like the call, the hit or miss director. I loved all of his classic films, and who doesn't right? I loved Prometheus, and the underrated Kingdom of Heaven, but lately, he's been a bit off. I don't think this will be the flop that Exodus was; because it is more catered to the casual moviegoer of all ages. Exodus was messy at times because it was the product of an entire group of people, rather than the single vision of Ridley Scott. I think Ridley did a fine job with this film as far as pacing goes and directing, but the writing was iffy and juvenile at times.The script was an adaptation of a highly acclaimed novel, a novel that I never read but I have a feeling that the fans of the book will be disappointed because I just never felt bad for the main protagonist. Matt Damon's fantastic performance was not enough to save the film in my opinion. I think he'll be nominated for a best actor Oscar and he deserves to be. He was absolutely hilarious too, many of his lines were clearly improvised, but never once did I feel myself rooting for him. He was a character without back-story, without family, and without something to live for. He hardly lost a single pound of weight during his ordeal and the obstacles he faced did not produce any amount of tension at all. He had a lot of tools at his disposal, and the solutions to his problems were solved easily. He came off like a vacationer at a resort rather than someone in grave peril.Most of the film was spent on NASA officials and their hypothetical solutions for the rescue mission. An entire hour was spent on the plan, and the plan B, and the plan C. As I watched, I kept saying to myself, ""Just save him already!"" The scientifically minded moviegoer will cherish these scenes, and at times, the solutions by the protagonist were clever, but there was nothing close to the wow factor of pseudo science. Natural elements, from gravity to sugar were used in creative ways, and the making of water from out of thin air was cool, but it all just felt like a science lesson. Some people might be wowed by it all, but I wasn't. What wowed me was the set design. Ridley Scott and his art directors are as good as they come. Visually speaking, this movie blows away anything seen on screen before, and that includes Interstellar, Prometheus and Gravity. The sets, props, and CGI were stunning.But all in all a disappointing film. When I spend 12 dollars on a movie, I expect one or both of two things. For one, I want to be emotionally stimulated. This movie failed to do that for me. And if the film is labeled as science fiction, then I expect a clever script, a story that makes you think. This was far from an esoteric film and it was not on par with great survival films such as Cast Away or Alive either. If this were a film that was based on a true story, it would've had a bigger impact on me. But it's just a futuristic adventure story, unoriginal, and a boring one at that.6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
poor representation of the novel,"The amount of detail left out of the movie is jarring, nothing is explained - rather they gloss over everything with 'the math checks out.'

The character development was atrocious - never going into any detail other than their position and title.Matt Damon should not have been casted as Watney as well, the joking and serious side shown in the novel didn't feel authentic in his performance. Any actor in Hollywood would have accepted this role, and Damon was the first choice? Weird.The CGI was disappointing as well, when floating in 0G they changed direction out of nowhere and could almost see the straps they were harnessed with.Overall cheesy, didn't give the same feel as the novel.

The movie should be counted as a comedy (or dramedy) or it isn't very good.,"I love this film. I love its optimism. I love its romantic view of how science-untouched and uninterested in politics!-works. I love that the film thinks people would be interested in space travel. I love the film's technical aspects creating a believable series of engineering feats that even look good to the eye. But I love the film as a light piece of scientific romance. It is not an intense exploration of the issues. It is not a drama.The film sort of infamously won the best picture-comedy at the Golden Globes. I saw it after that happened and I was really surprised anyone had the problem with the classification. The film is extremely funny. It has running gags. It has puns. It has multiply asides that are only in the film because they are funny. Most of the actors have comedic backgrounds. But most of all the central plot largely exists to hang wonderment and scientific romance on.Watney's death was only ever theoretical in the film. It was never a real possibility. The film repeatedly undermines the central tension with jokes. I think the film does this to focus the viewer on the engineering/science issues. The plot is faintly a little absurd in how the developments happen. Watney experiences all manners of set backs but, critically, they never ever seem more than he can handle; they are solved in fun ways. There's even a duck tape joke. This is a wonderful structure for a movie having fun with the engineering and the speculation of how a mars mission would work. Even in the film's darkest moments are tempered with optimism. Even as Watney fears his death and he is still at peace with it because he loves what he does. This tone works and the film is lovely as a result. But if you say the film is a drama it is too detached from Watney's possible death to work. The tension is never on if Watney will survive. It is on *how* Watney will survive and that makes it a scientific romance, not a drama.Damon is wonderful in this film. Indeed this is such a well put together and everything works so well that it is a personal favorite of mine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

After reading the book it was nice to see that almost everything depicted in my mind from the narration was brought to life on the screen. Andy Weir did a fantastic job and he put forth the extra effort to make it close to scientifically accurate. He has said himself that when writing it he would review his work and decide if Neil DeGrasse Tyson would approve, and then modify it accordingly.

Wrong approach to the book,"I have read (and loved) the book, and I am not distancing myself from that in this review.There's many ways to adapt material, and in a sense, The Martian is very faithful to the book it is based on. Obviously you can not fit an entire book into a movie, so you would have to skip parts of the plot, etc.. The book the movie is based on is in large parts the astronaut's first hand account of what is going on, the logs he writes. The movies have him making video accounts of the same, so we can hear the character say the lines instead of writing them. All of this makes sense.What I disagree with, was what the movie decided to put its main focus on. It has picked a couple of moments from the book and spent quite a lot of time on them, and fast forwarded through the rest. This has the effect of making Watney's stay ""easier"" then it is in the book. To me, the book was at its most interesting when Watney was coming up with great solutions, and explaining how he did so. The movie has some of this, but skips most of explanations, choosing to rather ""show than tell"" (which you'd think be a good thing).That said, I thought they picked great actors to play all of the roles, and all in all I appreciate how close to the book the movie was with what it decided to have on screen. I wish the movie all the best, but would really have preferred if it was done differently. I don't know how, but for this movie I would not have minded an almost continuous voice-over. Or at least for the movie to be longer. Or maybe replace most of the parts without Watney in them, having rather the ongoings on earth being related through other means. I don't know what would work the best, but the direction they went for was a big disappointment to me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Techie, Sciencie, and Moving","It's the mark of a good movie when it can grip you and hold your undivided attention without the use of high dollar special effects and other gimmicks. Not that ""The Martian"" was a small budget movie, but it's captivation wasn't dependent upon that. As long of a run time ""The Martian"" had, I didn't notice until it was wrapping up and I saw that two hours had lapsed.Much like ""Cast Away"" had to be held up by Tom Hanks, ""The Martian"" needed Matt Damon to be good. Matt Damon more than held his own as the stranded botanist Mark Watney.The acting was great and so was the story.

A fun and thrilling movie that perfectly shows the ideal engineering mindset.( UK B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10,"The best part of the movie is that it starts out on Mars. It doesn't fully-dally around on earth to start the movie like Interstellar did(which I also love). The film is hilarious, scientifically accurate(mostly), intense, thrilling. This movie had it all.

Just a one bad point.,"It is an excellent film, 100% recommended.He noted for its cast, their performances and landscapes both land and the universe and the other planets. I like the scientific approach that has the movie. Perhaps the only negative point is that it has a credible time-line for a moment another passes a very long period of time without impact on history or characters. In my opinion the soundtrack is not adequate, the songs do not reflect the feeling of the scene they represent. Another advantage is that it is a movie for the whole family.En is not the best movie I've seen, but it has a good rhythm, which makes not lose interest in it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding adventure,"I had checked concerning the major plot. It roundly grabbed my attention. I had watched this movie in the cinema. It was really fascinating. It has eye-catching visual effects, intelligible theme and a long journey. The epitome of other space movies. Especially, having an stupendous atmosphere in the planet as well as the fiction. Matt Damon was a thespain who would undertake this role perfectly, resuming the battle of surviving in the mars after the accident despite loneliness. It was an extraordinary experience for him.
Ridley Scott knows how to convert the story of a book into a movie and affect the people positively. One of the most favorite genres of Ridley Scott with his perseverences. He almost gives a favorable impression to the mind of the cinemagoers. I recommend all science-fiction fans to watch this with a great joy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Too scripted, hollow and cliché","Damon's portrayal of a stranded astronaut on Mars is let down by a mediocre script, terrible physics and implausible events.His character expresses little emotion through out the film. Everything is done very nonchalantly with a mild sense of confidence. It's like he's on Xanax the entire time.Nothing really remarkable happens. The film poorly attempts to add plot twists -- monkey wrenches being thrown into survival plans. They come off very scripted and implausible. If you're a rational person, the film has plenty of ""Oh, give me a break!"" and ""Yeah right!"" moments.All the characters are so scripted and cliché it's hard to look past. You have the character that wants to do everything by the book. The one that wants to do nothing by the book. The bureaucrat made to look like the bad guy for caring about public image. The bureaucrat made to look like the good guy for willing to sacrifice public image. The old scientist who can't think past his old ways. The cool young trendy scientist who has fresh, genius ideas. The romantic astronaut who seems to have a thing for the main character. The astronaut who talks way too much and of course is the ""tech"" support of the crew.Overall the film just seemed too cliché, too scripted and too hollow to really appreciate.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A hyped movie.. but good to watch once!,"I was set a huge expectation by my friends before going for the movie based on the reviews and critics.. But actually, the movie story line is fantastic,as obviously it is based on a novel! The first half hour and the last half hour keeps the viewer engaged.. the screenplay lacks momentum in between and they would skip a huge time frame of around seven months in the story just through a frame change.. which was not expected!But the science and maths used by Mark increases the curiosity to understand the space travel and even some of our daily living problems in earth! Sometimes, they speak too technical that the whole theater was silent.. probably none understood the technical terms and the jargon they used!

McGyver-Cruso on Mars,"OK  so much has been written both good & not so good about this film here and at other movie review sites. Considering myself a seasoned sci-fi fan, maybe it's just my advancing years but, Ridley Scott and company, what were you thinking? When is somebody going to give Mars a truly grandiose sci-fi treatment? How would Kubrick have handled this subject? So much of the suspense and pacing of the book is totally missing from this movie. Even at over two hours the events of the film just doesn't connote the passage of months. Further, it all seems just a little too glib. Our hero doesn't ever seem to be in any peril at all as long as he can ""science the sheet out of this"" he'll get by just fine. Red Green fans will love the somewhat comic use of NASA's super duct tape too. Even if you haven't read the book, in this typically ""Hollywood"" film, we know right from the first frame that our wisecracking group of explorers will never be in any real jeopardy. Even the premise of the entire movie is totally false. Wind speeds on Mars can be high but the atmosphere is so tenuous that it exerts a negligible force. The sand storm depiction is just plain wrong. Yes I know - suspension of belief - even Andrew Weir makes this concession in You Tube presentation. It's yet another totally forgettable sci-fi film about Mars. Chris in Winnipeg Canada, Oct 2015.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Makes Science Interesting,"Absolutely 10 out of 10. Not only a real feel good movie but appreciate the great lengths the makers went to keep it as scientifically accurate as they could. Fair enough, artistic licenses had to be taken into account, but without using it, you couldn't have developed a story fitting for the cinema format. Added to that, great characters, brilliant cast, kept a story alive and interesting throughout a potentially off putting subject of science. A great effort at interjecting real science into drama. Not an easy subject to tackle considering so much of it is still unknown. And interestingly, a story developed by a blogger on the urging of fans.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great spatial entertaining,"I hesitated long time to buy this DVD. The science fiction movies of nowadays are for almost part done without any great intelligence anymore. But here I was for once completely wrong. The Martian is a very entertaining and clever movie with real elements. I couldn't imagine that this story kept my attention and my wife during all the running time of two hours and a half. Every sequence is well studied in each detail and there were many plots and twists. Matt Damon was magic in his astronaut role and Ridley Scott proofed that he can create other successful films. Finally, I think the most important success key was the delivery of this respectable adaption on other material and a perfectly written screenplay. A rare 8/10 for this must see. Watch it and surprise yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Engaging and fun.,"The Martian seemed like a touch and go movie and it took me a while to check it out, but I was very glad to finally watch it. It was well worth watching The Martian which held my interest from start to finish.The Martian wastes no time kicking off with the Ares III navigating their way on Mars for a mission. The crew members include botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon), mission commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain, Rick Marinez (Michael Pena), Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Dr. Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan) and Dr. Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie). Watney is forced to be left behind after his fellow crew members on Ares III believe that he has been killed in a freak accident on Mars during a sudden dust storm in which they make the decision to evacuate. Later, Watney is found to have survived but his suit's bio monitor has been severely damaged and a piece of antenna has been lodged into his torso. Watney must draw on his knowledge of botany and his own ingenuity to survive on Mars by cultivating food supplies and maintaining his own health, as well as finding a way to communicate back to NASA that he is indeed still alive. Meanwhile back home, NASA administrator Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), mission director Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and flight director Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) must plan a rescue mission to have Mark Watney brought back home.The Martian was an excellent movie from start to finish and Matt Damon proves he still has the right stuff along with the rest of the all star cast. Director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Gladiator) still proves that he is still a great director.The Martian is an engaging and fun movie from start to finish, and I had a great time watching it.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Insanely entertaining,"The Martian directed by Ridley Scott is a Sci-Fi film following a rescue mission to Mars after one man is stranded on the planet... and this movie is GREAT. Within cinema one thing is for sure, when Ridley makes a great film it's monumental. The Martian is one of my all time favourites. The shots and cinematography on Mars are truly out of this world... The editing, score and integration of CGI is outstanding. This film is put together beautifully. Although The Martian isn't just exceptional on the technical side, it's also insanely entertaining. And that is thanks to the excellent script and line delivery by Matt Damon. This is his best performance in years. He's everything from witty to emotionally fragile, which forms such a complex and compelling character. The Martian has a perfect balance of distress and great humour. I love the integration of music by David Bowie and ABBA. It really helps lift up the spirit. The large cast doesn't weigh down the film at all, as they all add something more to the story. I can honestly watch The Martian countless times and never get bored. This is an outstanding film so therefore I give it a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The best space expedition in years,"Relatively unimpressive works like Prometheus (2012) and Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014) have put 77-year-old Ridley Scott's directorial prowess under scrutiny as of late. The Martian is Scott's response to these sentiments. With a level of humanity that Gravity (2013) could only dream of and a precision that Interstellar (2014) never achieved, The Martian is definitively the best space mission I've been on in years.Based on the book by Andy Weir, The Martian follows the Ares III mission to Mars. Due to an intense sandstorm, the Ares team is forced to abort their mission and flee the planet's surface. During their departure, botanist Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) is struck by debris and lost by his crew. Presumed dead, the team cuts their losses and sets out for Earth, only to find out later that Watney has survived and is awaiting rescue.Much like Scott's sci-fi classic Alien (1979), The Martian features an enormous ensemble cast full of some of the most talented actors in today's market. This is the first of many reasons why this film works on such a deep level. No aspect of the narrative feels peripheral because each character is fully fleshed out and critical to the story's structure. Every person is given purpose and dignity, which deeply enhances the film's connection with the audience.This is primarily because Drew Goddard's script, and subsequently Weir's novel, is written with such charisma and wit that it's near impossible not to become profoundly attached to the characters, namely Watney. His sense of humor, which is so well developed that the theater I found myself in erupted with laughter on several occasions after some snarky insight or sardonic remark about his situation, keeps the entire movie afloat. Watney remains simultaneously very conversational and intimate throughout and is definitely the most likable protagonist this year has seen thus far. This allows for all his hardships to connect with the audience that much more. After watching this man's incredible ability to remain calm through such an ordeal, seeing him break down becomes almost too much to bear.It's this profound humanity that makes the story so interesting. The Martian is nearly a two-and-a-half hour movie, but not once did I find myself checking the time. I could've watched Watney wander around Mars forever, observing as he sarcastically mutters to himself about the absurdity of his situation while simultaneously performing miracles of science not thought possible. After leaving the theater, I found it difficult to come to terms with the fact that I had just watched a work of fiction, not an actual biopic, precisely because Watney is so well rendered. He's a living, breathing human being, just like the rest of us.The film's supreme sense of realism is spearheaded by the way it so logically and casually implements the science of its fiction, a skill that won't be found in most other films of this nature. For example, I have little to no idea what was actually happening in Interstellar, and for those of you who haven't seen it, I can almost guarantee the same confusion awaits you unless you're a quantum physicist. I'm certainly not a scientist, and chances are you aren't either, so when a film presents concepts that are unfathomable to the average citizen, few people benefit.The Martian avoids this problem altogether for two reasons: the first is the fact that the entire film is based in science that transcends theory. Much of what is seen on- screen is accurate to where we stand today. The narrative of the film is supposed to take place in the very near future, so most of the technology seen is either already in existence or just a few years away – something that Interstellar most certainly cannot lay claim to.The second reason why The Martian remains so accessible to the scientifically illiterate is that Watney explains everything he's doing in detail as he does it, getting into the nitty-gritty of every process he undertakes and every feat he achieves. For him, he's just talking to himself while documenting his experience, but for us, he's giving a clear, understandable account of how one could possibly survive on Mars while not being in any way prepared to do so. This didacticism keeps the film wholly engaging and credible throughout.But the film's narrative isn't great just because it's so fascinating and thorough – its also incredibly well structured and paced. I wasn't sold on Gravity because of its relentlessness. Every possible thing that could've gone wrong did go wrong, and after a while that has a numbing effect. I can't be completely invested in a character's struggle if A. I don't know them very well and B. the level of danger they're in is so constant and explosive that it borders on absurdity.The Martian understands this. It doesn't test the limits of its characters by throwing everything and the kitchen sink at them. Instead, it provides only intermittent crises. It allows for the audience to become invested in the improbable success of Watney and then tests both him and the audience at just the right moment. This allows for bursts of intensity and subsequent release that establish the emotional intelligence of the whole film.That being said, it's still early in the year and Oscar season has only just begun, but for now, The Martian is the best movie of 2015. Ridley Scott has been the king of science fiction for several decades, and it doesn't look like he's going anywhere anytime soon.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Who made the decision to ""jazz it up""?","It is clear that someone grabbed control of the script. Some producer who made the decision not to go with a slightly jazzier Apollo 13 and allow this film to be halfway believable.I was ready to give this a solid 8 or 9 stars. Despite the usual needless Hollywood visual embellishments, I was hanging in there, liking the way they were resisting making this film just another special effects exercise. But they couldn't do it, so right in the middle of the film they seem to invent ""Rich Parnell"". Young kid who comes up with hare-brained maneuver, and somehow gets into the office of the NASA director to make a stupid unrealistic demonstration that no one would put up with even from a legendary mathematician, much less a grunt astrophysicist no one knows. A maneuver that is totally unbelievable because it is preposterous.After that point, they continued to stretch our credulity until it broke. There were innumerable cases, but the final straw was when they had to honor political correctness and send a wisp of an woman, who had not trained for the maneuver, out on EVA when it would have been clear they needed the strongest man they could find. It's like Hollywood films have the equivalent of a Communist political officer -- ""The party wants it this way!""This kind of crap must sell, but it is sad. I would hope that the people who make this will realize they have relegated their movie to the scrap heap of history. ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"" is a classic because they didn't overreach. Likewise ""Apollo 13"". Those are films a director could be proud of. Instead, Ridley Scott will be remembered for laying a turd on the cinematic landscape.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One man on entire planet and his will to survive..,"This science fiction movie seems to be same like intersellar and Gravity but its not.

He is an astronaut but a hell of botanist as well because definitely he just grew potatoes on a planet where it seems impossible to grow anything at all. The movie seems kind of same like gravity but that's one aspect of this film what we haven't seen is, his will to survive. He decides to live and fights for it.

Watching documentary footage of real people both in NASA and among the public becoming tearful at the successful landing of Apollo 13, just made me so aware that the scenes of the public anxiously waiting for Mark Watney to be rescued weren't real. It took a number of viewings for me to finally develop that suspension of disbelief to enjoy the ending. But every time I've watched it I like it more and more.

"""In your face, Neil Armstrong!"" — The Martian.","If it's the goal of great science fiction to boldly go where no man has gone before, Sir Ridley's ""The Martian"" might be a rare trodden turf, and typically Skeptical of science fiction movies dealing with space travel, yet.While it's no ""Interstellar,"" spinning off from Andy Weir's everyone-was-reading-it-on-the-bus bestseller, as much as it is a Robinson-Crusoe-in-space, it's a jet-black comedy about laughing in the face of mortality.This well-crafted film intricately embedded thought-provoking science, real controversial decisions pertaining to space, and futuristic science applications humans have yet to develop.""Mission Control"" monitoring, in the movie, the large TV screens plastered in every angle accurately captured the darkness, timing and adrenaline involved in finding a solution within a 3-5 minute span before potential explosions were to cause deaths.""You do the math. You solve a problem. Then you solve the next. Then you can come home."" Running a mathematical analysis for 560 Sols straight, all by and for a nozzle botanist to stay alive simply on, hey Potatoes! - it takes a skilled team to find real-time solutions.There's a fictitious scene served to brilliantly re-ignite a real concern echoed in the Space community about launch safety. Rocket launches are risky, and successful rocket science is about proper certifications being met. In the movie, the NASA director orders that the return flight's thrust and weight certifications be skipped in order to save time in returning to Mars. His decision led to excessive vibrations and bending moments within the launch, which exploded the rocket into pieces mid-air. This scenario is real. That's almost bloody accurate!Chaos Theory is used for more than space travel. It predicts new technology, new weather systems, and even explains how the human brain's neurons fire together in Neuro-plasticity. Though in travel, humans have never been on a spacecraft that has flown to Mars partly because the ""gravitational assist"" effects on the human body are not fully understood yet.Don't forget it's been four decades since Sir Ridley Scott first made space travel so uniquely terrifying with ""Alien;"" here, he and Damon fill the film with fresh, deadpan pleasures, storm that kick- starts the narrative, what lingers are the crew's panicked faces, helmets aglow like Chinese lanterns.There is not always much adrenal drama: the default mode is problem- solving. But put The Martian next to its peers and it shines. In particular, between its last-man-standing plot and the presence of both Damon and Jessica Chastain, the overlaps with Christopher Nolan's Interstellar are downright curious. And The Martian is nimble everywhere Nolan's film galumphed; it's a movie in which the greatness of the human spirit meets the wonder of gaffer tape. Furthermore, this must be a new frontier to explore, if ""The Martian"" is put in contrast to Britain's spectacular cinema landmarks: ""Moon"" to ""Gravity"" to ""Interstellar"" it'll look like a 70's disco classic remix album: While it is a great science fiction film that intricately embeds thought-provoking science applications humans have yet to develop, you'd hardly call it a Scott 'Masterpiece' stretching itself, or the boundaries of where an effects blockbuster can take us. It's less a space odyssey than this genre's equivalent of a high-climbing log flume that's also very enjoyable to watch.""They say that once you grow crops somewhere, you officially Colonised it.

11/10 unironically and wholeheartedly,"I could not name a single thing that could be improved in this movie without sacrificing some of its realism and unique feeling.It is not typical hollywood. The ""countdown stops at 0:01"" feeling is missing from the movie. Which is apparently what a lot of people miss, because scifi is aliens and lasers and action.But this is how things actually usually are and it gives the actions of the characters and challenges faced by them paradoxically *more* weight through this.This is an extremely brave decision which alone sets this movie into a class of its own.It is deceptively light. It is a positive, realistic, and respectful portrayal of the future, instead of a romp through some adventure, while at the same time being relevant in the present and embracing the past.It manages to appeal to the human desire for exploration and togetherness without being emotionally manipulative. Kindof how a planet loved and cheered for the mars exploration rovers as if they were actual beings of their own. Because the capacity and desire of humans for connection and discovery is limitless. This movie speaks perfectly to that part in all of us.It is also a veritable nerd's delight without ever being embarrassing and feeling ""wink wink, nudge nudge""-y.The acting was so on point that it retroactively erased all of Matt Damons other roles from memory, and all future performances will be measured to this one.The characters were real. Not action/sci fi heroes, but regular nerds and people.This movie also adds something to the real world by it existing. It portrays exploration realistically, but still in a positive light, appealing to the human craving for it, and maybe reawakening that in some. At the same time it teaches that difficulties are not overcome as most movies would have you believe, by just a couple of people trying really hard for a couple of hours and possibly fighting it out. Difficulties are overcome by enduring through difficult times, taking advice from other people, and keeping hope. Physical fortitude, book smarts, coolness and on your feet thinking, friends you can rely on, emotional strength, and burning passion, desire, and trying hard are all things that work together to get one through the night. Alone they are not enough, but some can be missing from people at times, without it impacting the results.But we as humans overcome the difficulties. Because in the end it is worth it. For the future of us individually and all of us collectively.No other movie does as good a job as this one of conveying this.All while i fail to find anything that when changed could make this movie better.And while it is appealing in all its details, characters, designs, references, robots, music and action.Truly in a class of its own, and compared to others definitely up at the top with the best of them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Cast Away in space,I went to see this movie in theatre's on release day completely by accident I actually went to see a different movie but missed the start time so just picked this movie simply because there was a line for it and I thought must be good if people are lining up for it and by the final act of the movie I was on the edge of my seat heart pounding at how things were gunna turn out and I left the theatre in aww of this movie completely forgetting that I came to see a completely different movie.The story follows astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) who is accidently left behind on the planet Mars by his crew mates who think he died during an accident caused by a sandstorm that forced them to abort there mission and evacuate the planet but after they have left the planet and began there long journey back to earth Mark Wakes up in the aftermath the strom left behind barely alive he takes shelter in the temporary base used for the crews brief time on the planet now alone with little food water and supplies and no way to get home he begins working on a way to survive till the next scheduled Mars mission in four years time.The film is expertly shot by director Ridley Scott who is most well known for making the epic space horror movie Alien in 1979 the cast is perfect and Matt Damon gives one of his best performances to date.I recommend this movie to any Science Fiction fan and fans of intense thrillers and survival story's you will not be let down by this movies stunning cinematography suspence and story.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The Martian: a Spielbergian take on space,"Greetings from the galaxy, where we get yet another semi-realistic, big-budget space exploration movie from an A-list director - following the very good and very successful Interstellar (2014) and Gravity (2013). So - how does The Martian fit in? There is a bit of overlap, but overall, Ridley Scott has succeeded in adding a completely different perspective.Where Gravity and Interstellar felt like big leaps forward in movie-making, The Martian does not. It is the least ambitious of the three, lacking a deep philosophical undercurrent or breakthrough visual effects that made the other two so compelling. This is not necessarily a bad thing, however. The Martian features - by far - the most well-developed cast, acting performances and characters, and comes with an unexpected, almost Spielbergian sense of pace and storytelling. The movie and its leads are upbeat, resourceful and have a lightness that prevails in the most trying of times. It is, far more than the others, a people movie, and a popcorn movie at that. It's up to you if you like that, and can stretch your suspension of disbelief accordingly.Without giving away any plot details - let's say that, in the end, like its two blockbuster predecessors, The Martian is about survival in the face of overwhelming odds. But while Interstellar focuses on the abyss faced by an entire race, and Gravity on the depths faced by one person, The Martian shows us the joy of survival through old-fashioned team spirit. In that sense, it is a very American movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Sci-Fi I really enjoyed,"I was completely amazed by this movie! I don't usually like Sci-Fi movies or TV series, but I really enjoyed this one, I guess that there are some exceptions... Probably it was because not everything in the film is placed in Mars, they come back constantly to Earth, so having that change was nice; it was half the Sci-Fi part and half the realistic part. Matt Damon's performance was really good, he expressed many feelings: happiness, loneliness, nervousness, excitement.His character went to a lot and he expressed it just perfectly. Scott Ridley did an incredible job, I'm speechless. Was absolutely magnificent. I loved the screenplay, actually most of the performances called a lot my attention. The production was just enough, it wasn't an extravagant weird thing. Everything seemed so real for me (possibly why I don't like much Sci-Fi is because is so unrealistic to me, and I like things that can be real) but what Mr. Ridley did to this movie was so fantastic, is really awesome.

Woth watching..honest review,"This is till now one of the best movies I've ever watched, although its 2h 20min length, it is a must to watch, it gives you a two hour of thrill and excitement, i advise everyone to watch it, this deserves way more than just 8.1, i understand other point of view that it may be like other older movies which may make it predictable, but the fact that you watch the whole two hours and u still need more is amazing, I've never experienced anything like this in any earlier movies, even with the best of them. Without spoilers I can only tell you this, this is an amazing and huge production that takes place in more than one situation and environment it may seem predictable but its not, they did a great job in keeping the trill going through the whole movie. I can add this too, the actors did an amazing job, they made us all feel the situation, plus there is a big variety of actors and a big number, which make it ever better. Now comes the bad stuff the movie may be a little overflowed by conflicts I'd licked them to focus on one and give it more time, but sometimes this is a good thing, and i think they should have backed it up with some more science.. Other than that I think this is an amazing movie, in fact one of the best, will definitely recommend did, and finally i leave the rest to you, watch it and you'll know...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

One hell of a thrill ride.,"The Martian is a visually spectacular adaptation of a science fiction novel with a thoroughly riveting narrative. It is packed with incredibly tense moments, thrilling action sequences and a lead performance from Matt Damon that is right out of the top drawer.Ridley Scott uses all of his directorial prowess to squeeze the juice out of every second of Drew Goddard's excellent screenplay. The technical and scientific elements are both authentic and mind-blowing in equal measure. I cannot vouch for the plausibility of the science behind parts of the story, but I have read several accounts that state it is sound and contains admirable attention to detail.Damon's committed and convincing performance reminds me of Tom Hanks' in Cast Away, capturing the same level of intensity and eccentricity symptomatic of such an isolating and dire situation. His pragmatic approach and resourcefulness in the face of unimaginable adversity really captured my interest and investment in his survival.Watney's endurance is so contagious and when the gilt-edged moment finally arrives where his crew attempt to rescue him, I was seriously rooting for him! Damon really hooks you in and takes you on the perilous journey with him.The rescue scene is a truly magnificent and suspenseful sequence of action that took my breath away. I was literally on the edge of my seat. It looked and felt far more real than it had the right to, and is an example of special effects of the highest order. Yes the whole thing felt a little unlikely but that didn't detract from my enjoyment of it.What I feel took this great picture from a 9 to a 10 out of 10 was the humour that was deftly incorporated throughout. And despite the difficulties and despairing scenario faced by Watney, it never felt misplaced at any point and needed those light moments to offset the dark.Damon delivers the laughs with real aplomb. I don't think that justified its inclusion in the comedy category at the Golden Globes, as it's quite clearly a science fiction thriller, but it was surprisingly funny.In conclusion, I found the movie impossible to fault. It's beautiful to look at, smart, imaginative, entertaining, exciting, moving and very funny, which makes for a thoroughly engrossing and memorable cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
that boy's alive.  and we're gonna get him the hell out of there,"This movie is about three brothers sent to Mars. Two die, and one, James Francis Ryan, is left stranded. NASA doesn't want to have to tell the mother it lost all three of her sons so it plans a dangerous rescue mission to save Ryan and bring him home. Well not exactly.The actor and premise may bring back memories of a certain Spielberg film but this movie is actually more like a combination of Cast Away and Apollo 13. (Others have mentioned this.) Throw in a bit of Gravity, Mission To Mars, and Interstellar you have The Martian.Does the feeling of familiarity make this movie bad? In this case, definitely not. Fortunately the Mars setting provides enough new elements to make this film interesting. The science is believable and, according to real scientists, fairly accurate. Matt Damon brings his usual likable, everyman charm.Thinking of films about Mars released over the past couple decades like Mission To Mars, Red Planet, Ghost of Mars, and Mars Needs Moms, this movie is easily the best movie about Mars since Paul Verhoeven's Total Recall. Still, I can't shake the feeling that Ridley Scott must've watched Matt Damon's part in Interstellar and thought to himself, ""Gee, I could turn this into a 2-hour movie"" and did. But whatever the inspiration, this film was well done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Do rewatch this,This movie was a hit in 2015 but many seem to have forgotten about it. This movie should definitely not be forgotten about. It is Matt Damon's best movie in my opinion. The humor brought to us through the writing is hilarious and it is delivered perfectly by people like Matt and Donald Glover. The concept is both sciencey and interesting to your average watcher. It is a compelling story filled with trials to overcome. With an amazing soundtrack this really is a 10/10.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Was expecting more....,"I was expecting more from this movie. It was directed by the famous Ridley Scott but he was not able to give what we were expecting. It's so frustrating when so many people like and praise a movie that really doesn't deserve it.There are so many non-sensical depictions of the physics of space travel. The script seems written more by market researchers than a screenwriter. The pacing is not good. Film slows down at many points and is unnessarily stretched. It could have been shorter, it didn't deserve 2hr 30min runtime. Matt Demon's performance and special effects were good. Only, these two things were good in the whole movie.Overall, I am not saying that it is a bad movie but it had a lot of potential and could have been made better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A nice light comedy,"Let me start with: this is not Gravity. Although comparable (basically one actor carries the movie, trying to survive), Gravity is much better. This one is just OK. Not better or worse than that. Matt Damon is excellent as usual (as well as Chivetel Eijofor) but there is no obvious signature for Mr. Scott here (dark atmosphere, long shots and so on). It seems he was again just doing his job with not so much personal involvement. There are also some purely scientific flaws (too much light during the ""day"", for starters), but this is a movie, right? Anything passes. What this movie obviously lacks is both story and character development. Although predictable, everything happens too quickly leaving almost no space for ""digestion"" or ""surprises"" or explanations. It should probably last more than three hours or so. And it still would be fun to watch. Go for it, but don't ask yourself too many questions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Meh, but mostly annoying because of the lame female roles","Watched this on a plane, had heard great things about it and figured it would be an entertaining 2.5 hours on my flight. It was okay, but i'm not sure where all the hype is coming from. Matt Damon puts in a good but not great performance. And the plot is pretty predictable without any particularly exciting moments. The whole time i just was thinking ""meh"".But the movie did manage to consistently annoy me with its subtle misogyny. How? First, the basic premise of a man getting trapped on a planet and quickly figuring out his way to survive, all the while narrating his amazing accomplishments to the audience. All Matt Damon does is narrate his smartness. It is basically 2 hours of Matt Damon mansplaining Mars. Annoying because this movie would literally never be made with a female lead because the world could not fathom a woman lecturing the audience that long. Second annoyance was that, with the exception of Kate Mara, there was not a woman in this movie who said a line without looking at a male character for reassurance or confirmation that she was making the right decision. I didn't notice it for the first 30 minutes, and then once i noticed it, it became like a drinking game. Kristin Wiig, Jessica Chastain, the blond woman who works at NASA. Seriously, they don't do a single thing in this movie except look at the men to see what they think. Other than a handful of exceptions, the men in the movie never do this. It was both comical and infuriating to watch. Argh.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Whoring out to China,"This was a great sci-fi movie that has all the ingredients I'd ever want. And then came the China involvement in the rescue effort.Get used to it. Hollywood studios have begun the process of COMPLETELY altering their core story line to make films more attractive to the gargantuan Chinese viewer base. The Chinese element in this film crashes into the core story line so hard and with such utter lack of congruence that it is beyond a distraction, it's just a suspension-of-disbelief buster.

Great Scott !,"Ridley Scott has returned to form with The Martian due to sticking to the nuts-and-bolts of the story rather than some way-out SF-based theme(as in Prometheus). This is concerned with a space mission to Mars the red planet with a crew who are forced to leave an astronaut(MarkWatney) behind , thinking he's dead, when a dust storm blows up. Think of an Apollo 13 scenario where the astronaut played by Matt Damon has to survive until he is rescued in a very risky return by the retreating space vehicle which has to use the earth as a sling-shot device and pick him up in Martian orbit.Scott has an ease of manner at dwelling on these space subjects. He's also learned from other films, like Silent Running and Cast Away and Saving Private Ryan. With the Mariner probes we face post-fantasy Mars, where science fact squeezed out science fiction, where a real Mars took over. There are no Martians and the only life on Mars is likely to be more like microbes. Matt Damon plays a plucky individual who ""does the math"" to estimate how long he can spin out his resources, oxygen, water, potatoes which he grows utilizing his own faeces as compost. He establishes a communication link and keeps a video blog .Meanwhile back at NASA they are all thrilled he's still alive and calculate how many sols he's got before he dies. How soon can they send up another rocket to rescue him?Meanwhile in space we tune into the crew aboard the rocket, who when they discover he's alive have to debate pros/cons of returning to Mars or heading home to Earth. Watney can play Lieutenant Lewis's ( Jessica Chastain) awful 70s pop disco collection. Damon shows ingenuity, guts and chipper humour after his buddies have left him for dead. Classy space procedural getting the science mostly right from the Master Ridley.Science fact and pseudo-science are the new sci-fi. We are not a million miles away from making this leap of faith to go to Mars and so I found the film plausible. We are like the cave painters projecting what we are going to do in the future. Matt Damon and Scott are the cherry on the cake. A mix of Cast Away and Apollo 13: survival is all. There are fictional parts like the dust storm and the flight back and retrieval. A beautiful use of Jordanian landscapes to simulate the Martian terrain and a feeling for a few local difficulties. No inner angst, but the heady optimism of simply pushing forward for survival. Based on Andy Weir's novel.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Predictable and disappointing,"Although Matt Damon is an excellent actor, it was hard for me to fully immerse myself in his character.

Good but could have been great,"This movie certainly had a super cool concept and was honestly beautifully shot, but I never felt a sense of urgency or suspense in the plot or pacing, which is something I would have wanted for this movie to be elevated from ""good"" to ""great"" status.Furthermore, I never really connected with the main character on a meaningful level due to Mark's continuous jokes and inability to be serious. I would have really preferred a little more depth to his character... I mean, of course complex characters are always a plus in any movie, but I feel it was especially important here since the whole point of is that we, and the rest of the world, are supposed to be rooting for this one guy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Houston has a very big problem in this exciting and tense SF film.,"This Twentieth Century Fox film opens on the planet Mars. A crew is working there but they have to leave in a hurry and thus accidentally leave behind one of the crew, the eponymous 'Martian' played by Matt Damon.A major storm forced the rapid departure but Matt Damon's astronaut suffers an accident and his life-support systems show he is dead, thus the reason he is left behind. If he were dead, this would be a very short film. However, the film, 'The Martian', is 141 minutes long, (2hrs and 21mins), and as the trailers show, Astronaut Damon is alive and thus destined to be 'The Martian'. Alive, through a quirk of fate, Astronaut Damon realizes that he will soon die from starvation except if he can utilize fully his botany skills and Earth mounts a rescue mission.On Earth, Astronaut Damon is declared a hero, and a funeral is held. Things though quickly change when a lowly tech worker, played by Mackenzie Davis, discovers the reality. The scenes with Miss Davis on the floor of Mission Control are well done. The excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor is brought in as the story develops, as are Jeff Daniels, playing NASA head Teddy Sanders, and Sean Bean. Donald Glover too, gives an authentic performance as a bright computer geek and mathematician.Jeff Daniels has the hard role of playing the boss who has to play politics, play the long game, all the while playing the numbers, and most importantly playing safety first always. He does this well enough to arouse empathy and understanding in his position. Sean Bean's character is perhaps easier to play. He is compassionate, honourable and noble. The two instruct a rescue-mission. Benedict Wong plays well the engineer asked to meet impossible 'Scotty-style' deadlines. There is a little humour here in this, as there is in much of the rest of the film too.Unaware of any of this, are the crew of the Martian expedition, who are now sailing home back to Earth. Aksel Hennie, Kate Mara and Sebastian Stan are good in their roles as crew members. The pilot who had to blast off from Mars is played with great humanity by Michael Pina. Those who fell in love with his character in 'End of Watch' (2012), will be happy to know that once again he plays a really warm and human character. Jessica Chastain plays the Captain who had to order take-off. Her character is responsible for the Seventies disco-music used throughout the film to such great effect, especially in the scene which uses the song that started an era.It is good to see both Miss Chastain and Mr Damon in this film. They have both also appeared in 'Interstellar' (2014). The appearance of Mr Damon in that film was actually one of the highlights. 'Interstellar' actually, was a disappointment. An interesting dystopian start, and perhaps too brief sojourn to the planets, was marred, ruined in fact, by a dreadful last third of the film. However, here, in 'The Martian', we have the film that 'Interstellar' could have been, and should have been.While praise is due to all the cast, in reality they play small roles in this film. Matt Damon has to shoulder a lot of the burden in this film. His performance is in fact a tour-de-force. Facing death, he records his thoughts for posterity, using cameras, thus also supplying us, the audience, with explanation and exposition.As said, this is not Matt Damon's first trip into space. As well as the aforementioned 'Interstellar' in 2014, in the previous year of 2013, Mr Damon also appeared in another exciting SF story, 'Elysium', which also had some hard social comment in it too. Nothing new for Mr Damon, 'Promised Land' (2012), was a serious film that tackled a serious issue. However, the talented Mr Damon can also deliver a performance that balances romance and comedy, as in his role as a suave but bad-French-speaking character, in the true story 'The Monuments Men', a film that perfectly balanced humour and seriousness.'The Martian' is directed well by Ridley Scott. The 3D version shows well the Martian scenery, basically massive mountains and wide sandy valleys. The scenes in space are perhaps some of the most breathtaking and gripping. Drew Goddard's screenplay comes from Andy Weir's book.Those of you who enjoyed seeing Tom Hanks have a problem in 'Apollo 13' (1995), will recognize a similar NASA and similar themes. So too, those Sandra Bullock fans, who were wowed by her performance in 'Gravity', will also find familiarity. If you liked those films, you will enjoy 'The Martian' too. Perhaps not the most action-packed film, it is after all basically about one man alone on a big planet, the film does build up the excitement and the tension as it heads to it's climax. The last couple of scenes could be described as an unnecessary anti-climax, however as they play out, you realize why they are there.Top marks for a top film! 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
And I thought Prometheus was bad....,"Another day I read that the average IQ of the human population is falling....A rating of 8 for ""The Martian"" is proof of that.The Martian is a real bore fest, an uninspired politically correct film filled with the habitual clichés about scientists, race and everything else.I can even ignore the stupid things they showed in the movie (e.g, why remove the roof of a perfectly airtight, functioning Mars rover?) after all not everyone has a PhD in physics or engineering... but the characters are bland, the cursing is annoying, the acting is coma inducing...There is no tension, no sense of urgency...the whole thing can be summarized as an experiment in the cultivation of potatoes on Mars.And to make things worse, the ending is almost an exact copy of what they did in ""Red Planet"" (2000), with Val Kilmer...It is a mediocre film made by a director who is showing his age...",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Basically a 2 hour long documentary about how to survive mars,"As someone who's really interested in space and astronomy, I find this film quite fun and anyone interested in astronomy should definitely give it a try!Every thing Mike does to make himself survive longer are all actually a real accurate, proven way to survive Mars by scientists. Also the whole space travel, disagreements are all pretty accurate as well. What I'm trying to is, a real life situation where an astronaut is stuck on Mars would definitely play out like the Martian if it were to ever happenOne nice little touch is that the few really interesting lines Matt Damon delivers is really thought-provoking. Like the ""in 4.5 billion years I'm the first to climb the mountain"" and the quote he says at the end was pretty great.The tone/themes were basically trying to tell the audience on how to survive Mars and it can go wrong when unexpected which I really like. But remember this film was basically a documentary so no real plot or tone was really there.There isn't really anything bad to call out for.

Lets feel good about NASA......,"Poor old NASA, no ones heard a whole lot from them lately. Indeed, it seems the Chinese are getting more attention.Not to worry, The Martian, offers up a few spoonfuls of feel good, cinematic hope, for forlorn US astro-nuts out there. The film presents a very optimistic view of a high tech, future NASA. A NASA populated by super science types, like Matt Daemons character, who can solve all problems and overcome any situation. Even being stranded, Robinson Crusoe style, on planet Mars.This film is over the top but, for all that, quite entertaining. Daemon is his pleasant, laid back, jokery, folksy self, fitting like a homemade spacesuit into this role.What is surprising, is how the writers and director, Ridley Scott, managed to make, what is on the surface, a not so exciting premise, a guy stranded on a barren planet, quite engaging and enjoyable. On that basis, this film is to be commended.That said, this film has, in my opinion, been chronically over hyped, especially in the pre-release marketing and as such, has created an expectation, I feel, it could never really live up to.The Martian is a good film. Its well cast, employs engaging and amusing narrative and surprisingly, given what appears initially, to be, bland material, its never boring.

Falls a little flat but looks great,"Based on Andy Weir's novel, The Martian is a 2015 science-fiction film about an astronaut who finds himself stuck alone on Mars when his team abandons him thinking he died during a dust storm. The film was directed by Ridley Scott and stars Matt Damon in the lead role.Armed with an all-star supporting cast, The Martian sold itself as a kind of space-set take on Castaway focusing on one man's unlikely survival in a desolate, unpredictable setting. It was a big hit upon its release and it earned itself two Golden Globes as well as multiple Academy Award nominations. While there are glaring technical and scientific inaccuracies in the film, which is fine since this is a science-fiction story after all, a lot of effort was put into making the film feel as realistic as possible.Indeed, when it comes to stranded botanist astronaut Mark Watney (Damon) and what he has to deal with, everything seems relatively plausible from growing potatoes using his own feces to using the Pathfinder probe as a way to communicate with Earth. This is a loving homage to problem-solving and Watney's smart approach to dealing with potential certain death is inspiring. Though perhaps a more charismatic lead might have sold that a tad more convincingly?There is, frankly, something rather vapid about The Martian as it constantly fails to really connect with the viewer on an emotional level. In its hefty 142 minutes, the film instantly shows us why we should care about Watney (he is optimistic and has good survival instincts) but it never builds on that. His friendship with the crew that eventually comes back to try and save him is almost entirely implied as we only see Watney communicating with them through computer messages. This astronaut almost seems too good at what he does and Matt Damon, while he delivers a solid performance, doesn't quite manage to show us how this character feels, who he is and what other dimensions he has despite being a clever botanist and recording borderline narcissistic vlogs.There are some great performances here from the likes of Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor and many others that feel a lot more human than Damon's. On the plus side, this is a slick movie in terms of visuals, the soundtrack is very good and the ending does have a good amount of suspense to it.There's a great film in The Martian somewhere. On the surface, this is the perfect Oscar-friendly sci-fi film with its Man vs Nature survival story but it is just too predictable, too long and too shallow to truly feel like a worthwhile and rewarding experience overall. There's a lot of talent involved and that pays off here and there but The Martian is altogether a little disappointing.Worth one watch, probably not two.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Only two positive points: nice 'spaceshots' and a few moments of good acting from Damon. Too few to make the story believable or to really care about his character.

Cast away meets Apollo 13,"As I sit here writing this I am also listening to an interview with author Andy Weir. Andy Weir wrote the book on which this film is based and its quite interesting how the book now film came to be. Andy like me was also a Sci Fi nut so went about writing science fiction and posting it online. However when he began writing ""The Martian"" there were no aliens, no star cruisers, no lasers this time round. Instead it was all researched scientific fact and it revolved around a manned trip to the planet Mars. Each week he would post new chapters online and would ""update"" chapters each time his readers corrected his factual inaccuracies. Eventually he had completed a book, it soon got published from online to paperback and the rest is history.We have been graced with several poor adaptations of mars in recent times from the likes of the pitiful ""Red planet"" and ""Mission to mars"" and I don't think Hollywood wanted to finance big budget sci fi films after several flops but then blockbusters ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar"" came round and we all know how amazing they were This brings us to the newest member of the Science fiction film family 'The Martian'. Ridley Scott created some Sci Fi masterpieces in Aliens and Bladeunner so when I heard he was attached to this film I was already anticipating this one. The premise is simple. A manned mission to mars in the not too distant future encounters a freak windstorm. Forced to evacuate the planet in the chaos they drop everything, leave behind astronaut Mark Watney believing he is dead and begin the journey back to earth. In actual fact Mark survived but has been injured after being impaled by his communication antenna. With no way of contacting NASA or his crew and the next mission to arrive on Mars another 4 years away not to mention dwindling food supplies Mark is left with a pretty tricky situation.What happens next has been described as cross between cast away and Apollo 13. The film alternates between 3 main facets. NASA mission control on Earth, The crew members of the Ares 3 mission en route to earth and Mark Watney now stranded on Mars and the actors chosen for each portray them brilliantly. Note to Jeff Daniels try a serious role like this one rather than a silly sequel to Dumb and Dumber. Matt Damon portrays the role of Mark Watney perfectly from his mannerisms to his humour. Far from thinking this future is bleak and I'm gonna die on this god forsaken planet Watney takes a Bear Grylls style approach to survival and proclaims If I'm to survive here 'I'm gonna have to science the $#!@ out of this'. Each ""Sol"" (means Mars day) he updates us on his situation via his ""Video journal"" For the budding science minded individual like me many of his ideas also came into my head as I viewed the film but for the average Joe the film is not difficult to understand. I was afraid of the film having a lot of scientific jargon but was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to understand what was going on.When NASA caught wind of this film being in production they were more than happy to lend their expertise to help this novel translate to the big screen. Legally you are not allowed to portray NASA in any other form without their express written permission anyway... In a way you could say this is a product placement promotion for the future of NASA which in a way it is but hey that's a good thing. Its not fully 100% accurate. We do know that the winds on Mars are no way near as strong enough to generate the storm style winds but by and large the film gets the science right. We have to remember it's a film not a science lesson. Author Andy Weir even calculated the trajectories, distances among other things to ensure everything is told as it will be when we finally make that mission to the red planet.This film is simply stunning simply amazing but it will also have some good competition with the upcoming Oscar awards. ""The Walk"" and ""Everest"" come to mind. If this film doesn't win any awards I will be bitterly disappointed because I can already foresee Matt Damon standing on stage accepting an award for ""Best Actor"" So with that in mind go out and watch this film already if you haven't done so you WONT regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Ridley Scott could be back.,"Has Ridley Scott finally returned to form with The Martian? Well seeing that The Martian turned out to be one of the best films of the year, you can say yes! After a period of mediocrity by Scott, The Martian was a reminder that Scott is one of the great directors living today. When you initially look at this film on paper, you see an amazing cast, good writer, and shaky director, but this film had it all. First of all it is amazing to look at. The cinematography is stellar, shot by Dariusz Wolski (Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Exodus: Gods and Kings, Alice in Wonderland). Ridley Scott's execution of this film was outstanding, he made you feel like they were actually on Mars. When you look at this cast, which has various Oscar nominated actors you are expecting the performances to be good (maybe not great cause look how the Counselor turned out), and they deliver big time! Matt Damon who played Mark Watney was obviously the star of the movie. He delivered on all aspects, and might be one of his best performances of his career. Jeff Daniels (Teddy Sanders) does an amazing job in this movie, playing a real human being, a business man who is concerned only about what is best for NASA. He is not the antagonist at all, even though he might be made out to seem like it. The whole crew consisting of Jessica Chastain (Melissa Lewis), Sebastian Stan (Chris Beck), Michael Peña (Rick Martinez), Kate Mara (Beth Johanssen), and Aksel Hennie (Alex Vogel) played off each other so wonderfully. It seems like they have been together for such a long time and the chemistry is beautiful. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Vincent Kapoor) was superb, but when is he not? Sean Bean was Sean Bean really, nothing super spectacular, but not bad. Kristen Wigg, leaving we can say her comfort zone in comedy and doing some drama, did well, didn't disappoint. Surprising performance came from Mackenzie Davis (Mindy Park) who blew me away. My least favorite was Donald Glover who seemed out of place in this movie and was one really slight negative, but did not detach me from the film. This movie is really an original piece, of human survival and hope. Ridley Scott managed to make this movie feel so real, you were scared for the well being of Matt Damon while he was stuck on Mars. The writing was outstanding as well, done by Drew Goddard. It was the perfect blend of comedy and suspense. The big things I was worried did not happen at all. Mainly being that the movie seemed to spoiled by the trailers, but it wasn't! Also the science behind it all which I thought could become confusing, wasn't! This film ended up being one of my favorite of the year, and made me remember what a great director Ridley Scott can be, and don't be surprised come Oscar time, you see The Martian in the running for an award. Highly recommended a must see this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The best sci-fi movie for years!,"The Martian follows the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut left behind on a place where nothing lives or grows, Mars. For most of the runtime (this is quite a long film at 2 and a half hours) we spend time on this planet with Watney, and with such a brilliant performance from Matt Damon it is a pleasure to do so.As soon as the film starts we are thrown straight into the action and feel what it's like to be in Watney's shoes. What we are given is an incredibly intense and realistic portrayal of loneliness and desperation from Damon and director Ridley Scott. It is also fascinating to watch Watney do his ""sciency stuff"" where he actually creates his own water and grows his own food, which is thought to be impossible on Mars. It is ironic that the film shows us this in the same week water actually was discovered on Mars, but even so it is so interesting to see these aspects. The supporting cast also do a great job, especially Watney's crew who just want to get him back to earth. Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara.. the list goes on and they all shine as well as Jeff Daniels who we really don't know whether he is one of the good guys or not. The standout however comes from my man Donald Glover, i love the guy and he steals every scene he is in even if it is only for a short time.Overall, see this film. It is one if the best 2015 has to offer and remains in my top 5 of the year so far. It was like Interstellar meets castaway with less fantasy and more realism. One question though.. why does Hollywood keep letting Matt Damon get lost?! Have they not learnt by now?",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Saving Matt Damon... again!,"Super-science is the name of the game in this drama regarding a Botanist who was left behind during a super storm on planet Mars in 2035. Astronaught Mark Watney wakes up after the dust settles and finds himself abandoned by the Aries III crew with no means of communication, a decreasing supply of food and water, and the harsh environment of the Mars surface on the outside of his surface pod. Watney drums up the courage to continue surviving despite bodily injury, starvation, dehydration, and several near death experiences.The scope and scale of this movie is pretty amazing. So much so that it inspired one of those ""War of the Worlds"" moments in modern society. Several articles were published in American newspapers about movie goers who either believed they were watching a dramatization of real events or a documentary. Yes, some people actually believed we went to Mars because of this film, but that isn't the impressive part.What i really enjoyed about this movie wasn't the acting to be honest. I really didn't find any moment where I felt Watney to be in any real danger, and you somehow always know he'll be okay. His confidence brings him a long way through this sci-fi drama, and of course I'm no scientist so it's hard to refute any of his survival techniques (seriously though... a plastic door and some duct tape?). Never the less, the thing that is by far the most outstanding achievement of this film, is the use of real organizations, technologies, and creating an amazing setting on the surface of mars. I couldn't believe how beautiful everything looked, and was constantly impressed with the effort this director took to make it somewhat believable. Enough to fool a few anyway.An excellent weekend movie, and be prepared for a lot of Matt Damon screen time. But that's to be expected in a movie that features and actor that has been rescued more times than a cat from a tree.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A fantastic new voyage with scott Ridley,"As terrifying as I imagine it would be if I were suddenly abandoned all by myself on the planet Mars, one of the first questions that came to my mind the first time I ever saw the trailer for this year's The Martian was can this film succeed mostly being carried by only one man? I know that Tom Hanks successfully pulled it off in (2000) 'Cast away', but he at least had the island's wilderness beauty to help with enlivening the film. Can Matt Dammon pull it all off in a geography that what I understand is mostly only dessert? The answer is that with director Ridley Scott behind the scenes, many things are possible; particularly 'The Martian' serving as just one of those examples!In the near future 2030's, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) with a crew of others are on day number 18 on Mars living in an artificial habitat of a 2 month mission to research the possibilities of Mars one day being able to be colonized. During a sudden massive storm, the crew is forced to evacuate early in their mission to make their 4 year journey back home. Thinking that Mark was killed upon being swept away by a monstrous dust storm and only minutes to escape before the spacecraft is crushed, the crew take off and leave him behind. Mark miraculously escapes the fate of death. However; the bad news is that with the limited supplies of food and NASA equipment left on Mars, he now has the seemingly impossible task of trying to somehow make contact with NASA. Even when; as seen in the trailers, NASA discovers he is alive, NASA are pretty much as clueless to how to get him back as it is with Mark; thus begins the lengthy journey of twist and turns for a workable protocol to be created.Matt Damon does a fairly good job inhabiting the role of the stranded astronaut who knows that his chances of ever getting back home are slim to nothing; most likely in his mind his status being the latter. Determined to be a good scientist and find as many answers in his research before all his months of food ahead runs out causing him to die of starvation, he gets to work both doing mechanical work and also attempting to grow food in an artificial greenhouse composed only of human wastes to plant in. Unlike Chuck Noland in 'Cast Away', Mark Watney does not have Wilson the volleyball to have a one way conversation with and to also serve for dialogue in the movie. However; documenting all his experiences daily in the video loge diaries serves as the inside of his mind both good and bad days in his uncertain life. Here you get both his dramatic fragile demeanor and his comical demeanor in interpreting life on Mars.Back on earth at NASA, there are a complex of characters adding to the tension. There is the self-serving director of NASA Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) whose desire to get Mark back is only second to his bigger concerns of NASA equipment, money, and propaganda. In contrast to his minimal concern for safety in getting Mark back is flight director Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean); whom wants nothing more than to get Mark back safely back home. Under the authority of Teddy while butting heads with his boss from time to time, Mitch wrestles between doing what Teddy tells him to do, or for him to do what is morally right.As captivating as the story was, the most enchanting part in the movie for me was the unexpected beauty of Mars! I've have not seen enough photos of the planet of Mars to make a comparison, but I suspect that Ridley Scott's perception of Mars is beautifully created more from his imagination than the real Mars. From time to time, visually you're treated to spontaneous sunsets along the rocky mountains lining the dessert land on the horizon; in which blossoms in a starry dessert night. If that is the way Mars really is; while I'd never want to live there, I'm love to visit there.Not being of a scientific mind, it is hard for me to distinguish how credible many of the strategies in this space movie are; as far as the tactics attempted to bring Mark back home. Nevertheless, the film did remind me very much of, (1995) 'Apollo 13'; which was the true story of astronauts tackling and improvising the impossible odds of getting back to earth. The fact that the real NASA seems to be getting closer in the years to actually putting a person on Mars makes this tale seem even more plausible.While 'The Martian' has been airbound for at least a few weeks so far inside movie theaters everywhere; while I suspect that it will be around for at least another week, the abundance of new feature films coming out I believe will create the inevitable: it will soon blast away from the big screen and land into the family small screen. If you can, I'd highly recommend to watch this new science fiction film on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"This is a story about Mark Watney ( Mat Damon ) , an astronaut stranded in mars.","WARNING:SPOILERS!!!""The Martian"" is a really fun ride from one of the best directors of all time, the man himself Ridley Scott. This was probably one of the best movies of 2015, even the 2010s, it has got a great cast, wonderful performances, surprisingly good and funny screenplay. The thing I am not sure if I loved or disliked is that he is so positive all the time. He was taking pictures with a big smile, telling jokes and being sure that he will survive and was saying with a smile on his face: ""F**k you, Mars!"". This is definitely a thing that i liked, but it seems a little bit weird. I mean, he is stranded on Mars, but he is acting all fine, but I liked that, but I am surprised. I mean that this is Ridley Scott. One more thing that I was not expecting was Sean Bean to live. I loved this movie, man. It's so good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent!,"This movie exceeded expectations. When a movie is set in space, and there's mainly 1 character, I usually assume that it will be a very LONG movie with very little action. That was not the case here. There are so many witty lines, plenty of plot, and action going on other than just on Mars. Other than a few curse words (which were appropriate for the situation), and 1 nude back scene (to show the weight he lost), it was also movie that is appropriate for older children. The Martian is different from any other ""Lost in Space"" type movies. The characters all have great chemistry together. It includes romance, jaw-dropping suspense, and ends beautifully.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Martian Has Landed,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie going in. Matt Damon is pretty hit and miss for me and I was afraid of a preachy message from Scott (like so many sci-fi movies do). To my great surprise I, I loved this movie! The story was compelling, the characters believable and the ""leave no man behind"" message is very positive. Matt Damon's performance shines and watching him deal with overwhelming problems is enough to inspire anyone to not give up. Of course much of the science was not believable - it's a movie - but as a story element it all worked terrifically. I recommended this movie for everyone teen and above. It has some language issues (so would I if I was left struggling alone on Mars). This movie just topped my list for 2015.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ridley Scott's Return: The Martain is a thrilling sci-fi adventure you don't want to miss out on.,"Ridley Scott's latest thrilling sci-fi blockbuster ""The Martian"", blew the box office away, But did the film live up to the long-awaited expectations?""The Martian"" was based upon a self-published bestselling novel by Andy Weir. And, unlike most movies adapted from books, ""The Martian"" mostly stuck to it's original material.Matt Damon stars as Mark Watney, an astronaut/botanist with a huge sense of humour which proves to be his greatest strength, stranded by himself on the vast rocky planet Mars. You watch in awe as he fights against all odds to survive the harsh environments of the red planet. He (Matt Damon) portrayed the role very well, which struck a lot of people, including myself, by surprise. As the film rolls foreword, the audience becomes attached to the character and you'll find yourself sitting at the end of your chair, rooting for him to solve each problem he must face. The side characters (scientists, crew mates) were played wonderfully, each one speaking with a hint of dazzle in there voices or body language that makes their characters unique.The movie is beautifully filmed, the rocky landscapes are shot from unique angles and the cinematography was spectacular. The soundtrack was odd, but kept the film upbeat. The dialogue was filled humour, which makes a slight chuckle wash over the theater, making film much more enjoyable.Unfortunately, if you plan on seeing this movie in 3D, save your money and don't. There were hardly any great 3D effects. The story was also predictable and a bit corny at the end, and at some points the film seemed unrealistic.Overall, ""the Martian"" is a thrilling, beautiful journey about survival, willpower, perseverance, and hope. With humorous dialogue and believable characters, ""the Martian"" is an amazing science-fiction thrill-ride you do not want to miss out on.My overall rating: 8.6 / 10.0-Jacob McDonaldBy the way, this was my first review, so I hope you liked it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I Loved The Movie But.........,"Why? Why? Why would you make such a great movie and put an actor like Kristen Wiig in it? She was a low point of the movie. She CANNOT ACT at the level of the other actors. Thank goodness she had a small part. Luckily the movie is so good it barely distracted the audience. Other then that I found the movie to be great. It held my interests and kept me on the edge of my seat. The special effects were tremendous. I thought I was on Mars with the actors. I found the scenery to be realistic and not on a set. It set the mood for someone being alone and so far from home. When the scene started with a far away shot as if it was from a probe orbiting Mars, you felt marooned. If you want to see a wonderful Science-Fiction movie this is one you should not miss.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Martian,"My family enjoyed this Movie and the scale of the production. We are also Ridley Scott fans as we love his work. Unfortunately Sean Bean gave a very strange performance as though he was in Coronation Street? At this point let me make it clear that it was nothing to do with the Yorkshire accent (yes I know Corrie is Lancashire!) But the laid back throwaway delivery he gave? However all the other cast were wonderful!!! Well written, directed and thought provoking and very human with a great delivery from Matt Damon who pulled us nicely through the story! We will watch again when the movie is on the movie channel in the comfort of our own home. We still don't like the slurping of fizzy drinks and the awful smell of popcorn drifting around the cinema giving a second thought that someone might have broken wind?Professor Howard Marbles",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Well-made but vaguely disappointing and flat with no emotional engagement,"Hmmm, it wasn't THAT good. It's well made and Damon probably saves it from utter failure but despite all the ""science"" there are many contrivances, conveniences and plot holes. Characters are depressingly flat (she's the computer nerd that keeps a hex chart on her PC, he's the chemist that can do Heisenberg-type feats with kitchen ingredients, she's the tight-laced mission commander with a secret passion for disco music, sigh, he's the Nasa bigwig who just sees the numbers, he's the genius loner doing the hard math and lives off only coffee, sigh, you get the picture) and dialogue is trying too hard to be clever and snappy. The dynamics of the team on the mission are too perfect to be really believable and, for me, all the buddy-buddy, black-and-white, suits vs astronauts stuff is so by the numbers that it really annoyed. The structure of the plot is very procedural and it seems that Watney only needed to encounter each kind of problem once - when he had it solved then it never happened again despite all the equipment on Mars getting older and older and ... but I digress. There was also one too many scenes in which someone had a brainwave in relation to a problem and then walks away mumbling to themselves while someone else follows them saying ""What? What? What did you think of?"". In the end, I didn't care what happened to anyone. The movie didn't engage me in that way - sure it was interesting and nice to look at but it main message is that science shall save you if you work it. Science may be the new religion but fanaticism to anything is a blinding and dangerous thing. There are some people at whom this film is perfectly targeted but for many more this will be a good-looking and distracting work with little real satisfaction. I'd still give it 6/10 and on a good day when my disappointment abates I might up that to a 7/10 at best!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Captivating and Thrilling,"Every cinephile is familiar with Ridley Scott's name. He has made two of the greatest Sci-Fi films we have ever seen i.e. Blade Runner, and Alien. He also made the historical drama film Gladiator, which was a critical and financial success. His filmography is filled with great and awful films. He is a great director, but he hasn't done anything great for years now. He made Prometheus but it wasn't that good and we all know how mediocre Exodus was. He needed a good film and The Martian is just that, a film that Ridley needed to revive his career and put him back on track. It is a well-made film with great visuals and fantastic story.Plot - Imagine a planet, where you are the only being alive. There is no water and the land is not fertile. Your supplies won't last for more than 60-70 days. You know that you can escape the planet only after 800-900 days, but you have to stay alive. There are so many things you have to take care of –If you run out of food, you die. If you run out of the water, you die. If you go outside, you die. If you don't do something, you die. If you lose hope, you die. Most importantly, the feeling of loneliness will definitely kill you. We all have seen what loneliness can do to people. If you haven't, then watch Taxi Driver.Now, what would you do? Would you lose hope and die even before the supplies end or will you start finding ways to solve the problems? Does your mind work or does your body become numb? How would you keep your mind in control? How would you live? Well, that's What happens in The Martian.""The Martian is a story about some astronauts working on NASA's ARES III mission on Mars. They are hit by a storm and one of their team members (Mark Watney) gets lost. Presuming that he is dead, the remaining team members leave the planet. Mark Watney was not dead, he was hit by an antenna. He wakes up to find himself alone and stranded on this red planet. He has supplies that could last for a few days. He tries to communicate to NASA, but the communication system was destroyed by the storm. Now he has to face all the odds, find a way to communicate back to earth and survive until someone comes and saves him. Does he make it back to earth?""The film is based on a novel by ""Andy Weir"". It is a simple story but works on multiple levels. Drew Goddard (The Screenwriter) did a fantastic job of converting words into action. The screenplay is simple and doesn't hold many surprises. The runtime is 141 minutes, but the pace is so perfect that you don't feel that something is being dragged. As the plot drives forward, the protagonist is presented with more and more problems which present threats to his life, He tries to overcome these hurdles by using his wits, spirit, and skills. The whole process is very exciting, exhilarating and thrilling. This is a perfect example of smart and witty writing supported by good filmmaking. The Martian is a character-driven film where out protagonist is in a bad situation, but he does not lose hope and makes full use of his skills and wits. This is a film about hope, fighting the odds, Optimism, courage and willpower.There is only one shortcoming that I could think of. I wanted to see more of Watney's (Matt Damon) character. He was such a fascinating character and always a delight to watch. I would have loved it more if they had explored more depths of his character. The used the humor really well, but all his emotional conflicts were not shown. His internal struggles, pessimistic and optimistic character shifts and emotional conflicts would have added more depth to his character. But you can't really complain as it would have added another 20-30 minutes to the runtime.Performances/Cinematography/Visuals - This has to be one of the best acting performances of Matt Damon's career. He is an excellent actor and he did a fantastic job in The Martian. He portrayed every emotion perfectly and effortlessly.The supporting cast is equally good. Jessica Chastain didn't have much to do, but she did complete justice to her role. Sean Bean was good, but I was disappointed because he didn't die.The cinematography is gorgeous and some of the shots are spectacular, especially the climax scene. If you are going to watch this film, make sure you go for the 3D as it adds more depth to the scenes. You can feel the atmosphere created by the Cinematographer.Final Thoughts - The Martian is a must watch. Go and watch it as soon as you can because it is one of the top 3 movies of 2015. Some people might be put off by the Sci-Fi tag but believe me, it's The Shawshank Redemption set in space. It is the journey of a man who tries to survive against, all odds, using his wits, willpower and courage.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
technically excellent,"Ridley Scott has a great eye for fashioning self-contained worlds, evidenced in this movie by convincing depictions of both the confines of a spaceship and the vastness of a planet.THE MARTIAN is solidly entertaining Hollywood fare. How much you enjoy it will be determined to a large extent on whether you're happy to pass a lot of time watching Matt Damon, who is at the centre of it. He's improved as an actor over the years. Pretty dismal in THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY, he was impressive in BEHIND THE CANDLEABRA, and has some fine moments here. The sheer size of the role might even attract an Oscar nomination. But there's something about him I don't get, a hollowness in him somewhere, a lack which doesn't exist in actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Leonardo DiCaprio, who fill the screen with sheer presence, just as De Niro and Pacino did before them, and Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Spencer Tracy...the list is long. Damon has his moments, more than he used to, but he's not in the same league.Provided you can live with that, and some of the clunky dialogue, you'll have a good time with this technically excellent movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Finding A Way Home,"The fact that four days before the release of Ridley Scott's new sci-fi drama, The Martian, NASA announced they had found evidence of water on Mars fed into the zeitgeist moment which this film so eloquently captures. Ridley Scott, well-known for directing the Alien series of films, has returned with an edge-of-your-seat feature which confronts the lone human against space storyline in a refreshing way.In The Martian, based on the best-selling book by Andy Weir, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left for dead on Mars after his fellow astronauts lose contact with him in a storm. The five crew members, led by Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), abandon their mission on Mars and make their return journey to earth on the Hermes.Meanwhile, Watney is declared dead by NASA, only to be discovered alive several months later. The key dramatic turn is that Watney has no way of contacting NASA, and vice versa. From here it is Watney's never give up attitude, science, and both NASA's and the crew's desire to bring him home that drives the plot.Instead of the fear of aliens on distant planets, Ridley takes the audience on a visceral journey with Watney as he faces his fear of dying alone on Mars, a cold, waterless (as we understood at the time) wasteland. Survival is the name of the game. With the help of some disco music ""I Will Survive"" gets a spin, of course, and Watney's irrepressible wit, the botanist finds innovative ways to stay alive - all the while making botany look cool. Damon puts in a performance that is nuanced and understated, and along with a tight plot and humour, the character carries the viewer along on his journey. Documentary style video journal entries help draw us in to the triumphs and tribulations of the lone Martian's experience, while sweeping cinematography (shot in the deserts of Jordan) show us the extent of his vulnerability, alone on this vast, red planet.For those of us who grew up watching the space shuttle missions NASA introduced us to the innovative, exciting possibilities of science. So, in the film when Watney declares, to survive Mars, ""I'm going to have to science the sh*t out of this!"" it's a punch the air moment. Although science buffs will notice a few mistakes in The Martian - all for the sake of storytelling - NASA was consulted extensively during the scriptwriting process. The space agency's efforts to bring Watney home help move the plot forward, and introduce some plot-twisting tension, especially when the - almost forgotten - Hermes crew members become involved.The Martian sits comfortably as a companion piece to Cuaron's Gravity; both films strip their characters down to their bare essence, using space as a metaphor for the fragility of human life, and a backdrop for the triumph of the human spirit. What The Martian displays is Scott's skill as a storyteller who understands the strongest and most base of human feelings; fear, the will to survive, the depths of loneliness and the inexplicable pull to return home. All the while revealing the possibilities which space exploration ignites in the human imagination.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The sci-fi we deserve and need to see,"I've read the book before I watched the movie and I absolutely loved it. It's sense of humorous optimism and of the value of scientific achievement is, quite frankly, unparalleled. So the question is, how did the movie fare? It did really well, too!This is the kind of science fiction movie that we need to see: it is about science, using fiction. It is not using technobabble to give us fiction. The difference is huge! Also, most ""sciency"" films are going for the dark and broody feel, discussing the things that people fear about science, not the things that people love. The Martian does not do that!Not everything is rosy, though. In order to cram a book filled with inner introspection, science calculations, explanations of what was going on, all going on for almost two years, the film had to take some liberties with what was shown and what wasn't. My feeling is that they did a good job, but even for a two hour and a half movie it wasn't quite enough. My wife was still asking me what was going on and why did he do that and where is he going.In fact, the biggest defect of the movie was to eliminate the sense of size for the planet Mars that is present in the book. Seeing some guy going to the Pathfinder landing spot in a few minutes and then Pathfinder back at base doesn't begin to show the scale of travel and difficulty Watney had to overcome. Also, Damon does a good job bringing humor to the script, but the book was filled with jokes and that Weir humor and optimism.Bottom line: A movie that doesn't need deux ex machina to save the protagonist, doesn't need implausible crises or alien villains to share the thrill and terror of space exploration and yet shows that hope, friendship, skill and hard work, knowledge and science can overcome any obstacle. We needed that. Thank you, Andy Weir! Thank you, Ridley Scott!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
My all time favorite space movie!,"The Martian is a movie based on the novel of the same name by Andy Weir. Astronaut Mark Watney(Matt Damon) & his crew consisting of, Melissa Lewis(Jessica Chastain), Rick Martinez(Michael Pena), Beth Johanssen(Kate Mara), Chris Beck(Sebastian Stan) & Alex Vogel(Aksel Hennie) are on a manned mission to Mars. When they reach Mars & go about exploring the terrain, a severe storm breaks out. After Watney is hit by debris, he's presumed dead by his crew because his space suit doesn't give off any readings. So, the rest of the crew reluctantly leave Watney behind on Mars. Now, it is up to Mark Watney to use his skills, wit & wisdom to survive on the limited supplies he has on the extreme planet. Watney also has to somehow convey to NASA, that he's still alive.The Martian is a spectacular film. This film surpasses both Gravity(2013) & Interstellar(2014) to become my all time favorite film, set in space. The Martian is a flawless medley of the best elements of those two movies. The special effects are mind blowing. The 3D definitely adds to the already magical experience of watching this film. Director Ridley Scott & cinematographer Darius Wolski have masterfully captured the martian terrain. Green screen or real location, it actually looks like the movie was shot in Mars. I also loved the fact that the film tried to be as realistic as possible. The farming techniques that Watney tries is most probably what one would have to do if they're stranded on Mars. The fact that despite all the adversities Watney faces he always holds on to hope & never loses his sense of humor. Matt Damon is fantastic as Mark Watney. Being the protagonist stranded on a deserted planet, the success of this movie will always be judged by Damon's performance. He pulls it off, effortlessly. If it wasn't for Matt Damon's entertaining & powerful performance as Mark Watney, this movie would have been quite boring. Jessica Chastain is superb as Melissa Lewis. Kristen Wiig is great as Annie Montrose. Jeff Daniels is good as Teddy Sanders. Michael Pena is awesome as Rick Martinez. Kate Mara is impressive as Beth Johanssen. Sebastian Stan is amazing as Chris Beck. Aksel Hennie is effective as Alex Vogel. Chiwetel Ejiofor is outstanding as Vincent Kapoor.

Lukewarm fun spaceride on mars,"Not the best, not what I had expected, and far less than what I had hoped for.Lots of detail missing and lots of dramatic high points omitted making Martian feel like a outta space roadtrip.You never really feel like he is gonna die and even the problems that arise are not given he gravitas they deserve and the solutions that Watney come up with are made to feel like ""any average joe"" can accomplish it. In reality, what he does is an absolute feat of near future science, engineering and sheer human willpower and ingenuity.As most book to move conversions go, this one is fairly faithful hence the 6/10.I saw The Verge complain about the ending, but comparing the ending of the movie ending to the monologue ending in the book, the book's was far more moving. And the book's ending monologue was used for the promotional material for the movie but not in the movie itself... how dumb! In the end, they left out the almost getting lost in the sandstorm and the rover overturning, two highly tentative moments in the books.One of the most interesting things about the book was the humor and the humor as a result of Mark's comments in his logs, most of which didn't make it into the movie. i.e when he repaired the machine that recycles water and how he does it and the way he interacts with NASA when they tell him don't touch it.

Less Ambitious than Interstellar but Brilliantly Delivered and Funny,"Ares III, another group mission of NASA astronauts to the Mars may not have originality in plot due to source adaptation and visual effects not as amazing as Academy Awards winner Interstellar, director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Drew Gooddard still manage to turn it into a successful and brilliant sci-fi. It's definitely not scientifically accurate at all levels due to minor flaws, but the story mainly focuses on the survival skills and rescue efforts which are presented in a straightforward, entertaining, chilling, educational yet inspiring way. The film is surprisingly funny compared to Interstellar and Gravity thanks to the outstanding performance from Matt Damon who delivers the character's positive attitude overshadowing the fear of being a stranded stranger on the red planet, other strong star-studded cast including Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ejiofor have solid performances as well as scores composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, not extremely powerful but strong enough to fit into scenes. While it seems to be a rescue mission, the film is able to deliver an important message - regardless the help from the whole world, self-initiation determines the survival opportunity. Overall at a smaller scale and fans perception, The Martian fits perfectly as sequel of 2013's Gravity and prequel to 2014's Interstellar.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"After watching the entertaining film, we still want to read the book too, fun not mind-blowingly fantastic","Space seems to be the trendy environment for original cinematic adaptations to take place, this time it is Ridley Scott's chance with The Martian, starring Matt Damon.During a mission to Mars, the crew must make an emergency evacuation after a fierce storm, and leave the presumed dead Mark Watney behind. Unfortunately, or fortunately, for Mark, he is not dead, he is very much alive, but is now alone and stranded on the near uninhabitable planet and must persevere if he hopes to make it off the planet alive.If I've said it once, I will say it again, the best films being released recently are those that take inspiration from novels rather than exhausting the pre-existing roster with a remake. The Martian isn't quite outstanding in the way that Christopher Nolan's Interstellar captivated audiences and awards shows, in comparison, it could only compare to Interstellar if you stripped Nolan's creation of all cerebral content. It is energetically great like an action-adventure, thanks to its levity in matter rather than over- reaching toward lofty ambitions, a la Gravity, with which we were less than impressed.In terms of a film, The Martian is an odd one in that, unlike most films, the audience basically knows what is going to happen. Despite this fact, you are still interested and engaged in the story and in Watney's journey, a testament to both Matt Damon's performance and the general 'light' tone created by Ridley Scott. And for a film lasting over two hours, you hardly notice thanks to its fast pace.The Martian is not perfect, by any means, but it is great. Once Watney contacts NASA, the film loses a considerable amount of steam. NASA becomes a distraction from the gold of the film, and honestly I could have used less of that story line.Everyone can relate to a survival story, it taps into a basic instinct all humans have, the twinge of fear that creeps up your neck telling you to fight or run, and sets it on fire. Whether this was the intention of the author Andy Weir, I can not say, but based on the film adaptation I am very interested in reading his original version of the narrative.This quirky wannabe Cast Away set in space is sure to entertain movie goers, even if at times to is a bit formulaic in that manner. Using disco music, having a sassy main character, a lot of the methodical tropes of a good film are in The Martian, which is not bad per se but simply not original.7.5/10 but not near enough to upgrade it to an 8Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ridley Scott's Awesome Comeback!,"Minutes into The Martian, Matt Damon's Mark Watney says ""I'm gonna have to science the s**t out of this"" and I swear I chuckled so loud that the guy next to me was eyeballing me. I never thought I'd be in for a treat going for Ridley Scott's The Martian. Of course I am a huge Scott fan but his last two movies were a bit too tiresome to sit through. The aging director's prowess felt bumbling a bit, but The Martian proves that he's still got it. This is Sir Ridley Scott's awesome Comeback!Lets get the obvious stuff out of the way. NO, I am not going to compare Interstellar or Gravity or even Apollo 13 with this one. 'Apples, Oranges and a PERIOD' is what I'd add if anybody'd even start to argue about the same. The Martian sits cozily in a niche that Scott has carved so well.The Martian is a straightforward sci-fi drama about an astronaut stranded on Mars. It is about his sheer will that he ""wont die on Mars"" and up to his wits to survive in hopes of a rescue team to arrive. Its equal parts drama, sci-fi and survival genre and it never tries to be anything more than that. There is nothing that's too complex to comprehend, nothing that beckons for multiple viewings and despite its flaws it comes out a winner. The flaws were too obvious and felt deliberate as if Scott wanted us to ignore it and go with the flow. I had already sunk into the fact that there were so much flaws and to think about the same while watching the movie would ruin it for me. And it did wonders for me! What you get is a well acted, well written, visually arresting and unambiguous sci-fi movie with chuck-loads of comedy and tension to drive you till the finale.The Martian is a Matt Damon show! He was never a bad actor but his post-Bourne roles never needed much of an effort. Scott opened an awesome sandbox for Damon where he makes the most of it. The 'log files' worked out for a great mechanic that was used to document most of Watney's life on Mars and it felt like Damon was interacting more with us than a video capture device. A stellar supporting cast also supplements The Martian's narrative. The AAA cast included Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Michael Peña, Sean Bean, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover and instead of overcrowding the movie, each one of their performances were memorable. Even Donald Glover's barely 5 minute of screen time remains etched in my mind. Agreed it was much more fun watching Damon 'Science-ing the S**t out' but at the same time the supporting felt integral and never came off as a 'me too' addition.The Martian could have easily been a tense drama or rather have an over-all grim tone but it successfully injects well paced comedy and balances out the tension and drama. Thanks to Drew Goddard the comedy in The Martian doesn't feel forced. Get me started on the licensed tracks in the movie and I might not even stop; brilliant selection of licensed tracks that gave the movie a quirky beat.Sci-fi need not be mindbogglingly complex or have logical explanation for every damn detail on screen or even demand multiple viewings. Most of yesteryear's sci-fi classics focused more on 'fiction' than 'science' and it worked out well. I loved The Martian more than Interstellar or Gravity. I am no scientist and I am not here to argue about the plausibility of everything that happened in The Martian. I was there for entertainment and boy, did I get it served hot! Absolutely terrific performances by Matt Damon and the supporting cast, superbly written by Goddard and all executed perfectly well by Sir Ridley Scott. Come to think of it, even the the recent discovery of liquid water on Mars feels like a huge Marketing stint for The Martian.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This Martian is %100 human,"I'm currently only 60 or so pages from finishing the novel, but my friend has been bugging me to go see it, and this was the only day on our schedules that worked, so...Sympathetic hero, impossible odds, up with people message without beating you (too hard) over the head with it. Even a little Disco music. What's not to like?Scott is in solid form here, and he's assembled an excellent cast.

Overrated and over-hyped,"If you're the type of person who needs all the details to be plausible, this isn't the movie for you. It fails quite remarkably in that respect. The acting is unconvincing from all the main performers and eye-rollingly poor from Matt Damon. The script is maddening at how dumb it often is. Everything is explained to you like you're an idiot, and even to the NASA officials like they're all interns, rather than rocket scientists who know their stuff. There's a shameless amount of movie-computer sound affects. There are several characters in this movie that are pointless, like Kristen Wiig, who is always trying to keep a straight face through her unnecessary lines. It is almost devoid of tension because problems are solved within seconds of being encountered, often to a blaring disco soundtrack. About 40 minutes in I began to lose interest and wanted to check the reviews of this movie to see if I was the only one disappointed. In the end, you feel like you spend more time watching this movie than Matt Damon spends marooned on Mars. Some compare this to Castaway, Gravity and Apollo 13. But it seems more like the baby of Community, Big Bang Theory and Guardians of the Galaxy.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Matt Damon + Ridley Scott = Astonishing Space Epic,"Optimistic, witty, A great story of human survival.Stood outside of the cinema I had to make a decision whether to watch this or the maze runner:scorch trails or this and I made the right decision.First of all Matt Damon gave a stellar performance and was perfect for the role. He really made you feel for him and want him to survive. He does a great job of keeping you entertained even when he is by himself. This is where the directing skills of Ridley Scott comes in. He makes it so Matt Damon character is indirectly talking to the audience while he is talking to the cameras in the base.The cinematography in this film is also brilliant. I especially liked the angles created by the small camera/Go Pro on all the astronauts suits.Ridley Scott does a very good job of making mars look exiting and extremely cool place. As a very vast and desolate place making it interesting was very difficult task and Ridley Scott delivered.The supporting cast in this film really adds to its overall enjoyability. Most of the best of the supporting cast are on earth at NASA. Jeff Daniels and Sean Bean where both every good in there roles and the dynamic between the two was really interesting. Chiwetel Ejiofor was all so very good and really showed his acting ability.The film also supplies some comic relief. This usually come in the videos Matt Damon is recording and the conversations between him and the crew.To sum up this is a powerful, gritty and at times funny tale of human survival.I really enjoyed the film and would recommend it to anyone looking for a tremendous feat in film and by far one of the best films I've seen this year!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ridley Scott's best film in years,"I've been a huge fan of Ridley Scott's for years, counting Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, and American Gangster as some of my favorite films. But after the disappointing Robin Hood, Prometheus and Exodus I was hoping for a return to form. So his latest film comes as a welcome surprise, mostly because it doesn't come with the baggage of expectation like Prometheus. It is easily Ridley Scott's best film since American Gangster. Unlike recent space adventures, the film keeps the melodrama to a minimum, which was welcome, because so many films of this genre start out promising but eventually devolve into episodic ""How do we fix this problem?"". As usual, Scott's visual style is breathtaking, the effects are amazing and the acting is excellent. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ridley Scott the director - is back!,"Ridley Scott has been a mix bag recently - with movies like Robin Hood, Exodus.But being a fan of REAL Ridley in his days of Alien, Blade Runner - I had high expectations from this movie. And Ridley has delivered!!This is one of those rare Sci-Fi movies these days, where every scientific phenomena is explained very clearly - which even a layman can also understand. Perfect depiction of Martian atmosphere. No flaws at all. Plus some decent taste of humor here and there. Best movie of this year so far.If you have liked Gravity, then The Martian is it's god-father! I have to say - there have been some 3D movies recently - which just adds 3D in their name to raise the ticket price - but never found some real 3D effects as such recently. But The Martian is a REAL 3D Movie.I still remember the Martian dust storm scene at the start. It is one of those rare scenes taken in the dark (remember Jurassic Park?) that is so perfect - in 3D - you'll feel like you're inside the storm yourself!But the big new is - the REAL Ridley Scott the director - is back! A must see - in 3D for all!Hope to see some more movies like this now from you Ridley!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Realistic concept of a modern space trip to Mars.,"There are two very-well known individuals who went in the making of this movie, Ridley Scott and Matt Damon. This year's space blockbuster has proved to be very well-executed, as usual. Mark Watney (Matt Damon), is a lonely astronaut that is left behind on Mars when he's considered dead by his crew on take off back to Earth. He has to find a way to contact Earth so he can go back, but meanwhile he has to save and produce supplies to last about 2 or 3 years, while help is on its way. Matt's portrayal of a character who is completely lonely on an entire planet and has only hope to hold on to is formidable, including the fact this character has a very strong personality. So once contact is made, Earth begins to work on a rescue plan, and when everything seems to be going well, it isn't. After Mark finally figure out a way to survive for several years on Mars, everything goes wrong and everything gets lost. It leaves the audience with thrill and wonder, because every time you think you're predicting what's gonna happen next, it never goes that way. This is an example of good screen writing. The movie is not hard to follow, but some scientific aspects may leave you a bit confused. This movie also includes a strong cast and well performed acting in a way that, even though this is fiction, you can't help but notice how real it feels. There's no year representing the happenings in this movie, it just feels like nowadays. Visually, there's a lot to this movie. Although it isn't as overwhelming as Interstellar, it looks real enough to make you believe ""this is Mars"". Some space shots from Mars didn't look as photo-realistic as expected them, but that was probably because it was too much saturated in color grading. I'm expecting at least 1 Oscar nomination for either sound editing or mixing, since there was so much about. I usually don't watch a movie thinking there's something special about the sound but this definitely has in the way it was edited/mixed. Overall, ""The Martian"" proved to leave me at the edge of my seat, not many movies can do that. It's at least one of the best movies I've seen this year from 2015.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Engaging but not my genre,"Although The Martian is firmly rooted in the sci-fi genre, which isn't my usual preference, I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging the film turned out to be.Matt Damon gives a strong performance as Mark Watney, and the movie's focus on his survival on Mars offers a compelling blend of science and human emotion.The script successfully balances moments of tension with humor, making the dire situation more digestible. However, despite the film's quality, the sci-fi elements, like space travel and the heavy use of scientific jargon, didn't fully resonate with me.For fans of the genre, this will likely be a much more enjoyable experience, but for me, it was a one-time watch. Still, I appreciated the journey and the production quality, just not enough to watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Matt Damon is astronaut Mark Watney who along with a crew goes on a Mars mission, only when a bad storm hits Mark is assumed dead. And the crew returns to earth only to find out later that Mark is stranded on this hostile planet! What will Mark do? And how will he make it with limited supplies can he also stay alive?

The Martian is out of this world,"The Martian was out of this world. Yes I know that is cheesy but this movie was amazing.

Lead by an all star cast starring Matt Damon Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Michael Peña, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Donald Glover. Each one delivers an all star performance that form characters that you grow to love and root for. Matt Damon specifically is amazing in this movie. When a man is stranded and the only person on a planet, you can imagine emotions would be high. Damon does an incredible job of portraying those emotions and also brings forth comedic relief in an excellent form. This is a very stressful and high intensity film at times and the comedic relief was a pleasant surprise and best of all, didn't feel forced into the situation at all. The writing, the special effects and the directing (the amazing Ridley Scott) well all spectacular. This movie is over 2 hrs long but it doesn't feel like it. Time flies because you are so sucked into this movie. I honestly can't say enough good things about this movie and I don't want to give too much of the story away. Usually I try and think of some things that I might change or what they could have improved on but I am drawing a blank. You guys will just have to see it for yourself and see what you think.

Saving Mark Watney,"For all the hype about CGI, and such things as ""Real"" 3-D, or IMAX 3-D, the fact is that Hollywood is throwing in a lot of ultra-expensive special effects and gimmicks to lure patrons into theaters as incentives to watch movies costing anywhere from $150 million to $200 million that are so much about the sonic and visual experience exclusively, and so precious little about the art form of the motion picture itself—primarily comic-book spectacles, and ultra-violent action. But there are still directors who like to do things differently. One of them is British director Ridley Scott. Known for such masterworks as ALIEN, BLADE RUNNER, GLADIATOR, and, in 2012, the Alien-influenced sci-fi/horror epic PROMETHEUS, Scott returned to the science fiction genre in 2015 with a film that is full of eye-popping visuals and sonic experiences, but rooted in realism. That film was THE MARTIAN.Based on the novel of the same name by Andy Weir, this film, which is a far-into-the-future science fiction opus in the manner of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (one of the films that Scott always considered a touchstone film), focuses on a manned expedition on the surface of Mars that goes horribly wrong for those involved when a severe Martian sandstorm envelops them. In a panic to leave, they unwittingly one of their own, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) behind on the Martian surface. The crew (led by Jessica Chastain) believe him to be dead, as does practically everyone at NASA, including its chairman (Jeff Daniels); but in fact, he is managing to survive on his expertise as a botanist and grow his own potatoes inside the sealed space lab on the surface of a planet where nothing can really grow naturally. Chastain and her crew only find out about this just as their spacecraft is making it home to Earth; and Daniels, a mission specialist (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and a British technician (Sean Bean) have to fast design a new mission for Chastain, Michael Pena, and their compatriots to quickly swing back to Mars for an incredibly dangerous rescue mission. Damon's knowledge of botany, and his somewhat caustic wit, are what manage to keep him reasonably sane through all of the difficulties; but at some point, luck will run out on him.As the bar for realism in terms of space flight and space exploration had been set by ""2001"", where both director Stanley Kubrick and legendary writer Arthur C. Clarke were in close contact with NASA, and was extended with films like that film's 1984 sequel ""2010"", 1995's APOLLO 13, 2013's GRAVITY, and 2014's INTERSTELLAR, Scott found it worth his while to follow in their footsteps when it came to The Martian. And although some slight inaccuracies were inevitable (Hollywood has a tendency to exaggerate reality for visual spectacle), in general, Scott shows an otherwise extremely high accuracy and attention to detail as Kubrick, one of his personal favorites and mentors, had done for his 1968 sci-fi masterpiece. And as with all good serious science fiction films, from ""2001"" onwards, the technology doesn't overshadow the characters or the plot; it is all in service of the story, as opposed to the other way around. Damon, of course, in his own sardonic way, is really good in his own sardonic way, as is Chastain (who was in INTERSTELLAR), Ejiofor, Daniels, and Pena. The score by Harry Gregson-Williams, who did the score for GLADIATOR, has an appropriate amount of futurism to it, as well as some moments of pure classical music and modern minimalism, to give the appropriate amount of tension (as well as lighter moments that use 1970s disco music, including Vicki Sue Robinson's ""Turn The Beat Around"", Abba's ""Waterloo"", and the O'Jays' ""Love Train"").The vastness of the cosmos, as well as the red deserts and mountains that constitute the surface of Mars itself, are all vividly rendered by Scott, cinematographer Darius Wolski, and the visual effects team assembled for the project. With its combination of visual accuracy and stellar acting, THE MARTIAN joins GRAVITY and INTERSTELLAR as a pre-eminent example of how great science fiction movies can still be made at a time when Hollywood has eschewed visual spectacle for visual reality, and sonic assaults for story immersion. Scott is one of those veteran directors who has shown that it need not be any other way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Very well done and entertaining,"After watching Interstellar where I was feeling sleepy, this is a refreshingly entertaining movie which is believable and has nice human touches and wit to keep the audience interest intact. Fortunately, the science behind what happens at Mars and the rescue is explained in plain English which makes it thoroughly enjoyable and a delight to watch. Of course, the spectacular visuals is done very well and I must mention that the subtle use of 3D complements the story rather than distracting from it.Hats off to Ridley Scott for making a very wholesome, entertaining and visually delightful movie that will appeal to the masses.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Bring our Boy Home,"I am fascinated by films that show how people survive in impossible situations. THE MARTIAN is an old- fashioned ""feel good"" movie directed by Ridley Scott who knows how to make blockbusters and hold your attention - though here he goes ""off course"" from his usual dystopian science fiction-y horror movies like his breakthrough thriller ""Alien.""THE MARTIAN is basically about Mark Watney, (a breeze-through performance by Matt Damon,) as an affable brilliant, but down-to-earth botanist/scientist on a manned flight mission to Mars who is left stranded on the ""red planet"", after a fierce storm untethers him from the rest of the crew. Dramatic footage of sand and flying debris slamming the spaceship upending its stability, forces Jessica Chastain (performing in a minor role as Melissa Lewis, the flight Commander) to make the agonizing decision to abandon their fellow crew member - assuming he was killed by some space junk that pierced his body - to continue their NASA mission.The quiet after the storm shows us a steadfast Matt Damon awakening to his dire predicament, and the knowledge that death is almost a certainty, but never panics; rather he is optimistic, immediately going into survivalist mode - step by step using all that science and life experience has taught him in order to figure out how to live on a planet without water or food. One advantage is the artificial space vehicle/living habitat, or Hab which is still intact - providing oxygen and dietary supplies including his fellow astronauts' personal effects, along with a trove of ""bad"" music that becomes a continuing joke in the film. The lighthearted likability of Matt Damon, who relates his daily chores and mundane skirmishes with the airless ""elements"" via a video diary - a technique that keeps the film buoyantly hopeful; psychological depression never sets in - so we know that Hollywood has cast a rosy net of oblivion around THE MARTIAN. And by doing so, it feeds directly into the hearts of Rocky Balboa, and sports viewing fans - we love to see America's can-do spirit triumph.This is intrinsically a story about man's ability to endure in the face of terrible odds - which makes for great theater, and we in the audience cheer him on. Who cannot get caught up in this existential dilemma and not feel the intensity of Mark Watney's battle to exist? He is not alone - eventually there are others who join the fight to aid him in his heroic efforts to stay alive in an ""alien"" atmosphere; everyone realizing that there is a looming deadline when necessities will be depleted. Lots of actors contribute to the ensuing drama and add to the film's tension, which involves the diminished ""window of opportunity"" - to bring Astronaut Watney home while he is still alive, as the months glide by.The supporting actors were chosen to exemplify a ""type"" in the movie: Jeffrey Daniels as NASA's Director, caught in the vise of the political ramifications of his decisions; Michael Pena, a fellow space traveler who is the jesting buddy; Chiwetel Ejiofor, an assistant at NASA who is a catalyst for getting things done; and a surprisingly wonderful scene-stealing performance by Donald Glover as a young ""idiosyncratic"" Jet Propulsion Lab scientist whose mathematical computations lead to innovative approaches in the rescue attempt to bring Watney home. Being a bit of a wonk, even though I don't understand the mathematics and physics involved in the computations, I am thrilled seeing numbers and formulas no longer sitting abstractly on notebook papers, but put to use to change the world we live in- another example of what a group's inventiveness and a resilient outlook can accomplish.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Better than Gravity, not as good as Interstellar. Still one of the best movies of 2015 so far!","The Martian, directed by Ridley Scott (one of my favorite filmmaker of all time) is that kind of film that claims to be a hit from the beginning but, at the same time, tries to remain a simple and intense story that can be enjoyable and easy to understand by a wide audience, not just by the typical science-fiction fans.The movie follows two main story lines which remain parallel until a certain point of the action. The first one tells the story of the protagonist, ""the martian"" Mark Watney, played brilliantly by Matt Damon in one of the best roles of his career in my opinion. The hero is left behind by his crew during an ordinary mission on Mars after a huge storm that made everyone think he's dead. But as he turns out to be still alive, despite a serious injury, the movie follows his efforts to survive totally alone on a hostile planet without any possibilities to escape in the next years, until the next mission of NASA on Mars is programmed. But will he manage to survive? This is the question that remains predominant through the whole movie.The second storyline is based on the action that takes place on Earth, where an entire elite of scientists and even the whole humanity tries hard to rescue the astronaut as soon as possible by planning an earlier programmed mission to bring him home.The movie has terrific visual effects (especially in the 3D version, which I was lucky to watch) but also a quite realistic vision of the future, presenting an unfriendly image of the Red Planet, with stunning landscapes that seem to be more and more hostile as time goes by. There are no aliens, robots or other futuristic machines and this apparent lack of fantasy offers a significant touch of realism.I recommend this film not only for the die-hard fans of Sci-Fi genre, but for anybody who wants to see an emotional and thrilling (occasionally filled with the specific humour of Matt Damon) story about one man against the hostility of an entire planet. Among other recent Sci-Fi movies, like Interstellar and Gravity, The Martian is also focused more on the human nature and not just on the science stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
How Ridley Scott and Matt Damon Channel Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart _ on Mars,"Some years ago, I accompanied the great director Frank Capra, whose works included life-affirming pictures like ""It's a Wonderful Life' and ""Meet John Doe,"" on a nostalgic return to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he had graduated some years before with a degree in chemical engineering.While there, Capra met with a group of students who had formed an informal film club, for which they shot clever home movies basically for their own pleasure.Capra patiently waded through the eight-millimeter silent films, which were actually pretty good, and offered some sage advice that applied not only to these little snippets but to movies in general.First, he said, movies have to have a beginning, a middle and an end, not just be a blurb of cinematic virtuosity that goes nowhere for no particular reason, and second, the characters in the film have to be someone the audience in some way cares about. (He would note during a later meeting I had with him that the reason ""E.T."" was so successful was that it was, in his words, ""a love story between the boy and the alien."")I mention all of this because a portion of ""The Martian,"" director Ridley Scott's new science fiction movie starring Matt Damon, takes place at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed by Caltech for NASA.It's impossible to watch this film and not be reminded of Capra's words. The bright faces and eager minds on the screen helping us wend our way through the story are not unlike those of the young film students I encountered with Capra at Caltech those many years ago.Interestingly, Damon has been called the new Jimmy Stewart, whose career was cemented by his association with Capra in films like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""You Can't Take It with You"" and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" Damon, like Stewart, is a terrifically appealing actor who meets the Capra standard of being someone audiences really care about.Even more intriguingly, it's not a stretch to say that Stewart _ a decorated World War II pilot who would go on to achieve the rank of brigadier general in the Air Force, and who himself played the ultimate lone-wolf-in-the-sky, Charles Lindbergh, in the 1957 film ""The Spirit of St. Louis,"" as well as the lead in other flight-oriented pictures like ""Strategic Air Command,"" ""No Highway in the Sky"" and ""Flight of the Phoenix"" _ might have been greatly interested in this role.If indeed Damon is the new Jimmy Stewart, then Ridley Scott, at least with ""The Martian,"" might here be called the new Frank Capra.Like Capra, Scott in ""The Martian"" emphasizes what is best about man and the human spirit. And like Stewart in those films about flying, Damon is a man who represents mankind.This film, based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel ""The Martian"" with a screenplay by Drew Goddard, stars Damon an astronaut named Mark Watney who is left behind on Mars after he is caught in an otherworldly dust storm and presumed dead.Mission commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) reluctantly decides to leave the planet with her crew.Watney, although badly injured, is very much alive, and our story begins.As luck would have it, he is a botanist and there is enough equipment left on the planet from that and past missions so that he can attempt to survive.During his efforts, Watney records a video diary in case he doesn't make it, wry and humorous descriptions and asides that are almost a movie within a movie (and it's tempting not to think of how Jimmy Stewart might have handled the scenes as well, in his patented offhanded natural way).A fascinating parallel story has NASA officials reacting back on Earth, both in all their glory as technological whizzes and pioneers, and at their nadir as techno-politicians reaching for ways to spin the possible impending tragedy of losing an astronaut to their own advantage.The film has a solid cast, and along with Damon and Chastain in the leads, features in supporting roles Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.If I have a problem with the film, it might be that the dialogue is a little too heavy in technological jargon (that may or may not be accurate), and that some of the plot devices seem a bit contrived.But then I think about those great Capra-Stewart films, which critics also complained were too contrived, to the point that they derisively labeled them ""Capra-corn.""If this is corn, I'll take it any time. It's a luscious, beautiful film, made for all the right reasons. Mainly, it's just plain fun to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Mars no far away,Thought the movie is fiction but the things like growing food on mars is not too far away. With all the efforts our space companies putting to make this fiction a reality will show results soon.The second aspect that I liked about the movie was the joining hands of Chinese and US space agencies for the greater cause of humanity. If we share what we know with all others then we can expect a speed up space exploration missions.The center stage the movie was Matt Damon and he really performed to the pitch perfection. Movies which are centered at a single personality sometimes get boring but this movie was not felt boring at any point of time.I will recommend this movie to everyone who really wants to see the pure acting.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Book is Better,"Those of you who have read the book, ""The Martian"" are probably going to be somewhat disappointed with the movie version.First of all, in the book, our protagonist talks to himself all the time, and his dialog with himself is very funny. Much of this is left out of the movie, and therefore, a lot of the funny moments are nonexistent.The movie also leaves out much of the harrowing trip to the rocket that will get him off the planet and the many obstacles that he has to overcome to get there.The costumes are excellent and the scenery is believable, but this movie did not do justice to the excellent and exciting book, ""The Martian.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A little less ""Apollo 13"", a little more ""Cast Away""...","I read many critics calling ""The Martian"" formulaic but I think it's a half-empty glass way to look at it. In fact, like many great movies, its plot is driven by two great concepts borrowed from other movies, but put together making a greater concept with a novelty as the cherry on the cake. Basically, ""The Martian"" is ""Apollo 13"" and ""Cast Away"" on Mars, and it's so obvious I just read other reviews mentioning this combo, so I think we're reaching a general consensus here.Anyway, ""The Martian"" has the crisis-management and triumph-of-human-brain-over-natural-adversity theme that usually inspire entertaining, pedagogical and inspirational stories, and it has the inevitable 'stranded in a desert island' vibe only this time, in a more exotic landscape, if exotic also means hostile, hellish... and reddish, well you can't get worse than being left alone in Mars, like Mark Watney. It's not the first film set on Mars, so not quite a novelty, but still, the first by Ridley Scott, so in terms of production designs and recreation of an extra-terrestrial setting, we have a director who mastered the Sci-fi genre at a time where half ""The Martian"" cast was watching 'Sesame Street'.On that level, ""The Martian"" is perfect to a documentary-like level.Now, let's get back to our combo. In ""Apollo 13"" department, the film delivers exactly what we expect with the whole brainstorming moments, the internal tensions and conflicts within the NASA operators, the ethical dilemmas, the last-minute solutions, the decisions to make fast, and all these moments are served by terrific performances, especially from a trio of great actors Sean Bean, Chiwetel Efigogor and Jeff Daniels (whom I suspect is promised to play many authoritarian figures in the future given how natural bossy charisma he exudes). ""The Martian"" isn't just a thrilling race against the Martian clock, it's also a great film about management. And that's where my criticism starts; the film should've been an ever better one about self-management.I think ""The Martian"" lacked a little something on this aspect. We have a man, who's trapped in a planet, alone, with no one to help him light-years around, and for some reason, there's no real moment where Damon 'feels' alone, starting with the fact that he talks to his audience (in fact, a camera installed in the base, where he can leave information and messages 'for the record') it's the first departure from the usual 'desert island' silent discoveries, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. Actually, it was quite a pleasant surprise, not to have the character immediately desperate or scared, here's a guy who's trained to resist the pressure whether in a vessel or a stressful situation. Besides, he strikes as a very optimistic nature, capable to throw a few hilarious one-liners and it's like the situation is critical enough not to inject some extra level of pathos, and that's fine at first.Not only it's fine, but it's also realistic. Mark has the oxygen (available thanks to the oxygenator), but he's got to find out how to make food and water and water to make food, so there's no time to waste. And that's why the beginning is so promising in ""The Martian"", it doesn't waste time, as if it was governed by the very urgency of the situation. Noland in ""Cast Away"" was alone, but he had food and water, the real struggle was to cope with loneliness and accept his nihilistic future. Watney has no alternative, he does something or he dies, it's pure survival instinct. Do or do not, there's no try. And then, we see him, working for his life, growing plants, eating, drinking, exploring the planet, step by step, making first rudimentary contacts with the NASA, and then being able to communicate. But after one hour, he 'chats' with his NASA colleagues and, he's just like the child trapped in a well.My personal regret is that we never get a true emotional impression on his loneliness, it's physical, but the film is so in a rush to get to the rescue part that it doesn't allow itself at least ten or fifteen minutes for the main character. And I mean that because he was a fascinating, well-acted and intriguing one, so they could afford a little extra time for moments where basically 'nothing' happens, and where we try to find out what's going up in his mind. I understand Watney is supposed to be a sort of wisecracking guy, who's not probably the type of man to directly express his feelings, it's part of his nature, but that's what would have made a real breakdown, an emotionally rewarding moment. I waited desperately to see him reach a breaking point, to throw the potatoes all over the place, to cry of pain, hunger, exhaustion, but we never get that moment and it's a pity.It's a pity because I think it's precisely for this reason some perceived the film as formulaic, because it didn't take more chances with Damon. I don't mean to 'intellectualize' the film that much, it's a matter of emotions more than analysis, ""The Martian"" had the entertainment valued so locked up that it could allow us to get deeper in the character, a sort of character study, without cheap emotional moments, just the nice amount. Not that it prevented Damon from getting his Oscar nomination, I guess he showed a few signs of vulnerability here and there, behind his restrained facade, but I wish there could be more ""Oscar-baity"" moments, and be a real threat to Di Caprio this year, who had a flashier 'survivor' role in ""The Revenant"".But again, the designs were impeccable, the landscapes breath-taking, the special effects spectacular (once again, old-school Ridley Scott) and the acting good with a honorable mention to Jessica Chastain I forgot to mention. ""The Martian"" is great entertainment, I wish it was just less about the rescue than the rescued.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Robbed of awards,"For me the combination of Riddley Scott and Matt Damon sounds like the recipe for the best movie ever. But there are several 'However's. Some of the concepts are a little far fetched and let's be brutally honest: I was expecting Matt to find a basketball and paint a face on it. Those negatives aside, it was robbed of awards by that straight to DVD abomination of Crap Max. The Martian keeps one gripped with the isolation and desperation of trying to cling on to life. Predictibale. Done before. But why change something if it isn't broken. I'd give it 10 if they had just made it a bit less fluffy and more dark.

The Martian is a rare Science Fiction film that focuses on human connection above all else.,"Most Science Fiction movies focus so much on the narrative and scientific elements that they tend to lose focus on the key ingredient; human connection. This however, is where the Martian thrives. Director Ridley Scott has put together a (mostly) feel good experience that has been missing from his most recent films. The character Mark Watney from Andy Weir's best selling novel has been brought to life in a thoroughly entertaining performance by Matt Damon. The film gives you a hero to root for throughout this tremendous ride hitting you with highs and lows until the final scene plays out.The beginning of the film drops us into a Mars mission named Ares III where Watney and his crew are in the middle of a massive dust storm. During an effort to evacuate, Watney is hit with flying debris sending him airborne away from his crew. When his vital readings go offline, the crew assumes his death and are forced to evacuate without him. As the world mourns his death, Watney wakes on the red planet abandoned and alone. His only means of survival are his wits and the limited resources left behind. Luckily for him, the mission was cut short, leaving him a months supply of food. The only issue; He doesn't have a chance at rescue for 4 years. Once NASA becomes alerted of his survival, they and Watney are tasked with not only plotting a rescue mission, but figuring out how to keep him alive in the process.Even though the film revolves around the audiences connection with Watney, the special effects and visuals still take center stage. Filmed in Jordan to simulate Mars, the setting is breathtaking. Vast red deserts covered in rocky sculptures give the illusion that Watney is somewhere other then our home planet. The seemingly absurd situation that our main character is in creates a lot of sarcastic humor that goes along way in balancing the mood. Watney is left with a laptop full of disco music as his only means of entertainment which creates a unique way to use the soundtrack of the film as a comedic outlet as well. Matt Damon gives a heroic performance in illustrating the emotional limits Watney has to endure. His dry humor is perfect in brightening the mood and his resolve in such a dire situation is impossible not to root for. The snappy dialogue, great performances and a few heart stopping action scenes highlight the Martian but what the film does best is touch on your emotions while pulling for the hero.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Bring Him...an Oscar?,"I just want to be clear here. I know a lot of people are claiming that the science in this movie is outrageous and unbelievable. I am no scientist by any stretch of the imagination. I took one semester of Chemistry in high school. However, even I know that the science depicted in this movie and, more specifically, the book is actually quite conceivable. There are obviously factors that are, for lack of a better word, stretched, but almost completely the science is still POSSIBLE. That is what I find most interesting. So, be careful before writing a review that this movie is impossible or, at the very least, unconvincing.With that said, this is my favorite movie of 2015. Though I doubt that it will win Best Picture at the 88th Academy Awards, it certainly is worthy of its nod. Matt Damon is absolutely at his finest and is certainly one of my favorites for Best Actor. He achieves an acting performance that even surpasses Tom Hanks (for whom I have a soft spot), in Zemeckis's Cast Away. The supporting cast is lovely. More interestingly, I am thoroughly impressed with Goddard's adaptation. After reading the book (which I did after watching the movie), I was blown away that Goddard could craft such a fiction into a film (and one that is in fact even better than an already great book). And of course, Ridley Scott is brilliant. The visuals of this movie are beautiful. I went to see this on a whim. I actually wanted to see Bridge of Spies of but didn't have the chance. I decided to watch this on the basis that ""eh, it looks pretty good."" I was not disappointed. This movie will surprise you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Beautiful, engaging and funny","A great movie, scenery and clean effects, very good actors, especially the excellent performance Matt Damon, and lean and coherent script. The Martian might seem just another science fiction film, well, it is rather a film genre, however, is not ""just another"", he gets all the credit for innovating in the approach to the subject, differing quite recent successes in this category, rather than trying to follow the realistic mold and serious Interstellar or even the tension and paranoia of gravity, the film is based on completely different bases and behind an engaging story of sci-fi with an excellent mood and that is embedded incredible way within the script, by the way, this is perhaps the greatest asset of the film, it does not come as a comedy, but the good mood prevails throughout most of history which makes it much more engaging to the audience. About the same, the film shows no innovative plot, may be even classified as simple, but even that makes it all even better job, even with a story that you basically know how it will end, you still yes hooks you - you know going back to rescue him, but how? - And in all other respects it never seems forced or without cohesion. The visual effects are excellent as well, leaving the film as a whole extremely ""beautiful."" Matt Damon is fine, giving his charisma character, a sardonic air at various times, dramatic when it is necessary, in addition to appearance changes that show a huge commitment. In short, The Martian is more of a science fiction movie at a time of re-popularization of the genre, but innovating in the approach of its proposal, out of default, has an indisputable success, avoids saturation of this kind of movie and shows that science fiction has much more to give, certainly one of the best 2015 productions.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An Imperfect yet Enjoyable Sci-Fi Shipwrecked Tale,"Andy Weir's novel of the same name, originally self-published in 2011, was quickly optioned by 20th Century Fox as its popularity soared. Ridley Scott ultimately helmed its translation to screen which was released in October of 2015. It tells the story of Mark Watney, a botanist aboard the Ares III, a manned mission to Mars, who must, as he put it, ""science the sh*t out of this"", in order to survive. Audiences are treated to a lone man against nature whose superpower is ingenuity. However, the jocular tone prevents us from making a connection with Watney. Instead of seeing him agonize over lost family (he mentions his parents once but has no partner or children), wrestle with faith, doubt his abilities, or even feel the effects of a prolonged isolation since time whisks forward fairly briskly, Watney is neither given a chance to overcome a character flaw nor are we able to truly sympathize with his situation. His video journals are filled with too many jokes about disco music. In keeping with the lighthearted tone, we know all too well that he will overcome all obstacles and ultimately return to Earth. But we don't watch just to see him do those things, we watch to see our protagonist learn something of himself, or of society, making the climax all the more triumphant.The film is more successful with its scenes on Earth. We are privy to the closed-door negotiations about how to retrieve Watney safely. They calculate the risks and benefits of telling Watney's crew he is alive, about advancing the timeline of their next mission, about skipping safety checks, about partnering with the Chinese NASA counterpart, and about the overall cost of resources to rescue a single man. These discussions were filled with drama. But again, as these discussions span the course of years, we do not feel like we are among the world citizens gathered in their public squares in rapt attention watching the live coverage of his rescue.Though perhaps unfair to make direct comparisons to other films, The Martian does call to mind 2013's Gravity. Gravity, though perhaps suffering from its overt attempts at allegory, was both more visually stunning and engaging precisely because of its focused timeline.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Great Modern Version of Apollo 13,"I went into the screening of The Martian disappointed that Bridge of Spies was sold out and I'd have to settle for what I thought would be a lame sci-fi action flick. Boy was I surprised at how good this movie was. There is a lot going on with the story throughout the movie – yes, ""rescue Matt Damon"" is always the main plot, but the story went in unexpected and even complex directions that I didn't expect. There are the expected themes of loneliness, sacrifice, perseverance, etc., but also some really interesting scenes about corporate management, the purpose of space exploration, even about the value of a single human life. This is a movie that can serve as an entertaining popcorn flick, but it also has enough substance to be quite thought-provoking for those paying attention closely.Matt Damon gives an excellent performance, especially in the most intense scenes. Supporting actors are good as well – this is definitely a film where Jeff Daniel's ""stoic harass boss"" character fits really well as the leader of NASA. I didn't find the visuals to be as stunning as many did, but maybe that's just because I had a crappy seat in the theater off to the side.Overall, this is a great sci-fi film that actually has a lot of, well, science. It's actually pretty nerdy at times, with some cool nerd jokes thrown in. I did find some of the humor to be too forced, seemingly present simply to keep the popcorn audience watching. Bad jokes and a ridiculous but forgivable ending aside, I have no major complaints about this movie. It's a wholly satisfying 2.5 hours of entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Seriousness and Comedy on Peak Level,"The Martian is a very funny and at the same time, serious movie. It's the best when a non-comedy movie is genuinely funny.The story is very intriguing, the pacing is incredible, 142 minutes just fly away. I don't know whether this would work in real life or not, but the writers made it seem pretty real. The stakes felt very real, as a viewer you don't want bad stuff to happen, but just as in real life, those things happen in this movie too, which helps it seem even more realistic.The cinematography is gorgeous, the soundtrack elevates the excitement. The sound effects were also really good. I don't know how many visual effects shots they used, but everything looked pretty real to me. There was only one shot, that I had to stop, because I realized it was filmed in Budapest, Hungary. At least some of the scenes involving the NASA centre. Of course I wouldn't have noticed that, if I hadn't been living there.The cast was an other major factor that helped this movie seem realistic, because all the actors were phenomenal.

More humour than I expected in a fine film,"There was controversy at the Golden Globes last month when 'The Martian' was nominated in the 'Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical' category, and in fact went on to win it. By that stage I hadn't seen it but had been told by many people (host Ricky Gervais included) that this was an absurd category for it to be placed in. So I went into the film expecting to find a deadly serious tone, however what I found was instead justification for it being put in that category. Amost all of Matt Damon's scenes are like a little comedy skit on his part. The rest of the cast play it very seriously but he is undoubtedly the star and if his scenes are all that way I see no issue with labeling it, at least partly, as a comedy.Damon has in fact been nominated for an Academy Award for Actor in a Lead Role for his performance here. He was personally helped by the category choice at the Golden Globes when he was able to take home the award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. On that occasion his competition was almost non-existent. Sadly at the Oscars it will be a different story, no one is taking that award off Leonardo DiCaprio. Damon is impressive in his role though, he has an ability to be charming without ever coming across cocky or arrogant. He's the guy you want to root for and thus was perfectly cast in 'The Martian'.The film has also been nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Again I would call it almost a 0% chance of winning but that shouldn't take away from a well deserved nomination. For a film about a guy on a distant planet all by himself there is never a dull moment. Director Ridley Scott does a terrific job of pacing the film and the above average runtime of 144 minutes never drags. To me it felt like a cross between 'Armegaddon' and 'Cast Away'. All the elements of an epic blockbuster are there, while never forgetting about the emotional side of the characters and story. A well executed film that will be enjoyable for the entire spectrum of audience members.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Martian - 500 Days of Mars !!,"""The Martian"" - a film about a man who gets stranded in Mars waiting for rescue from Earth. Matt Damon depicts the role of Mark Watney, a Botanist cum Astronaut. Filled with humour, Matt has done a great job in acting as always. He justifies his role as a lonely guy in a planet, but the scenes where he is shown in Mars did not give us a complete depth that he was alone,implying that Scott has done it necessarily thereby reducing the sensitive part of loneliness or at least I presume so. A great attempt at that,which can truly be appreciated. The pace of the film was always good, there are some scenes in the second half which will test your patience but none the less, they will be forgotten along the film.On the note of acting, I personally couldn't find any of the character's acting extraordinary. Each and every character did what they intended to but they also stick to our mind at the end of the film so none of the characters can necessarily be said as wasted.Matt can be given the thumbs up for acting because it didn't look like he was pushing himself to give the best performance, it was with ease with which he gives us the role.Scott, one of the most renowned directors before certain years definitely deserves this film as to be his comeback. I have seen a lot of Scott's film, he's a master in giving us a commercial flick but at the same time filled with all the vital elements that should reside in a GREAT film. ""The Martian"" can definitely be considered as one of the good films that got released this year. Bottomline, this is a good film which gives a average movie-goer all he wants but this cannot be considered as a GREAT film as this has only shades of it.

"Damon as Martian was good, with DiCaprio would be great...","In short, it is yet another story of a castaway. This time he is on Mars, alone and left for dead. This film is the work of the master of the genre: Ridley Scott (Alien, Prometheus ...). The effects and scenery are very realistic. As a strictly science fiction movie, we can't ask for more. However, the drama misses the mark. The acting miserably lacks passion and intensity. Again Matt Damon, this Hollywood ""pretty boy"" plays out in one of his two trademark registers: the ""good guy"" or the ""eternal teenager."" This time he offers us the first. Never do we really believe in the hopelessness of our hero. One can only imagine what Leonardo DiCaprio would have done with this role. DiCaprio has become in my opinion, the best American actor of his generation. As for the others, a lot of talent is left stranded. Jeff Daniels, who is capable of so much madness on screen, is like a robot and unfortunately the immense talent of Jessica Chastain boils down to close-ups of her luscious lips. For a realistic glimpse of the future of space exploration, it is a very good film. Nothing revolutionary as was ""2001 ..."", but very competent.

Best commercial made for NASA and space travel made in years,"Let it be said up front, I am a huge fan of science-fiction to the point where I've watched just about every classic and non-classic. Ridley Scott of course is a master of the genre with Blade Runner, Alien and Prometheus. With such an outstanding resume, one expects a lot from a new sci-fi movie from Scott.About that, The Martian barely seems like sci-fi, the technology shown and the 'modest' scope of the mission, sets this film within the next 20-30 years (my guess). As such it is as film that feels present day and I think that is what Ridley Scott set out to achieve.It is no secret that space travel and NASA enthusiasm isn't what it used to be. The sci-fi optimism of the 70s and 80s has been almost fully replaced with doom scenarios of zombie apocalypse or broken futures. Ridley Scott has at least done his part with The Martian, to bring back excitement and relevance to the NASA mission. Honestly, no government bureaucrat or PR firm could devise a better advertisement for NASA than this film. The Martian will undoubtedly make clever 12 year olds sit glued to the screen and plant the dream of space travel in their minds. The result we will see in the next decades.I haven't touched on the actual cinematic experience, which has been reviewed by many others, but it's a great looking film, stunning visuals as always with Scott and it always feels real. Matt Damon brings an A+ performance, most of the time making me forget that this is Jason Bourne or Matt Damon at all and that I suppose is the greatest compliment to an acting performance.The film is somewhat short on personal drama and development although the cast does an excellent job. There's no romance, no family drama back home, in fact Damon's character doesn't seem to have a family except parents. The actors are well cast in their roles and do not suffer from needless Hollywood 'cool and pretty' standard (like in Promethus) though Kate Mara could never not be stunning, even if she tried.The film is nerdy in that way. It really is as much about the great and almost supernatural feats of science needed to make something as a Mars mission work. As such it is again a great advocate for STEM fields and undoubtedly will inspire many young boys and girls to go into those.All in all, this was one of the best and most gripping sci-fi movies made in a long time. Ridley Scott remains the uncontested heavyweight champ of Sci-Fi.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"excellent in design, lacking in story","The production design and cinematography is excelling, unfortunately the story is a feel good us-american patriotic film that could have been way more. The acting is on fleek on the other hand.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Sort of a mix of Castaway and Gravity,"Super good, enjoyed this one a lot. Sort of a mix of Castaway and Gravity with Matt Damon taking on the deserted Hanks role, explaining things to a video diary along the way after he is left stranded on Mars and presumed dead by his crew. With meager supplies he must find a way to contact Earth, make oxygen and grow some food. Its very funny and Damon seems to be having a great time.It did feel a bit too long but in saying that I also can't think of any scenes that were unnecessary. Great special effects and finally a movie using CGI and green screens to enhance the movie not just BE the movie as is often the case these days, where movies forget about a story and just become special effect extravaganzas.It gets a bit over-the-top towards the end with Damon in his Ironman reminiscent suit but I went with it. Worth a watch.Oh, this is based on a book by Andy Weir and directed by Ridley Scott.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"
