Warm and Human British Comedy,"Notting Hill is a district of west London that was built as a fashionable Victorian suburb, became very run down during the mid twentieth century and is now once again fashionable, but which retains a distinctly cosmopolitan atmosphere, with London's biggest street market and many small specialist shops. (My wife and I sometimes go there to shop for bargains). The hero of the film, William Thacker, is the owner of one of these shops, a travel bookshop. The film concerns the romance which develops between William and a young woman named Anna Scott whom he meets when she comes into his shop.As another reviewer has pointed out, 'Notting Hill' is based around a theme, love between people of unequal social standing, which has provided literature with some of its greatest works, both comic and serious, dating back at least to the tale of King Cophetua and the beggar-maid. Although many of these stories tell of a poor but honest lad who aspires to the hand of a princess or titled lady, Anna is not part of the Royal Family or the British aristocracy. She rather belongs to an even more exclusive elite, the Hollywood starocracy. She is a hugely popular film star who earns at least $15,000,000 per film, and pops into William's shop during a brief stay in London to publicise her latest movie.Although Anna is played by a real-life Hollywood superstar, Julia Roberts, the film is very typically British. William is similar to an number of other Hugh Grant characters, being a shy, diffident middle-class Englishman, probably public-school and university educated. (Despite this background, he is not particularly wealthy following a divorce from his first wife and is forced to share his lodgings with an eccentric Welsh flatmate, Spike). The humour of the film, particularly the dinner-party banter between William and his friends, is mostly of the typically ironic, self-deprecating variety popular in Britain, especially in middle-class circles. Rhys Ifans's Spike, by contrast, typifies another strand of British humour, the eccentric zaniness found in the likes of 'Monty Python'. Spike's strong provincial accent suggests a more working-class background; this possibly accounts for the teasing that he has to put up with from the other characters, although he takes it all in good part.William may be diffident, self-deprecating and unsuccessful, but he is probably the stronger of the two main characters. Anna is beautiful and successful, but underneath it all she is insecure, worried about losing her fame and fortune and about her inability to form lasting relationships with men. Early on in the film she has another boyfriend, Jeff, but it is clear that he is only the latest in a long string of unsatisfactory romances which have left her emotionally (and in some cases physically) bruised. The scene where Anna says to William 'I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her' is the one where we see her at her most vulnerable. Although both characters are in their late twenties or thirties, it is noteworthy that Anna refers to 'girl and boy' rather than 'woman and man'. Anna's vulnerability also comes through in her reaction in the scene where hordes of paparazzi appear on William's doorstep; William tries to play down the incident, and Spike finds it hugely amusing, but Anna is horrified. (The film was made shortly after the death of Princess Diana; this scene possibly reflects British disgust with the antics of the paparazzi, who were regarded as being partly to blame for the Princess's death). Like others, I found myself wondering how much Anna's personality reflects Julia Roberts's own; she too has had a number of unhappy relationships.Important roles are also played by Tim McInnerny and Gina McKee as William's best friend Max and his disabled wife Bella; the love of this ordinary couple for each other provides a more realistic, down-to-earth counterpart to the fairy-tale romance of William and Anna, helping to anchor the film more firmly in reality. The main charm, however, lies in the relationship of the two main characters, as Anna comes to realise that the seemingly ordinary William has a kindness and decency which count for more than the monstrous egos of Jeff and his like. Like 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', which was also written by Richard Curtis and starred Hugh Grant, 'Notting Hill' is one of the warmest and most human British films of the nineties. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny and Touching ...,"This movie is almost entirely character driven and it is great. It's very funny, positive and enjoyable. The story is very simple - classic boy meets girl (or vice-versa) scenario. However, Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts' outstanding performances propel this movie to greatness.Hugh Grant delivers one of his best 'average, humble' guy performances in this movie. Many of his lines were some of the most witty and clever dialog I've heard in a while. Almost reminds me of how Jimmy Stewart could mumble lines and come off as brilliant.Julia Roberts was sparkling as a somewhat forward but grounded movie star that one could relate to. It was pleasant to see lots of big smiles from Julia.The other characters were literally 'characters' - bizarre, off-beat, odd-ball, goofy - but at heart warm and enjoyable to watch.If you're in the mood for a good laugh and pleasant movie-going experience, this is a great movie to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Media goldfish bowl,"Notting Hill is a neighborhood in London and it's the title of a romantic comedy
starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Two of the most unlikely lovers you could
ever imagine get together here.Grant is the respectable, but somewhat dull proprietor of a bookstore in Notting
Hill which specializes in travel books. It looks like he's getting by, but truth be
told Grant's perfectly happy with just making enough to pay the bills and a little
extra.Back in the day after she retired from the screen for almost 50 years it was one
of those urban legends in New York City to spot Greta Garbo out and about and you'd never know but when she might get a notion to stop into a bookstore like Grant's. In this case Julia Roberts plays a movie star not unlike
the real Julia Roberts. Garbo mysterious she's not.For if she was I doubt Hugh Grant would have considered approaching her. As
for Roberts she's looking at Grant as a bit of respite from her life in the media

fantasy. I mean who doesn't have a fantasy of wooing and winning some
celebrity you might admire or be crushing out on. In that sense Notting Hill
has a universal appeal.In an unbilled part Alec Baldwin plays her boyfriend whom we learn little about factually. But he comes across as an egotistical fathead. One thing
you're certain of, no matter what happens with Grant, Roberts and Baldwin

Brit Wit Rom Com in one of London's most famous districts,"After reading the synopsis, 'Notting Hill' sounds like just another melodramatic Julia Roberts rom com. Fortunately, that ain't the case. 'Notting Hill' is fun, sweet, intelligent and  well, simply said, very entertaining. London's Notting Hill does seem like a street you'd like to walk on.While the storyline itself is larger than life, the characters are real. There is no overt melodrama. We can see that Curtis put a lot of heart and some Brit wit humour into the writing. After meeting William, Anna, Spike, Max, Bella and Honey, we, as audience, really connect to these very interesting characters and care about them. The table discussion in Honey's birthday scene shows how all the characters connect. While a nervous Anna, is new to the group, we see that she eventually gets a hang of them and feels comfortable enough to talk about herself.Hugh Grant isn't anything different from his other rom coms. Julia Roberts is brilliant. I never liked any of her romantic comedies (e.g. Pretty Woman, I Love Trouble, Something to Talk About etc) but 'notting Hill is an exception. She gives a subtle portrayal as hugely famous but very vulnerable Anna Scott and does full justice. This indeed is one of her finest performances. Rhys Ifans as Spike is standout! While Tim McInnerny, Emma Chambers, Hugh Bonneville and Gina McKee (love her) are excellent. McKee's comedy is extremely subtle and her character is one of the most appealing. She underplays her part with tremendous grace and maturity.All the actors share a very warm chemistry that just keeps adding on to its quality. The relationship and friendship between the characters is shown in a very sensitive way. While Spike and William are roommates who just seem to get along, we know that they like each other. Also William is about to cancel a date with the world's most famous actress to attend his sister's birthday party. The relationship between Max and Bella is beautiful.Additional credit must be given to Coulter's amazing cinematography and the visuals. Watch the scene where Thacker is walking through the market and we see the weather change (indicating the passing time). There's a beautiful soundtrack that recites the moods of the scenes. And last but not least, thanks to Roger Mitchell for putting it all together to tell us this sweet entertaining story.",,Anonymous,Romance
How is Hugh Grant more charming than Julia Roberts in this?,"The funny thing about Notting Hill is that Hugh Grant comes off as more charming than Julia Roberts. William Thacker (Grant) remains poised & polite throughout all the madness happening in his life, whereas Anna Scott (Roberts) becomes unlikable at times. Still, this romantic comedy is full of likable characters and amusing moments. I thoroughly enjoyed each dinner scene, especially the interactions between Bella (Gina McKee) and Max (Tim McInnerny). Notting Hill isn't one of my favorite creations by Richard Curtis, but it features many elements I like from his writing and it's an enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cute but Empty,"Julia Roberts playing a famous American movie star wasn't quite a stretch and yet it felt unconvincing. The humor works the second you're seeing it but then it vanishes into thin air. It feels self conscious and forced. Once all that is said, ""Notting Hill"" emerges as a pleasant enough improbable romantic comedy in the ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"" mold without ever reaching the smart, disarming charm of its model. Hugh Grant is lovely in a part destined to seem Hugh Grantish with all the clipped bit of nonsense that have made Grant a household name. The quirky friends and bizarre room mates are the questionable salt and pepper of this romantic tale. I found myself smiling, getting impatient and enjoying it, all at the same time. I'm too much of a Preston Sturgess fan to be able to sit through a modern comedy in the way I did with ""The Lady Eve"" for instance. My favorite moment: The Horse and Hound sequence. Very funny. If you've never seen a Preston Sturgess, Ernst Lubitch or Billy Wilder comedy, you may like ""Notting Hill"" much more than I did.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Simply the best, better than all the rest.","I think I've watched this movie about 20 times. I adore it, adore the idea, adore the script and simply love the way it has been produced. I'll probably watch it again wayyyyy too soon.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Some bad choices hold this back from greatness,"I'm a sucker for most romantic comedies, and I must admit that Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are like a dream-team to star in a rom-com. I also adore the premise of this movie, because it naturally creates situations that will be humorous. Any time the mega-famous interact with ordinary people it is potentially funny, and I particularly love how Hugh Grant is constantly trying to downplay the whole situation. They also fill the cast with a number of hilarious characters that add to the laughs. The first dinner date that they have is easily one of the funniest scenes in a rom-com, and I love every minute of it, particularly when it gets dark for a moment and they know just when to surprise you with a joke. They do stretch the limits of believability a few times in order to manufacture more comedy, but I still think it works, particularly watching Hugh Grant stumble through media interviews in a movie's press junket. There's so much to like in Notting Hill that I almost feel like it should be one of my all-time favorites, but it isn't. So let's talk about why.First and foremost, I struggle a lot with the mean-spirited outbursts that Julia Roberts is given in the script. I feel like the massive difference in social status between the two characters is enough to create the kind of tension that is necessary to add that touch of drama required by any rom-com. But instead of relying on that, they crank her up to ten, and have her be downright vile to our protagonist. In the end, I struggle along with Hugh Grant's character to decide if forgiveness is the best course, because that kind of personality trait isn't going to just disappear. The other thing about Notting Hill that has always bugged me are the needle drops. I know this is going to sound like nitpicking because this isn't the kind of thing I ever notice, but it stands out like a sore thumb here. Every single song they plop into this movie is easily the most cliched or on-the-nose choice, and that rendition of ""She"" by Elvis Costello is nauseating. Aside from these bad choices, Notting Hill is a solid film, I just wish they tweaked it a little more to make it great.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sparkling romance at a deliberate British pace,"It may be a paradox to say that a film can sparkle slowly, yet that's the only way I can describe this charming romantic comedy. The star(dom)-crossed lovers don't know that they are Meant For Each Other ... yes, this is the standard RomCom setup. But the -way- they don't know? That is put across in a most British and deliberate pace and setting. And it makes the ending that we all know is coming gather color and charm.""Notting Hill"" takes over a third of its running time to show William (Hugh Grant) as he is immersed in his daily life, wanting to be supportive of his friends, yet searching for his own inner life. The five closest friends all show something he lacks: ""happy"" conformity, a loving marriage transcending obstacles, a sister who takes bold risks for finding love, and a roommate that sees through pretense and says so (and, yes, is delightfully vulgar).That very British character-in-a-wry-setting pattern borrows from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" but the only friends there that I could consistently believe -mattered- to Grant's character were the gay couple, one comic, the other showing profound emotion. Here, all of the lead character's circle deeply cares about him, as he does about them. This makes all the difference.Where it matters most is in giving him support when the American film beauty (Julia Roberts) comes into his life, then out, then in, then ... and all in ways that are believable for such dissimilar lovers. The romantic turns are more plausible because Grant's character has such support and a place for sharing his emotional roller-coaster ride. He isn't crushed by the down moments, but picks up his individuality and moves on. And his friends tell him, sometimes with only searching looks, just when he's picked up -too much- of being on his own. (Okay, the moment towards the end when Spike puts his exasperation into three pointed, even vulgar, words is a refreshing change. Sometimes, when a friend lets loose with the pithy truth, it hits the needed spot.)All this backstory, character richness, and pointed use of the ""right"" words are British qualities that we don't get with the standard American RomCom setup.Gina McKee's turn here as Grant's wheelchair-bound female friend is of someone with deeply felt individuality and unique perceptiveness, including her own tender perspective on loves past and present - especially her husband. It's a glimpse into a woman with distinctive qualities that -she- has chosen. This makes her both appealing to all her friends, and forceful by quiet understatement. She also ends up being much funnier, when you've rewound the tape and end up thinking about the story. (Listen for her spoken turn on ""standing up."" No, it's not a cheap play on her limitations. Not in context. And that's subtle comic acting.)Richard Curtis's inventive screenplay is one of the best in years, and would reward a look in book form as well. He takes this backdrop of supportive friends, puts in the sparkle of Roberts invading and shaking up their world, and creates a skein of personal truths and imposed celebrity nonsense.Grant and Roberts are both passionate and bemused observers of the absurdities of fame that end up surrounding them, but they act this out in comic byplay and inventive responses. This isn't an American breakneck-pace (or ""screwball"") comedy, and their subtle discovery of each other's -minds- and substance wouldn't work in such a setting.Roberts has both the easy familiarity with and the hair-trigger of frustration from fame, both coming out to undermine her when she least expects it. But she shows that she can grow and learn from her mistakes. (Unlike her well-acted but overexplained realization at the end of ""Runaway Bride."") She even has one scene -sans- makeup that is a genuine romantic turning point. I don't see many other actresses being willing to try that.Grant shows an astonishing inner strength and self-awareness, not being willing to hide how -he- sees reality. (He did the same realistic turn in ""Four Weddings,"" but didn't try nearly as effectively to figure himself out.)The photography and settings show off London beautifully, and the story's interior scenes make highly imaginative use of a narrow, stacked-up Notting Hill mini-townhouse.I do feel the director fails to take up some opportunities to build on the comic or dramatic moments in the screenplay. He coasts on the words. They're excellent words, but they need a twist at times.My only take-off-a-point[*] quibble is with the music. It's mostly popular tunes that underscore the action. One of these is luminous, and frames the story perfectly - Elvis Costello's cover of ""She."" Others, though, use their lyrics to overstress plot points. Some are performed too high in volume, sometimes lapping against dialogue.(The two original themes by Trevor Jones are beautiful, lushly written, and quite fitting to the main characters. We should have had more of his work, but they're less than a fourth of the film's music.)The British often put more creativity below the narrative surface and into the setting than Americans do, and often get beyond formula. To discover this in a film is joyous. You'll feel this when you find yourself compelled to see this deeply felt, yet very funny, film twice, thrice, or more. For me, it's still delightful after nine months and nine viewings.[* Edited on 21 April 2011: After another decade and another ten viewings, this love story has only become more resonant and beautiful. The pop-song choices feel notably less obtrusive. The acting of both Roberts and Grant has evinced more depth. And I see no reason to not give it a full 10 rating.]",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
There's Notting much to love,"Here's my issue with this movie: there are so many vivid characters and they're so funny with an army of veteran British acting talent to make them pop off the screen...Yet the main focus of the movie is on such a bland character with no personality beyond feeling sorry for herself and looking good naturedly over sunglasses.The movie actually tries to sell you the idea that she should have your pity.Like most of this kind of movie, the central narrative is derivative and plain but all the little moments of comedy that adorn it are a joy.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sweet Film,"Notting Hill proves one thing -- jokes lie in the oddest places.  This film is an excellent vehicle for Julia Roberts to put her own life as an actress under the microscope.  While Roberts' ""Anna Scott"" character isn't an autobiographical figure, the Scott character allows for some biting satire at the life of Roberts herself.  Need I mention some excellent one liners in the film like the sister of Hugh Grant... ""I feel like we are sisters"", an excellent throw-back to ""My Best Friend's Wedding""...  or my favourite, a discussion about nude body doubles just before a nude Julia Roberts (or a Julia Roberts body double) crosses the screen.Apart from the small bit of satire, Grant's character plays on the emotions of every guy who has ever unexplainably fell in to, threw orange juice-on, lost out on, and fell back in to love.  Roberts character can only help us understand how such a relationship as the one her and Grant share in the movie, could be ""Surreal, but nice.""A sweet film surely not to be missed!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Very predicaable and not too ""charming"" or funny.",I was overall not too impressed with this movie. I found it to be very predictable and not too funny as well. Julia Roberts plays an actress- Anna Scott- who is filming a movie in London and meets a normal Joe named William and they develop a romance. I didnt think the love story between William and Anna was well developed at all. She was a total bitch to him and any normal guy would have dropped her like a bad habit instead of being such a chump. Spike the roommate was funny but hard to believe a guy could be that big of a dork in real life. The ending was typical and very predictable. I give this movie 6/10.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the Few Romantic Modern Romantic Comedies that WORK!,"Julia Roberts is the queen of Romantic Comedies. Her iconic role in Pretty Woman should give her the title alone, but she's been in tons, some good while others weren't. However, she chose a good one in Notting Hill.Notting Hill is a sweet, good-natured romantic comedy that succeeds on every level it is trying to be. The story is well-written and more original then it may come off from the trailers. This is a film about movie stars that actually have meaningful conversations about being movie stars. Hugh Grant is also dashing in the leading man role. Roberts actually gives best ""Rom-Com"" performance here, aside from the Oscar-Nominated, Pretty Woman. She restrains herself and isn't loud or obnoxious, just true to the character. This is some of her most underrated work.With beautiful shots of London and a sweeping romance, Notting Hill is an example for future romantic comedies. I only had one problem: there is a huge gap in the middle where Roberts is off in America. I understood it was important to the story, but it didn't have to last 20 minutes. This is her story as much as it Grant's, but the writers put her on the back-burner.While the ending is predictable, it's sweet and makes you smile. Wonderful film; 8.5",,Anonymous,Romance

"Warm, charming and pleasant","This film was surprisingly good, not my favourite romantic comedy in the world, and personally I think Love Actually and Four Weddings and a Funeral are better. But it is a good film, thanks to the strong performances, fresh script and the film's look. While not laugh out loud funny, Notting Hill is nonetheless warm and charming. The script is fresh, sometimes funny, sometimes insightful. The part where Anna says ""I am just a girl, standing in front of a boy, waiting for him to love her"", may be cringe worthy to some people, but for me no matter how clichéd it is it shows a vulnerable side to Anna's character. The film is based on love revolved around unequal social standing, William being diffident and unsuccessful, Anna being the complete opposite. The photography is fabulous and the direction is excellent. Hugh Grant is charming as William and Julia Roberts is positively luminous as Anna, and the two have strong chemistry. Out of the supporting performers, Rhys Ifans stands out in a very zany turn as Spike. The music is lovely too. All in all, this is very warm, charming and pleasant, yeah the ending is predictable, but this is a well written and quite irresistible film. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Underneath this saccharine romantic-comedy-by-the-numbers lies an intriguing reflection of our celebrity culture.,"On the surface Notting Hill may present itself as fast food for the broken heart: a harmless piece of feel-good cinema fluff that might double down a night with the Ben & Jerry's in pajama bottoms. However there's much more to this nineties formulaic screwball comedy than meets the eye.The far-fetched plot of Notting Hill draws its inspiration from previous fantasy driven screwball comedies such as Frank Capra's It Happened One Night (1934) and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936). These pioneering films in screwball comedy capitalized on the glamorized fantasy of the average Joe (or average Jane) living the unthinkable: an actual romantic, meaningful relationship with a bona fide world-famous celebrity.Capra's timeless classics however, were developed in the shadow of the Great Depression, addressing the social issues of inequality amidst the fairytale-like courtship of its protagonists. This was a crucial element to those films; it gave context and grounding for a romance that would otherwise feel completely unreal to the audience. Notting Hill seems to allude to this fictionalized awareness, with both Grant and Roberts repeating the line ""it was surreal, but nice."" This line in particular felt like a wink to us in the audience, since the filmmakers of Notting Hill are unable to make their picture entirely believable. It's as if they are telling us that we should just go along for the ride.Capra's films on the other hand, fully immerse us in their world because the celebrity and ""everyman"" meeting scenarios are not entirely serendipitous. Quite the opposite, in fact, they meet through carefully developed character motivations and fully established locations. Notting Hill has us take an almost religious leap of faith into believing that one of the worlds largest superstars casually buys books without a chaperone or bodyguard in a working-class district of London. When Hugh Grant spills juice on her shirt it requires a second major leap of faith to believe that she would enter a strangers apartment, again without any sort of bodyguard or chaperone, to clean up. To that effect, Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston present a far more believable couple in the action romantic drama The Bodyguard (1992).However, I have no problem turning off my inner critic and push myself to enter the world of the film which isn't drawing me in on its own. I enjoy many cheesy romantic comedies and have no problem defending less believable plot lines like 2001's Serendipity with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale. Notting Hill however, has far worse writing and a weaker supporting cast. Its comic timing is always a bit off, and even has Hugh Grant saying outlandish lines like ""Ill stabbed him to death later"", meant as a joke early in the film when his roommate doesn't pass along a message left by Julia Roberts (Anna Scott).The supporting cast in this film fulfill the role of a cliché group of British pub crawlers and middle-class domesticity. The one twist in this, which could have been a very interesting character, was a paraplegic woman named Bella played by Gina McKee. However, instead of fleshing out her dialogue she is left as the inspiration p**n for Grant and Roberts' hardships. What's worse, the director actually has her leveraging her disability in order to grant Grant (no pun interned) access to a press conference with Roberts. It seems that Gina McKee's character exists in the film only for this, which is a tragedy of filmmaking in and of itself.The worst aspects of Notting Hill lay in it's character development and completely unhealthy relationship dynamics. Julia Roberts plays an almost pathological narcissist: someone who lies and cheats on Hugh Grant and is completely incapable of any heartfelt apology. It's interesting to note that she never says once in the film that she loves Grant's character, William Thacker. Instead, after breaking his heart twice and lying to him, she asks for him to love her (after a little time has passed, of course).The film sells the relationship on the chemistry of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts and the celebrity fanaticism that it expects from its viewers. In fact, almost every character is enamored with movie stars (even if they don't know which film Anna Scott is in) and plays the everyman role as some sort of stupefied stooge drunk at the alter of celebrity worship. I couldn't help but feel somewhat offended, as if the filmmakers see the public as dribbling idiots who want nothing more than autographs. Even Grant's character, who perpetually ""plays it cool"" is shown in movie theaters gazing upon Roberts in a bizarre peeping-tom like obsession. Six months after she cheats on him he is still lost in his daydream of Roberts, replaying her films. Some of the scenes are a little reminiscent of Stockholm syndrome in the way that Hugh Grant is portrayed as the non-functioning sad sop who can't get over this femme fatal.Perhaps to combat this state of events, the producers of the film have laced every montage and establishing shot with the most unbelievably saccharine soundtrack I've heard in years. Once again, it's as if the filmmakers don't have confidence in the script they've made to draw us into a world of actual romanticism. They need to create that romanticism artificially with a score of Al Greene and other musicians that created songs which far surpass the material they are being used for.The most painful part of the ""Notting Hill experience"" has to be the way Hugh Grant's character is written. Obviously aimed at an unintelligent and emotionally stunted audience of People magazine readers, William Thatcher is portrayed as the ultimate non-believable hunk: He's handsome, charming, unassuming, self-effacing, and yet always has the first two buttons of his shirt open and just enough confidence to say the right thing. In addition to this, he's inexplicably lonely and unattractive to the outside world, despite his undeniable good looks and charm. As a character he has no depth, his past marriage is explained away in one sentence we can see no reason for him to be the suffering hunk that he is, aside from the necessary role that he plays in his ""accidental"" meeting with Anna Scott (Julia Roberts). The script reminds us that he was put on this earth to please her narcissism and ""treat her right"" while she is there to reap the rewards of an undiscovered handsome ball of charm.Ultimately this film was a commercial slam dunk and for somewhat obvious reasons. It gave a somewhat interesting peek into the life celebrities and lets us bask in the glow of our adoration for Julia Roberts, not unlike Busby Berkeley did for Ruby Keeler in his 1930's musicals. Julia Roberts was at the zenith of her career in the 1990's. She has always been a magnificent actor and a terrific beauty, so I was not spared from the spell myself. However, I cannot be sold entirely on a film based on respect and attraction to a single celebrity. The characters need more substance and definition, as well as motivations that extend beyond the codependent and unhealthy dynamic presented to us.While the film has an admirable switch in gender roles, it takes this too far in certain respects as well, with Julia Roberts trying to buy off Grant's character with an expensive painting. It hits all the right notes for the lonely middle America working woman. It has moments of defiance, gender reversal, and a completely submissive and buttery hunk, mastering in the art of spinelessness. The film ends with an ultimate montage of wish fulfillment, overlaid with sappy music to show the good life of marriage, pregnancy, and happily ever after. A final reminder that the script itself is void of any real identity.I can't recommend this movie as a good piece of screwball comedy fluff. However, it is a pretty fascinating look at our culture's fanaticism over celebrities, the way the movie industry views us within that fanaticism, and our skewed complexes for dating fantasies. it seems that we can find any romantic comedy decent enough when codependence and narcissism are normalized by attractive actors and a half-baked script.

"An enchanting, lovely, and humorously lively viewing experience.","Visually lovely, ""Notting Hill"" becomes an enchanting fairy tale.....a magical and endearing love story, from the opening credits to an afternoon of quiet sharing in a London park.  Being a romantic at heart, I was emotionally drawn to this well produced and entertaining motion picture, enticing me to view it a number of times more.Some friends have indicated that the ""plot"" is boring and in 2 hours and 4 minutes takes too long to come to an expected conclusion.  But the lyrical chemistry between William Thacker (Hugh Grant) and Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) give intimate glimpses into the human heart and spirit. As in Mary Poppins when Burt jumps into the chalk sidewalk drawing, I longed to join this tapestry of two people falling in love, among caring friends and relatives.  To longingly look into Anna's eyes and to see a reflection of your very own soul of hope and humanity may seem less than exciting to some people.....too involved in their fast paced, action world and who fail to see the beauty of life around them....to smell the roses.Watching the inflections of Julia Robert's face became a mesmerizing cinema experience.  And Hugh Grant's thoughtful and honest, yet quirky presence gave hope to what could be possible.

I've made the wrong decision, haven't I?","Bookshop owner William Thacker's (Hugh Grant) life is turned upside down when Hollywood star Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) ventures into his shop.By definition, Notting Hill is crowd pleasing fluff for the romantically inclined. Nothing wrong with that of course, chances are that if you have tuned in on TV or loaded this film on your player, you are fully expecting a fluffarama with lots of toothy smiles. Sure enough Notting Hill, written by Richard Curtis and directed by Roger Mitchell, delivers everything that the wish fulfilment plot synopsis suggests it will. And nicely providing a few laughs into the bargain as well.That it stops short of being a top line rom-com falls at the feet of Curtis and his over egged script. The comedy is razor sharp and the romance is excellently fleshed from start to finish, but in his need to add drama via media intrusion and a ""woe is me"" life of the actress, Curtis comes dangerously close to fluffing his, well, fluff piece.Still, it's a flaw that doesn't sink the film, because hey! We want feel-good and that's what we shall bloody well get! Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts take the lead roles of our mismatched (matched) coupling, and as it turns out it's a fine bit of casting. Roberts is not asked to do much other than smile and work well opposite Grant's wonderful foppish charm, while both actors benefit from an excellent supporting cast who rise above what in essence is a roll call of rallying around your mate mates!Especially praise worthy is the efforts of Gina McKee and Tim McInnerny, whose sub-plot story could have been twee, but thanks to both of them it actually adds an emotional pull rather than being a shoehorned hindrance. Cringe comedy comes courtesy of Rhys Ifans (owning every scene he is in) and James Dreyfus adds extra light relief as William's assistant at the shop, Martin.There's no Wet Wet Wet theme tune to outstay its welcome, and Roberts says her cringer line with far more oomph than that of Andie MacDowell. To which all told it makes Notting Hill no masterpiece in a much loved genre, but crucially it is however a delightful frothy film that hopefully makes you smile as much as it does yours truly. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sparkling fairy tale romance, film star meets ordinary bookseller","Whether or not realistic, this is a wonderfully touching fairy tale like story of the romance between two people of unequal social and financial standing. The beautiful, rich, and famous American movie star is superbly captured by the incomparable and always endearing Julia Roberts, who brings such a wonderful vulnerability to her roles. Hugh Grant is perfect as the shy, stammering, bumbling, unassuming, obscure, and not very affluent London bookseller, who shares a flat with his zany, weird roommate, Spike.The tale revolves around the world's most famous actress, Anna Scott, who visits a Notting Hill travel bookshop and thereby meets the very ordinary British bookseller, William Thacker. Improbable as it might seem, the two fall in love despite the fact that Anna already has a 'significant other' in the form of the obnoxious star, Jeff, who treats her poorly. Alas, Anna and William's romance is of course subject to hounding by the ubiquitous media, making the course of true love definitely not run smooth.Just an aside, but did the screenwriters get Hugh Grant's character's name from the Victorian novelist, William Makepeace Thackeray? It seems quite a coincidence. Ha, ha. Anyway, nice name...The film does a marvelous job conveying what must resemble Julia Roberts' own fishbowl life, subject to constant media scrutiny and innuendo. She must have identified strongly with the character she was playing, not only the media nuisance but also the failed relationships so common among film stars. Her hounding by the paparazzi is also of course reminiscent of that plaguing the late Princess Diana, and of course, sadly, resulting in her death.The portrayal of William's friends is very touching here, as their reaction transforms from understandable awe at socializing with such a famous star, to accepting and treating Anna as basically an ordinary person and good friend. The viewer gets a sense of how much this response, this genuine friendship means to Anna. One of William's friends is a disabled wife in a wheelchair. Her normal, ordinary life and attitude are well captured and would be well received, I believe, by viewers with physical disabilities.The love story is beautifully depicted. The sadness of Anna's failed past romantic involvements is conveyed, and despite the fame, her vulnerability as being really just 'an ordinary girl in love with an ordinary boy'. The portrayal of William is touching, as he copes with all the media attention, sees the actual person behind all that fame, wealth, and glamour, and tries to give Anna the genuine security and the 'ordinary life' she so desperately craves. A fabulous, moving, and ultra romantic film with a relevant message regarding modern society's perception and treatment of its movie stars. We can all learn a lesson here.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nice fluffy kittens,"It's not often that a sequel surpasses the original, but, like The Godfather Part II, Notting Hill starts where ""Four Weddings"" left off in this fumbling romantic comedy.It's five years on, and Hugh (played by Hugh Grant) has divorced Andie McDougal and now owns a bookshop or something. But Hugh gets the shock of his life when Andie (now played by Julie Roberts) waltzes back into his bookshop one day and announces grandly that she's now a big-shot hollywood actress. Hugh is speechless and we are then treated to fully 20 minutes of ""ums"" ""ahs"" and ""the thing is..."" from Hugh.But then the action really gets going as Hugh and Julia find themselves falling in love all over again. There's lots of familiar faces as all Hugh's toffy friends have married each other and now live together in a big house in a nice village called ""Notting Hill"". Fans of Scarlet will be shocked to discover that she's had a sex change and is now a man and is calling herself Spike. And is also Welsh!!!!As in Four Weddings, the two love birds again find that the course of true romance never runs smooth. Andie goes back off to America leaving Hugh heart-broken. Again! And would you believe it, just as Hugh thinks he's in with a shot she reveals she's got a boyfriend. Again!! Talk about lightening striking twice!Will poor Hugh ever learn!?

"The best parts are warm and clever--the worst parts you can live through, so do it!","Notting Hill (1999)At first I though this was going south fast--the narration by Hugh Grant as the intro got going was straining too hard to be funny, and taking too long to click into gear.But then it switched to a more usual romantic comedy, the kind that Grant has made his bread and butter (lots of both--he's really good at this). Later, when the narrative voice-over returns, it works just fine. He's the consistent charming low-key Hugh Grant that we've seen in many films before, and if you don't like him, you should steer clear. If you do, here you go!Of course, there's Julia Roberts, too, and I find her completely fine, the dependable Roberts who really can't quite ""act"" but who is always likable and so acting isn't the issue. And to make it even easier, her role here is to be a huge mega-star actress. Which she already is. Voila, a perfect fit.The magic and romance that is meant to spark between the two leads isn't always convincing, but there is a sparkling kind of dialog between them, and among extended family, that keeps it going. There is some really sharp writing here.And there is some really stupid acting. The goofy roommate is just too goofy and caricatured for the rest of the cast, and he is given some of the weakest script to read, as well. The first appearance of Grant's family might strike you as forced, as well, but they gradually work their way into the film and are actually warm and very funny. I wish they had been larger and the roommate smaller in the plans.Director Roger Michell has a short resume, including a well-regarded ""Persuasion"" which didn't persuade me (I like Jane Austen too much, I think). But there is a sensibility in that film that carries over here in some of the family scenes. Well done, as far as the script takes it.Don't expect a great movie. It's entertainment, pure and simple, but enjoyable, and with some shining moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
All The Romance Charm and Wit One Can Ask For in a Romantic Comedy Fantasy,"Notting Hill holds up more than two decades after its release in 1999. This utterly charming Cindafella daydream is one of the best romantic comedies to ever grace the big screen, with a perfect pairing of Roberts and Grant in the lead roles, backed by an equally spot on casting of the engaging supporting cast.The film keeps things simple - Average boy meets famous girl; Boy wins over girl; Boy loses girl; Boy wins back girl; Both live happily ever after (or at least long enough for the credits to roll). It's a classic tale, done with a deftly light touch, devoid of any complex tension - we know its going to end happily, because it's the dream many have despite knowing odds not in their favor, but this is a modern fairy tale - happy endings are required. Even if just a moment in time, perhaps that is enough for anyone to have a dream come true.An all-time classic that has moved onto my Top 25 romantic comedies list.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Surreal, But Nice.","Romantic Comedy is my Second Favourite Genre in Movies following only Dramas. What is it that makes a great Rom-Com? Is it the chemistry between the Protagonists? Is it an unclichéd and non-banal script? Is it the Direction? Is it a mesmerising Soundtrack Or the enthralling Cinematography? Maybe it's a combination of all these. Notting Hill is one of those few which have all these ingredients to make for a great Rom-Com.Notting Hill is the story of William Thacker, a diffident divorcee who lives in a house with a Blue Door and runs a not so lucrative Travel Book Shop in a small cheerful neighbourhood of London called Notting Hill. It is the story of his eventful rendezvous with the fabulous, ravishingly beautiful Anna Scott, a renowned American Actress and the love affair that ensues.As William says in the movie 'Surreal, But Nice', is exactly how I'd describe my experience watching Notting Hill. It is one of those Movies which makes us believe in fateful encounters, in the enigmatic inexplicable appeal to which our very hearts tremble, in the aching separations and the exhilaratingly joyous 'Happily Ever After'. Some people might be of the opinion that these so called Rom-Coms though exquisite, portray an unrealistic affair, that the Writers conjuring such Fables live in Oblivion and not in the real world. To some extent this might be the hard truth. After all what are the chances of me running into Julia Roberts? Probably next to zero or, to be a hardcore realist, absolutely zero. These Movies might give false hope to the heartbroken or the lonely, but it is Hope nonetheless. Hope, that I might bump into a significant other while fetching for Orange Juice and that some people do spend their whole lives together. And that is what I'd prefer to believe. After all I am guilty of being the Hopeless Romantic.What I like about the movie is that it isn't just some random Girl Meets Boy Story. Albeit being a Rom-Com, Roger Michell tries to dwell a little deeper into each character's Inhibitions, Hopes and their Psyche. The 'Last Brownie Scene' is a testament to the same. This very brief scene is my favourite from the movie. It portrays immaculately how each character on the table has their own Wins and Fiascos, Dreams and Inhibitions and how life never goes on as intended. As Bella very aptly says - 'C'est La Vie'.'Hugh Grant' plays William Thacker while 'Julia Roberts' is Anna Scott. Their Chemistry is most coveted and undeniable on screen. 'Rhys Ifans' plays the eccentric roommate Spike and 'Gina McKee' plays Bella, among the troupe of Artists employed by Michell.The enthralling Soundtrack is an anthology of Songs by various Artists which works flawlessly for each scene. My favourite among them being 'When You Say Nothing At All' by Ronan Keating.In short, Notting Hill is an absolute delight to watch. It may not be the best Rom-Com out there, but it definitely is worthwhile.A Review by -

A modern Cinderella tale with English charm and humour,"Can lightning strike twice? Well with writer Richard Curtis it has! I understand he wrote this screenplay and completed it before he realised just how similar it was to his previous hit, Four Weddings and a Funeral.Let's examine this a second: Hugh Grant is the hero; There's an elusive and glamorous American that he falls for; He has a circle of friends, each in their own way a success AND a failure in life, and yet Hugh's character (William Thacker) is somehow trailing them all; there's the kooky yet endearing sister; the character with a tragic disability; a complete buffoon of a sidekick; and several near-misses.Yet it's all so thoroughly entertaining, AGAIN. It's like a delicious dish, and its recipe for success is cooked up time and again by Curtis as Jamie Oliver's older and wiser brother.As a single bloke in this day and age I AM William Thacker, and I AM Charles in Four Weddings. So on the one hand you'll have parts of the audience identifying with the hero, and parts of the audience wanting the hero to be their real-life partner. Yet character empathy alone is not enough to carry a film.The path that the hero follows needs to be a roller-coaster ride. Sometimes it's up, sometimes it's down, but it's never boring. In fact, the pacing is assuredly steady just as, in one excellent scene, we see the indication of time passing in an extremely effective way. I feel that Curtis learnt from Four Weddings and tightened the strings on the time line in this movie. Where Four Weddings very occasionally crawls, Notting Hill paces along assuredly.In addition, our hero's roller-coaster ride must be believable. Could this really happen? Why not? Do movie stars ALWAYS fall for other celebrities?So what of the performances? Well Hugh Grant is really Hugh Grant (again) in this role. But isn't that why we go to see Hugh Grant movies? He's funny yet tragic, vulnerable yet assured, and I can't imagine anyone else playing William.Julia Roberts is one of those stars who, love her or hate her, delivers in every role. She's very believable as Anna Scott, showing the resolute public charm of a movie star, whilst exposing the hidden human frailty behind Hollywood's finest. And this despite the undoubted (and wholly false) criticism that she's simply playing a movie star like she in fact is. She perhaps COULD have leaned back and simply ambled through the movie expecting it to be an easy role for her, but in a truly professional manner, she's sought to add depth and weight to her character.The rest of the cast sparkle in their roles, most notably Rhys Ifans as Spike. But even without the requisite comedy set pieces that Rhys revels in, actors of class such as Tim McInnerny, James Dreyfus, Gina McKee, Emma Chambers and Hugh Bonneville expertly fill in the no-less important landscape of this joyous and warm piece of art.Watch out, too, for memorable cameos by Alec Baldwin, Mischa Barton and Matthew Modine.So who is Cinderella and who is the Prince? At first glance William is the hopeful nobody. But really, as the story develops, we'll see that there are two character's dreams unfolding in Notting Hill.Why then not 10 out of 10? Well, full marks would have been ME starring as William Thacker... ;)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Harmless trivia,"I first saw this film about a year ago and wanted to dislike it: I couldn't. When it came on TV again, another viewing seemed better than the alternatives:  that proved more a comment on the merit of the alternatives!Overall, there is a feeling that this is little more than ""Four Weddings"" revisited.  Gormless main lead bumbles through life.  Standard storyline of ""boy/girl meet, fall in love, split, then finally reunite"".The difference from ""Four Weddings"" is more romance, less comedy.  Hugh Grant plays standard Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts appears to play, well... probably Julia Roberts.  The overall acting standard is uninspiring, the best moments come from the zany supporting cast.So what does all that leave us?

The Mystery of Apricots soaked in Honey,"My. Comfort. Movie. 100%.People always fail to understand why this movie lives rent free in my head 24/7. They say, is it thrilling? And I wouldn't say particularly so. Is it dramatic? Not really. Does it have something powerful to say? And I'd have to admit that the only thing it pushes is love, unpredictable, accidental, affectionate love and pull of polar opposite soul mates.So what is that continues to make Notting Hill my favourite, comfort-movie of all time?Maybe it's the classical, clever directing, because that scene through the market will always be iconic and one of a kind,Maybe it's the romanticism of 90s Central London, leaving me dreaming of summers in the vintage ritz tearooms, or relaxing under the shades of Hyde Park,Maybe it's the britishness of it, with an (almost) entirely british (and extremely) iconic cast, bar the it girl of o0s Hollywood, Julia Roberts. The amount of times the word ""tea"" is said in this movie touches me deeply as a brit,I also truly believe thst as a brit, the casual conversation style of this film speaks to us, the idea of romance coming simply from a sarcastic little chit-chat is dumbfounding and glorious.Maybe it's the soundtrack, which sparkles and sings with sopranos and tunes that will live rent free in my head FOREVER,Maybe it's the insight to celebrity culture and the darker side of fame that we needed; something that's not explored in movies too often, and often leads to fantastic films such as Gia and the Truman Show,Or maybe it's the love. Not presented in some twisted crazy plot, but just the story of two people, so different in lifestyle and livelihood but leaves us utterly convinced that a love like that is possible...After all, we all want to fall crazily in love with someone like them. They're it all; the way they keep finding their way back to each other despite all crazy odds of their two polar-opposite lifestyles, the inside jokes and the utmost intimate comfortablness they have with each other, the way they communicate without using words. We all want to experience a love that makes us feel like a violin-playing goat floating through a midnight blue sky. We all want our next random outing out of the house to end up in being the moment that changed our lives, the moment we meet the one person for us.And so Notting Hill at the end of the day, is a heavenly, out-of-reach-but-feels-so-close kind of romance film, something that is made to feel so simple and just around the corner, when we all know it is not. It is special in that paints romance so simply, so perfectly, but so impossibly at the same time.Watch it.

Tripe,"Julia Roberts delivers the same sort of schtick again -- a movie star! But oh SO down to earth.  She failed to sell it because she is utterly without charm.  And you can't tell me that she was actually acting in this movie -- it's not much of a stretch when she is, in essence, just playing HERSELF.The script and plot were overly sentimental and unimaginative.  Julia's immortal utterance of ""I'm just a girl...standing before a boy...asking him to love her""  will live on in my mind as the most nauseating and cringe-inducing line of all time.  I shudder at the memory.Only Hugh Grant managed to save this movie from being completely intolerable.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Up The ""Hill""",">  After suffering a divorce, a marriage between a best friend and an ex-lover, not to mention living with a complete slob for a roommate, travel bookstore owner William (Hugh Grant) was just trying to live a peaceful existence in Notting Hill, England with his disastrous lovelife and a fledgling bookstore.  When American film megastar Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) comes in to browse for books about Turkey, the two sense a mutual attraction and begin a delicate love affair that threatens both their complicated lives.  The crux of ""Notting Hill"" is this : can two exact opposites in the complex world of publicity and disposable relationships stay together forever? Screenwriter Richard Curtis's (""Four Weddings And A Funeral"") goal this time around seems to be a sharp satire of the Hollywood starlets and their psychotic relationships with the public and themselves, and the old wacky English humour we've come to expect from any film with Mr. Grant.  It's a very odd mixture of the audience-pleasing easy comedy and something more sinister - possibly due to both lead's past public lives.  He creates two compelling characters in Anna and Garrett.  They both have very convincing motives for the courtship, it isn't just a roll in the hay and then the aftermath like most films.  Director Roger Michell keeps the flow nice and the two leads make good on their promise for charm and beauty. I'm a little irritated that so many would consider this a big step for Julia Roberts in the acting department.  She already gave a commanding performance in last year's ""Stepmom"".  With ""Hill"", Roberts continues her impressive growth spurt into real adult acting and role choices.  Her work with Grant here is the most easy going I've even seen her do(Maybe one too many close-ups of that smile though...).  Hugh Grant does his stammering best to make William seem lovable.  I'm not a fan of Mr. Grant, but I will easily concede that this is his best performance to date.  Rhys Ifans is disgusting (a good thing) as Spike, William's flatmate.  He brings some very much needed brevity to the proceedings.  If anyone ever needs an actor to represent an English skuzzball, they should call this guy. If the charming ""Notting Hill"" suffers from anything it might be the ""She's All That"" syndrome.  Whenever you get the relationship ball rolling, it seems in everyone of these movies we need a forced situation to break up the two leads, just so we can cheer when they reconcile.  That's fine, no complaints.  In ""Hill"", this syndrome is put to the extreme test.  We follow this romance through, I believe, at least three breakups.  That's too many for a two hour film.  We never get sure footing on to why these two should be together and that is a frustrating element.  Director Michell tries to hold onto the reins, but the climax of the film is forced and seriously uncharacteristic of the movie. ""Notting Hill"" has a lot to say about fame and the effects of it on a life. It never bothers to take a stand or really explain if Roberts's character embraces her superstardom or is oppressed by it.  Screenwriter Curtis makes compelling arguments for both sides of the debate but strays away from truly looking deep within the fishbowl. When you think about it, William was a fan of Anna before meeting her, yet that subject seems too taboo for the film. What we get is just puppy love, no strings.""Notting Hill"" is an extremely charming film with so much love to offer. It's a concoction that's hard to resist.  You'll come out of it with a warm fuzzy feeling in the tips of your toes.  It's nice to have a film that just wants to please, I just wish they didn't lay such a heavy topic wet blanket over the proceedings. --------------- 8",,Anonymous,Romance
Not up to its hype.,"Not nearly as great as its hype, but not too bad.  It takes Hugh Grant an agonizingly long time to complete a sentence -- and those fluttering eyelashes of his CAN get annoying.  Julia Roberts spent too much of the movie smiling waiting for Hugh to complete his thoughts (which explains the slowness of the film).  But the movie is worth seeing just to observe Grant's roommate-from-hell, Spike; he steals many a scene.  Best scene: Hugh Grant walking through a British open market thinking of his lost love as the seasons change from fall to winter to spring.

With romantic comedies, I don't usually require originality because I know you can't be too original with those films, but this one just wasn't interesting or entertaining enough to me. The acting isn't bad, in fact Roberts and Grant are pretty good in the movie, it's just other factors in the film that I wasn't so crazy about. The script is alright, to me there was nothing in the script that jumped out at me and really grabbed me, it was just okay, but the writing didn't inspire me to come back and watch this movie over again. Yes some of the humor was done well and there were several times where I laughed, unfortunately that alone was not enough to save the movie and make me recommend seeing it. I'll finish up by saying this. It's not a bad movie, you won't reach the end and say wow that was bad, but if you're like me then you'll come to the end and feel like you could've watched a better movie of that genre and been more satisfied.

"Subtle, embedded messages emerge to create positive view of people with disabilities.","Notting Hill, this totally implausible, happily improbable, feel good flick, does more to influence positive attitudes about people with disabilities than any all day sensitivity training seminar could ever hope to accomplish.As significant as the two leading characters is the ever-present, fanciful circle of friends. Wouldn't we all love to have a close group of intimate chums like these! The collection of assorted characters includes Bella, a woman who uses a wheelchair, a sleek Quickie Ultralight at that. I love the easy nonchalance of her introduction to the viewer. She is merely one of many diverse folks in the day-to-day life of William Thacker, the film's protagonist.In one after-dinner scene, the group sits around a big, friendly, worn farmhouse table, consuming way too much wine and sharing what stinks about their life. Bella reveals that she and her husband discovered they cannot have children. I like that she also dares make a complaint about ""sitting in this damn chair"". She is being honest; she is not burdening herself with feelings that she should sugar-coat her life for others. Nor does she feel compelled to be upbeat and cheerful no matter the cost to her own integrity.This character lives a typical, dare I say ""normal"" life. She is married, throws parties, gets drunk on occasion, and interacts with the able bodied world around her . . . all with unaffected naturalness. I like the message this sends to the viewing public: people with disabilities are a whole lot like people without disabilities.In a scene when Anna Scott and William Thacker leave the birthday party celebration, the very first words out of Anna's mouth are, ""Why is Bella in a wheelchair?"" This is precisely, to the letter, as it would be in real life. When folks come in contact with a person with an obvious disability, they understandably want to know what happened.Bella's husband tenderly lifts her out of her wheelchair to carry her up the staircase to bed. My thermometer was on . .. testing for feelings of excessive sympathy or sorrow in myself or in the audience. There were none. There was only empathy, warmth, and tenderness, much of what one would feel watching any loving couple where the man lifted the woman over a doorstep, for instance, into their first home. Kudos to the director and the actors for not playing the pity card here. Thankfully no soaring violins tugged at our tear ducts.As the culminating scene of the movie approaches, the group of friends all impulsively jump into a small European car to race off. There was Bella left waving goodbye from her Quickie. No, wait a minute. This was not to be. They wanted Bella with them; she belonged with them on this mission. There were no complicated maneuvers of how will we squeeze her into the car, what will we do with the wheelchair, no exasperation from the characters. They just did it. They made it happen. Before we knew it, Bella was sitting in the front seat; a few others had rearranged their positions and crammed into the back seat, and off they all went charging away full speed ahead.In a final scene, the friends are attempting to 'crash a private party' so to speak, and having trouble getting past the hotel management. In a boldly triumphant move, Bella comes wheeling authoritatively toward the hotel bureaucrat, confidently announcing in a power voice: ""He is with ME. I am so-and-so from such-and-such journal writing an article on how your hotel treats people with disabilities.""Swoosh! All doors opened to the group! Bella saved the day in her quick-witted plot to get past the hotel magistrate. Aside from the glee I felt at her being the savior of the day, I also applaud the embedded message: Disability rights are expected; don't tread on disability civil rights; disability access is what's happenin' in the Nineties.This film has broad cross-class mass appeal, from the teenybopper to Joe Six Pack to the intellectual, and therefore has the power to impact the sensibilities of millions of viewers. I applaud Notting Hill for its contribution toward influencing positive attitudes toward people with disabilities.",,Anonymous,Romance
A cross between Close Encounters and Jean de Florette.,"As a thirty-something male, I don't expect I was in the key demographic the producers were thinking of when they made this movie.  I'm supposed to be the guns, cars and action brigade.  I do have my sensitive side and I do like to indulge it occasionally.  Besides I do see a niche for films to take women I fancy to.  This all might explain how I've come to see this film on three separate occasions.And lovely it is.  Julia Roberts has fun playing herself.  Hugh Grant has fun playing Hugh Grant again.  Richard Curtis has fun writing for Hugh Grant again.  The plot meanders its gentle way to the conclusion you paid for when you bought the ticket.  Everyone smiles and thinks how wonderful true love is as the credits roll.  Warm feelings inside all round.That's just it though.  This film sticks to an established formula and rakes in the cash.  It does so in a stylish manner with well-rounded corners and lots of polish.  It's the rom-com equivalent of Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven. It does exactly what it says on the tin, no more, no less.  Maybe I'm being picky for pickiness sake.  If I am, so be it.I'm glad to see that Hugh Grant is moving on to less Hugh-Granty roles.  I'm really looking forward to seeing him in About A Boy soon.  I hope Richard Curtis can move on to, he can be brilliant (cf Blackadder) and I would hate to see him stuck in a rut.Go and see for smiles, romance and Rhys Ifans in his pants.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The greatest romantic comedy of all time,"I remember graduating from 8th grade and there was this girl who was just so beautiful, I couldn't breathe around her, talk, walk, etc. She was just so gorgeous and still is. I finally reconnected with her and yet she still scares me the same way she did when we were kids. This film came out a few days after we parted ways but I had seen the previews and realized she was exactly the same as Julia Roberts and I was exactly like Hugh Grant. She was a million, million miles from the world that I live in. How can two people from different worlds fall in love? Richard Curtis captivated the entire world with this film. It has often been described as the greatest love story captured on film. I have my favorite films, some of which are Oscar winners like The Godfather, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Lord Of The Rings, etc. This one was so much more real to me because it embodied my story. I still love the girl and she has no clue, call me a loser, but it broadened my love for film, my love for love. Guys, if you have never been interested in the so called 'chick flicks' watch this one. I visited Notting Hill, the Travel Book Store, Portobello Road, the gardens. I loved it all. I highly recommend the film and highly recommend going there if you truly love this film. Thank you, Richard Curtis, for giving the world love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A great movie, to see at any age and without moderation !","The love movies I've seen in my life can surely be counted on the fingers of one hand, but this one is definitely worth it.Having returned from London today and having visited the mythical London street of Notting Hill only yesterday, I had to pay tribute to the movie ""Notting Hill"".This film makes us want to love and believe in a love story or an unlikely encounter. It transcends the ""social boundaries"" of love between a bookstore owner with an unprofitable start and a world famous Hollywood actress.Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant embody this encounter so well, they would make you want to discover and rediscover the feeling of being in love. At this level, I think the actors are very well chosen, we would even think that we are just seeing a couple living their life behind our screen!This film is a perfect mix between what provokes the strong feeling of falling in love (making us happier than ever), but also stages the trials and tribulations when that perfect love is about to fall through.The British capital sets the scene slightly and is not overrepresented. Indeed, we can recognize the street from which the film takes its name, but this setting is only slightly outdated, thus finding the right balance not to be taken by a feeling of redundancy in the scenes.I recommend this film to singles as well as couples, since the variety of characters allows everyone to find their way. Nevertheless, the end gives us an irresistible urge to fall in love. But who knows, maybe one day your Hugh Grant or Julia Roberts will come knocking on your door.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Massively Cliché Rom-Com that Still Manages to Work Brilliantly,"I don't really have much to say on this film, it's a great Rom-Com but it feels very cliché and predictable at the same time. I think the movie hinges on the fact that Julia Roberts is so likeable and Hugh Grant so charming that when you surround them with a group of talented comic actors and give them a funny script you can't really go wrong. The film is very funny, making me laugh out loud an embarrassing number of times and even when you can see a joke coming a mile away it manages to hit. Technically the film does nothing new but still I think you will struggle not to enjoy it. Just a classic boy meet girl film but a very good one none the less.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A wonderful movie!!,"When i visited the Notting Hill page i was very surprised to find a modest rating for this movie (less than 7). I was not sure and would like to meet people who gave it such a poor rating and understand and inquire what else do they consider to be a great movie. This movie has everything you can ask for. Great story (i agree its a rich girl poor guy love story plot but put up beautifully), great direction, great performance, subtle but again great humor and it makes u feel so good watching it. Entertains you all along, with a perfect touch of romance, humor, sorrow and backed up with some beautiful dialogues.I guess every single person who has seen this movie(despite the fact what he/she might rate this movie as), still can never forget that scene where Julia says these lines to Hugh grant: ""I am just a girl standing before a boy, asking him to lover her!""I became a fan of Hugh Grant after watching this movie and what do you say about Julia Roberts. She just looks gorgeous in this movie.So if you have not seen this movie till now despite having heard a lot about it which i am sure you would have, you have missed something for a long time now.

too slow for a comedy,"Much too slow for a comedy. The camera lingered on faces for far too long and if they'd only cut that technique out, the film would've been 20mins shorter. Thing is, I think they played on the actors rather than the characters. Hugh Grant with his bewildered blue eyes and Julia Roberts with her smile etc etc (and Rhys ""Spike"" with his utter lack of hygiene). Anyway, there was too much of the staring thing and not enough acceleration although I guess they had to hide the fact that it was really just ""together apart together apart together"" the whole time. It had its moments though, especially Thacker's family and some of the cultural input was interesting. A slow film - don't pay for it at the cinema, hire the video or something.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
British films are the best,"Such a heart warming film. Yes the story line is cheesy, but you end up loving it. This is probably because Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are so talented and pull of their rolls so well . They also have two other very famous actors that are brilliant. These people being Emma Chamber and Rys Ifan. Also, from what I can read on google most of the other actors are very famous and talented also which probably also adds the how good the film is. The meaning behind the story is that just because someone is famous doesn't mean they are not normal like everyone else. Like Anna Scott states in the film, she says something like ""The whole fame thing is fake really. I'm just a girl who likes a boy"". This film will send a much needed message to young people these days that famous people are just normal people and are no different to anybody else. Yes there are benefits to being famous making lots of money, meeting other famous people, doing all the things you dreamed of. However, the down falls can have dramatic effects on the person. I mean if you were famous you could't just go out for a casual stroll with your hair a mess and no makeup on because you would probably end up with your face plastered all over some silly magazine and this film highlights this. This film is heart warming with also a good humor all the way through. You must see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Is this supposed to be funny?,"In the brain-dead world of the U.S. sitcom, there's a common plot device called ""embarrassing the protagonist,"" in which some idiot writer apparently finds mountains of hilarity in rendering the protagonist speechless; as with a kick to the groin, getting covered in gallons of some food product, or stammering out a rambling monologue when the guy/girl should really just shut up, etc.  Somebody, somewhere, must find these things funny.  If you see such a person, please smack them, and if you are such a person, what on earth is wrong with you?There are about three genuinely funny moments in ""Notting Hill,"" and the rest of the film features various Brits making asses of themselves.  I wasn't laughing, I was cringing.  This is entertainment?Not a single character in the film is particularly nice-- note how Thacker tries to impress the girl by calling his roommate a ""pea-brained idiot."" (Well, maybe he is, but guys don't usually impress girls by insulting people, do they?).  Anna Scott is remarkably shallow and is given about 3 lines of character development in the whole film, all of which occur during the birthday party scene.  Why is Thacker interested in her, other than because she's famous?  Why is Anna interested in Thacker, other than he looks like Hugh Grant?  These questions are ones we loud Americans are apparently not allowed to ask, we're just supposed to point and laugh and actually believe this couple actually has a shot at a real life.  The characters barely talk after they meet; character development is replaced with pop songs.  Note to director: it's NOT THE SAME THING!!Shallow characters, shallow writing, and it seems to be shallow directing, too, as the actors really do their best with the material given, which is really just Generic Sitcom Plot #7 stretched to feature-length, with better cinematography.  5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Surreal, but nice!","Notting Hill is a romantic comedy or rom-com from 1999 made by a successful production company (Working Title) and written by an equally successful screenwriter of the time, Richard Curtis.The team had been behind another successful rom-com of the 1990s, Four Weddings And A Funeral.It is as the title unoriginally suggests set in the Notting Hill area of London. An affluent area some would say yet at the same time home of immigrants and the annual carnival. It is also the home of a bustling market. I digress!Back to the film. Anyway, Hugh Grant plays a travel book shop owner William Thacker who lives within walking distance of his shop conveniently. A shop that isn't particularly financially successful.Grant has a couple of failed marriages to his name and lives in a terraced house with a rather scruffy, yet likeable Welsh lodger Spike (Rhys Ifans).The film has all the traits of the rom-com film at hand. You could say it is split into three distinct acts:
1. Boy Meets Girl
2. Boy loses girl
3. Boy wins her back and everybody lives happily ever after!The boy in question is really a man, Thacker! Although Grant plays Thacker with his usual rather tedious surreal but nice attitude. He's done it in several of his films before and after.The girl, or lady is successful Hollywood actress Anna Scott played by Julia Roberts.Now the meet-cute scene is classic rom-com staple. Scott is in London and happens to browse the bookshelves of Thacker's book shop. Although his initial attempts at link-selling leave a lot to be desired!All I can explain about the scene is surreal but nice!Grant struggles against the media frenzy that follows Scott and her movie enterouge, at one point pretending to be from Horse and Hound magazine!Thacker introduces Scott to his wacky relatives/friends at dinner. The supporting cast here includes the likes of Hugh Bonneville.Now there are obstacles to the relationship developing. Not least the fame and 'adulation' that follows Scott at every turn. The media frenzy and tabloid revelations about old videos.The obstacles also come in the form of a supposed relationship with a fellow actor, cue a cameo by Alec Baldwin.Scott seemingly has little independance but shows Thacker a good time. In one scene breaking into a Notting Hill square garden over locked railings whilst Thacker struggles ala Alan Partridge!The casting is a high point of the film. Grant is a regular at these roles throughout his career and Roberts probably had her most successful role to date in Pretty Woman.Rather than a gay best friend, Thacker confides his concerns to his relatives/friends including Ifans who is funny as Spike.Now Thacker loses Scott whilst she faces her media demons and cross Atlantic way of life.Cue a musical montage scene where Grant walks through the Notting Hill market to his shop through several changing seasons to depict the passage of time. For the musical geeks out there the track in question is Ain't No Sunshine by Bill Withers.The soundtrack also features some brothers Gibb input and Ronan Keating.Thacker faces his moment of despair around the 3/4 point of the movie toward the end of the second act.The final act sees Grant racing through London traffic aided by his friends to reach Scdott's latest press conference at the Savoy Hotel. Horse and Hound is back!The inevitable outpouring of love occurs and Thacker and Scott appear to live happily ever after!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Apricots in honey.,"Yes, the two leads have no discernible personalities outside of their courtship, the picture does very little with its core concept (she's famous, but he's not; how will they stay together!?), Hugh Grant's 'adorkable' babbling is more annoying than charming (his current self-aware silver fox phase suits him much better), and the film mishandles its 'leaked nudes' subplot quite considerably, but Rhys Ifans also poses in front of a mirror in his tightie whities (or greys) and makes his butt cheeks do a little dance and that makes this a masterpiece. Okay, that's obviously hyperbole, but 'Notting Hill (1999)' is undeniably charming despite its notable flaws. Sure, it's sappy and predictable, but it's also heartfelt and engaging. There are a handful of nice directorial flourishes (the 'changing seasons' scene is simply divine) and the performances are all pretty good (Hugh Bonneville is delightful). It's a breezy romantic comedy that remains endearing and enjoyable throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A perfect romantic comedy,"A wonderful movie about celebrity meeting normality. Nothing Hill stars Hugh Grant, as a book store owner, whose life is changed when an international movie star, Anna, played by Julia Roberts, walks into his book store. By fate, William collides into Anna knocking his lunch all over her. William offers Anna the opportunity to clean up in his flat across the way. Anna agrees.Suddenly William has an international celebrity in his house. He desperately tries to keep her there by offering everything in his refrigerator. Anna leaves, but comes back and they kiss. Seems a bit Hollywood, am I right? No, I'm wrong. Nothing Hill's a wonderful film from start to finish. William tracks Anna down, and they start dating.The movie basically has the same premise as Woody Allen's wonderful Purple rose of Cairo, even though Purple rose leans more towards fantasy than reality. Both movies contain quiet, humble, perfectly normal people confronted by celebrities.Nothing Hill perfectly nails the relationship between celebrity and normality. Not just on a romantic level, but on a general level as well. In a wonderful scene, Anna's invited to William's sisters Birthday party. At the table, she's filled with happiness and joy by how happy, and simple it is to be normal. Opposed to living the false life of celebrity. I'm sure 98 percent of society would love to be in Anna's position, but maybe being a celebrity is not what is appears to be. Not everyone thrives off celebrity, getting a great deal of pleasure out of the shallowness of fame and fortune. Not everyone worships their own celebrity status like the Paris Hilton's of the world.But on a romantic level, Nothing Hill succeeds amazingly as well. Just seeing William and Anna walk down the road, sit together, in a restaurant together, has amazingly wonderful charm to it. It's easy to put your self in William's shoes and feel his pleasure and excitement, basically why I loved this movie so much. I felt William's excitement the same way Cecilia felt everyone's on screen in the Purple Rose of Cairo. I escaped my own normal existence through William's wonderful situation with Anna.It must be every man's dream, especially a humble man like William's, to have a beautiful superstar walk into their life and fall in love with them. Oh, how'd I love for Natalie Portman to walk into my bookstore and kiss me. It won't happen, because A) I don't have a book store, and B) because reality bites. But why not dream? Anyway, William and Anna fall in love, share intimate moments, and the shallowness of celebrity mixes in. Anna pisses me off towards the end of the movie when the paparazzi show up at Williams's door snapping a photo of him in his boxers with her upstairs. Anna suddenly puts her career before the likes of William. Anna leaves, William mopes around, but his flat mate and sister track down Anna for him.Of course, William tracks Anna down on a movie set a few months later after she wins an academy award, which Roberts would win in reality a year later for Erin Brockovich, but mistakenly hears her say a rather rude remark about him. Little does he know it was in character. But Anna, once again, returns to Williams's book store, confesses her love for him, he turns her down, his friends make him realize how dumb of a mistake it was, and then he tracks her down at a press conference. And they live happily ever after.Of course, in reality, this probably wouldn't happen. But why couldn't it? Why can't celebrities and every day people fall in love? Like Anna says, she's just a small town girl. Nothing Hill's a wonderful movie no matter how you look at it. Everything about it's perfect. Julia Robert's and Hugh Grants best work. 10-10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Undeniably brilliant,"The setting, the characters, the writing. Absolutely everything in this movie is done to such a high standard, and is presented so fantasically, you simply feel as if you are in this world. Sitting in Notting hill, sipping tea with Hugh Grant. 
Who, by the way, is in his prime here and carries the movie with ease.It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is about this movie that I love so much, but every single time I watch it, I find myself fully pulled in, completely unable to pull myself away. 
I love it, beyond rhyme or reason.Perhaps it is the characters, in how each and every one of them is so brilliantly memorable. You come to love each and every one of them, and just want them to succeed in their endevours. 
Or perhaps it is the writing, which grips you like the best book would, and never, ever lets up.All in all, this is one of my favourite things to watch. It's one of those simple things that just makes me happy.

Tolerable By Romantic Comedy Standards,"The life of a simple bookshop owner (Hugh Grant) changes when he meets the most famous film star in the world (Julia Roberts).What I really enjoyed about this film is the guest stars. Alec Baldwin shows up unannounced for a brief but crucial scene. Heck, even Mischa Barton appears as the child actor whom Will pretends to interview for Horse & Hound. Of course, when the film came out no one knew who Barton was, but that is what makes looking back at movies fun.Beyond that, it is your typical romantic comedy. I suppose it is slightly different in that the main character is male rather than female, and Grant is more charming than the average male lead.

I cannot recall one memorable line that was uttered from Julia's large mouth (probably one of the reasons that she's so popular with men) in this film.I also found the relationship between Grant and Roberts totally unbelievable in both the sense that an actress with Roberts IQ would never go for a poor bookstore owner, and that there was just no reason for Roberts to have ever went for Grant in the first place.

"a bittersweet romance, powerful and emotional","Those who look for a story about bittersweet romance need look no further than 'Notting Hill', starring the ever-handsome English Hugh Grant and American star, Julia Roberts. Hugh Grant's character is an ordinary man who lives and owns a travel bookstore in Notting Hill. He falls in love with celebrity actress (played by Julia Roberts) who happens to come into his store. She then leads him on a wild chase and ultimately breaks his heart while he is trying to win her over. But, like other films in this formula, there is a happy ending.'Notting Hill' is very British in style, and it has that sense of Hugh Grant-esquire humour. Then, there is his Welsh flatmate, the odd sister and odd dates, and the embarrassingly-funny and confessional press conference. It is easy to feel sorry for Hugh Grant's character, and this film does play on the tenderness. It also does not take itself too seriously by offering the humour, mainly at shy Grant's expense. There's also some fast-paced action at the end, and it is feel-good because it brings all of the characters together. Talk about team-work. I'm not a fan of this genre of film, but I did enjoy 'Notting Hill'.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Played strict by genre rules,"A straightforward romantic comedy.  In many ways this characterisation sums up both the strengths and weaknesses of this film. It is disappointingly non-experimental and plays the genre strict by the rules, but these rules work fairly well and here we have the good cast that is needed to pull it off.There are quite a few details in the script that are rather questionable. For example, if Anna is this big Hollywood star, then - how does she manage to walk unnoticed through the streets of London, with not one paparazzo in sight?  And why do we have (in contrast) an army of photographers at William's house when the source of their information was merely a rumour spread by his flatmate Spike down the local pub?One of the big pluses of this movie is its largely British supporting cast, especially Rhys Ifans is a treat.  As so often in this genre the supporting cast is not given enough to do.  The film hardly touches the stories of these characters, we only get the odd bit of inconsequential information. That is a shame, because one could have used these characters to add interest in the story .",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

I also like how the obligatory comic relief character is actually funny here, that's a luxury the average Hugh Grant film rarely has. Hail Spike and all his disgusting ways. Obviously the script is very predictable, and there are some scenes in here that are downright painfully corny (""I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy"" definitely comes to mind), but if you have to watch one thing that features Hugh Grant, there are plenty of worse picks that this.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A heartfelt RomCom.,"Notting Hill is a Romantic Comedy that really leaves you with a warm feeling towards the end. Directed by Roger Michell, staring Julia Robert and Hugh Grant, this movie is about a world renowned actor who meets an awkward book keeper, and they fall in love.The movie overall is actually really well done. It has fun music that really works with the vibe, the cinematography is fine except for the time moving scenes, those are so well done. The movie is funny, and overall makes you feel the love. What really stands out in this movie is the acting and the lines. The acting is done brilliantly and each character is just great, even down to spike. The lines too just make the film fit together. They are memorable and are just so good. The ending of the movie also is so great. It gives you all you were waiting for and wraps up the movie perfectly.The problem I had with this movie, however were it was unrealistic. Now I know most romantic comedies are meant to be like this, but it was just too unrealistic. It felt more like a dream. The American stigma is definitely shown by Robert's kissing Grant within 20 minutes of the movie, which also is an example of unrealistic relationships, however the movie overcomes this and it works out well.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sharp clever brit-flick with a verbal wit like no other.,"A welcome change from your average `chick flick of the week', `Notting Hill' leaves a satisfying taste in the mouth. But there are a few nagging flaws. While the film opens brilliantly and maintains that pace up until about half way through the duration, after that the comedy becomes more sporadic, unsuccessfully mixing dry wit with needless sentimentality.But the presence of Hugh Grant really lifts this one off the ground. His bumbling act never fails to amuse and is always right on the mark. On the other hand, Julia Roberts does little to outdo her reputation for being shallow and the love at first sight aspect of her character isn't all that believable. Rhys Ifans more erratic style of humour is equally welcome and the one-liners he uses are classic.The film loses a lot of momentum near the end but what has gone before erases a good amount of the minor drivel that followed. So, with a nice cast, a great script and a pleasant overall effect, `Notting Hill' is a success. 6.8/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
I love Notting Hill,"I watched this movie when I was 14.There are three reason why I love it so much. First of all, The climax of this movie is moving. It is very romantic scene where He proposed to her in front of the journalist.He is very wonderful!! Secondly, Actor's character is very funny. Especially, Spike! He is an eccentric. But in reality he is kindly. He is a key person in this movie. And, Thacker (Hugh Grant). He is cool. But He is comic actor. Very cute! The third reason why I would like to introduce this cinema to you is its music. Very famous song.The title is ""She"". Singing by Elvis Costello. I do love this song. This music can be heard by a good scene. It is drew tears. And in other scenes, used oldies songs. I love Oldies very much.This movie still makes me impressed. And will never forget forever...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining...ok for a chick flick,"As I said to my friend as I left Notting Hill, I tend to like Julia Roberts movies, despite the fact that she plays the same character in every one. The same indignant stare and the same hurt-about-to-cry gulp, for example. Her revelatory, heartwrenching speeches all strike the same chord in my mind.  But that's okay, because I like her style for some reason, and I almost always enjoy watching her films, at least while they are taking place.  Notting Hill was no different.  I laughed hard, I enjoyed the plot for the most part, and the eccentric characters.  But I left thinking, ""mediocre.""  Why?  Well, the cheese factor, for one.  I know this is a love story, but PLEASE.  They concentrated WAY too much on that, and way too little on what I thought would be the interesting part.  They should have put more media hassle in there.  There was this one cool artistic scene with Hugh Grant walking through the streets and the seasons.  That was neat. Also, I mean, the characters were pretty good.  It may have been more effective NOT to use a real high name actress to play the part, but then again, it was easy to relate.  Oh well, it's not a waste of your money, but it's not the best film I've seen in its genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Classic Romantic Movie,"Even though the story is too unrealistic especially nowadays, it is such a cute one and I'm sure this is something you have at least once imagined ""what if I bumped into a celebrity on the corner..."" things. Julia Roberts is so beautiful and I can't imagine if there is such an iconic actor exists in the current Hollywood. Diversity is important but also it makes difficult to produce iconic actors like her. It was great to see those England city looked like those days. Sadly, I have never been to the UK so I can't compare but it must have been nice to walk down the stone pavement in the streetarket.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the Best,"Notting Hill is one of the best romantic comedies out there. The reason for its status is the well written story, the dialogue, and the actors.The film tells the story of a simple travel bookshop owner (Hugh Grant) who meets a famous movie star (Julia Roberts) when she walks in his shop. And it goes on to show the resulting relationship that starts from this point.The story follows the guidelines of most romantic comedies but it does so with its own flair. The dialogue is very sharp and the characters' conversations with each other are either thought provoking or laugh inducing.The chemistry between the actors on this film was perfect. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant dazzled in the lead roles. They make the audience care for each of the character's storyline no matter where the story takes them. The supporting cast compliments the main characters immensely. Rhys Ifans as Spike, Hugh Grant's flatmate, is comedic genius.Notting Hill is one of the best romantic comedies because it is so much more than just that label. The film sucks in the audience and at the end gives the viewer something more than just laughs and a happy ending. It gives the viewer insight and hope. I don't want to explain why because you should watch the film and find out for yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
First 3/4s of the film is terrible compared to the end,"The first hour and a half are surprisingly terrible compared to the last 25 minutes. Until 1:28:00, I would say the film is exceedingly bad. There's very little successful comedy and the romance is unearned and bad. The tone is also very out of touch with itself at points. The particular writing style also doesn't work for me.At 1:28:00, there's one long shot where he is walking through different seasons in the market, and I loved that shot, even with the obvious cut. And that's the turning point in the movie for me. The last 25 minutes seem like the ending of a great movie, and almost made me forget how much I truly hated the first hour and a half. The first hour and a half are probably worth a 2/10, but after that the film is at least a 7/10, probably a 8/10. It reminded me of my experience with La La Land, although that movie was much better than this one in every way. And I will say, coming away from the film, I didn't mind the beginning so much, so maybe you'll have a similar experience. So overall I'd give the film a 5/10, but there's a big asterisk there (it might even feel like a 6/10).",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's okay,"I liked how there's a scene of Dylan Moran stealing books from Hugh Grant's bookstore. I'm treating that as canon for Black Books, and that's how Bernard gets his books.I mostly liked this, even if the romance wasn't always believable and the runtime felt a little long. Curtis' movies are often pretty long for romantic comedies/ dramedies, but movies like Love Actually and The Boat That Rocked earn their runtimes by having big ensemble casts. This is a very simple story which just focuses on one main relationship, and I thought it just stretched on a bit.Most of the comedy works- some of it's a little predictable. And yeah, soundtrack isn't awful but it's a tad on the nose.I go a bit hard on romantic comedies because they're not one of my favourite genres, but this one was certainly better than your average one.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

I guess it doesn't take itself too seriously anyway so I won't be too harsh against it. Two beautiful actors involved in an intimate affair and all the rest of the supporting cast adding to the comic relief. I loved Hugh Grant's lines, every single word was perfectly chosen to add to the wit and attractiveness of his character. I didn't like the plethora of close-ups of the two leads, they made the film look like a photo shoot of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. Okay we know they're good looking but please!

Fine romantic comedy,"First of all, I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies. Sure, I adore ""The Wedding Singer"" and a few other films, but I'm not exactly interested in the next ""big"" romantic comedy. However, there are a few movies belonging to this genre that are so charming that I can't resist them. ""The Wedding Singer"" is one of those, as is this film -- ""Notting Hill"". It's very funny and it's very romantic. I saw it for the second time tonight and I liked it even better than I did the first time. Hugh Grant is absolutely adorable, Julia Robert's character is charming. Some of the scenes (e.g. ""The Horse & Hound""-scene) are absolutely hilarious. This is a much better film than Richard Curtis's ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", and it's a masterpiece compared with the other Roberts-film ""Runaway Bride"".In short, ""Notting Hill"" is a fine romantic comedy with appealing performances by the two leads.

a kind of magic,"Notting Hill had a kind of magic to it, not because Julia Roberts was a big star, in and out of film, but because the story is so beautifully told, and Julia is completely out of her usual, powerful performance routine, it seems she is not really trying to act, which gives it it's certain edge, she becomes real, this can also be said for Hugh, playing the usual dopey character he's customed to really does suit him, and both of them really worked well together. The day after watching it, i went round to Notting Hill which is just near where i work, hopeing to catch a glimpse of the famous door, but couldn't find it, oh well the magic of this romantic weepy will have to remain in my heart, and im sure alot of people feel the same.",,Anonymous,Romance
Charming In Parts But Overrated,"I never understood why people thought this movie was so romantic. The premise is there, with Grant as the sweetly bumbling London bookstore owner and Roberts as the American movie starlet who is out of his league. The setting is charming, there is some good music, and Grant's friends and family (particularly his roommate and his younger sister, eccentrics both) are a winning bunch whose banter is fun and sometimes touching.Why then, does the movie not feel at all romantic to me until the last twenty minutes or so? Because Robert's character, despite her supposed desirability, is not particularly charismatic, likable or even sympathetic. She's beautiful, famous and supposedly unattainable. She reveals a surprising vulnerability. We see that that she really yearns for love and normalcy. That should make me like her more, but it just doesn't.This movie reminds me of ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"" in the sense that the heroine keeps leading the hero on, showing up for a tryst and then ghosting him. Am I supposed to be OK with this? It's cold and careless. No male lead would be allowed to get away with this and still come out a romantic winner, and I say this as a woman!At least the leads in FWaaF had chemistry. Grant and Roberts don't really have much until, again, the very end. But that's not enough.I was more interested in Spike and the Sister, frankly. That's a pair I could ship.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A sweet--overly sweet, perhaps--funny and endearing experience","Notting Hill offers a sweet and endearing experience to viewers. At times, an experience that feels overly sweet, and excessively endearing, but sweet regardless. The film portrays the classic story of a wealthy, famous, and hard-to-reach damsel (Anna Scott, played by Julia Roberts), sought after by a mortal, common plebeian (William Thacker, played by Hugh Grant). And despite the themed cliché, the narrative offers some twists and turns, some overly dramatized, while others unusual, that play with the heart of the viewer, offers some smiles from time to time, and some unbelief as well.But still, all expectations aside, viewers will know, pretty much, what they will witness at the end of the film, and will wonder if that was really the most realistic picture that could have been. Most interestingly, the film could have offered a deeper and more substantial exploration of the characters was warranted: who really was Anna Scott, and who really was William Thacker remained as elusive as Anna's smiles and William's chase thereafter. Certainly, it could have offered a more endearing experience, and a more memorable one, too, if more conversations as that of William's sister's birthday party were featured. That way, one wouldn't end the film knowing almost as little about the characters as one knew in the beginning.Regardless, perhaps that was not the point of the writers and directors. Perhaps the capturing of viewer's attention with the looks of the characters was meant to drive sales and story. But still, to those looking for a change of scenery from mostly U.S. based films, Notting Hill offers a nice peak into neighborhoods and sceneries of England.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Somthings are better left Unexplained,"Well there are many people asking questions like, ""Why would someone like Hugh like Julia, in this movie"", well that's the beauty of it, when someone falls in love, it doesn't matter how bad or good the other person is. It only matters what the other person is to you. Sometimes they are cruel, sometimes sweet, but who likes whom, how can we define?The jokes in this movie aren't all perfectly timed, and that's what that makes it more realistic. OK not all parts were realistic, but this is a very sweet and heart warming story. Its a story of hope, which we lately need a lot of. Hugh grant was the best thing in this film, his weird way of saying things and strangely accepting every unintentional crap his roommate threw at him, and the way he dealt with it (like the glasses scene) was hilarious. All in all this is one of my all time favorite Romantic Comedies.

Notting Hill'99,"It was a pleasant, simple and mostly implausible romantic comedy about a famous fictional actress and the man that loves her. A romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts is not normally my sort of thing but sometimes, a good girlie film such as ""Notting Hill"" can be just what the doctor ordered. ""Notting Hill"" is one of those movies for people who appreciate the particular British sense of humor. British humor is a full plate, let's face it. This movie, when it comes to humor, romance and simplicity, is at the same level of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Bridget Jones Diary"", which makes it a good alternative to these movies. Although it contains some vocabulary of discussable taste, it isn't profane at all and doesn't contain dirty humor which makes this a much more intelligent movie.The characters here are interesting and humorous, without being great (in fact they deliver an ordinary performance especially Julia Roberts). The supporting characters, on the other hand, have more depth than I expected. Unfortunately, it's not their story. Nevertheless, the actor who portrays Spike is who makes this movie so hilarious. Spike is so goofy, so silly and so humorous - congratulations to the actor (Rhys Ifans) who played him, 'cause he did a perfect job for this kind of role. I really didn't like the overuse of pop music in the film, especially the overblown music used to bookend the film. It felt a little tacked on or inorganic to the soul of the film and almost seems to try to ""sell"" the scene as emotionally related to the piece of selected music. In terms of romantic comedy, this film basically gets the touchstones right. There are quirky, but fleshed out supporting characters. Silly scenarios are quite good. It's cute enough to be smile- making funny, albeit nothing laugh-out-loud. It's likable.My Rating - 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

First of Julia's summer hits is a miss,"""Notting Hill"" was probably intended to try to appease Julia Roberts hungry moviegoers until ""Runaway Bride"" hit the screens. Too bad its not a very good movie.Plot is this:  a divorced unlucky at love bookstore owner meets a famous American actress and they share an instant mutual attraction.  It then follows their romance through his discovery of her boyfriend, then his roommates' deception of her ""hiding place"" when nude photos of her are printed in the British tabloids, and finally his decision that he didn't want to see her again.Julia Roberts puts forth a less than stellar effort on this one. Her character (Anna Scott) isnt very well executed and she seems to be trying to save her best work for the superior ""Runaway Bride"".  She has some good moments and her charm shines through often enough that you won't be disappointed.Hugh Grant is lively as William Thacker, the owner of the small travel book store.   He has some pretty decent moments, and is not as dull as he has been in previous movies.The supporting cast really shines though.  Ryhs Ifans is Spike, William's slightly less than hygenic roommate.  He is both offensive and hysterical all in the same scene.  The rest of the cast is solid and well done.  Very believable characters.""Notting Hill"" was just good enough to hold over die hard Julia fans till ""Runaway"" hit, but it was quite plain thats all this movie was meant to be. It was overlong, drawn out and at times a bit dull. Next time you wanna have multiple releases Julia, make sure you put your best effort into them both.2 out of 5",,Anonymous,Romance

'Steel Magnolias' is a film, I will forever carry a special place in my heart, however, this comes as a close second. Hugh Grant gives a typical, gorgeous, and average performance, as an average Joe who falls in love with someone, not within his reach...but somehow is.I would recommend this film to everyone and anyone.

"Ah, the romance of it all...","Do you like a bit of romance? A bit of comedy? A bit of simple feel-good entertainment? Then look no further than Notting Hill. Here's Hugh Grant in the movie that is the perfect vehicle for his awfully-nice-but-a-bit-dim Englishman. And it works beautifully. His character lives in a little world of awfully nice people that never quite make a success of anything but they don't really care much. It's a small world of good friends, enjoying their lives, smiling at misfortune...very British. In fact, it's really quite a small movie, an ensemble piece that Hugh Grant uses to demonstrate his great talent for comedy acting. His characterisation of William is perfectly presented thanks to his natural talent for this kind of role. Of course he has played the same role many times but if that's what the director wants, then Hugh is your man. The supporting cast play their roles to perfection, some of the little cameo parts are as good as you will see anywhere. James Dreyfuss as the effete and just-a-little-bit-dim Martin is hilarious but tinged with the same resignation of failure as all the rest. Rhys Ifans plays the slightly unhinged Welshman perfectly, an extension of the part he played as one of the psychotic, drug fuelled Lewis brothers, bent on revenge in ""Twin Town"" And what of Julia Roberts? Well, she plays along with all these warm hearted British types, looking a little bit bemused but all she has to do is play herself, a Hollywood star who falls for an ordinary mortal. Which is what she did when she married Danny Moder in real life. Notting Hill is a perfect piece of romantic escapism, watch it with your loved one and enjoy the romance of it all. And when Elvis Costello sings 'She' at the end of the film, well, it brings a tear of happiness to even the most cynical of eyes.

While Hugh Grant is nothing great, I must say he chooses good romantic comedies to be in.I lived in England over 5 years, and picked up the British 'humor' that is so many times overlooked, or called 'raunchy' and while their sitcoms may be this sometimes, the main humor is not raunchy!

I have a theory that in any movie starring Ms. Roberts, the co-stars take 5th seat and back, because Ms. Roberts is a genuine superstar (one of those special people that only walk on the earth every few decades or so) in the Marilyn Monroe tradition, one who just becomes so charismatic that no mere mortal stands a chance (look what happened to Richard Gere in RUNAWAY BRIDE).  She is wonderful in this movie.  But does all this mean that the rest of the cast does not matter ... well, almost.

Has some very sweet qualities and laid-back performances,"""Notting Hill"" is quite pleasant and has many wonderful moments, but I resented the cookie-cutter formula which serves as the framework for the story. The two main characters played by Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts meet in his bookshop and trade some lines. The stage is set for them to meet again, which they do by bumping into each other on the street (he splashes juice on her clothes). This kind of stuff is worse than old-fashioned, it is downright creaky. Things do pick up from there as the bookseller and his movie-star girlfriend get closer to each other (the sequence where she meets his friends is enchanting, funny on different levels, and based in a surprising sort of reality wherein Roberts sends up her persona as an overpaid underachiever). But then the formula has to rear its ugly head in the climax: guy meets girl, guy loses girl...you can finish the rest. It's a 'nice' movie, lightly broad, but is it asking too much to want smarter people at the controls? **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Carried Largely by Two Very Charming Leads,"Watching Notting Hill I came to the realization that it's been a while since I have seen a movie that is so unabashedly romantic. Today's romantic comedies tend to add layers of cynicism in lieu of two people, on screen who actually have chemistry. It's like half of the rom-com industry has decided to pander to the eye-rolling, smartphone scrolling, shrugging indignation crowd. The other half cater to those who like their romance overcooked, contrived, and unbearably overwrought as to render them offensively outdated upon arrival.Thankfully Notting Hill falls into the latter category without wholly reaching Nicholas Sparks territory. Our protagonist William Thacker (Grant) is a normal, good-humored Brit who has a chance encounter with American darling of the screen Anna Scott (Roberts). Despite being consistently befuddled around the constantly on-guard ingenue, William manages to endear himself to her and they begin a charming little courtship away from the flashes of paparazzi cameras.Grant's character manages a struggling bookstore because in the late nineties and early two thousands screenwriters wanted to let us know how unfashionable books were. His shaggy-dog normalcy, quick yet harmless wit and his social circle of close-knit friends, endears him to the audience within the first few minutes of the movie. This is important because with the arrival of Robert's character it's as if a draft of arctic wind had assailed his life. Take away the moments where bit characters do a double take when she enters the room and you're left with a very cagey actress who Grant at first seems to admire because of her celebrity. She doesn't come across as endearing at first but slowly gains your trust throughout. As she slowly un-spools to a level the audience can commit to her struggles, Grant also begins to grow and change in unexpected ways. In the hands of other actors this movie might have been relegated to rom-com purgatory. Yet so much audience goodwill can be made with Roberts's winning smile and Grant's signature stutter.The secret to Notting Hill's success is its ability to play out the scene in a meaningful way and earn the audience's respect with well- formed characters. The central gaggle of friends played by Tim McInnerny, Gina McKee, Hugh Bonneville and Emma Chambers all have interesting backstories and aren't the one-dimensional boors we always see. The movie goes into a bit of a third act stumble culminating in that frantic ""mad dash to your lover"" sequence we've seen in every romantic comedy since Manhattan (1979). It's a shame too because everything leading up to that moment was organic and fun while not being too sweet.I didn't love Notting Hill but then again the film is not for me. Much like William's bookstore, the movie is for a special class of people who don't know or care that the world has left them behind. It's a piece of well glossed fantasy that has the ability to harken back to older movies such as Roman Holiday (1953) and The Shop Around the Corner (1940) only with updated stars and risqué humor. It's obviously a winning formula as proved by the film's enduring popularity. Give it a try if you're not completely callused by the prospect of love; otherwise there are other fish in the sea.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An actress falls in love for a simple bookshop owner,"For refreshment this comedy is good at all. The plot is very real, nobody can say that a movie star cannot love a simple man, perhaps this may happen even better than the love between an actor and an actress. The actress (Julia Roberts) was in fact looking for new air and trying to escape from the routine of journalists, photographers, critics and others. She was tired of all this circle and wanted something different. Hugh Grant, the bookshop owner, showed her modest life, good friends and other environment much better than the one of million US dollars. Congratulations to Roger Michell for this film that anyone can see several times, it has also excellent music with songs of two Bee Gees (Barry and Robin Gibb)and Charles Aznavour, congratulations once again to Julia Roberts, who is simply at present the best actress in comedy in Hollywood.

More of A Good Romantic Movie Than A Comedy,"SpoilersI have read the negative reviews and I agree with most of the comments, made, but I still love this movie.This movie has a (somewhat) ground breaking premise of a famous and very attractive movie star getting involved with a person of no fame and no notoriety. It seems like a logical choice of movie scripts for Julia Roberts, considering Julia's prior marriage to Lyle Lovitt. The movie goes on about the conflicts that cause this couple to stay apart. In that sense it is not very funny and I agree with those people that critique it on its lack of humor. This series of conflicts cause the movie to drag on in a serious, un-entertaining way.However, the character Spike tends to add tremendous comedy to most of the scenes that involve him, so it does not drag too much.After all of the conflict, the movie suddenly focuses in on one of Julia's lines, regarding the issue of a famous movie actress wanting to be involved with a not so famous man.This fame thing is just an illusion, well, what you really have here ""is a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her."" It was a very powerful line if it stood by itself, but then it gets repeated later on, which they did not need to do.The ending was powerful also, but the music messed it up, as they used the song ""She"" by Elvis Costello for the climax. Nonetheless, still a powerful ending showing that the famous and the not so famous can be together.I give the movie 9 stars. I have watched the ending of this movie a dozen or more times, sort of ignoring the the repeating of Julia's line and ignoring climactic song ""She"" and just watching the actions on the screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Something nice to see, meets expectations.","Notting Hill very nicely meets the expectations for a romantic-comedy. Julia basically plays herself, a charismatic leading lady with understated grace. Hugh makes his trademark performance as an everyman(-brit) seem natural and almost too easy. Together, they have enough chemistry to be believable as a romantic couple. In the end, I felt like Notting Hill fulfilled my requirements; an enjoyable, charming love-story with lots of laughs and a plausible(if somewhat fantastic) story-line. A great date movie that you can see on your own.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Has the ultimate RomCom stood the the rest of time? Without doubt,"Just been to a 20th anniversary valentines screening of Notting Hill. I was worried that such a classic film might actually be a bit of a let down after so long.I need not have worried,it was superb and perhaps even better knowing what was coming and just enjoying the film.Watching again on the big screen it really comes across just how brilliant Julia Roberts is in this. She basically is playing herself, I guess, but even so her performance is flawless. Compare her to Andi McDowell in 4 weddings and it shows why Roberts is still A list.Hugh Grant is great as Hugh Grant as he usually is and the supporting cast really make the comedy and add realism to the film. On top of this the soundtrack still stands up.Still the ultimate RomCom, a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I absolutely loved this movie,"I absolutely loved this movie!  I saw it in the theater 4 times!  Julia Roberts is one of my favorite actresses, and her performance as Anna is outstanding.  Hugh Grant also does a wonderful job as William.The movie combines romance with humor to create some fantastic lines.  Two of my favorite segments are the apricots soaked in honey and when William and Anna go to the private garden. (whoopsidaisies!)  Practically every scene incorporates humor, and it's all fresh; nothing cliche.The supporting characters complete the cast and also create humorous moments of their own.  Every scene that involves Spike, William's disgusting flatmate, involves some type of oddity, even if only Spike himself. Notting Hill is a fantastic movie that I can't wait to watch again and again.  Without a doubt one of my favorites.  I give it a 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Reminded me of London,The team of Roberts and Grant is truly inspired! And the location was one I have been to many times during my family's time in London..our Mom and I made frequent trips to Portobello Road-a well visited weekly street market ..you never knew what you would find...sadly I never found Hugh Grant 😭. Love watching this movie-Hugh's housemate is a true comedic wonder! 🌟🌟🌟🌟,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good for Notting,"I'm sorry but I absolutely hated this sickly-sweet romantic comedy from the too-prolific pen of screenwriter Richard Curtis. It boasts, if that's the right word a wholly unbelievable plot about a mega-famous Hollywood actress (Anna Scott, played by Julia Roberts) escaping the trappings of stardom to naturally stumble into a London bookshop and promptly falling in love with its down-at-heel but of course down-to-earth and available mop-haired owner (played by who-else? Hugh Grant) and the ups and downs of their subsequent affair. Along for the ride are a motley crew of Grant's supposedly ""normal"" friends including Gina McKee and Hugh Bonneville and kooky characters like Grant's fated-to-be-mated hippy-chick sister, played by Emma Chambers and his painfully unfunny gauche flatmate played by Rhys Ifans.By-passing the ridiculous plot, the film's dialogue is excruciatingly awkward and strives so hard to be everyday and natural but instead comes off as stilted and cringe-worthy. The humour is as thin as ribbon-pasta and the acting painful to watch, almost as if the cast was embarrassed speaking this forced, supposedly feel-good nonsense. The worst example is when Grant profanes the phrase ""Shittety Wicketty"" at an exasperating moment, but there's plenty more dross where that came from.As for the playing, you can see everyone acting and a painful experience it is to witness. Mind you, you'd have to be Mary Berry to make writing as flat as this rise up. For good measure throw in a sappy soundtrack with Elvis Costello vacuously crooning the old Charles Aznavour hit ""She"" and a song by the even worse Ronan Keating, to make my movie-hell complete, while the only happy thing for me about the so-predictable happy-ending is that it was the actual ending of the film.For a so-called romantic-comedy, I found it uninvolving, unamusing and ultimately unwatchable. I'd resort to sarcastic clichés to complete my hatchet job but fear the movie used them all up by itself.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect RomCom,"There is nothing wrong with this film, it's perfect. I recently saw a brand new romcom which I enjoyed but it was nothing compared to Notting Hill. Hugh Grant is a legend and I want to see him on screen much, much more. The performances here are great, every last one of them, right down to the Asian guy who climbs up and kisses the man behind the Ritz counter. This is a film you could just watch over and over again! It launched careers and no one saw it coming at the time. What's so lovely about it is that amongst the laughs there is so much lovely and heartfelt story, it's one of those films that can make you cry and then make you laugh, what more could you ask for?! If you haven't seen it yet, then drop everything right now and go see it. Straight away!!",,Anonymous,Romance
This is what romantic comedy looks like!,"Notting Hill (1999), directed by Roger Michell, is a showpiece for Julia Roberts and for London. (Hugh Grant is pretty good too.)The movie is undoubtedly formulaic. From the moment Julia Roberts--Anna Scott, the most famous woman in Hollywood--steps into Hugh Grant's bookstore, we can pretty much predict how the rest of the movie will turn out. My comment about this is, ""So what?"" No one wants a romantic comedy with a sad ending, and no one wants to think about whether ""the most famous actress in the world"" could really enjoy life with a kind and gentle man who lives and works in Notting Hill.The movie has some real strengths: William Thacker (Grant) has a loving, lovable sister (Emma Chambers), and some great friends. The Portobello Road market and the Notting Hill section of London look colorful and authentic. London gleams in the sunshine, and the posh hotels look, well, posh.Most important, Julia Roberts is perfect for the part. The cliché is that the camera loves Julia Roberts. I would say instead that WE love Julia Roberts. The camera just transmits her beauty and charm so that we can appreciate it.Note: Watch for the lovely Emily Mortimer who plays ""Perfect Girl."" That is, she and William are brought together after Anna breaks his heart, and she would, indeed be perfect for him. However, who wants to see a romantic comedy where the hero says, ""Sure, who needs Anna Scott when Perfect Girl is around?"" It just wouldn't be romantic, and it wouldn't be comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Better than the cynics may expect...,"Now lets not get carried away with Notting Hill, I thought (or 1 Wedding and a Film Star, as it should be known) - it is not going to be the greatest or ""loveliest"" film that has ever been made.  Hugh Grant in reality is a fairly boring and very type cast actor and so, unfortunately, is the plot.So, the real test for this film,for me, was always going to be if it could rise above these obvious shortcomings, and in general it does seemed to do so.  The script, which has to be the main star, is brilliant.  Better than 4 Weddings and a Funeral, Richard Curtis inserts many more ""Blackadder"" moments, which will have many in stitches.  Julia Roberts is as engaging as ever and revels in the apparent auto-biographical nature of her part.The support cast is universally brilliant, although stand outs include: Rhys Ifans who is hilarious as Spike, Hugh Grant's flat mate;  Tim (Darling) McInnerny and Gina McKee both excel making a touching couple, and Dylan Moran is unforgettable in his tiny part as the shop lifter.I was a sceptical viewer, but I was pleasantly surprised, it is better than 4 Weddings, so worth seeing for all those, like me, who initially refused to just see a rehash of the same film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Delightful with a couple of flaws...,"The story line and setting are engaging and fun.The ensemble cast of friends and their subplots is delightful.Hugh Grant rolls out another one as the hesitant, but charming Englishman.The script is fine...except - what's the deal with Julia Roberts? I normally like her just fine, but she doesn't get much to work with in this one. She's either a complete boor or she's standing around staring at people in what is probably supposed to be a ""meaningful way"". But it doesn't work. She's supposed to be the romantic lead girl, and she's not particularly lovable or endearing, and it really stretches one's ability to suspend belief to buy the plot line. Poor Anna - she could have been worth loving, I'm sure. Eventually, I guess.There's a lot good about this movie, and it's worth a rent. The only really glaringly annoying thing was the soundtrack, which threw the mood of the entire movie, and seemed complete unassociated with anything going on it. Nothing wrong with it by itself, but simply not right in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Charming and Enjoyable,"Roger Michell's ""Notting Hill,"" from a screenplay by Richard (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") Curtis is a charming, engaging little movie that fortunately gets saddled with two stars with real chemistry. Julie Roberts plays, somewhat ironically, a famous American movie star who, through a series of enjoyable contrivances, keeps running into a foppish, handsome travel bookstore owner (played by Hugh Grant). The screenplay is rather stereotypical, but Curtis doesn't write these two characters off; they are intelligent, literate, and we get a sense that they truly fall for one another. My major quip towards the film was that I did not care for the ending; it's the same old thing and, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of it. Rated PG-13. 123 minutes. 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"not romantic, not comic, not good","I had no preconceptions before watching this-- i just wanted a bit of fun diversion for the evening. Instead, what i ended up with was a nearly-unwatchable steaming pile of scenes that failed to achieve the basic requirements of story or characterisation.It occurred to me early on that perhaps the goal of the film was to take the highest-paid, biggest-name actors the producers could find & make the worst movie possible out of their contributions.What made the subject/story/believability of characters even harder to choke down were two additional crimes: 1) the underlying theme of ""ooh celebrities have it so rough here's a feature-length PSA examining their plight""; 2) the under-use of at least 2 truly brilliant comedic actors (the picaresque Dylan Moran & the luminous Julian Rhind-Tutt), who put art before ego & therefore do the job of acting better.I still could not figure out, at the end of the film, what drew the 2 main characters together. If their feelings were so compelling, the audience should at least have the remotest inkling as to _why_, surely.The constant fawning over the fictional starlet was nauseating and demeaning-- surely, a single celebrity can not be held in the same degree of spluttering fascination by all who encounter her-- not every ""famous"" person resonates in the same way by all those little people who behold their greatness... and, amazingly enough, some people even don't even care about celebrities!There was a great deal of discontinuity between threads which started & then disappeared with no resolution, the uncomfortable clash of comic with tragic (even in the same scene), and the mix of UK & US slang.The soundtrack was also way off base... not sure whether there was a single UK cover/artist in the lineup. Considering the whole film was set in the UK, the usage of so many United Statesian artists felt confused & displacing.With plot twists you can spot a mile away, unconvincing ""romance"", an ill-fitting jumble of predictably kooky characters, and an intolerable repetition of self-effacing British stereotype ""sorry's"" & other self-deprecations, this movie is entirely missable.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A really nice, charming and humorous movie.","Notting Hill is a very charming and humorous movie. It follows the classic pattern of boy-meets-girl, they loose each other but meet up again later. This could be so boring, but thanks to the humor used in this movie, it didn't annoy me once. The humor is typically British and perhaps not to everybody's taste, but I thought it was very funny.William Thacker (Hugh Grant) is the divorced owner of a travel-bookshop who lives and works in London's suburb Notting Hill. Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is a very famous American actress who comes to William's shop to buy a book. While Roberts and Grant are wonderful in their roles, it is definitely the supporting characters that set this movie apart from others in the genre.Perhaps there are people who think this is a real girls-movie, but I'm a guy and I loved it as well. I gave it an 8/10. A really nice movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"More equal, not sequel","This film is over-long.  A dull 45 minutes could have been edited from the second half and none of us would have been any the wiser for it.  So very formulaic: Boy and girl meet, fall in love, break up due to misunderstanding(s), and you can guess the last bit.  But you're not watching for the plot (I hope).The script is sharp, but could be trimmed, as mentioned above.  Funnier than Four Weddings, with a better cast.  Hugh Grant has suddenly gained a smidgen of acting ability, since I found his character quite likeable and amusing.  Julia Roberts was as charming as she's ever been.  Rhys Ifans was brilliant.As for the direction - two great moments spring to mind, a change-of-seasons stroll through a market, and a splendid ascending top-down shot of a park. Nicely done, Roger Michell.Overall - funny, charming, but a little too stereotyped and over-long.

Top shelf romantic comedy,"As far as romantic comedies, this is in the upper echelon.The movie revolves around William (the delightful Hugh Grant...again), a struggling book store owner who's world is turned upside down when he meets Anna (Julia Roberts), a huge American movie star.

Can these two seemingly complete opposites make it work, or are they too different?A brilliantly done movie, backed by an excellent supporting cast, most notably Rhys Ifans as William's roommate Spike. Plenty of memorable scenes, especially when William poses as a reporter and one of the great music moments in a movie when William walks the streets to ""Ain't no sunshine"".Guys, if you have to endure one romantic comedy, you could go a lot worse than this eg ""Monster in Law"" or anything with Meg Ryan.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Highly Entertaining Film,For years being a fan of both Roberts and Grant I had been anticipating this film for months.  After I saw the film I realized why.

Not Richard Curtis' best movie but quite sweet,"Hugh Grant, a man who has a fairly rubbish love life and owns one of the worst bookstores ever has a romance with a hugely famous film actress. Richard Curtis, ever the feel good rom com maestro, launches another sugar covered love story at us with this irresistible premise. Sure, it's ludicrous, but for many this will be just escapist as many of today's blockbusters. A perfectly cast Hugh Grant plays the bookstore owner, and an even more perfectly cast Julia Roberts plays the actress superstar. Together, they're a dynamite romantic couple, although the film around them lacks a bit. In stark contrast to the giddy laughs of Love Actually, the loopiness of About Time and smart, razor sharp wit of Curtis' crowning achievement Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill is a bit dead. It's not particularly funny with Curtis' jokes falling flatter than usual and the film drags itself out over 2 hours, which really wasn't necessary. It's more dull than other Working Title films and populated with many offensive British caricatures. Normally Curtis' eccentric, bumbling British middle class citizens are entertaining but here it's just a bit offensive and also not very funny.NH has its many dips, but is made more enjoyable by its leads. Hugh Grant is very likable as the main character and while he's pretty much playing the same character he did in Four Weddings, he does it very well. In fact, possibly even better. Julia Roberts is the complete star of the show and she's aggressively likable as the Hollywood superstar actress, but more importantly she brings a vulnerable, insecure side of her character out too. Despite the lack of effective humour, the film is undeniably charming and the film is very uplifting and is also an original rom com. Emotionally, it more or less delivers for all of its characters and thankfully this time Curtis actually includes a bit of conflict in the story, something which is mostly absent from his other movies. It's not a great film and can be fairly dull at times, although to be fair it's possible Richard Curtis was aiming for a different tone. A decent rom com; not as fun as other Working Title films, lowered by a lack of laughs, irritating secondary characters and overlength, raised by a decent amount of emotion, good acting and decent direction.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Aged terribly,"One of those films that I liked when it first came out but which has aged horribly. I feel Richard Curtis' films all do that, as they portray England in a particularly twee way which is incredibly distant from reality, to the extent that they start to grate.Notting Hill though as a film has a few flaws in that it's all rather stilted and some scenes just drag badly where it almost appears as if the actors don't know what to say or do. It's not witty and paced properly, and has far too many stereotypes in it especially Hugh's annoying friend circle (now you know why Americans are convinced all Brits have awful teeth!)The connection between Grant and Roberts was rushed as well, it didn't take time to build and feels like more sloppy writing. I guess it's done wonders for the tourism industry though in that part of London, but looking at it now it's a bit of a rubbish romcom with some big names in it.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Both Julia and Hugh can be pretty cute and a love story of the two is not unthinkable. But why cry?? Nothing really sad happened except for the woman in the wheelchair which I do not think is the thing they cried about. The story then.... , so very very superficial and such an easy plot, was unable to bring tears to my eyes for any moment during the whole film. I guess the makers just thought seeing Julia and Hugh on the big screen together would make people not pay attention to the story anymore.

It's refreshing to have a British comedy that doesn't leave you feeling depressed, like Full Monty did. And like any Richard Curtis script, it gets funnier the more you see it. I often see a trailer and feel that the movie didn't add anything to the trailer: in fact comedies often put all the good jokes in the trailer. Now, Notting Hill puts good jokes in the trailer but you laugh at them again in the movie and you laugh the second time you see it. This is Blackadder quality stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A decent movie with some impressive cinematography.,"While this movie is decent overall, there were two scenes that make it particularly interesting for movie buffs.As a movie buff, there are some scenes in movies which I'll probably never forget.  Some of them are the opening scene in _Touch of Evil_, and Glen Close crying in the shower in _The Big Chill_.The ""passage of time / change of seasons"" scene in _Notting Hill_ is now among those.  I was amazed with this scene, and the choice of music (""Ain't no sunshine"" by Bill Withers) was perfect.  The cuts blend perfectly together -- at least I'm assuming they were filmed separately, since it required clothing changes for some of the participants.  Aside from the obvious change of seasons, the passage of time is shown to have an effect on other characters, such as the pregnancy/baby of one woman and the sister's meeting/breaking up with a man.There is a second scene, that while not as awe-inspiring, it was certainly technically well-done, and again reminds me of a similar technical feat in _Touch of Evil_.  In the park scene, the camera pulls up and angles down. At first, I thought that was a sweet touch, showing how they are just two people in their own little world.  But as the camera continued to pull up to somewhere around 75 feet above the ground, I recognized the engineering that went behind it.  My guess is that they mounted a camera via wires and remotely controlled the angles and focus.  I think putting a person up there would have been a bit too much.  Does anyone actually know how it was done?So while this movie is sweet enough to see, I feel it's a must-see for anyone who likes well-constructed cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

OK so some people say that it's an implausible plot but as Anna says in the film ""Its just a girl standing in front of a boy ands asking him to love her.""

"Cute, simple, harmless, unchallenging, unremarkable","This film is nice and moderately pleasant. It allows Hugh Grant to act like Hugh Grant (almost intolerable for my liking), and trots out the old boy meets girl, loses girl, gets girl back, routine in a pleasant way for such a well-worn formula. The supporting cast is fairly good but is really only there for cheap laughs or a bit of sympathy. Julia Roberts is tolerable and the situation passingly interesting (every man's fantasy really) but just didn't do much for me. Part of the problem may have been that I'd just been to see 'Life is Beautiful' the evening before and this just pales into insignificance in comparison. Undoubtedly most of the viewing public will enjoy this because it does nothing more than deliver some low-brow chuckles and soppy sentiment - a perfect recipe for success today it seems.

Still love this film after 20 years,"After the huge success of Four Weddings, Richard Curtis struck gold again with Nothing Hill. I think I actually prefer this to Four Weddings. The characters aren't quite as OTT quirky as Four Weddings and seem far more grounded and realistic. The warmth of William's friends who surround him is lovely and you can see why someone like Anna would find his life appealing. I like the little nods to Julia Roberts previous films (""we'll have you spick and span and back on the street in no time... In a non prostitute way of course""). I like how she shows she's just a vulnerable person under the sheen of being Hollywood's biggest filmstar.Notting Hill of course is a gorgeous setting before it got ridiculously gentrified, and humble book shop owners could afford to rent with a jobless Welshman in a flat in Portobello Road. I can't believe this film is 20 years old, but in my mind is a timeless, sweet, romantic comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"More of a romantic drama than 4Weddings, but still worth seeing.","As a fan of the comic rapport struck up by Hugh Grant's ensemble of friends in 4Weddings, it quickly became evident that Notting Hill is not simply a basic reprisal of a proven formula. NH is much more of a romantic drama (although not without some brilliantly funny moments).

"Started Off Great, Then Became Like The Rest Of Today's Lame Comedies","This started off promising with a very good first 40 minutes, then slid downhill fast with all the typical modern-day film clichés you hear in a romance-comedy. You get the customary excused promiscuous behavior and overdone sex jokes, excessive profanity and wrong intentions with the male always at fault. (It's never the female in the ""politically correct"" world of entertainment.)Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts obviously make an attractive couple. Grant is a likable guy in most of his movies, not just some ""pretty boy"" because guys like him, too. The only complaint I have with his characters - as he does in this film, too - is his overly self-effacing attitude where he's always apologizing for living, practically, to his female counterpart. Hugh - speak up and be a man! Stop sounding like a stuttering wimp!I'm a romantic guy, but romantic comedies are so lame most of the time. How two people get together usually is so ludicrous, so unrealistic it gets downright insulting. Modern-day films like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" make me puke, as do classic films labeled ""screwball comedies."" I actually thought - for the first 40 minutes - this film might be different. It wasn't. You get the normal ""formula"" and ""contrived"" story, even though it reeks of charm. However, enough is enough.Grant (""William Thacker"") and Roberts (""Anna Scott"") got all the acting publicity for this film but the colorful supporting characters were more fun to watch than the two stars.Do you think it is possible for some filmmaker to make an intelligent romantic comedy, and one that isn't rated PG-13?

A enjoyable Romance movie,"Anna Scott: ""Here sit down. Have some tea, these lots to see"".Notting Hill is about an unassuming, unimportant bookstore owner in Notting Hill becomes friends with Anna Scott, the world's most-loved actress. But as friendship turns to romance, the fame and attention, not to mention an American actor, threaten to destroy their relationship.Okay I have to be honest here but Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts never stood out to me in they movies. I don't think they terrible actors or anything like that, it's just that they performance in they movies I never thought it was groundbreaking or pure greatness, just okay and nothing else. And now both of them are in Notting Hill and I can positively say that I thought both did pretty good in this movie.The chemistry between Grant and Roberts was sweet and well written. Yeah it was cliché and I could predict what was going to happen next and normally I hate it when I could predict the relationship and all the drama in a romance movie, but in this it didn't really bother me that much. Because of the great acting and good character development that stopped me from hating the movie completely.I actually was surprised how much I laughed during this movie. The side characters or the supporting characters to those people would like to say, but anywhere the side characters were pretty damn funny and give a lot of funny lines. Rhys Ifans in this movie was the true comic relief of this movie. He stole every scene he was in.For problems there only are some: Has I said before about the romance cliché thing and how Grant and Roberts chemistry stopped me hating this, well towards the end of the movie it went so cliché I won't lie I rolled me eyes. The scene that stuck out to be the stick in the mood cliché is towards the end were Grant and Roberts have this big fall out and you see them feel sad and they missing each other but they don't want to admit it, but one of them finds out that he or she was wrong and goes chasing after the girl or men of he or shes dream.

"Pretty Woman in reverse uses silence, not words.  A 7 of 10.","Notting Hill will be remembered for its title (interesting on the tongue for the strictly American) and most likely for little else.  It is more or less the typical boy meets girl loses girl meets girl loses girl meets girl loses girl gets girl story with the twist that the girl is the world's most famous movie star and the boy has an amusing sister and an idiotic roommate.  The beauty of the rich woman loves normal guy and visa versa plot is the dialogue -- or lack thereof, to be more exact;  Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts communicate so much through his ever-expressive eyes and her center-of-attention mouth whether smiling or smirking.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Whoopsidaisies!,"I first saw this film when it was released in May of 1999. I saw it as an instant love comedy classic combining the taste of Noel Coward as well as the subtle wit of Four Weddings and a Funeral. There was something original about this tale, something that just made the entire movie-going experience monumental. I was very impressed with both the talents of Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, and newcomer (that would eventually make a name of his own) Rhys Ifans. I loved the modern fairy-tale story that Richard Curtis created (and would soon repeat again and again with success) and felt that the chemistry between Grant and Roberts could not have been done by anyone else. America's sweetheart coupled with Britain's poster-child was immaculate. This was a near perfect film that could be rediscovered again and again.Sadly, I still haven't bought this film, but when my wife and I chose to rent it the other day, I was curious to see if the emotions and excitement that I felt when I initially watched it would survive in the year 2005. Sometimes films have this uncanny habit of becoming dated and musty with age. The jokes seem to be less funny, the characters seem old (because Hollywood may have recycled them in other films), and overall the film just feels like 1999. As I watched this film again, the first time in several years, it became obvious early on that it did not age in any way. The jokes still had me rolling around in my chair with laughter, the quirkiness of the characters still redefined Britain, and Julia Roberts still shined in one of her best roles to date. It was impressive to see how well preserved Curtis was able to keep this body of work.The characters are what preserve this film so well. I do not think that Hollywood has ever recreated Rhys Ifan's Spike, and if it has it was not as memorable. Hugh Grant is an awesome screen presence with his quick tongue and insecure personality. I have always been a fan of Hugh Grant's work, and am constantly impressed with the resume he has built. Julia is, well, Julia. While some will argue that she plays the same character over and over again, I would have to agree. She is a typecast character, but in Notting Hill it works. She is supposed to play herself, and she pulls it off with the greatest of ease. I did not see this film as a stretch for Julia, but an opportunity to show the world what Grant has to offer. He successfully built this multi-dimensional character that believed in love so deeply that once it was given to someone, it could never be taken back. You don't see that sort of theme in the cinema today. Even the cheesy ""boy and girl"" line was not as bad as other films. I thought that it fit perfectly and gave Grant a reason to continue. Nothing could be as bad as ""You had me at Hello"". To see a cheesy romantic comedy last through time is due to the work of Richard Curtis' screenplay and some amazing (yet simple which is why this film works so well) direction of Roger Michell.Overall, I felt the story was bold and imaginative. The characters were played with so much respect and dedication that it felt almost real. It was a love story that has lasted the test of time due to the huge talent and simplistic themes. I laughed through this film again in 2005 just as hard as I did in 1999. That says something about a film if it can still evoke the same emotion nearly six years later. I am impressed with this movie, and with everyone involved. Go see it if you haven't yet, I know you will not be disappointed.Whoopsidaisies!Grade: ***** out of *****",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's still not better than ""Four Weddings...""","(1999) Notting Hill
ROMANTIC COMEDYMade almost in the same tradition as ""Four Weddings And..."" starring Hugh Grant, a reporter/ paparazzi striking up a relationship with Julia Roberts for a scoop and then getting a possible conscience dilemma when he actually starts to fall in love with her. Idea may have been inspired by ""Roman Holiday"" but adapted to Hugh Grant's persona made famous in ""Four Weddings..."". Some parts drag by covering them with uninteresting songs.

Cringeworthy plot,"Recently watched this movie, and this movie hasn't aged well. Its cringeworthy for current day standards. Very cliché Hollywood film and not quite believable, which takes alot of the credibility away from the movie. It was a hard watch altogether. An actress falls in love with a random guy she barely knows within minutes, I mean even for Hollywood standards the plot is quite too flimsy. The side kicks were very one sided caricatures, to a point that I truly believe that the supporting actors were not actual real people in the movie, but those are the lead actor schizophrenic imaginary friends, all representing one part of the protagonist thought process. Even any random Disney movie has more credible plot than that.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

"..How love should be, floating through a dark blue sky- with a goat playing a violin!","Notting Hill is an exceptional Rom-Com flick, and one of the very few which actually take your breath away.William Thacker, a divorced gentleman from London, who stays with a quite tolerable Welsh room-mate, strangely meets the gorgeous American Actress Anna Scott in his tiny not-so-profit making Travel Book Shop. When a non-affordable Orange juice is spilled all over Ms Scott, the plot begins to unfold in a series of emotionally complicated twists and turns as we dig deep into the lives of this made-for-each-other couple with a constant Fate (sometimes spelled as Scott's Annoying Boyfriend) Intervention.All praises for the cast of this film. Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts play two totally contrasting characters; Roberts- the foul-tempered, moody, controversy-phobic girl and Grant- the humble, charming, and at times a reality-struck lad. Also, apart from the brilliant supporting crew, a person of interest to me was Dylan Moran, as Rufus the Book Thief, who ironically goes on to create and host a Book related Popular TV Series later on.At times of depression, Roger Michell beautifully uses Hugh Grant's subtle sense of humor to get the momentum back on track. Some real intelligent use of comedy, some intentional puns (Robert's Big Feet, Large Shoes) and some British Classics (Whoopsidaisies!) make this movie a thoroughly enjoyable film.A predictable end is expected, however, Julia's beautiful smile and Elvis Costello's 'She' makes your heart pump up with unexpected Love hormones. I enjoyed the entire 124 minutes and can definitely watch it numerous times. If only Julia's interpretation of Chagall's work was true, the quest for Love would be simple, or would it?I give it a well-deserved 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Predictable, witty, charming, super cast - Oh... and English!","I enjoyed this film from first to last.  But then, I would.  An English expatriate watching his city, watching all those amusing, articulate, silly ass, Brits, that give Americans such a strange notion of us.  And that one stunning American, Julia Roberts, liking our city and its people, too.  How could I not enjoy it.  Hmmm....Well, from the moment Anna Scott walks into the bookshop, the plot is predictable.  We are given very little data to explain why the two leading characters are as they are, and not much to explain their attraction to each other.  Indeed, there is not much explanation of anything; part of its English charm are the long silences, the pauses in the rhythm of the action, as in Grant's manner of speech.  Perhaps with such an obvious plot, explanation or any attempt at elaboration would have been banal.  Perhaps that is why the real glory of the film (after, that is, Miss Roberts' radiant smile) is the eccentric collection of supporting roles, each perfectly played, although Rhys Evans's Spike deserves to be singled out as impeccably offbeat.  Miss Roberts, too, deserves appreciation for a precision in phrasing that turns the rather stock character she plays into something more interesting.  Grant, though, really does need to lift himself from that English middle class bemusement that seems his only manner, whether he is in contemporary London, in Jane Austen's West Country, or Norman Lindsay's early 20th century Australia.Certainly a well-made and enjoyable film, but the principal protagonists should go on and do more and better things, as I sense they can.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

But, when he finally realises that she likes to be with him, he doesn't go out of his way to keep her.There isn't a whole lot of chemistry going on between the two of them either.

"Witty, intelligent dialogue with charming performances","Notting Hill is a film with an interesting premise and sharp dialogue which differentiates it from countless other formulaic rom coms. The film is peppered with witty, intelligent dialogue which is often quite funny. The characters in the film are also endearing and charming- I particularly enjoyed William and his group of friends, who remind me of a similar group of friends Hugh Grant has in Four weddings and a funeral. Lead performance are also pretty good, and the story is engaging enough to capture our attention for two hours, though the engineered conflicts which the characters have to go through(namely, the press turning up at Bills front door) seems a bit contrived. The only fault I can find in this film therefore is this- that it has to engineer conflict like Anna's boyfriend turning up, or the press finding out where she was hiding, to carry on the story. A good comparison could be made with Roman Holiday(1953) a very similar film which is a breeze to watch simply because there are no engineered hurdles to overcome. In that film, the only hurdle was that a princess could not end up with a commoner, and the film realistically realises this fact with a sad ending. Regardless, I still find Notting hill to be a light, charming film with uniformly great performances and funny situations bound to get quite a few laughs.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Highly likable, cute film with Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts.","OK, it shouldn't take a genius to figure out why this film was made - to capitalize on the cinema popularity of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant in the late 1990s. On first viewing I thought ""there isn't anything substantial here, but a good script and good acting make it a very enjoyable viewing, deserving a rating in the mid-7 to low-8 range"". But after viewing it several additional times over the years I have come to appreciate it more, and it has become one of my favorites to re- watch. It has a lot more depth than I realized in my first viewing. Plus it contains a collection of great characters on the British side of the casting.Grant plays a shy and unassuming bookstore owner in Notting Hill section of London. Julia Roberts plays an American movie star, and the film is about their romantic possibilities. If you are a ""romantic"" and like to see two young lovers try and figure it out, then this is a very enjoyable film. I think most of us men can identify with Grant's character, even though the object of our affection perhaps was not a movie star.The DVD extras shows a bit about the ""making of"" Notting Hill. Of interest to me, even though street shots of the Notting Hill area are used, all the filming ""inside the bookstore"" was done in a studio on a set created to look like the bookstore.I now (2016) own the BluRay version and the picture and sound are a definite improvement over the DVD, plus the ""extras"" are a bit different. This remains one of my favorite movies.",,Anonymous,Romance
Quality trowelmanship,"I didn't want to like 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', but in the end, I just couldn't help it. Writer Richard Curtis is a master of situation comedy, and although manipulative and sentimental, the film was constructed with sufficient skill to force one to care for the characters, even when one's head might have been telling one to vomit. 'Notting Hill' is virtually a retread of the same film: there's another Curtis script, Hugh Grant plays an Englishman falling for an unavailable American, lashings of soppy music and moments of poignancy. Unfortunately, it's obviously not as fresh as its predecessor, and moreover the essence of the earlier film has been not so much replicated, as distilled into something almost unbearably trite and false. Grant's character Thacker, for example, is almost a parody of the one he played previously; he lives in a Notting Hill that can be considered (depending on your perspective) either stylised or racially cleansed; and although (unlike in 'Four Weddings') we do actually see how he earns his living (as a cute, inefficient bookseller) this in no way accounts for the quality of his life (for example, he owns a main door flat in central Notting Hill, which is not the average abode of an impecunious shop owner). Indeed, whereas in the funeral scene of the earlier movie, we at least saw that not all of the characters necessarily lived in the manner their fancy wedding attire might have suggested, in 'Notting Hill' all the heroes are sympathetically unmaterialistic and yet none seem to in any way be strapped for cash; even when one loses their job, and another's business fails, there seem to be no negative consequences, and no-one envies anybody else's success, either. It's as if each character has to be given problems to make them seem human, vulnerable and sympathetic, but these problems are not in turn allowed to puncture the essentially idyllic set-up. The scene where one of Thacker's friends, who is beautiful but paralysed, half-laughs off her disability (able to do this because of the depth of her husband's love for her), really does make one reach for the sick bucket in its mawkish conceit.Yet Curtis is just so good as writing this rubbish that I find I can't hate this film either, even though I should. There are some very funny jokes (although some lines seem virtual copies of those in 'Four Weddings'), and the romance is played by all with infinitely more skill than in, say, 'Bridget Jones Diary' (which also had a Curtis script, but which was infinitely cruder in its execution). It may all be laid on with a trowel, but the trowelmanship is the best in its class. So I find I have to give this film seven out of ten. Oh, well. Maybe I'll manage to hate 'Love, actually'.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
How On Earth Is This Film Only Rated 6.9,"At least when I write this review, this wonderful film is rated only a 6.9. Largely speaking I avoid most films that fall under the magic 7 out of 10 rating. However, there are hundreds of films on this site that, in my opinion, are far inferior to this gem. I am not a fan of romantic comedies in general, as the vast majority are so much shallow pond water - full of rather tasteless odds and ends and leaving a bad taste in the mouth. There are some exceptions, and this is one. Julia Roberts plays the part of the flawed but beautiful film star, and Hugh Grant plays his diffident best as the understated dry humored Englishman. But what makes this film great is the whole cast, from the effeminate book shop assistant, to William's quirky sister, Rhys Ifan's delightful gently crude and socially inept Welshman, Bernie the failed stock market trader (Played immaculately by the now famous Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville), I could go on!The genuine and realistic relationships that the group of friends has contrasts with the world of fame represented in a somewhat satirical fashion. This only serves to leave you feeling warm and fuzzy with the thought of ordinary well-meaning people who love and appreciate each other and stand together through life's vagaries. How anyone cannot be moved by the response of Anna (Julia Roberts) at the end smiling like 'a little girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her' and what's more to a stirring rendition of 'She' by Elvis Costello; Come on, there is enough cynicism in the world not to delight in this gem of a film that oozes happy endings and feel good lives! This is probably the 5th time I have watched it and I admit unashamedly to tears welling up at the end.Give it another viewing, you won't be disappointed",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Now that it is being advertised, I can say that the commercials don't even begin to scrape the surface of this film. There have been so few genuine love stories lately that this is sure to take its rightful place among the great romantic comedies. It does answer a question sometimes wondered by non-celebrity and celebrity alike: How do you find someone out there who wants you for you? How do know when someone wants you simply because you're famous instead of for the person underneath? And how do keep the media away? It's a funny movie, with that dry British wit and the American savviness. It's a wonderful look at love and the battle to make a relationship work under extraordinary circumstances. There's nothing I would change about this movie. In particular, I loved the roommate, Spike. But this movie will endear its way into your heart if you've ever fallen in love, with someone who knew or someone who never knew.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nothing Hill!,"People who watch this have to be reasonably familier with writer Richard Curtis' work, to really undertand what Notting Hill is really about, Curtis who also brought us the equally vapid ""Bridget Jones Diary"" is a socialist who deplores British values & culture. I think once you understand this, it becomes clear what this movie is all about, & it is certainly not about a cute movie star romance with an idotic book store owner. Worse still are Hugh Grant & Julia Roberts in the duo leads, because they have absolutely no chemistry & the script is incedibly weak, which does not explain why they fall in love with each other. Why are they attracted to each other? What do they like about each? Etc. Grants character is horribly unbelieveable. He is a baffoon, dim witted character of little substance, who calls his friends nasty names to impress his movie star love interest. To be fair some of the supporting characters/actors are much better & indeed colourful, but Curtis writing really lets this film down. Richard Curtis wants the whole world to believe that the English, in particular white middle class Londoners are toffy nosed hooray Henry's, obsessed with dinner parties & practically tripping over their stiff-upper-lip, which makes them comical charactures riddled with English clichés so bad it is cringe worthy! I am a British northern born working class woman, & I have never met any fellow English person who is anywhere near as bad as they are protrayed in Notting Hill. Any decent famous American actress would run a mile when faced with Thacker & his crew of jolly hockey-sticks, Ohkay YAH! Do gooders.The plot goes like this: WilliamThacker (Grant) owns a travel book shop in Notting Hill & one day world famous American actress Anna Scott (Roberts) enters incognito, but later they meet in the street & he spills his drink over her. There is some shenanigans with her changing clothes at his place. She invites him to her suite at a posh hotel where he is mistaken for a reporter. They go scramblining over fences & end up at his sisters for a birthday dinner party....""Oh-Kay YAHhh!"" hooting commences!They only two characters I felt any warmth for were ""Spike"" (Rhys Ifans) & the dizzy ""Honey"" Thacker played beautifully by Emma Chambers, but dispite some solid efforts by the rest of the cast, there the warmth ended. The only other good aspect of this movie I did enjoy was the excellent soundtrack & I remember it was hugely popular at the time. But as a supposed star of British RomCom, for me this failed. Notting Hill also presents a wholly fairy-tale, rose tinted vision of London, which is actually one of the worlds most dangerous cities for women & girls so it is very unrealistic. It also failed to give a fair diverse, relaistic demographic of the area of London where it was filmed which did not truely represent the ethnic Afro-Carribean community & this aspect was criticised in the Independant newspaper at the time saying ""only Curtis could write a movie about Notting Hill, London's most diverse borough, and not feature a single black face in it.""In short Notting Hill was empty, vapid & it's comedy was as outdated as a Carry On movie from the 1960's. Curtis simply can't hide his contempt for British culture & while he was considered to be a top comedy writer of the 1980's, by 1999 his writing was very outdated as well as racist & sexist. I honestly hope we have seen the last of his writing. If you like basic romcoms this could still please. But I wont waste my time with it again!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Romantic Delight,"""Notting Hill"" is a quintessential romantic comedy that, despite its familiar premise, delivers an enchanting cinematic experience. The film's narrative-a Hollywood starlet (Julia Roberts) falls for a modest bookstore owner (Hugh Grant)-is a classic setup, yet it excels through its deft handling of British humor and its warm, inviting atmosphere.The cinematography is a standout element, capturing the vibrant essence of London's Notting Hill neighborhood with both precision and a palpable sense of life. From the bustling streets to the cozy confines of William Thacker's travel bookshop, each frame is meticulously composed to draw viewers into its world. The film's soundtrack, featuring tracks like ""You've Got a Way"" by Shania Twain and ""She"" by Elvis Costello, further enhances its charm with a blend of upbeat and tender melodies.While ""Notting Hill"" may not delve into profound themes, it offers a delightful escape from the complexities of life. Its strength lies in its ability to evoke a sense of pure, unadulterated joy. The chemistry between Roberts and Grant is palpable, and Richard Curtis's witty script provides endless quotable moments. This film is a testament to the power of cinema to uplift and heal, inviting audiences to revel in its two-hour embrace of romance and whimsy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good romantic comedy,"Good romantic comedy. In a scene when Anna Scott and William Thacker leave the birthday party celebration, the very first words out of Anna's mouth are, ""Why is Bella in a wheelchair?"" This is precisely, to the letter, as it would be in real life. When folks come in contact with a person with an obvious disability, they understandably want to know what happened. Bella's husband tenderly lifts her out of her wheelchair to carry her up the staircase to bed. My thermometer was on . .. testing for feelings of excessive sympathy or sorrow in myself or in the audience. There were none. There was only empathy, warmth, and tenderness, much of what one would feel watching any loving couple where the man lifted the woman over a doorstep, for instance, into their first home. Kudos to the director and the actors for not playing the pity card here. Thankfully no soaring violins tugged at our tear ducts. As the culminating scene of the movie approaches, the group of friends all impulsively jump into a small European car to race off. There was Bella left waving goodbye from her Quickie. No, wait a minute. This was not to be. They wanted Bella with them; she belonged with them on this mission. There were no complicated maneuvers of how will we squeeze her into the car, what will we do with the wheelchair, no exasperation from the characters. They just did it. They made it happen. Before we knew it, Bella was sitting in the front seat; a few others had rearranged their positions and crammed into the back seat, and off they all went charging away full speed ahead.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beauty,"Wow this was amazing. I think this could easily be one of my favourite romantic comedies. The comedy was hilarious and the romance was beautiful.Like with Pretty Woman, it had that class difference and it's such a strong element in these films. William is a bookseller, barely making any money to keep the store open. Anna is an actress and made $15 million in her last film. However, money doesn't stop them from falling in love. In fact, Anna makes all this money and couldn't find happiness, and William without her was stuck in an endless loop of living with no meaning. However, their paths cross and their lives are changed forever.I need to mention how good these ending scenes are in these romantic comedies. They all have the same premise with the one chasing after the other, but every time it's very special and takes your heart away.Normally this genre doesn't do anything special in cinematography but I think this film did a great job, having a lot of rememberable scenes. There were a few continuity errors, however the editor always prioritised emotion and there couldn't be nothing more important.After watching this I've realised that romance/ romantic comedies are my favourite type of film. They're just too beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hugh plays it again.,"It never ceases to amaze me that Hugh Grant succeeds in navigating through his movie career playing the same character over and over again.

Frothy fairy tale romance,"Impecunious London bookstore owner Hugh Grant lost for words when incognito film star Julia Roberts pops into his shop for a browse. This is the movies, so  despite the chasm between them  they fall in love. It's a path fraught with obstacles and misunderstandings, most of them comic. Richard Curtis' canny follow up to Four Weddings is in no way a sequel though it is very similar  a sentimental fairy-tale romance that's all froth and no body. Nonetheless, it's diverting entertainment and the sheer class of the stars seems to lend it substance, certainly as the story unfolds (which is basically Roman Holiday for the 1990s, with better jokes and a happier ending). Grant's patented stuttering diffidence is thrown into sharp relief by Roberts' easy radiance. She's already proved a dab hand at self-effacing comedy and she brings a scary conviction to her tantrum scenes here. Grant's gaggle of friends are a less impressive bunch, though Rhys Ifans has fun as his disgusting flatmate Spike.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Just impressive...,"""Notting Hill"" I believe it's a movie which is the definition of a romance movie and combines really nice romance with comedy. In this movie we have a beautiful and really famous actress who changes the life of a simple bookshop owner and love starts there. Also in this movie we watch what difficulties have to get throw and how are they going to do that.I liked this movie because of the plot, the storyline and the direction of Roger Michell who I believe that he did a great job in that and this is something that is obvious in whole of the movie. Julia Roberts who plays as Anna Scott a famous actress makes a nice interpretation as Hugh Grant who plays as William Thacker a bookshop owner for one more time do. Another good interpretation made by Rhys Ifans who plays as Spike the roommate of William Thacker and best friend who is really hilarious.Finally I have to say that ""Notting Hill"" is a must see movie for all the people. I also believe that you will like this movie not only for the above reasons but because of the music which accompanies the movie and I really liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Julia Roberts was The Finest Woman in 1999,"This romantic comedy is actually pretty enjoyable. with light approach and simple story and pretty colorful setting for 1999 movie.Hugh Grant played the awkward, cute man in London live life as underachiever.

Mind you, Julia Roberts was so so so captivating here.rest of the story is probably guessable but the dynamics between the two lead are adorable. sometimes I feel myself blushing while watching.all in all, this movie is pretty good and enjoyable. kinda similar vibe as Love, Actually but with minimum characters",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Take 2 (Take 1 Date: 16 February 2003),"I have since purchased this movie on DVD, and watched it several more times. The supporting characters who make up William Thacker's (Hugh Grant's) world seem a bit less freakish with greater familiarity.Moreover I now ""get the point"" that Thacker's genuine love for, and patient acceptance of, all these zany people -- even the shoplifter -- is precisely what Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) finds so appealing about him. He is that rare sort of guy who would love her and accept her, no matter what changes fate and time should bring. He would also love their children with equal if not greater devotion, not just because they are his, but because that is how he treats everyone in his life.Perhaps this was a type of love that Scott had not realized was possible for her, something she had not even known to want until her chance meetings with Thacker. And this explains why she took such reckless risks to woo him.Now that I ""get it,"" I really like it.*Directors, even more than writers, confront a paradox of timing. They spend endless hours, weeks, and months planning, shooting, cutting, and tweaking a film, growing deeply intimate with every detail, including the ones left out.But they must ultimately release their movie in a form that is perfectly comprehensible and engaging to the audience, so that people for whom it is all brand new can still get the whole thing in one unbroken take (there ain't no pause buttons in the multiplex). At least with a book (and now with DVDs) the consumer can re-read a passage or replay a line that did not connect the first time. But movies are still made for theaters, and must work there the first time, in real time.The best movies do work the first time, but also reward repeat viewing with enhanced pleasure and deeper insight. But some very good movies, including this one, can only be fully appreciated after several viewings. This is yet another reason to be grateful for DVDs.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A simple,feel good romantic movie","William Thacker (Hugh Grant) is a bookshop owner and Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) plays the real life character in the reel life too of being a very famous actress. The story starts when Anna one fine day comes to William's shop to buy a book. If you watch this movie don't expect anything.It's just a feel good movie and does'nt provoke you to think .The best part of the movie is that it's a simple story with simple performances by both the leading actors. Worth mentioning is William's room-mate Spike(Rhys Ifans) who adds some elements of fun to the story every now and then. The story spans both William's and Anna's lives after they meet each other (a cake of life with some problems between the two to serve as toppings !!!). You watch the whole film in one mood so it seems rather monotonous yet you would like it as there has got an appeal in simplicity too which makes this movie click. But the problem in this film is that it does'nt have anything unusual. You can give this movie a miss like any other simple movie.Nothing to watch for. The role of William and Anna could have been done by any other actor, so can say that actors of such caliber have been not used upto the mark. The story is predictable and ending is rather too flat.It could have been better had it not taken the usual path as to strive you got to be different. Yet the main motive of the movie seems to be making a routine film rather than trying to be different. Overall : a simple,feel good,romantic movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

liable to give you tooth-ache.....,"""Notting Hill"" has an attractive leading couple, an interesting supporting cast, and more laughs than your average romantic comedy, but overall it makes ""Four Weddings..."" look like gritty social drama.  Sweet, sweet, sweet. After a decent set-up, thought-provoking even, (how would YOU react if your friend brought a mega-movie-star along as a date to your dinner party?) at every juncture thereafter the film leaves all sense of reality behind and heads off on flights of fancies...... If you want to disengage your brain as the lights dim, and enter a fantasy world where movie stars and mortals meet, mix, and fall in love inside 10 minutes, then this is the film for you. If, however, you're hoping for some sort of realism, and any insights at all into relationships in the 90's, try somewhere else, sorry. Where you might expect to hear the sorts of conversations which might explain why Julia should fall in love with Hugh, you'll only get lingering views of beautiful faces and soft music....... .....And how come Hugh demonstrated that he lived on planet earth by recognising ""Anna Scott"" but somehow didn't know who Leonardo Dicaprio was?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not as good the second time around,"Perhaps it is unfair to compare this film to FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, even though the writer and star of that film(Richard Curtis and Hugh Grant) have re-teamed for a similarly-themed romantic comedy(English man falls for American beauty who may be out of his league).  And I don't think Grant has played the same the same character over and over again(there's not much in common between his roles in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, SIRENS, and EXTREME MEASURES, for example, not to mention AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE).  But he certainly does a carbon copy of his performance in FOUR WEDDINGS here. Worse, while he was able to display a range of emotions in that film, and even get in on some of the film's funny bits(the best man speech), here, the only emotion he's allowed to display is wistfulness, and a little of that goes a long way.  You just wish that he'd get angry once.Julia Roberts fares a little better, though she's underplaying as if she expected she'd have something much more raucous to play against.  She of course is playing someone who has to have a facade on at all times, but she does get to show other facets, like petulance(when the others around her are saying how miserable their lives are, and she feels left out), humor(when she shows up a group of diners talking about her as if she was a whore), and anger(when the press shows up outside Grant's door).  Still, I wish the satire on movie stars' lives had been more pronounced; what's there is good(the press junkets, the discussion of stunt bottoms), but I was left hungry for more.Oddly enough, the most blatant copy of FOUR WEDDINGS - the friends Grant has - is the part which worked best for me, because at least the people their had personalities to express, and they never let the sentimentality get too heavy(when one of them is in a wheelchair, you prepare for the worst, but Emma Chambers(I think she's the actress) deflects that by never playing for pathos).  Also, Rhys Ifans steals the movie, and it sorely needs him. Overall, not bad, but could have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Comedy of the year? No!,"I've always had a problem with 'Romantic Comedies'. What this term usually means is that there is no plot, no jokes and that you will leave the cinema feeling nauseous. If that didn't scare me away then the names at the top of the poster definitely should have, Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. But for some reason I saw it anyway, partly because of Rhys Ifans who was brilliant in Twin Town and secondly because it was free. My worst fears were confirmed, weak plot, predictable jokes and Hugh Grant playing his one character (bumbling, annoying, pathetic.)Rhys Ifans' character seemed to be tagged on as the comic relief (why does a 'comedy' need a comic relief?) and was underused. Julia Roberts was just dull and unconvincing. Also when will comedy writers learn that Middle Class people aren't interesting. They have responsible jobs, live in nice houses, drive 'reliable' cars, have dinner parties, go ski-ing, listen to Phil Collins & Celine Dion, drink wine and have children that are good at science. They are not good subjects for comedy. All the best sitcoms and films have been born out of squalor. Steptoe & Son, The Young Ones, Only Fools & Horses and even Father Ted are all based around the fact that the charcters haven't got two pound notes to rub together. Richard Curtis seems to have been seduced by the dark side of the comedy force, that of the affluent American sitcom. Where everyone is rich, clever and pretty and get into a series of ""hilarious mishaps and misunderstandings"". An air of pomposity can sometimes overcome the affluence problems sometimes (Basil Fawlty, Captain Mainwaring etc.) but Notting Hill doesn't have this either. All the characters seem apologetic for their own existence which just leads to more tedium. Overall a thoroughly over-rated and boring film. Little Voice was more touching and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrells was funnier. After watching this film I think you will be able to tell that it was Ben Elton who wrote the funny bits in Blackadder.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Remake of Four Weddings and Funeral?,"During the summer of 1999, this movie was so over-rated that it was almost scary. When I sat down to watch it, all I got was drama and romance that was sappier than a pine tree. I hated it and it wasn't until years after I saw Four Weddings and a Funeral that I finally figured out why. Both screenplays were penned by the same man. Could Notting Hill have had anything more in common with Four Weddings? Lonely Englishman meets a lovely American woman and just when he thinks that things couldn't be better between them they only get worse a few times before she finally isn't too busy to spend more time with him. With these and recent movies that bare the names Sandra Bullock and Jennifer Lopez, I'm convinced that romantic comedies are nothing shy of crap.",,Anonymous,Romance

The soundtrack, the insanely quirky roommate-Rhys Ifans, Hugh Grant's amazingly funny friends, Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant himself. I'm gonna go with all of the above because I don't have to choose!! One thing I didn't love was how Julia Robert's character was kind of mean to Hugh Grant's character too many times. I wouldn't have stuck around for all of that crapshoot behavior but I guess she was guarded and cautious? I'll give her the benefit of the doubt because she's got trust issues from the paparazzi and the Hollywood life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable...,"Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts compliment each other so well in this film. Hugh Grant plays the bumbling travel-book store owner who leads a simple life well, while Julia Roberts plays a celebrity with character in an almost self-analytical role. Considering she already is a celebrity with character, she certainly makes Anna Scott extremely appealing.(WARNING: mild spoilers) What I liked about this film the most is that it is totally from William Thacker's (Hugh Grant) perspective. The audience never gets to see Anna Scott's glamourised world unless William is present. Essentially we're all stuck in Notting Hill with him, but on the other hand, in reality, would we ever see how celebrities live unless it is through the media. Thacker's perspective relates to the audience very well because we could all wonder about what it would be like for a normal person to become involved with a celebrity. This factor plays well in the film for comic value without being slapstick such as when William takes Anna to his sister's birthday celebrations, the humour revolves around the friends and family's behaviour towards Anna!Great performances from Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, and the supporting cast. Predictable but fun, and a great balance of analysis of celebrity hype and normal everyday life and romantic comedy. ***1/2 out of *****!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Has its moments but nothing special.,"Hugh Grant bats his eyelids too much.  Julia Roberts, well this is pretty much her most likeable performance since Pretty Woman.  Rhys Ifans as Spike steals a couple scenes out from under both.  A better than average British romantic comedy which deteriorates due to a familiar mad chase to fix the relationship ending.  The Brits own the copyright on this type of ending. But the press conference climax was completely unbelievable.  In fact, making Julia Roberts a world renowned movie star wasn't the best idea. Perhaps if she was more low key like a an Author, or an Heiress, or a Cellist, it would have made the story easier to swallow.  A big time Hollywood goddess falling for a book salesman in some seedy London district for more than a diversion is a fairy-tale at best.Not the worst comedy romance you'll ever see, and not the best.

Unexpectedly beautiful.,"Let me get through it, how i became so obsessed with this movie, i was just rolling channels on my home TV and i was just checking out same TV channels with the different programs and eventually, i got myself at HBO, there was a scene when a random woman which i considered at that time, walked-in in some kind of book store and was looking for the guy (William Wacker) and then he came and struck up with the most deep proposal conversation. I listened that and watched that scene so desperately and i loved it, As the movie went ahead, there came a most beautiful scene i have ever seen on TV when the William Wacker and Anna Scott sitting on the bench and William reading a book while holding a hand of her and there is baby in her womb. I figured that scene and that moment in the movie as one of the most beautiful and charming scene.

A Cute 90's Rom-Com Bolstered By Hugh Grant And Julia Roberts Especially,"Pros:
1. There is electric chemistry, not just between Hugh Grant (William Thacker) and Julia Roberts (Anna Scott), but between all of the main and co-main actors and actresses.
2. The character of Spike (Rhys Ifans) serves as excellent comic relief to break the monotony of the romance-drama fuelled story.
3. Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts deliver brilliant performances, particularly Julia Roberts who adds so much depth to her character by just her facial expressions and vocal intonations.
4. The soundtrack is both cozy and comforting, fitted with classics and modern classics (Bill Withers - 'Ain't No Sunshine' and Ronan Keating - 'When You Say Nothing At All') thus helping to imbue the film with an easy-going vibe.
5. The movie highlights the importance of empathising with differing perspectives in a grounded and non-patronising manner.
6. The quick-cut edits are used sparingly but effectively to add dynamism.Cons:
1. The score, especially the guitar strumming and piano playing, is overbearing and way too cheesy.
2. Somehow Anna Scott is able to walk around London almost entirely unnoticed, whether it be in a crowded street or restaurant. This is somewhat unbelievable.
3. There are a few scenes needlessly added in order to inculcate pointless drama. For example, when William Thacker walks over to the men in the restaurant for loudly discussing their lust for Anna Scott.
4. At the end, the writing clearly got a little lazy as both the Ritz Concierge (Henry Goodman) and Savoy Concierge (Patrick Barlow) decide to break their oaths of silence - which were taken to safeguard the security of Anna Scott - in order to set up the final get-together scene.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rent it if you subscribe to the National Enquirer.,"I kept thinking it seemed odd at the beginning of the movie that Hugh Grant should be surprised by the attentions of this famous movie starlet. After all, he is surely one of the leading heart-throbs on the screen these days. Oh yeah, I remembered, he is pretending to be a nobody, not an actor. But even as a nobody, I had trouble believing he would be shy and unable to get a date. And I had a heck of a time identifying with him.And then there is Julia Roberts, famous actress, pretending she can't find true love, except in a book shopkeeper. Huh??? OK, accepting that stretch, lets say she was not a famous actress and just a girl who comes on to Grant. I doubt someone looking like Hugh Grant would pay much attention to such a mousy chick. So the logic that there is true love in Grant's heart for the person, not the actress is hard to accept.If only there had been a climatic love scene - no not sex, but an intelligent conversation. I mean here are two people who decide not just to marry, but to make radical changes in their lives and they have done nothing deeper than take a walk in a park at night. I mean, she comes in to his book store to buy a book about travel; he owns a book store with nothing but books about travel. I am sitting there just waiting for a conversation about how they love to travel and would like to run away to some tropical isle together, or something. Not just a few quick name droppings of authors and painters.The weird collection of people in Grant's family resembles the Addams Family, with Grant the only normal one. But then it began to make sense: this movie is not aimed at intellectuals, but at air heads who read People magazine and the tabloids, and whose very being hangs vicariously on reading about the lives of celebrities. The family represents the demographics of the tabloid readers, providing one of each type so they can identify with someone in the movie.This could have been a profound movie about love transcending all, etc. Instead it is a superficial romance aimed at people whose idea of romance consists of a famous person taking one look at them and then falling madly in love with them. If you read People magazine, you will probably enjoy it. If you read Scientific American, forget it.One other thing, this is another one of those videos where the box bears no resemblance to the movie. Why is Julia Roberts in pearls with a goofy grin? I mean she spends most of the movie in T-shirt. It makes it look like she is some rich person who lives in a mansion in Notting Hill.

"Largely innocuous, but entertaining in some ways","It seems lately that people expect every movie to either be an action fest or an Oscar winner. ""Notting Hill"" is neither. In a way it is ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" revisited. Hugh Grant's character has an agreeable group of friends including the kookie houseguest and the sibling. Andie MacDowell's character has been replaced by Julia Roberts's movie star. MacDowell is more beautiful than Julia Roberts, but Roberts is a better actress, though she really plays herself in this movie. Actually, I don't know Julia Roberts from Eve, so maybe she's playing a woman who just happens to be a world famous movie star as well. I gave it a 7 because it was entertaining and fun and above average in many respects and I expect other people to hover around 3 and 4 so I wanted to throw up the average. The honest ranking is probably 6.Oh, despite three years between pictures, Hugh Grant turns in a strong performance as a slightly disaffected, normal Englishman whose life is turned upside down because he happened to fall in love with the most famous woman in the world.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pretty famous woman,"What does fame do to a person? To their perception ... now don't get this wrong: this is not a character study. This is a comedy - but quite a good one. I can see why Hugh Grant was considered the thing (excuse the objectification) for some time back then ... well until he had a public ... I'm not even sure what to call it. Funnily enough this movie has something similar. Although I reckon no one would call Hughs character a hooker ... ah well so many jokes and connections to other things. Also life being stranger than fiction.But back to this and a story that may be a bit too sweet at places but still has some weird jokes to keep a balance of it all. If you like the two main actors and characters, there is nothing that can go wrong ... and then there is the mad Spike character ... he has his moments. For better or worse ... also the movie in general seems to be winking at the audience and be self reflective ... maybe more than some even remember. I know I would have really laughed, if after they talked about body (part) doubles, if we'd seen Julia Roberts behind ... well not her behind in that case obviously ... anyway strange and funny and engaging. It deserves being hailed as one of the better romantic comedies, predictabilities and that ending aside ...",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Tedium.,"It is quite possible for this film to wash over you and leave absolutely no trace of passing.There are about three or four lines in this effort which are funny however the tedium in-between does not make them worth the wait. If you take a few of the scenes from Four weddings and also Pretty woman add a quaint little London bookshop you basically have it. Also make sure you have a wacky girl with daft hair, the disabled ex-girlfriend, the failing stockbroker, a dreadful cook and a smelly flat mate with a Welsh accent and you have the total depth of the characters. All committed to each other as lifelong friends who share each other's highs and lows in life.Attention to detail is important in a film. Hugh Grant`s character lives in a flat with hundreds of LPs on the shelves, suggesting that he is a music enthusiast. However, the record player in his flat is a piece of junk with it's equalisation settings set to screaming treble. Obviously nobody in the production team has the first idea about audio, or perhaps they were all too bored to care.In order to prevent this getting the U certificate it richly deserves a few carefully crafted swear words were added to the script. A ploy often used to suggest that a film actually has something in it worth sitting through.Unfortunately this is the type of film Hollywood loves and will continue to fund. A dreadful sure fire box office success with multimillion dollar marketing opportunities for years to come.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
What possessed me to watch this c**p?,"What do I hate more? The film 'Notting Hill' for being such a heaping pile of mildewed, rotten, putrid smelling sh*t, or myself for paying money to the industry that allowed this artificial fairytale 'romance' to ever appear at my local Odeon.This is without doubt the most cloyingly saccharine sweet, disturbing, appallingly reality-free piece of film of all 1999, appealing only to a) Self satisfied idiots b) Drippy romantics/new couples. I'm neither a) nor b), so I see through the veil of c**p.Will Thacker owns and runs a bookshop. Badly. The biggest film star in the world, Anna Scott, (Roberts) drops into Will's Notting Hill bookshop, one thing leads to another and the two start a relationship.Not impossible, by any means. Just highly, highly improbable. The relationship and the place they called Notting Hill. I live near Notting Hill, and it don't look like that, believe me. Where are all the different races? Where are the tramps? Where's the rubbish? All conveniently airbrushed out to feed the Hollywood view of England as full of Hugh Grants (effeminate fops) and Rhys Ifans (lovable rouge) - granted, he's Welsh, but the US aren't listening that hard.Incredibly, both the US and UK's general public seemed to fall for the same character Hugh Grant has been playing since he was born - (blithering mook) - and as for Julia Roberts and the scene where people are bad-mouthing actresses: boo-hoo!!!

Julia Roberts signature movie,"Though I am not a fan of hers, I love her in this movie.It could have been better with reasonable cuts; like in the beginning. When I watched the start, I was tempted to call it quits after some 10 minutes. Minutes of a world-famous actress, followed by a rather boring, narrated introduction into Notting Hill that serves no purpose for the movie.Julia Roberts plays her role like a life-cast here. That's a rare occurrence in the history of movies. And she's splendidly clothed and made-up for it, since from the very first moment we can see the two faces of her: the global star, and the humble, thoughtful woman in search of the real life; the 'normal' compatriote.The actress who looks like having been forced into the business, and pursues it without too much conviction.In Germany the Best Friend's Marriage is more prominent and well-known, though. To me without any cause, since it doesn't contain the same depth and conviction. Maybe the Germans just turned off respectively left the cinema during the dreadful beginning of this one?

Typical British Romcom,"Richard Curtis movies are generally very similarly themed, as are British Romcoms generally, and this is no exception. They're all based in a kind of sunlit, middle class, quirky universe. This isn't a criticism, this is just to say that the world depicted in these films doesn't really exist in the way it comes across in Notting Hill.Most people probably know the plot to this film - Hugh Grant's William Thacker, a fairly unsuccessful travel book seller bumps into Julia Roberts' Anna Scott, a huge movie star, when she first comes into his shop and then literally when he walks around a corner and bumps into her spilling orange juice all over her. This is the ""meet cute"" where our two protagonists begin to embark on their on-off relationship.Whilst possibly slightly implausible in the real world, in this fantasy world of Notting Hill, west London, Anna and William keep meeting up - the juice spillage, a press junket, dinner with William's suitably quirky yet posh friends and sister, at the Ritz Hotel where their blossoming romance is interrupted and paused due to Anna's Hollywood movie star boyfriend surprising her with a visit, when she appears at his house to seek shelter away from the prying eyes of the British press after some ""pornographic"" photos of her are exposed, and when she's back in London some months later filming her latest project.The plot fizzes along and the humour is constant, generally very funny and fairly typically British in tone and style. The leads and supporting characters are all perfectly cast. Emma Chambers who plays William's sister Honey is fabulous, and I always thought she was hugely underrated as an actor. Hugh Grant at this time was still known for playing slightly bumbling posh men who aren't very good with women or romance really and Julia Roberts at the time probably was one of the biggest actors in the world so her role sits perfectly with her.Whilst not a direct sequel to Richard Curtis' mega success from 1994 Four Weddings and a Funeral, it does serve as a great and tonally similar follow-up.I've probably watched this movie at least twenty times over the years since it came out and I still really enjoy it. There's nothing in it to not enjoy really. At the time of its cinematic release it was, and still is, the biggest British film in terms of box office receipts ever. There is a reason why - it is a really, really good film. It isn't particularly deep or complicated, but it makes you laugh (and possibly cry) and its lovely to spend a couple of hours in a world where love wins.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Julia Roberts last hooray of her glorious 90's run!,"Julia Roberts closing out the 1990's, has had somewhat of a dominant run that made her a Box Office name. She had some stinkers here and there, but mostly she's synonymous for her work in Romantic Comedies such as Pretty Woman, and Best Friend's Wedding. But, by the time Y2K comes around, we start to see less of her, and it's movies like this that remind those who are not familiar or understand this genre, why she was so revered. It was her pinpoint understanding of romance in acting and the peas and ques of good chemistry with her partner. This is something I noticed about her just now, and it makes sense to her charisma on screen was sorely missed after the decade ended.Her ability to not be the same character from an acting standpoint is pause for observation. I watched this and My Best Friend's Wedding back-to-back and I appreciated the fact that she was more than meets the eye candy test. Beautiful is what some would call her as distracting, but that's deceiving. Her fundamental ability as an actress first, to approach the role with a surreptitious coquettish tone, compared to her vicarious maudlin role in MBFW, was a welcome surprise that didn't go unnoticed by me. And I came to appreciate it the more I think about it because she could of just phoned it in as another role, she might have been type casted in, but somewhere I read she got a hold of this script and loved it so much, she asked to be in the film once the writer sold the script. That's the playing cards of a professional. And a good one.Hugh Grant being her opposite side in the 90's craze of lined roles of typecasting was also riding high into the new millennium. It's to say that both of these actors came to a crossroads in their careers and gave the audiences a well-established romance even though it was a onetime thing. I don't believe they ever did another film together, even in supporting roles, but even if it was just this one go around, I wonder what a film would look like in a sequel twenty-five years later with an old William Thacker, and Anna Scott. I don't particular like Romance comedies but in Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant's library of films, I got to say this one was pretty damn good. And well worth the watch.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sci-fi romantic comedy,"This is the kind of romantic comedy that seems set in a parallel universe where usual rules of romance don't apply.Here are the rules of 'Notting Hill' universe:a beautiful, stinking rich, famous, self realized actress can't find a decent date;she falls in love for the first ""normal"" guy who looks at her mouth-open and says nothing smart;""normal"" people are all losers whose life has a meaning only if they meet a movie star; this is shown in the dinner between Robert and Grant's friends. Their chatting is covered by music, implicating that thay can't say nothing interesting.star and ""normal"" people belong to two separate castes, and their love raises more problems than Romeo and Juliet's.Apart from this absurd (and a bit insulting) premise, Roberts and Grant have no chemistry; they seem to be more in need of confidential friendship than love, and we see no solid reason for they should love each other.The script is pretty lame, characters are not well developed, and there's only one really good joke (about Mel Gibson). The supporting characters are nothing special, Rhys Ifans'character is there as a target for jokes, but has nothing to do with the story.Gets one point more for good visuals, the season-changing scene is fascinating.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nodding Hill - Rating: Two Eyes Closed,"American movie star on location in England meets unsuccessful travel book store owner and falls in love, ... I think.

For filler - it can't be all teeth and hair - round it out with a colourful cast of British extras slumming for money between BBC gigs, stage work, and pogey.  By the time this star vehicle reached its tedious conclusion, I had experienced several power naps and didn't care how happy, or unhappy, the unlikely couple had become.The only memorable bit in this movie was when Julia's actress character was making small talk with one of Hugh's fascinating friends/relatives.  The poor Brit was unaware of her star status and assumed that she was a struggling actress.

"I live in Notting Hills, you live in Beverly Hills.","In 1999, cinema audiences got to see the charming coupling of Julia Roberts, who ironically played a world-famous superstar and Hugh Grant in his typical british and witty manner.Written by comical genius Richard Curtis, whose work I particularly appreciated in ""Love Actually"", the dialogues are splendid. The romantic plot is obviously simplistic as well as easily told.And the movie does have some cliches here and there. But a clever and lighthearted take on the matter paired with ingenious humor make this movie memorable and fun.In my opinion, Rhys Ifans steals every scene he is in, as he is constantly hilarious.Additionally, the soundtrack is also quite notable.If you are a fan of British movies with conventional elements, like it is the case for me, then this is a most enjoyable must-watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the best rom coms ever.,"I think a very loose remake of Roman Holiday, I just watched Notting Hill again after 20 years, and its as good as ever. The whole thing covers realistically, what a normal person would do if they fell in love with a huge movie star, but also finds amazing humour and insight into romance, human nature, and the film industry.Richard Curtis's is a rare mix of a truly funny writer, but at the same time, he is a true romantic - he is arguably the best Rom com writer/director. This is one of, if not the best of his works.Hugh Grant is perfect as the slightly awkward but witty ""everyman"" and Julie Roberts works so well as the Hollywood actress.The ""I'm just a girl, talking to a boy"" scene is brilliant, and one of the best scenes in any romance move... hard to keep your eeys dry in it.Another strong element is the cast of his friends, all great actors delivering great dialogue, in the setting of the Npotting Hill area of London.Simply Brilliant.

A serviceable romantic comedy,"One of my friends really likes this movie. So I decided to give it a try. Well, it was a pleasant, simple and mostly implausible romantic comedy about a famous fictional actress and the man that loves her.In terms of romantic comedy, this film basically gets the touchstones right. There are quirky, but fleshed out supporting characters. Silly scenarios and the like. It's cute enough to be smile-making funny, albeit nothing laugh-out-loud. But that's fine.It's likable. But it still has a few faults, some of which I'll describe here. The film takes a shortcut in developing the characters' relationship by use of montage. I generally dislike this practice, except if you need to get across a lot of information quickly. In this case, it was to skip past the hard work of showing these people get to like each other. And so it comes across to me as cheap and I have a hard time believing that they've come to like each other. Of course, I just bought it for the sake of not hating the film--but it would be nice it the story featured more of that and cut a little bit more of the not-as-funny comedy bits.The other thing is that the main characters are pretty flat. That is, both protagonists aren't very well developed (albiet the male protagonist is a little more developed than the actress) and so sometimes wasn't really caring about their trials and tribulations. But otherwise, they seem to be lifted from templates rather than having been thought through carefully. The supporting characters, on the other hand, have more depth than I expected. Unfortunately, it's not their story.Still, it does its got as a serviceable romantic comedy just fine so I can say that you might enjoy it. I enjoyed it at least, even if at times I was throwing crumpled paper at the screen. 7/10.Another note: I really didn't like the overuse of pop music in the film, especially the overblown music used to bookend the film. It felt a little tacked on or inorganic to the soul of the film and almost seems to try to ""sell"" the scene as emotionally related to the piece of selected music. Perhaps with more carefully selected tunes, it wouldn't have been so bad, but the choices were either overly melodramatic or just too well-known.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I get the impression that a group of Brits want to impress the US with a certain British ""coolness"" and yet don't take themselves too seriously. The whole thing feels like a cynical way of making money. I don't find this very funny. It's worth a giggle but that's it. The US produces refined comedy in the mould (mold) of Frasier and that is something we could do well in England, but don't bother. The US also make comedies like Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) and they are a real hoot. England could produce those too.I don't live like the Notting Hill-ites and yet I see true humour every week. Perhaps I should write something? I just might.So - the English can be funny and English but not a caricature like this. Try some of the Ealing comedies of the 50's - look at ""The Lavender Hill Mob"" or basically the feel of ""The Pink Panther"".Anyway, enough wibble.

Even the humor is to the point, and not too pushy. The corniness is a given to the genre, but in movies like these, it is done in an endearing way. The characters are flawed, but never annoying.

ROM-COM that works,"I'm not one to watch rom-coms, let alone like them. But this one does it for me. Great line up, believable story (to a point), and above else, good comedy(not overbearing) that would work in a group of real friends. In my entire collection of owned movies, this is probably 1 of the very few rom-coms I own myself and watched many times. Definitely two thumbs-up.Simply put, a guy meets a girl that is way out of his league, but chance has it, they end up connecting and the ride takes off on a roller coaster of events and emotions.

An appalling film.,"Whoever wrote the pitching line was right to say that 'Notting Hill' is 'Four Weddings and a Pretty woman', but he or she would have been more right to say that this film is a 'wanna-be Four Weddings and a Pretty Woman'. The script I thought  was appalling. It reminds me of those teenage fantasies I used to have about being a very famous actress and being admired by the man I secretly wanted to impress in real life. There's nothing wrong with these fantasies, but there's cleverer ways of exploring them. Dialogues were dreadful, the plot absurd, the acting appalling and the directing very poor. But what most worries me is the fact that people like it and that companies invest in it.  Sad indeed!!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Spend your time on ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" instead!","The story of romance between the main characters is really not believable in any sense: All other plot-ingredients which have been put in to thrill the audience (like stereotyped English characters, ""exotic"" (i e highly fabricated) London-locations and supposedly ""witty British"" lines of dialog) form a much more convincing whole in films like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". This film just never managed to go beyond its rather boring surface and, hence, I found myself strangely disinterested in whatever happened to - at least - the main characters.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Wry British Comedy with Staying Power,"NOTTING HILL was a breath of fresh air when it entered the theaters in 1999. Written by Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually, The Girl in the Cafe - as well as the Bridget Jones scripts) and directed by Roger Michell (Persuasion, Changing Lanes, Enduring Love) the story is a bit cockamamie but blossoms in the hands of the fine cast. Now with this Collector's Edition release it is available for us all to appreciate again.William (Hugh Grant) is an ordinary bloke who runs a Travel Book Store in Notting Hill, a man whose life is abruptly changed when an American actress Anna (Julia Roberts) enters his shop and his life. Bumbling William spills orange juice on celebrity-shy Anna and the two cross the street to William's flat, shared with the wildly mad but lovable Spike (Rhys Ifans), and despite poor starts there begins a romance to test all romances. The manner in which William and Anna gradually find each other's vulnerabilities, including exposure to each other's lives - Anna with her celebrity entourage, William with his loony but oh so tender extended family (Tim McInnerny, Gina McKee, Emma Chambers, and Hugh Bonneville) - is the story of love overcoming hurdles. The secondary themes are lovely and beautifully played by this committed cast.For a springy, funny, tender, sweet British humor story, this one is hard to beat. Recommended. Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
1999: the 'Year that Changed Movies' ... except maybe for romantic comedies ...,"From Richard Curtis, the screenwriter of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"" wandered through a labyrinth of cinematic conventions with such confidence I felt myself immediately absorbed by the story. Romantic comedies might not be my cup of tea, but not in Britain where tea is elevated to an institutional rank.And romantic comedy is not the easiest genre to handle; it has an obligation to reinvent new comedic and entertaining situations out of hackneyed material. For instance, as soon as the eyes of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts meet in the titular area, we know they're meant for each other and that they'll end up together. But we also know it won't happen before the last five minutes, so the reason-to-be of ""Notting Hill"" relies on the way it will delay each time the predictable resolution. And when it comes to rom-coms, it's on the 'how' factor that relies the effectiveness of all the 'aww' and 'wow'-feelings, they're meant to provoke.Like most romantic comedies, ""Notting Hill"" starts with two lonely hearts filled with good excuses for having lost faith in true love: an indispensable attitude to postpone the romantic epiphany. Julia Roberts is Anna Scott, a movie star, an object of admiration for women, of fantasies for men, and harassment from the Press and Tabloids.(and Britain is certainly not the safest place to visit when you're a celebrity of her caliber). And in the love department, Anna Scott had the kind of romances that would have made lousy Curtis' screenplays, when we meet her, she has 'naturally' a boyfriend, but 'naturally', it's not official. Nothing is.And Anna Scott is such an obvious alter-ego of Julia Roberts that her name doesn't fool us, there's no doubt about her autobiographical inspiration, if it wasn't intended in the beginning, at the end, no one can ever dissociate the fictional from the real actress, but this is definitely not a flaw. At one point, Anna even mentions the disillusion of her stardom and the artifices she had to undergo to earn her 15 millions for a role, and then there's this little sparkle that disappear in Julia Roberts' eyes, as if Anna became the vehicle of Julia's truth. And in the process, Julia Roberts brings so much sincerity to her role that our empathy is granted for her, as it's impossible not to forgive the attitude she displays with the poor, well- meaning William, played by Hugh Grant.Grant is a divorced man, running a modest travel bookstore, sharing a house with an eccentric and nonchalant roommate (Rhys Ifans) who keeps exposing his dirty soles on the table, something that would immediately cure from the most hardcore foot fetishism. By the way, I suspect the director Roger Mitchell for having quite an obsession with feet and after Rhys Ifans and Hugh Grant, I was glad we could have some glimpse on Julia Roberts'. Anyway, there is Grant as William, who despite all his misadventures, is still in love with Anna Scott. Nothing happens at their first encounter but a few minutes later, through one of the gutsiest plot devices ever written, he collides with her, spilling orange juice on her shirt, and a perfect excuse to invite her to his house, and when she kisses him, it's  well, didn't I use the word 'obviousness'?Yet, there's one obvious element that is handled perfectly: the supporting cast. If you believe that nothing could beat the joyful bunch from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", wait till you see ""Notting Hill"". Now, that is a group that could have inspired a less insipid sitcom than ""How I Met With Your Mother'. We meet them during the first date between Anna and William coinciding with his sister's birthday: a lovable couple with a woman on a wheelchair, William's goofy airhead sister, a buffoonish stockbroker, they all make lovable losers (in the positive meaning of the term) genuinely supporting William and blessing his actions and decisions with the most cheerful approvals, with such friends, who'd even need a girlfriend? Except one like Julia  I mean, Anna Scott.William's friends contribute to one of the best written dinner scenes featuring a game in which the last piece of cake would be earned by the saddest story teller (not a piece of cake exercise).. And the scene provides some serious and tender moments proving that ""Notting Hill"" is more than your average romantic comedy. Indeed, while the two stars in the posters might be invitation for the most cynical expectations, ""Notting Hill"" tactfully and elegantly walks on the tightrope of its screenplay and never falls into the stereotypical schmaltz that could have destroyed it, even the so-called cringe-worthy line supposed to be the ""is it still raining"" of the film, suited the story. However, I noticed that the choice of songs seemed kind of out-of-place sometimes and. I was glad, after reading Roger Ebert's review that he also was annoyed by the 'Ain't no Sunshine' montage after the break-up. Who needs a song with 'when she's gone"" when we know what's going on? (By the way, I hope you won't take this as a spoiler, wouldn't you expect one break-up in a romantic comedy?)Perhaps regret on the redundancy of some situations, and the fact that Grant remains all stoical, never abandoning his British phlegm  seriously, when you know you love one person, would you take that much time before taking the big dive? Sometimes, one delay is one too much, or it betters leads up to a better conclusion. And I wouldn't have been that enthusiastic if the film didn't fulfill this premise, when it ends, it's a cheerful celebration, not overdone like ""Love Actually"", but with the right amount of positivity and tenderness, and the last shot is probably some of the best that ever concluded a romantic film.And thank God, they didn't think of putting ""Here Comes the Sun"".",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

They were unable to get into the plot. The movie is much too long, especially the last thirty minutes extends the movie in an unnecessary way.

The most shocking film in years.,"By shocking, of course, I mean shockingly GOOD. Hugh Grant is one of those actors that I have never been able to tolerate, and I have never been a huge Julia Roberts fan either (although I was truly impressed with Runaway Bride), but Notting Hill is one of the best romantic comedies that I have seen in years, easily surpassing Runaway Bride, one of my current favorites.Hugh Grant plays a normal guy who owns a travel bookstore in a tiny town called Notting Hill in London. He gives a surprisingly convincing performance in this role, and Julia Roberts is also excellent as the hugely popular Hollywood movie star because, whether you like it or not, she is a hugely popular Hollywood movie star. She plays the part of Anna Scott, the film star who happens to wander into William's (Grant) bookstore while in London shooting a film. One of the things that distinguishes this movie from other romantic comedies is the hesitant way that William and Anna grow to know each other. It's true that the whole oops-I'm-sorry-for-spilling-my-drink-on-you bit is not entirely original, but the good acting and directing made over-used material interesting again.By far the funniest character in the film, of course, is Spike, William's nut-case of a roommate (or `flatmate,' as William calls him). Some of the things that he did in the film are funnier than anything I've seen in years. For example, the way that he blows smoke through his nose into the snorkeling goggles, the way he mistakes mayonnaise for yogurt, or the scene where he finds out that William turned down Anna Scott (`You daft prick').While the movie may be a little bit long for some people, and as a whole, it doesn't really present anything really new in the genre of the romantic comedy, it moves along so smoothly and is so entertaining and funny that it is more than worth the extra time. I think that the fact that I am personally not a fan of either of the main stars, and yet I thoroughly enjoyed the film, says something about the quality of the movie. An excellent date movie, for everyone from first dates to happily married couples, so don't miss it. Just be prepared to be sore from laughing so much.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hugh Grant & Julia Roberts sparkle,"Can a common man ever expect to be in the company of a beautiful star? Maybe not in real life, but for the many that hope to ever do so this movie is a ray of hope.Hugh Grant was absolutely marvelous as a bookseller who bumps into Julia Roberts. She was equally fantastic in what I perceive to be her best performance since Pretty Woman.Rhys Ifans was absolutely over-the-top as his flatmate.As Lloyd Dobler said in ""Say Anything..."" My goal in life is just to be with her. What a goal. Lloyd achieved it and so did William Thacker. There is hope!I would be remiss if I did not mention the fantastic music in this movie. It was just incredible. Shania Twain, Al Green, Bob Marley, and on and on. It was a perfect soundtrack. That seems to characterize all of the romantic comedies that Grant is in.Damn, this was one great movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

If you want a truly admirable performance from either Julia or Hugh, search elsewhere. I'm glad this movie did work, because of all the tourists it now brings to Notting Hill, but I'm sure the residents would maybe think otherwise. The girl in the wheelchair and Ifans (Hugh's flatmate) give the best performances of the movie in my opinion and they have minimal roles.

Wonderful comedy about love and belonging,"This is a movie I never expected to like, being a romantic comedy and all. But now I've seen the movie four times, and it is still growing on me. Every time I see it I begin to cry (which I seldom do). This is one of the very few movies that has stuck with me. I have it with me, in the back of my head, whenever I try to work out love, when I'm thinking about life, etc. It's one of the very few movies that has had this effect on me (to name some of the others: The Iron Giant, Hannah and her Sisters, Fanny and Alexander, We all loved each other so much, My night at Maud's...). I know I am not the only one who feels this way about this movie. Some of my closest friends absolutely adore it, like me, and have seen it ten times or more. Others, however, think that is merely a nice romantic comedy, that's pacing along sometimes too slow. Why do people react so differently? I'll try to explain what I think is so amazing about it.The love story: First thing, of course, is the love story. It's based on the very old story about people who can 't have each other because of difficult circumstances (think Romeo and Juliet). Here it is about social class - a normal bloke from London and a Hollywood film star. But it is also about much more. What made me see this movie in the first place was that it was mentioned in a book about introversion that I was reading (myself being a kind of sociable introvert that has experienced difficulties in relationships because girls didn't give me enough space). Both Anna (Julia Roberts) and William (Hugh Grant) are introverts. Both have a hard time just expressing their feelings or immediately doing what they feel like. But still, from the first moment there is a spark between them that they can't deny. I guess that people who love this movie identify with either Anna, William or both. It's a major part of the movie: Seeing their faces, their expressions, their conversation... if you identify with them and intensely hope them to find love, you get drawn in. If not, you will find it boring.For me, I have found that I identify with both Anna and William. Anna, of course, is every man's dream: The star and beauty that shows up from nowhere and becomes a part of your life. So far, as a guy, I'm all with William. But in terms of how they interact... I know that I'm more like Anna. She is afraid of getting hurt, she's afraid of giving away her heart, she has a temper. She is difficult. William, on the other hand, is the good guy. He knows that he loves her all from the start, and he never shies away from saying it. Some lines are especially poignant. Once, when she comes to his house in a state of confusion, he just says: ""This is the place"". This line always gives me the shivers. So simple. So moving. And it says so much: No matter how difficult circumstances are, his place is the right place for her. I know that I, unfortunately being a bit Anna-like when it comes to being afraid of letting go and giving away my heart, long to meet a girl who will be like William: Who will just love me, in spite of my quirks and fears, and just be there, and not give up on me.The humor: This movie is not just about love, it is also very funny. Spike, the outspoken and vulgar roomie of William, provides constant comic relief. The humor is very British - dry, self- depreciating, semi-intellectual, at times surreal (but nice). The dialogue is sparkling all through the movie. love it. But I suspect that this is also a part of the film that some people will love, and others not so much.Place, friendship and belonging: Ultimately, however, i believe that the reason I and so many others see this movie time and time again is because it is about more than romantic love. It is about friendship, and ultimately about belonging. About finding a place in the world that is YOUR place, and then staying there. William's friends are always around, supporting him (and making fun of each other). The love between William's best friend Max and his wheel-chair bound wife Bella is very moving. And not to forget: The whole movie is called Notting Hill (an area in London). It 's not called ""William and Anna"", or something like that. Simply: Notting Hill. The area. The opening scene is about this area: William goes around explains that this is where he lives, and will continue to spend ""his hours and years"", and why he loves it so much. This is where William and his friends are grounded. It is their life, their area, their place in the world. And, the whole movie is about Anna coming to this place, and seeing the beauty in it, compared to the superficial world of Hollywood. Notting Hill/Williams's circle vs. Holllywood: 1-0.Summing it up, I guess this is why I keep coming back to this movie. If I feel lost, not sure about my place in the world, or wondering if I will ever find a girl to love who will love me back and that we'll be able to make it work - then I see this movie. It reminds me that life is ultimately about belonging somewhere, about having friends and family, and to dare to love. Not bad for a romantic comedy, eh? (and, of course - the acting of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts is superb. The filming is beautiful. The only annoying and dated thing is the music. But even that can't ruin a perfect movie)Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Good Watch.,"Notting Hill is a delightful romantic comedy movie. Hugh Grant shines as William Thacker, a bookshop owner whose ordinary life collides with Hollywood actress Anna Scott played by Julia Roberts. The film's magic lies in its sharp script and the undeniable charm of its leads. Grant and Roberts have fantastic chemistry, their witty banter and sweet moments making us root for their connection. Supporting characters like William's eccentric friends add humor and warmth. The London setting is vibrantly portrayed, adding another layer of charm. While the ending might be predictable, the journey is filled with laughter, warmth, and a touch of reality, making Notting Hill a romantic classic that deserves a rewatch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I'm surprised they were able to do so. The cinematography was amazing and the plot was so engaging, yet slow and beautiful. A fair bit predictable, as all rom-coms are, but I still loved watching it.

At the end of the day, it's just the typical movie about the poor guy falling in love with the rich girl, however little elements like the dinner with his family, the quirky roommate, etc. Help elevate the plot.

Acting:  B-; premise:  F+.  You know this one's full of itself when slo-mo shots and pics of Julia illuminate and fade during Elvis Costello's spewing opener, 'She'.

not too bad,"You know what this film is about?It's about £30k onto the value of my parents flat!Seriously, besides the noticeable effect on west London house prices (resident one R.

But the essential difference for me is that the female lead in this is sympathetic. Roberts brings to the role a charm and a beauty beyond mere physical appearance. What I find wrong about MacDowell's similar efforts (Four Weddings, Green Card (1990), Groundhog Day (1993)), is that I can't understand why the male lead actually likes her. Given that the film makers wouldn't tell MacDowell ""play it so that nobody likes your character"", I can only attribute this difference to the relative abilities of the actresses. Which surprised me, as I wasn't previously a huge fan of old fat-lips (the band Bongwater described the execrable Pretty Woman (1990) as ""It's fun to be a prostitute!"").This is a fairly mindless, but very warm and fuzzy movie. Don't expect to be intellectually challenged, or get a real picture of what life in West London is like.

It stars Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant as a couple consisting of a celebraty and private citizen.An actress (Roberts) and a book shop owner (Grant) are married. However, the latter is in for a shock when he sees the former occasionally going away to her film projects. It is because of this that their relationship is shaky, as they are not together often to accomplish group goals (eg, family events).An accurate portrayal of the subject matter are at play here, with no plot holes, situation-appropriate cuts and brilliant acting. Also, the topic covered is relatable. Coming from prior research, whether through the media in general or conversations, and experience when building relationships with folks everywhere, it is one thing to think of fame as all ""glitz and glame, with fancy property and no problems.

"Usual romantic comedy, but great screenplay.","""Notting Hill"" is an interesting romantic comedy, with two nice differences: Firstly, it is very well written, nearly as cleverly and as good as ""Analyze This"" and ""As Good As It Gets."" The relationships in the film are usual (half-witted but nice young man, beautiful and rich and clever but down-to-earth young woman, interesting but clueless bunch of friends, odd flatmate, close bond among a group of losers, funny helper at the shop...) to see in a romantic comedy (e.g., Pillow Talk had such interesting and actually non-existing but believable people), and the formula is pretty straightforward: Impossible love becomes possible after a series of strange events. Yet, the relationship between the people in the film and the lines they are delivering (Hugh Grant's ""Surreal but nice"" was a gem, so was the story about honey-soaked apricots and every word off of the mouth of Spike the subtenant) are wonderfully planned. The texture of the story is really wonderfully woven and fits together enormously well. You believe the story the screenwriter tells you, because it is easy to believe that such a story might actually have taken place. Secondly, the acting is brilliant. Hugh Grant is really believable as the half-witted holiday-bookshop owner and Julia Roberts shines in this performance (well, she sort of plays her real self, the international superstar, does she not?), yet the supporting cast, most from favourite TV series of Britain (from ""Thin Blue Line"" to ""the Vicar of Dibley"") are excellent. At the end, because of these two reasons, a film which tells you a run-of-the-mill fairytale becomes a real gem of a story to watch. It is easy and fun to watch, it is believable, and it is really funny nearly all the time. ""Notting Hill"" is a must see and I really mean it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Opportunistic and harmless little film,"""Notting Hill"" is destined to be the hype of the year in Britain and, as usually, what you get is a lot less than all the hype made you expect. The attempt to cash in on ""Four Weddings.."" is really obvious, but at least the latter had some rhythm. In ""Notting Hill"", the storyline is just an excuse for yet another artificial joke. Another problem is that the image the fime wants to portray is so clean, that it ends up having no relation to the actual neighbourhood it tries to portray. A total waste of money, which should be compensated by all unwarned movie-goers.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
new levels of sappiness,"Well. I'll give Julia and Hugh credit for their acting,but this movie was a nosedive to me. I kept waiting for this storyline to go somewhere but it never really picked up. Julia comes,he's happy, Julia leaves, he mopes, she comes again, he's happy and on and on.The occasional witty remarks couldn't save this loser.Light titters at best, unless the roommate was on. Now HE got the laughs. This flick could have ended much earlier and missed nothing.

Indefinitely,"I would imagine it's many people's dream to meet a movie star and fall in love over the course of one day & Notting Hill plays this very premise out with major success. Over 20 years old and just as charming as I assume this movie was praised for all those years ago. Julia Roberts effortlessly plays movie star Anna Scott (who may or may not be just a representation of who she truly is in real life) and Hugh Grant plays Will Thacker, just a bookshop owner who happens to meet Anna on a fateful day in Notting Hill. Just as I always say with Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts is one of those once in a lifetime movie stars, and someone who's always giving 100% effort even when it isn't needed. I think the ""they don't make movies like this anymore"" is overdone, but it's undeniably true here.9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Smart and Entertaining, Stylish Romantic Comedy","11 January 2010. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant have a chemistry on screen that is layered with a smart script and for the most part underplayed plot outline (except for the rushing car scene in the movie). There are numerous tender moments that have a timelessness element, allowing the audience to immerse itself in the emotions and feelings while at the same time the script captures the dry humor Hugh Grant very well. Julia Robert's character gets to play a role within a role with authentic overtones without exploiting the whole tabloid scene. This romantic comedy focuses more on the common, inner truth of super stardom and avoids the more simplistic approach to slapstick and overly dramatic comedic acting. The ending of this movie is a soft-landing approach that is atypical for most movies of this genre but offers more of a richer heart-felt honesty in its delivery that seems to permeate most of this movie. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Robert's, the shining American star looks so damn ridiculous in front of unknown English actors who make up in pizzaz what they lack in beauty.

At the part where they were celebrating his little sister's birthday at Max's and Bella's home, it was said his nick name was Floppy.

Feel Good Inc.,"I rate it as one of my all-time favourite romantic comedic movies. Hugh Grant & Julia Roberts are absolutely fantastic in their performances. Grant pulls off his character with just the right dash of conservatism, hopefulness, warmth and yes, even practicality, making his character very relatable and not at all unrealistic. Even though a female, throughout the film I kept putting myself in his shoes and imagining what it must be like to be him in those awkward situations.However at the same time, I kept putting myself in Roberts' character Anna and each time she laughed I laughed and each time she cried and felt hurt and lonely I felt hurt and lonely...At Honey's b'day dinner party, Scott has a go at winning the last brownie and surprisingly - I think even for her - she sees into the very deepest recesses of her own mind and sees what is most sorry about her life. She highlights the downside of being a famous actress who is at the peak of her career. Even the ugly head of eating disorders is lightly touched on when she innocently comments how she has been on a diet for the past decade.They each one defeats their personal obstacles they have themselves created about going ahead with a relationship with the other essentially ""live happily ever after""...Cliché, but we all need to have movies like these that are essentially Feel Good Inc., which give all of us simpletons a faint hope about our own lives....",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

You the viewer feel as if you're there, lounging around London, hanging out in a quaint bookshop and flat, unexpectedly hitting it off with a movie star.

Dull and unfunny,"First (or second) impression is that Notting Hill doesn't bear more than one viewing. I originally gave this light comedy 3.5/5, but on seeing it a second time could only give it a 2.5  and I think even that might be a little generous. There's too much about this film now that irritates: the slow pace at which the story unfolds, Hugh Grant's trademark hesitant quirkiness, Julia Roberts' cloying ""I'm just a girl"" line, etc. And behind it all is the unshakable suspicion that Richard Curtis is running on autopilot, simply rehashing the same themes that worked so well for him with Four Weddings but which come across as so contrived here as to be nearly cynical. For example, choosing to have one character confined to a wheelchair seems either unashamedly manipulative or simply included to add a little something to the ""biggest loser"" speech in the dinner party scene  which doesn't really work anyway.Grant is almost a parody of the old image he has since gone to some lengths to shed: a dithering, stuttering, self-conscious throwback to the Ian Carmichael school of acting. Perhaps attempting to broaden the film's appeal beyond that of the middle-class, Curtis attempts an injection of crude humour in the form of Thacker's witless lodger, Spike. Spike is a working-class lout with dirty feet and a poor taste in tee-shirts, and so is exactly the type that someone like Thacker would run a mile from. But then, this is a film which seems to specialise in unlikely relationships: perhaps, being a heterosexual male, I'm not really in a position to venture an opinion but, to me, it's impossible to see what a Hollywood mega-star like Scott would see in a knob like Thacker. But then I suppose that's the idea  Curtis is simply exploiting that juvenile fantasy that lives, to some degree, within all of us. Perhaps that is why so many people buy into what is essentially a half-baked comedy with improbable situations, characters who have little history beyond the boundaries of the story, and very few laughs.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the better romantic comedies.,"Of course, most romantic comedies are the same in story and flow. Boy meets girl, Boy loves girl, Boy loses girl, Boy gets girl back again. That's pretty much how it usually goes. NOTTING HILL adds a little spice to the usual and has a little more flavor than the typical romance movie.Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, Rhys Ifans, Tim McInnery, Gina McKee, and Emily Mortimer are all pretty decent here. The film is certainly nothing special, but it is quite entertaining and has some genuine laughs in it for once, as some of them are pretty crude and will most likely strike the fancy of any crude humor fan.Of course, everyone has different tastes, but NOTTING HILL is one of the more entertaining romantic comedies of the last several years. NOTTING HILL: 4/5.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Definitely worth the admission,"I expected to see another mediocre romantic comedy like You've Got Mail, but I was surprised that enough was different here to make it interesting. The London neighborhood and the characters entertained (although hearing the starring flat originally went for $500K was a bit much.). Especially entertaining was Rhys Ifans as the flatmate ""Spike"". I had to resist feeling insulted at such a portrayal of a Welshman in order to admire the performance though. He was very good, even down to the recent cultural shift among some Celts to revert to the pre-British spellings of their names; that I applaud.The sets and locations lent an air of realism, too; lots of small details. The Camera work took great advantage of these and gave us a visually rich film without it being ""in-your-face"" - it caressed.The remaining performances surprised too. This was the best I had Seen Hugh Grant. He was perfect in the role. Just enough modest loveability for the ladies in the party. Then there was Julia Roberts. I do not know when I have enjoyed her more in a film. It wasn't the part, the script or her character. She just seemed ""on"" for this in a very engaging way. It was a delight to drink in the different looks and degrees of costume. She looked very fetching in the scenes where it appeared as though she were sans makeup; just basic glowing beauty.The only negative aspect of the film for me was the multiple breakups. I would have preferred seeing a slow maturation of their relationship. Still, that wasn't enough to spoil the overall effect. It was refreshing and entertaining to feel good at the end of a movie after some recent things I've seen. Oh, there's room for all those dastardly realistic, rend-your-heart-to-shreds kind of things, but sometimes I just want to go to a movie to feel good. Most telling was at the end of the film, the audience spontaneously applauded; a real rarity. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. So much so I hated to see it end. Bravo.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightful,"The best Julia Roberts film? OK, so I've only seen two others. Here, her character is a famous film star, so it shouldn't be too hard to do? But the acting is superb throughout, and the writing is clever and funny. The support cast are great. Easily a ten.Anna (Roberts) is in London and goes to a street market, there, she gets clumsily bumped into by William (Grant) and he offers to try and clean the orange juice from her T-shirt. And friendship proceeds of course.There is an outstanding performance by Gina McKee as the wheelchair bound wife of Williams friend and other great acting by the publicist and others. But... Rhys Ifans plays Spike, the flatmate of William. Ifans is a great actor, but here, his character is primo-jerk and this reflects badly on Ifans? I don't know why the writers have made him so unlikeable.Something really different and really good is the mini-essay on the subject of why western males are so infatuated by women's breasts. Of course there are plenty of movies that flash a bit of flesh, but nobody ever discusses the matter in a serious way? Here, they do, briefly, and very cleverly. Well done!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect Date movie does this an injustice,Whilst this is a perfect date movie it's also a gem of a romantic comedy.

This ain't how it is in the real world!,"If you can accept the movie's being a totally unrealistic fantasy, I suppose it was done well. Hugh Grant is a prepossessing actor, and setting him up opposite Julia Roberts made for an interesting contrast.  There were also a lot of genuinely funny lines, and I particularly like Spike, the boorish Welsh roommate.But the completely unrealistic portrayal of the subject matter rubbed me the wrong way. Okay, you may say this was meant to be escapist, so that I shouldn't judge it for its lack of interest in realism.  Maybe if I could believe its makers never meant it to be seen as anything but an unrealistic, escapist fantasy, I could agree with that.  But this movie seems to be trying to pass itself off as reality. At best, that's an insult to my intelligence -- to expect me to believe the events in this movie could really happen.  At worst, it's a deliberate attempt to fool the viewer into thinking that this is what life is supposed to be like -- which is a sure-fire formula for breeding discontent and bitterness.",,Anonymous,Romance

More middle-class tossers with implausible speech patterns from Dick Curtis,"Having been underwhelmed by Four Weddings and nauseated by Love, Actually, what was I doing submitting myself to around two hours of Notting Hell? You might well ask.Richard Curtis is a New Zealand-born writer who seems to have a love affair with the duller end of the British bourgeoisie. Except that they have the ""endearingly eccentric"" habit of swearing in linguistic constructions unknown to anyone in this country (I was born and bred in London, and I don't recognise any of these people).It's a bit squirm-making to think people outside the UK might imagine this is what we're like and, goodness knows, Curtis's feeble-minded films are commercially successful enough domestically, so I can only take comfort from the thought that most intelligent moviegoers will have noticed that all of his subsidiary characters are essentially the same, whatever the film, and serve only as baffle-boards for the main characters' lame one-liners, while they also oil the lurching from each dull conflict to the next insipid resolution.Anyway, you can read the other reviews to get an idea of the plot  and there's a f**cking awesome twist (only kidding). I just hope Julia Roberts got a good cut of the (depressingly inevitable) profits  she acts very well in a film that's otherwise rather like an extended, self-satisfied British sit-com.But I will stop to waste a little more bile on the notorious ""brownie"" scene, in which assorted dullard characters with not one iota of self-awareness between them compete as to who is the more hard-done-by for a morsel of cake, albeit in a ostensibly comedic way  let's just say you don't want to be eating for this.

His only worth to the movie is as a plot device to set up the `Boy loses Girl' `Media on the Doorstep' scene, which could be handled some other way.  With absolutely no redeeming values shown, no one can believe our straight arrow hero would even know of such a person, let alone share his home with him.With Four Weddings and a Funeral, all the minor characters were enjoyable and funny, and with the exception of Spike, so are the characters in Notting Hill.

The Perfect Romantic Comedy,"When it comes to romantic comedies, you just can't seem to go past something with Hugh Grant in it. Notting Hill features Grant at a high point, as his bumbling, but undoubtedly charming self opposite screen goddess Julia Roberts. The first time you watch the film, you will most likely be pre-occupied with how Julia Roberts can look so beautiful in every scene without ever looking over the top made up. Believe me, don't only watch this film once, because the second time you will discover more of its charm and be swept away by the depth of the characters. Hugh Grant is your classic nobody. The most remarkable thing about his life is the fact that he lives in a house with a blue door! His slob of a room mate will make you laugh no matter how many times you see the film, and Roberts is captivating as the beautiful movie star who knows that her looks rather than her acting talent are the key to her privileged life. The film, with its easy going sound track, captures the beauty of London's Notting Hill and actually makes you believe that you would run into these people if you were to take a stroll down its busy main street. Essentially Notting Hill is a modern day fairytale that honestly makes you believe that it is possible for a movie star to walk into your life and fall in love with you.

My Wife made me watch it.,"""Notting Hill"" is the ultimate ""Chick Flick.""  This could have been a really good movie, but it wasn't.What this film lacked was a plot, a script, and good acting.  The basic premise that a movie star can fall in love with an average guy is a real stretch.  I could not believe that superstar Anna Scott would fall in love with an un-rich, un-famous man, not even a handsome Englishman with that British accent and manners that Americans love.  Even if you could buy that premise, it still didn't work.  As Don Adams used to say on ""Get Smart"" -- ""Missed it by thaaaat much!""  They almost had a story line -- ""the poor little rich girl,"" i.e. that Anna Scott is famous, but fame possesses her. They almost made the point that everything in Anna's life is controlled almost down to the minute.  She has no freedom, thanks to the demands of movie making, and no private life, thanks to the tabloids.  She can't even eat a decent meal, thanks to Hollywood's obsession with thin.I'm not a particular fan of Julia Roberts, but I have seen ""Steel Magnolias,"" an excellent movie in which she proved that she can act.  And people tell me ""Erin Brockovich"" is a good movie.  However, both she and Hugh Grant slept through ""Notting Hill.""  It was really a ""star vehicle"" for Julia Roberts.  The movie was way too long, with endless close-ups of her. It was as ""heroine-worshipping"" as a Barbara Streisand star vehicle.The ""characters"" in this movie add a welcome comic relief to a dull story, especially Spike, Will's Welsh roommate.  Along with Will's family, Spike is a scream. I hope we see Rhys Ifans in more films.My wife rented this movie, and at least she liked it.  One out of two ain't bad.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A boring and used concept.,"I found this movie to be dry and predictable.  You can always tell exactly what Julia Roberts's character is going to do.

For example, how inevitable was it when: Roberts (Anna Scott) decided to stay with the bumbling Thacker (Grant) ""indefinately""?  Or when Grant had to wear those hideous goggles to the cinema, only for the audience to discover that Spike had them?  God. 	And how pointless can a movie be?  We all know how it's going to end from the middle if not beginning. 	My conclusion is, only very sad people over 30 with an even sadder love life would waste their time to see this.  And my advice to them is, get a cat or a life.Emily SRVHS",,Anonymous,Romance
Creating the Green World,"Romantic comedy is, at its essence, the creation of a new couple, and literally, a new community a new society, out of refugees from dysfunctional social orders. Very commonly, it is a narrative of different social orders, of high culture and low culture, rich and poor, this culture and that culture. It is the creation of a dream world of possiblilities created in opposition to a real world of limitations and cruel, casual savagery. To make a good romantic comedy, you need to show realistic worlds of experience. You need to treat them realistically, with all of their depth and pain and logic. And you need your actors and authoring principals to commit to the Green World of possibility with all of their sincere hopes and dreams, and personal experience, coupled with their professional abilities
If you can obtain all of that-which is a rare attainment in an era of irony and unearned cynicism-then a film such as this may result. The screenwriter, Richard Curtis is a little dismissive of his own efforts, and commonly people who like Curtis's films like Four WedDings and a Funeral, and dismiss Notting Hill as a simpler, more derivative film. But the focus on the romantic leads is fuller in Notting Hill, and in a comedy in which the hidden world of interior journeys is essential, I think this helps. The film is easily Julia Roberts' best. The range of vulnerability and longing her Anna Scott projects, followed by cynicism and brittleness in the next moment, amusement, pain, callousness, fear, a range of complexity from moment to moment as her character progresses through the narrative, is as fine a work as any actress in comedy ever has achieved, in my opinion. Why she did not receive more professional acclaim for this role is a mystery to me, unless it were that she seemed to be playing herself. Hugh Grant's William Thacker is more the sounding board for Roberts' Anna, though his wistful, neurotic passiveness, mixed with a depth of reticent knowledge and unexpressed feeling is precisely the alternative to the narcissistic aggressiveness and expressiveness of Anna Scott's peers. Together, they balance in a centered life is shared experience that, in the film's world, neither can find separately in their own social world. 
There are other great romantic comedies. There are other touching dramas, and films and television worth watching. But there are few great romantic comedies that sincerely present feelings, and that suggest that love means sharing the self one can never become without a partner. This is one of those few.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Those two steal the show but the support actors really make this film - Spike is wonderful and hilarious and Honey really adds something to proceedings as well.Richard Curtis has done a fine job with the script; the first forty minutes is particularly special and I find myself chuckling the whole way through the start, even on the 12th viewing!

"""Whoopsidaisies""","I'd qualify this as awkward.From strange characters being supposedly charming and quirky on screen, to a romance that seems one-sidedly pushy and underdeveloped throughout, failing to evoke in me any sort of emotional response.Julia Roberts playing an actress and deliberately delivering very weighty lines in the way she does.. it makes it all feel like a layer of deceit that doesn't mesh with the execution and you wait for the truth to ""come out"". So, her character seems rash and maybe even desperate, or due to reasons that are never explored or explained. And while she is making the effort to meet Grant's character half-way, while also being quite encouraging, she still feels real and very charming (the sort of character you'd love to see in something better). All of this considering the male lead seems completely unbalanced when compared. The fact that I failed to see what he offers and what she saw in him probably ruined it for me. The word ""undeserved"" comes to mind!What a strange romantic story..
I did quite like a scene where passage of time takes place (market), but the rest of the film is just serviceable. The ""comedy"" part and most of the dialogue and situations aren't memorable. Can't say I particularly enjoyed it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

She hits all the right notes without overdoing it, keeping the feel of the movie light. Grant delivers perfect British witticisms and one-liners, and is highly lovable.

One amusing quip in two hours,"It is not enough to populate a film with beautiful and talented actors; a good script is wanted above all. ""Notting Hill"" fails the script test.I had tried once before to watch this movie, but had abandoned the attempt early on, when it became apparent that the female lead possessed neither cleverness nor goodness, nor indeed any virtue to speak of. I could see no basis for the hero's infatuation with a woman who did nothing but occupy space on the screen. But I forced myself to persevere in a second viewing for two reasons: 1) I'd recently heard an amusing quote (concerning actor Mel Gibson) from a later scene, so figured I might have given up on it before the good part started; and 2) I had not been much impressed with another Richard Curtis screenplay--""Bridget Jones's Diary""--on the first viewing, but had completely reversed my estimate after seeing it a second time--so perhaps ""Notting Hill"" was another such one.Alas, the Mel Gibson crack was the only funny line in the entire flick. And aside from pretty faces and physiques, was there anything to be found in the protagonists to justify their interest in each other? The Julia Roberts character displayed nothing but beauty, stardom, and wealth, and appeared to exist in a gently-smiling vacuous state most of the time; in the one scene where she came alive, it was only to display an ungracious temper--quite a nasty piece of business really. The Hugh Grant character was marginally more sympathetic, but basically insipid.The plot movement was slow and unconnected, with little sense of development.Hugh Grant is of course past master at portraying the awkwardly shy Brit twit--give him credit there--but the writing was so shallow that no mere actor could have rescued it.Don't bother with this one unless you're an MTV fan, i.e., you just like to pass time in front of a screen.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Insufferable crap, fodder for the lame and foolish...","Notting Hill is easily one of the weakest, most pitiful excuses for a ""comedy"" I have ever seen.  Nothing subtle or inspired or funny about it; only schmaltz for the gullible who are led down the merry path by these cynical moviemakers.  Two actors with no chemistry and extremely limited ability attempt to wring comedy from kneeslappers like ""I bet he's got a d**k the size of a peanut"".  The question one keeps asking while watching this wretched mess is ""why does anyone care what happens to this silly unappealing movie star (Roberts) and this bland drip who is smitten with her (Grant)?"".  Roberts is so stunted when it comes to range that she doesn't even play a convincing movie superstar in a fictitious rendering of her own status.  The movie is loaded with current and recent movie references so the dimwits in the audience can feel knowing and wise while fantasizing about the trials and tribulations of fame in this day and age, which the starry-eyed in the audience are permitted to empathize, courtesy of a pandering, National Enquirer-mentality soft soap.  In essence this movie asks the drips in the audience to either identify with how hard they would have it if they were the movie star they wanted to be (like Roberts)...while trying to give them hope that even they can hook up with a movie star, despite being a poor nobody (like Grant).  It's all trussed up in a British veneer to let everybody feel they're witnessing something quirky and charming.

Hugh Grant + Julia Roberts = Winning romantic comedy,"NOTTING HILL (1999) ***1/2 Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, Rhys Ifans, Richard McCabe, Emma Chambers, Tim McInnerny, Gina McKee, Hugh Bonneville, James Dreyfus, Alec Baldwin (cameo).  Winning, chemistry perfect odd coupling of glamorous globe renowned American movie star Roberts (typecast?  Not really but a real canny, clever turn on her own persona) and bumbling, charming and flittering nice guy/poor soul English travel bookshoppe owner Grant (affable to a fault) who find themselves star-struck lovers despite all odds.  Warm and fuzzy soft-focus feelings at the core but a sharply witty screenplay by Grant's old buddy Roger Michell (`Four Weddings and A Funeral'), super Brit ensemble  particularly the skanky, hysterical Ifans  as the slovenly flatmate of Grant, and nice light touch direction overall make for a great date movie and in general a nice old-fashioned romantic comedy that hits all the marks.

Enjoyable romantic comedy,"Notting Hill is one of those films that can still make me laugh no matter how many times I see it. The idea of a normal everyday guy falling in love with a famous Hollywood actress is an interesting spin on the romantic comedy, and shows how fame can have its downsides.The characters are interesting and well developed, and while Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are as good as always in the lead roles, the standout star is Rhys Ifans as Spike. He's the kind of flatmate you wouldn't want to have and that's what makes him so endearing.The film is full of hilarious, and quotable, lines, especially from Spike. His scenes are so laugh out funny it hurts! However, the best line is at the end when William and his family are chasing down Anna, and Max exclaims 'James Bond never has to put up with this sort of s**t!'The only part of the film I didn't enjoy was when William does several interviews while posing as a magazine editor; it simply isn't funny and just drags on.

Quintessential Chick Flick,"If you loved ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" you will love this movie.Sure, at times it seems a little unrealistic (i.e. how can someone with such a lousy business afford to stay in business for so long???) but it is a ""true chick flick"" and that is why I loved it.I found the character of ""Anna Scott"" to be a downright bitch at times but face it, all women have that streak in them :-) The room-mate, ""Spike"" was hysterical but it amazed me that ""William"" was able to put up with him for so long as a house-mate...I would have kicked him out after the first day!I agree that the script was written towards a more American audience as there was none of basically confusing vernacular that clouded films such as ""The Full Monty"" (at least I found it hard to understand at first....) But face it, this movie was made for a mostly American and Canadian audience ""first"" then the rest of the world.

Not particularly good remake of Four Weddings,"Part of the problem with this film was that I felt that I had seen it all before. Which, of course, I had in Four Weddings. Slightly pathetic, floppy-haired middle-class Englishman falls for glamorous American who rejects him them gets back together with him and has a group of friends suffering from various disabilities (though being black or Asian was clearly thought too severe a disability to be shown in a PG film).The rest of the problem I had with Notting Hill was that it wasn't very good. Not even as good as Four Weddings, which at least had some funny lines about relationships and marriage in the modern world and had the neat device of dividing the film into: four weddings and a funeral. No neat devices here - though there is a nice tracking shot showing Grant walking through Portobello Road as the seasons pass. Still no sign of any black people though (though last time I went there they made up about 40% of the population).Meanwhile, Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts plays Julia Roberts, some Welsh guy plays Grant's Welsh flatmate who is only funny if you think that one-dimensional caricatures who are unfeasibly idiotic are deeply witty.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

"With a lean script, perfect casting, solid direction and an abundance of charm and charisma, Notting Hill offers delicious moments of escapism","Notting Hill shows us an actress who is always surrounded by journalists and photographers interested in her personal life, someone part of the celebrity system who needs to feed the tabloids and the thirst of her fans. Owner of high fees, Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) travels to London, with a view to promoting her latest film, a work of science fiction. One day, she enters a bookstore in London's Notting Hill neighborhood. Received by the withdrawn William (Hugh Grant), a man who lives the hardships of the recent divorce. Soon, an attraction will be established between the two, in an interesting game of exchanges: she will need to enter the simplicity of William's world, a character that also needs adaptation to circulate in the meandering media of Anna Scott's celebrities.Fame does not seem to bring happiness to Scott, because even in the face of exorbitant wages, the actress does not show to be satisfied with her personal life. What attracts her to William, by the way, is the fact that he recognized her at the bookstore during the first meeting, but treated her normally, without the flattery common to the world of the famous. Thus, following the dynamic celebrity x anonymity, the film bet on chemistry between Roberts and Grant, one of the elements that made the box office success. Grant and Roberts embrace the film's proposal and show that they are a conquering couple. It is clear from the beginning how the film will end, but this is not a testament to its quality, because what matters is seeing how they both conquer, how they go through situations where they try to spend time together and also through samples of their respective lives. The sequence in which Thacker is mistaken for a journalist in a junket of an actress film yields the best comic moments of the feature, delivered at the right time by Grant, who hits, like few, the expressions of despair and discomfort that the situation calls for. In contrast, the sequence in which the actress is introduced to the protagonist's family provides first-rate comedy, with the varied reactions of its members when meeting a celebrity, while making a small comment about the difficulties and injustices by which women in this medium unfortunately have to pass.Incidentally, this is another good fit of the plot. A celebrity's life is not filled with roses and rainbows. It is full of elements that attack your psychological constantly, with consequences unconnected to the general public. Rita Hayworth once said: ""They go to bed with Gilda, but they wake up with me"", referring to her famous role in the eponymous film to say that she was no longer seen as a person, only as her character. This famous quote is used in the script in a simple and efficient way to humanize its protagonist.
It is not clear where the myth ends and the person of Anna Scott, actress character of the film, played by the real actress Julia Roberts, begins in a game of identities that we notice for the admired way that the camera captures that woman right in the opening sequence which will be the keynote of this romantic comedy, in which the impasse of the relationship of the main couple will then be to find an agreement between social / professional / artistic life and private life, between what is represented and what is. Of course, speaking in this way can misunderstand that Notting Hill is more complicated than its initial concept suggests, but it is not, and its grace is, moreover, in the fact of assuming itself as a genre film without any modesty, although its metalinguistic bias works, above all, so that the romantic journey of those characters, especially Roberts', is more interesting to follow. Yes, because the proposal to unveil the actress behind the spotlight, without script and without ready-made costume, makes the love story of the protagonist couple not only marked by romanticism, but mainly by discovery. Naturally, this demystification of Anna Scott throughout the film will yield those moments of greater humor, as she, in order to live the relationship with her partner (Hugh Grant), understands that she needs to adapt to ordinary and average life, and for that you need to dodge the flashes and the microphones, and our interest in this change would not be the same if Julia Roberts did not incarnate this role, lending Anna the actress a little incomprehensible star charm and Anna woman with a charisma and delicacy baffling.The supporting cast plays a key role in the plot. From Will's friends and family to Anna's business people and agents, and even Alec Baldwin's brief participation as the rude boyfriend, everyone acts in perfect harmony to strengthen the couple's romance between their comings and goings. It would be a sin to criticize Notting Hill without mentioning the famous passage of time during a sequential plan in which Will is walking through the streets of his neighborhood. As we follow the protagonist's depressed gait, time passes slowly and we discover this through the changing seasons and interactions of the extras.The screenplay is by Richard Curtis, responsible for ""Love Actually"" and who also collaborated with Grant on ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". It is clear that the actor fits perfectly in the tone of the writer's works, full of charm and charm. It is a film with a standard structure, with all conflicts and climax in the right places, interspersing the story of the protagonists with other groups. The difference is that all the characters are treated with respect and there is an interesting contrast between them: a nucleus is ""too realistic"", with a complicated drama; the other accompanies ""exotic"" people, bordering on slapstick comedy.Romantic comedy films are changing. They needed to change, adapt to our time, how and where relationships start, how they happen and, well, how they end as well. But Notting Hill is timeless for betting on an absurd, almost impossible premise. With intelligent dialogue and development and the best possible cast at the right time. It is impossible not to delight in the tone of the work, which leaves that feeling of well-being in the spirit during the entire exhibition time. Roger Michell's direction may not be innovative, but it is efficient and maintains full control of the pace. Curtis chose Notting Hill as he lived there and knew the area, saying, ""Notting Hill is a melting pot and the perfect place to set a movie."" This left producers to film in a densely populated area. The difficulties in filming in the neighborhood itself were immense, due to the large number of people who pass there daily. However, the decision to face the challenge proved to be right, resulting in a vivid, real, palpable and full of personality Notting Hill, fitting well with the proposal to illustrate the London of the film as an attractive place with a certain magic in the air.
The original song was composed by Trevor Jones. A main score was written and excerpts were used throughout the film. The score was divided into two songs for the soundtrack (Will and Anna / Notting Hill). Several additional songs written by other artists include Elvis Costello's cover version of Charles Aznavour's ""She"", the remixed version of Shania Twain's ""You've Got A Way"", as well as Ronan Keating's specially recorded cover, "" When You Say Nothing at All ""; the song reached number one on the British charts. Pulp recorded a new song ""Born to Cry"", which was released on the European version of the soundtrack album. The song played when Will goes down Portobello Road is Bill Withers' ""Ain't No Sunshine"". Tony and Bernie play ""Blue Moon"" on the piano at Tony's restaurant the night it closes. Originally, Charles Aznavour's version of ""She"" was used in the film, but American audiences of test screenings did not respond to it. Costello was brought in by Richard Curtis to record a cover version of the song. Both versions of the song appear in non-American versions.Notting Hill won the most popular film audience award at the BAFTA in 2000 and received three Golden Globe nominations in the categories for best comedy or musical film, best comedy or musical actor for Hugh Grant and best comedy actress or musical for Julia Roberts. Balanced and passionate, Notting Hill is yet another romantic comedy in the dramatic trajectories of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts and screenwriter Richard Curtis. Under the medium direction of Roger Mitchell, the film does not bring anything new, but as already mentioned in other reflections of the genre, it capitalizes well on ideas already worked on. Compared to the also attractive Four Weddings and One Funeral, the viewer will notice that there are quite similar scenes, something that borders on self-plagiarism, as Curtis also scripted the successful romantic comedy in 1994. With a lean script, perfect casting, solid direction and an abundance of charm and charisma. It is one of the most delicious romantic comedies that exist, offering delicious moments of escapism.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A very pleasant surprise...,"I was ambivalent about seeing this movie.  I went because my wife wanted to go.  I was very pleasantly surprised by its charm and humour, and left the theatre smiling.  Hugh Grant was his usual endearing ""everyman"" character -- stumbling and self-conscious, and Julia Roberts broke my heart with her ""I'm just a girl..."" bit near the end.  I've never been a Julia fan, but Stepmom and Notting Hill have pretty much won me over.  Yes, the plotline and cast of characters bear a strong resemblance to Four Weddings and a Funeral, but as far as I'm concerned, that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Both are wonderful, lighthearted feel-good tales that are well worth the price of admission or rental.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a drag it is to be famous....,"How can a director and a screenwriter take two actors of such charm (Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant) and produce such a lugubrious work?  Garry Marshall made a story about a prostitute lighthearted and romantic, but these guys take an actually good premise and turn it into a two-hour mope-fest.  I was uncomfortable feasting my eyes on the glorious Julia and Hugh when the message of the movie was that fame and public adoration are poisonous and ruinous to their objects.  I left the theater feeling like a stalker.  Too bad -- let's hope that Julia's re-teaming with Richard Gere in ""Runaway Bride"" goes down better.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
lesson,"a lesson of embroidery. because it is more than a romantic comedy. and less than a gallery than good acting. it is precise, ironic, using English humor, analysis of every day reality. the fame, the social problems, ""the adultescence"", the importance of books and the media. the feelings and the public image. sure, the meeting between the director, Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant is the premise of success. but the most important ingredient is the total honesty to describe a chaotic universe, with its rules and accidents and crazy sides. that transforms Notting Hill in precious lesson about a genre potential and about the art to use each detail for an extravagant and so realistic story about an impossible love story.",,Anonymous,Romance
Notting Hill,"For my tenth review I decided to choose one of my favorite films... Notting Hill... How wonderful it is!How I wish the story shown in this film was based on real events... So that always and everywhere in this world there was an opportunity to love and be loved, regardless of belonging to a particular social status.This is an absolutely wonderful melodrama, with a well-thought-out plot, beautiful scenes, amazing music that conveys the atmosphere of this film very well. Notting Hill is a work of art, a very atmospheric film. Directing, camera work, acting at the highest level!Honestly, a rating of 7.2 is an extremely low rating for this masterpiece...

A humble, if not quirky, bookseller falling in love with a high profile beautiful actress.

Hugh Grant's eyes just speak every romantic line itself.,"Roberts was a well-loved sweetheart by everyone, and Grant was a sweet English Gentleman just much as the sky is blue and grass is green. Two actors delivered what the director and the writer asked for 100%. Richard Curtis was Richard Curtis again in 'Notting Hill'. Lines are very realistic like the ones you can hear from the conversation of a couple sitting next to coffee shop or something with a humor added on the side. Even though the setting of a world-famous actress falling in love with a stranger from a bookstore in a foreign country is surreal, exchange of lines brings the story down to Earth. Moreover, you have to admit lines are adorable and romantic as heck. 'I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her' is the best romantic film quote and so applicable in real life not just in drama. William telling Anna ""You are lovelier this morning than you have ever been"" after first night just makes many girls' heart melt.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

However, the girl's girl Julia is stunning in this film due to the producers' and artists' attention to detail. She (Julia) is in so many frames without makeup and plainly Julia. That is something I dig about this film I have seen so many times. She is simple and complete. The kind of girl that a simple guy that owns a travel book shop on the outskirts of London would love to hold in his arms--and did--so she was ""just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her"". When she stood looking at him without makeup, it made it complete. That is the award winning part, to me, of this movie.

8 on a scale of 10,"This was a pleasant movie to watch. I enjoyed it from start to finish. I'm glad I went. I rate it an 8.However...... I was a little disappointed.

It's just that I didn't feel like the movie took control of me the way some romantic comedies do.Still, I can't specifically think of any criticism of it that is worth mentioning.

The only thing that kept me in the seat, instead of demanding my money back was Mr. Ifans (and even his part wore a little thin toward the end)  Not only was the film poorly written, there was not a shred of character development On the technical front, some of the editing actually made me wince.

"Fairy tales - do they come true? Well, rarely in real life.","It's the story that the whole world (well, the 99.99% of us who aren't famous) dream about. ""Normal"" people spend their lives reading about the lives of the famous, on posters, in magazines, knowing more about the lovelives of celebrities than their families.Wanting to be famous, wanting to be with someone famous. The self-referential irony is delivered with a deft touch, Hugh Grant playing what he does so well, the diffident, slightly awkward, but immaculately enunciated and perfectly quiffed English upper-middle class gent. Stuttery, self-effacing, but don't Americans just love that.And that's the key here. Four Weddings, part II. England for an American market, neatly packaged. It couldn't be anywhere, it had to be England. It couldn't be anyone, it had to be Hugh. (Again.)That's not to say it's not a very well produced movie. It is. A great ensemble of British comic actors. Plenty of well known London landmarks for the locals to point at and empathise with. And a tight script that carries you through the two hours rather than dragging. Two hours is brave in this day an age, but why rush?Julia Roberts continues to be a revelation. She isn't just a pretty face. She plays the part to its fullest - I did want to be William Thacker. I want to go buy a bookshop and have her visit.Isn't that what movies are about?

Pretty unimpressed,"Did not look forward to this film and was not disappointed. Not a patch on 4 Weddings.  Really difficult to find much to laugh about. Grant's habit of saying ""Right"" about 500 times was infuriating. Nobody, including the Welshman, had any good lines. Again lack of colour in the street scenes by leaving out the West Indian contingent was an error. Roberts did look younger and prettier but perhaps she benefited from lack of make up?

Definitely worth the admission,"Originally written 14 June 1999; account moved.I expected to see another mediocre romantic comedy like You've Got Mail, but I was surprised that enough was different here to make it interesting. The London neighborhood and the characters entertained (although hearing the starring flat originally went for $500K was a bit much.). Especially entertaining was Rhys Ifans as the flatmate ""Spike"". I had to resist feeling insulted at such a portrayal of a Welshman in order to admire the performance though. He was very good, even down to the recent cultural shift among some Celts to revert to the pre-British spellings of their names; that I applaud.The sets and locations lent an air of realism, too; lots of small details. The Camera work took great advantage of these and gave us a visually rich film without it being ""in-your-face"" - it caressed.The remaining performances surprised too. This was the best I had Seen Hugh Grant. He was perfect in the role. Just enough modest loveability for the ladies in the party. Then there was Julia Roberts. I do not know when I have enjoyed her more in a film. It wasn't the part, the script or her character. She just seemed ""on"" for this in a very engaging way. It was a delight to drink in the different looks and degrees of costume. She looked very fetching in the scenes where it appeared as though she were sans makeup; just basic glowing beauty.The only negative aspect of the film for me was the multiple breakups. I would have preferred seeing a slow maturation of their relationship. Still, that wasn't enough to spoil the overall effect. It was refreshing and entertaining to feel good at the end of a movie after some recent things I've seen. Oh, there's room for all those dastardly realistic, rend-your-heart-to-shreds kind of things, but sometimes I just want to go to a movie to feel good. Most telling was at the end of the film, the audience spontaneously applauded; a real rarity. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. So much so I hated to see it end. Bravo.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I don't know what Roberts is going to do now that she's getting too over-the-hill to play the ""All-American Ingenue"" character she's beaten into the ground like a dead horse (no pun intended). She has no range or depth to advance into more meaty, mature characters. Early retirement for motherhood would be a welcomed relief for many.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Startingly original, nicely familiar Romantic Comedy.","Unlike soft-focus confections like ""You've Got Mail"" (which was more about the love between a consumer and large corporations than Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan), Notting Hill has a bit of an edge to it which serves the movie well. Grant and Roberts get to zing each other with all sorts of wonderfully hilarious dialog before the inevitable happens, and the cast of supporting characters (including a wheelchair-bound first love and a sad-sack stockbroker) keep the movie grounded and the sap quotient to a minimum. Perhaps the most astonishing thing, however, is the camerawork.  The director takes some chances -- jump cuts, one exceptional scene in which four seasons swirl around Grant's character as he walks down a London street -- that pay off big time.  This is a movie that was basically presold. Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are huge box-office draws, and the words 'romantic comedy' and Julia Roberts together are pure gold.  It is refreshing, therefore, to find a well-written script, great performances from all involved, and some creative risk-taking.All in all, an excellent romantic comedy, a great date movie, and if you're single like me, another great excuse to stare at the bottle of sleeping pills and wonder how many it would take.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Absolutely Brilliant,"When this film came out at my cinema last summer I didn't go to see it because i had it in my mind that this was just gonna be another one of those boring romances. However when i got it on video and watched it for the first time i thought it was on of the best films i had ever seen. It is one of the only films i have seen that has brought me close to tears. The acting from Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant was excellent and there were times when this film really made me laugh out loud. The actor in it had to be Williams (Hugh Grants) lodger Spike. He was absolutely brilliant and really had me laughing. I just loved the way he talked the truth. Near the end when William tells his friends he has turned down Anna Scott they all agree with him but inside they want to tell him he is wrong. Then Spike walks in and his first reaction is 'You stupid prick'. I thought this was a classic. Julia looked beautiful as ever and if there is one thing that i walk away from and remember about this film is the line she says in Williams bookstore. It goes 'The fame thing isn't real you know. And don't forget, i'm still just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her'. This line will stick in my mind forever as i think it is so moving. It reminds us no matter how famous these actors and actresses are they are still just ordinary people at heart. I loved this film so much i didn't stop watching it for 2 weeks.

Too much Hollywood,"It squints for ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"", but in fact it is a ""Pretty Woman""-flick with swapped roles. The story (beautiful actress falls in love with a clumsy but smart english bookseller) is merely unbelievable - e.g. in the scene where Julia kisses Hugh right out of the blue. This does not necessarily disqualify the movie, if it's made well. But only in a few scenes it reaches the quality of humor that ""Four Weddings"" had. And were Hugh's friends all of the ""weird english""? Speaking of Hugh Grant brings me to the weakest part of the movie: himself. While Julia Roberts at least does her best to look nice, Hugh is a wooden carbon-copy of his greatest roles. Thank god the supporting cast is very good, but, as I said, it gets not enough space to show it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cynical slush,"Why? Because this was sheer stale US packaging and nothing else. Not only the ending was predictable (which is allowed in a romance) but every twist and turn. Yawningly too long. Lots of plain 'gags' that were the product of neither character nor plot (man who tries to buy novels, interviews with her co-stars in the hotel). Trite humour (grungy, eclectic flatmate; big feet/shoes). No insight, no questions, no credibility (why did she kiss him?) Huge plot holes - where did the fantastic Mr Ifans go during most of her stay? Why did he take the call from his mother? And yet another group of charming chums who are all SO supportive with not a twang of angst in sight despite disability/redundancy/business failure. By the second hour I was urging Hugh to hurry every one of those oh, so, faltering, foppish syllables. The plot was an obstacle course of devices which served only to titillate (goggles/guinea fowl/her from accounts and so many others).

A formula has been found and it was obviously the intention to follow it to the letter, but don't write the film off on this alone.

Even the one for the snack bar had better acting than this waste of film.  Aside from shamelessly borrowing from ""Roman Holiday"", this film lacks a plot or characters worth caring about.  Ms Roberts' character is not worthy of pity for the situations she finds herself in as she is shallow and self-indulgent--perhaps it wasn't a stretch for her to play this part.

First of all, the cast is great. Julia Roberts is in her best performance, Hugh Grant is very nice and Emma Chambers and Rhys Ifans are VERY funny. The screenplay is good too, and romantic (I love romance). But in fact, I think that the ""problem"" is that Notting Hill is English! Before watching it, I was thinking: ""My God! Another American romantic-comedy with Julia Roberts. I've already watched My Best Friend Wedding and I don't want to watch the same style of story again and again"". But when I discovered that NH is an English movie I started to think about it in a different way. I love English movies! But that's unfair. No, that's not the ""problem"" too.In fact, what I think is that Notting Hill is one fun, relaxing and beauty movie that you watch and stop thinking about your problems. While you're watching it you forget everything and pay attention only in the story. You know, it's very hard to happen in movies nowadays, make the spectator pay attention.

Charming romantic comedy,"A fantastic movie, really. I found out you don't even have to be a fan of Hugh Grant (although I am personally) to really get the charm of this movie. Grant goes through all his usual stutters and silly manners but that's a thing he does very well. But Notting Hill doesn't have to rely on Hugh Grant alone, it's simply got a very witty and intelligent script by Richard Curtis (who later went on to write and direct Love Actually), fantastic British director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral), Julia Roberts at her most charming and best and a bundle of supporting actors who are quite simply excellent.Despite a 2 hour running time the film's never overlong. Full of sentiment to go along with the humor the 2 hours plus go by very fast.Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Notting Hill  -- had they considered a Sequel,"Actually have seen the movie when it first came out -- also have the DVD; enjoyed the movie very much it was so funny .. Did not see it when it was shown on TV. It would be nice to have a sequel based on how Anna and Will are getting on. Actually the photography was lovely. also the tunes. Maybe Ms. Roberts may consider doing the sequel maybe down the road, but at this time is a bit busy with family congrates .. well done.. Maybe they can bring back the original cast Spike was a ""gas"" so funny and so was ""Honey"" they make a cute item. Or maybe a movie on them or Bella and her mate. They were a good match also. It would be lovely to see more of the UK Notting hill, hampstead heath area and surrounding area(s).",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""It's as if I've taken love heroin and now I can't ever have it again.""","Bumbling, charming, funny, cheeky-very Hugh Grant. One of those feel good movies you catch yourself watching every time you find it on TV. Good chemistry between Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant help carry this romance between an American movie star and a shy British bookstore owner. The sub actors are equally important here though especially 'Spike' the flatmate, hilarious, William's sister and his inner circle of friends.Robert's character is shy, stilted but what I also noticed this time is that she hurts William again and again, is just terrible to him and he remains charming...just nice, understanding. She does not deserve him.My favourite scene remains the market montage with the ""aint no sunshine when she's gone"" song and the changing seasons. The final shot is really sweet and beautiful, a couple at peace.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surreal,"Movies are supposed to make you feel good and this one does.  Who cares that the improbability of the story is about 1000% - you walk through that park, walk through the seasons, walk through the family and one just smiles at the enchantment of the whole thing.  You can have Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, the Philadelphia Story ad nauseum - all those realistic movies that people think are so wonderful and make you feel so bad.  Notting Hill puts a smile on your face and that's what movies are supposed to do. Perhaps the most truthful moment in the film is when his mother calls at the most important moment in his life and will not take no for an answer. There was a true situation and a tribute to the millions of self centered mothers in the world.  I really liked this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Glorifying abusive relationships,"This movie is a great example if glorifying an abusive relationship and making it seem like a ""romantic"" thing. Throughout the movie, Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) keeps abusing William Thacker (Hugh Grant) every possible way, treating him like a total dirt, accusing him of things, yelling at him, lying to him, hiding her boyfriend from him, saying things behind his back but this is all glorified because William just takes all this abuse and follows her around like a loyal puppy.The more she abuses him, the more he falls in love. The more he falls in love, the more she abuses him. She has no love or respect for him and sees him like a pet but he doesn't mind because he's in love with this abusive person. He has zero self respect and he doesn't ever stand up for himself.This is not romance. This is plain old abuse.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Modern day Cinderella,"Hugh Grant plays a terrific role, as the centerpiece of a group of underachievers that have absolutely no chance of greatness in their lives. Enter Julia Roberts, who basically plays... herself, A movie star, looking to escape the media at any possible chance. Together they turn subtle, silent moments, into romantic exchanges of fairy tale dreams, as the underachiever knows deep down inside, that the glass slipper does not fit. Ah, but in fairy tales, dreams do come true and the movie star is after all, just a girl that loves a boy. Hugh Grant's simpatico overflows in this lovely, simple, charming love story and Roberts is as beautiful as always, with just enough humility to give the audience enough hope for our Cinderella.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A romantic comedy that really works,"This movie is a kind of scrambled clone of Richard Curtis's other great romantic comedy, Four Weddings and a Funeral.  The nice thing is that for Curtis this is apparently one of his specialties, like Robert B. Parker writing a detective book, rather than something he did because his last comedy-romance fared so well at the box office.  He is not feeding off his last work; he is simply doing a variation on a favorite theme.  Which is to say that while Notting Hill shares many elements with Four Weddings and a Funeral, this in no way diminishes either movie, and both are quite good.In fact, of the two, I think I might prefer this one.  Julia Roberts's star power exceeds Andie MacDowell's, and Roberts is given more time to develop her character, so the romance works better here than in Four Weddings.The one rehash of the Four Weddings format that didn't work on any level was the attempt to find another rock and roll oldie to revamp for the soundtrack and turn into a big hit.  In the attempt to find what would be for Notting Hill what Wet Wet Wet's version of ""Love is All Around"" was for Four Weddings, we are taken through a tiresome and intrusive series of oldies and covers of oldies, the best of which (though that's not saying much) is Elvis Costello's far too faithful cover of ""She.""",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
best romantic comedy in years,"This is the best romantic comedy in years. It is not as funny as ""Four weddings and a funeral"", but it is better anyway. Julia Roberts is better than ever.

Still the scenes with Julia and Hugh are great, so see this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Everyone's romantic fantasy,"Just about any Romantic film that comes out of Hollywood is practically pure fantasy.  Knowing that doesn't deter us from watching films like Casablanca and wishing we could be either Bogart or Bergman, seeing Gone With The Wind for the millionth time and viewing ourselves as Gable or Leigh or sailed on the Titanic as DiCaprio or Winslet.  Who hasn't gone through adolescence and at some point daydreamed about the possibilities of meeting and falling in love with your favorite film star?  It is this fantasy that Notting Hill fulfills for us in a wonderful romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts.As William Thacker, Hugh Grant plays the average everyday sort of guy who owns and operates a travel book store in the Notting Hill section of London. On a day that starts out as any other, famous film star Anna Scott(Roberts) wanders into his book shop.  After Anna has some juice spilled on her, William offers to let her use her flat to clean up.  She seems to be appreciative of William's help, even if he is quite the bungler who hardly knows what to say in her presence.  When she leaves his apartment, William is sure his brief brush with a star has come and gone, but surprisingly Anna calls and invites him to a press junket at her hotel.  From here, the romance begins but it is not going to be an easy path to love.  There are plenty of pitfalls and hurdles on the path to true love in any romance, but they are magnified ten times over in a relationship such as this.Hugh Grant may not be every person's cup of tea but in Notting Hill he truly shines.  He plays William as an ordinary everyday kind of guy, who loves has family no matter how strange and quirky they may be, is willing to put up with his very strange roommate Spike (Rhys Ifans), and though well aware of Anna's stardom is still able to see she is  a person who has emotions just as you or I or he does.  He enables us to believe that he is falling in love with the person and not the name.  As for Julia Roberts, I have no idea how much of her character is based on her own real personality, but it wouldn't be a stretch to say she has included at least some of her own self into her role as Anna.  There are times when she seems truly vulnerable, and at other times she seems unable to let the real person of Anna show for fear of being compromised in some manner.  In one of the film's best moments, at a dinner with Williams family, Anna gives a speech about stardom and how sometimes it's not what it's cracked up to be.  It's a revealing moment, and there is no doubt that she could easily be talking about Julia Roberts and not just Anna Scott.The supporting cast in this film is also remarkable.  Rhys Ifan's Spike is about as dingy a character as one would ever want to meet and simply hilarious.  There is also a touching sub-story beautifully played out about William's friend Max (Tim McInnery)and his wheelchair bound wife Bell(Gina Mckee).  They have several moments together in this film that will easily touch your heart.  As William's sister Honey(Emma Chambers)is almost as quirky as Spike, but shows a bit more emotional depth.  Alec Baldwin makes a brief appearance as Anna's boyfriend, and handles the part of your basic ""too big of a star jerk"" quite well.Director Roger Michell gives us some wonderfully staged scenes in this film and each one is played out with perfection.  When William goes to meet Anna for the first time at her hotel, he is mistaken for a writer and is made to interview the other stars from Anna's film.  Later, when he takes Anna to meet his family and friends, it is a birthday party you won't soon forget.Yes, like all romantic comedies, Notting Hill is a fantasy film, but it shares and fulfills a certain kind of romantic fantasy we have all wished for at some time in our life. A truly wonderful film.My Grade: A",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Four Weddings and a Funeral,"I loved Four Weddings and found that I loved this movie more! Notting Hill and Four Weddings are in effect the same movie with only one or two slight changes. Hugh Grant played Charles in Four Weddings and his brother was deaf and in Notting Hill he plays William and his ex-girlfriend and wife to one of his friends is in a wheelchair. All the other characters are also the same in both films and I have to admit that I prefer Julia Roberts to Andie MacDowell because at least Julia didn't say ""It's raining I hadn't noticed"" in the film!! The moral of the story is that we are all looking for someone who we can feel at peace with and just sit in silence!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rave review,A total delight!  One of the most enjoyable films ever--on a par with Roman Holiday.  Every nuance is just perfect.  I am eager to see it again and again.

Well worth seeing.,"From the start, we were transported to Notting Hill, London, where we embarked on a fairytale reality of life.  Notting Hill, the home of William the bookseller, who was leading the 'quiet' life in his bookshop, when in walks a famous hollywood star.His life is turned upside down.  The story is very unbelievable, but it is great entertainment, and well worth watching.  Julia Roberts plays a famous actress to a tee. Her character cool and calm in the scariest of situations, battling with the fact that she is underneath all of the painted glitz, a normal person, with normal needs.  Grant plays his usual British Bumbling Bloke with great effect in the movie.  For my money, it was the actor who played Spike, in those disgusting underpants that should, at least be awarded a comedy award for his hilarious performance.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I knew I was going to regret it,"I watched it just because I need to improve my English, or my English from the UK because I have a test coming and movies and TV series are mainly from the USA, so that's why I chose this movie, we all deserve a chance and anyway I thought it could be at least a bit entertaining and even though I knew I wasn't going to love it because I don't like these kind of movies I thought: ""Alright, let's do it for the test, this might be less boring than the text books or watching the news""...But no,very boring, I didn't expect it to be that boring, I got very surprised when I realized I spent 2 hours watching that, it was too much and I don't really understand why some liked it, it had nothing new, so predictable...I think it was a waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Know its Good BUT...,"Firstly I have to say that I would have seen this movie anyhow because it has Julia Roberts in it(She is one of the most beautiful people in the world!!) and because it was shot two minutes from my house in London.Having seen it I will admit that it is a good romantic comedy, better than many which have come out in the last few years but I still did not quite understand what all the fuss was about!!I mean the director still uses the same *group of friends* strategy and Hugh Grant still plays the only role he can play, that of a muttering, stuttering romantic. What I think gets this working is the performance by Julia Roberts, the one liners, London itself(the terraced houses with the square gardens), the speed with which the lovers get to meet and progress(unlike the American, Wham-Bam-Thank You Mam style!!). I will see it again just to see the sparkle in Roberts`s eyes and *that* smile!!!Many have complained about the music but I honestly think the song ""When You Say Nothing At All"" was just perfect for *that* moment.One thing this movie does though, like all the great romantic comedies do is make you believe in *Love* in Love at first sight and you come out thinking that there is still hope in this world. Its reaffirms this for the doubters and instills it in the non believers.I have never been a very big fan of romances(unless I had to take my girlfriend out or had tickets to the Premieres!!) but this I actually did enjoy watching.Worth the watch....even if its only for Julia Roberts!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful Fantasythough at times a bit too sentimental,"What characterizes this film is good vibration and easiness in storytelling. Surprisingly fast paced for romantic comedy, with concentration on being humorous, while allowing the lead characters to build up the romance through pure chemistry.  Though it is not a downside, we have both Hugh Grant and Julie Roberts in well known parts, not displaying anything new.  What makes this film special are the extras, mostly British diamonds, similarly cast to add flavor to the story as in `Four Weddings and a Funeral'.  I especially enjoyed Rhys Ifans in the part of Spike, leaving me in stitches every time he was on screen.  If it wouldn't have been for the out of character, over sentimentally, over dramatized line from Julie Roberts close to the end of the movie, I would have considered this film worth 9/10.  However, that line was just too much.  8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Light and Amusing,"The movie is a light and amusing romantic comedy. A thoroughly enjoyable modern fairytale! It transports the viewer into a world where love overcomes. There is little point in looking for deep meanings in the movie - it is simply but effectively, a light hearted acting out of the archetypal situation in which a member of the public falls in love with a celebrity. The lines ""This fame thing isn't real..."" ""I'm just a girl looking at a boy and asking him to love her"", as spoken by Julia Roberts did seem to come from the heart though. I wonder if she really believes this herself ? Mmmmm maybe there's hope for me yet.....!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Bad Dialogue, Bad plot (plot?  what plot?), bad acting - all combined to make this 2 hour movie, seem like 10 hours long.

"Roger Michell, the unsung hero","Let's get past the obvious: the writing is world-class, the casting genial, the sparks between Julia and Hugh could incinerate the movie theatre, and the supporting cast is fantastic.

Just watch the birthday dinner ""brownie"" scene - one of my all-time favourites on screen - and you'll see what I mean.

An excellent blend of romance and comedy,This movie was one of those surprises that puts a great finishing touch on a good day.  I went to see this movie based on the fact that it had Julia Roberts and the previews showed a few funny scenes.  I was hoping that those weren't the only ones (as is the case with too many movies recently) and was not disappointed.

Great Film:,"Notting Hill Plot: William meets Anna. Fall in love. Anna has significant other already- Split up. When problems arise Anna runs to William, draw closer, Argument -Split up. Anna realises she really loves William and attempts to get him back .... William realises he really loves Anna and attempts to get her back ... The conclusion I will leaveAfter reading the reviews, and the comments, I'm wondering if we all saw the same film! Notting hill is a romantic comedy in the Doris Day Genre, in that the plot can only be ridiculous in the far fetched way. But still enables the viewer to suspend reality for a couple of hours to believe in the characters and the story.The cast British cast I found wonderful in their eccentricities, Bringing their own individual views to the situation. Sometimes comic and other sad. Hugh Grant has lost his idiot act (Not quite all though.) Julia Roberts may not be the worlds greatest beauty, (eye of the beholder) but acts the part of the star well. Scratching away at the gloss and hype of the film I found myself  thinking that Richard Curtis the writer has been very cleaver in combining comedy with something to say (Four Weddings did not appear to have a second layer). The best way to get a point across is to make you audience laugh, as the audience I saw NH with did. When I started to think about what  were laughing for, I saw a depth of social commentary. How the public View stardom, and all that entails. How Richard views the press view media personality's.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Charming,"When this movie first came out I wasn't sure if I was interested in seeing it, hence I stayed away from it for quite a while. Having nothing to do last night, I decided to go see it and I have to say that I found this movie to be incredibly charming.The story is about how a major movie star (Roberts) wanders into an obscure little travel book shop in Notting Hill one day and becomes somewhat intrigued by the shop owner (Grant) and vice versa. Through some intelligent writing, the two meet again the same day by chance and the story takes off from there.The relationship does not develop instantly as Roberts' character has to deal with her status as a major celebrity and keeps her guard up but little by little she opens up to Grant. The story continues throughout the movie showing the on again off again relationship and the awkwardness that exists as Grant tries to deal with this situation. The ending is predictable, as it is with most romantic comedies, but the journey that the audience goes through is amazingly more entertaining than the other romantic comedies that I've seen. As with other movies of this genre, it is endearing and humorous, but what separates this movie from the others, is the incredible witt of the writing. The humor is laced throughout very frequently and when you're not laughing, you're truely caught up in the emotions that the characters feel as they try to work out the awkward situation that they feel. The only criticism that I can state is that the ending seems to be wrapped up a little too neatly and hastily but that may more to do with time constraints than anything.Overall, I found this movie to be a pleasant surprise that women will definately like but men will also enjoy very much....8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hugh Grant in familiar surroundings with better results.,"It works for me.  I doubted that this scenario would get me into the movie, but the characters were quickly in place allowing for an enjoyable visit. It works better than Four Weddings because the Julia is much better written than Andie. I've read elsewhere that Hugh Grant reminds people of Cary Grant and I heartily agree with that.  Hugh shows himself to be a victim, commentator and survivor of the situation without falling out of his character. Julia Roberts is a wonderfully complex person complete with flaws that humanize the role. The supporting cast contributed greatly to elevating the whole piece.  They may look a bit familiar, but then its always nice to see old friends. On a personal note, I wish that the opening credits were on top of the screen because the guy in front of me was really big.
