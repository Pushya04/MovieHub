Argo,"An excellent movie, although I did not know the events of the storming of the American embassy in Iran, but the story of the film was very interesting and the level of representation in the film was excellent, the film made me on the edge of the chair of suspense I highly recommend watching it",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Well done Ben,"Honestly, I came into this movie with so-so expectations as the trailer I saw in a different movie made me give myself a 50% chance to watch it, up in the air if you will. But from the moment the movie began up until the end, I was gripping for the characters the whole way, the way movies should be.The opening of the movie played a huge part in setting the tone of the rest of the film. As I had no history or prior knowledge to the events that transpired in Iran in the 1980s, the brief amount of a history lesson was just enough to maintain my interest. Throughout the film, there are times when I might have started to wander through long bouts of dialog, but witty comments by the characters kept me entertained. By the time the climax was about to hit, I was sitting on the edge of my seat, biting at my fingers, awaiting their next move.Well done Ben, well done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Hollywood Hyperbole,"Ben Affleck who originally got acclaim for his collaboration with best bud Matt Damon on Good Will Hunting, went out gloriously alone and came back with a Best Picture Oscar for Argo, the story of one of the greatest hoaxes ever perpetrated in the last century or even in the short time this century has been around. I'm sure Matt Damon would love to have had a piece of this one.Based on writings of CIA operative Tony Mendez who engineered the escape of six American diplomats who were lucky enough to get out of Iran during the Ayatollah Khomeini craziness during the Iran hostage crisis, Affleck who sports a heavy beard that makes him totally unrecognizable as Affleck, but no doubt Mendez had such a growth. Only the voice lets you know from time to time that it is Affleck.Our protagonist has a history of pulling off good intelligence coups and he's given an assignment by his superiors. When they learn that the American diplomats are hiding at the Canadian ambassador's home he has to devise a scheme to get them out. He's one of several people put on this problem. His solution is to appeal to the Iranian's sense of celebrity. Affleck creates the cover story of a movie being shot in Iran, a science fiction spectacular like Star Wars and these folks were there scouting locations in the desert. Hollywood contacts John Goodman and Alan Arkin were most helpful, their sense of Hollywood hyperbole comes in handy. In fact both make several jokes about the movie capital. Arkin got a Best Supporting Actor nomination.Of course we know what happened. I remember the news breaking that the Canadians had gotten these diplomats out who should have been hostages along with the others. The Iranians huffed and puffed and vowed divine retribution on Canada for aiding the Great Satan. It all came to naught however.Argo which is the title of the pretend science fiction epic so far represents the summit of Ben Affleck's career. Why he did not get nominated for Best Actor and Director is quite beyond me if the Academy thought the film that good. Now that the story is declassified we now see that the CIA can occasionally get it right.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Good movie but took a lot of liberties,"This is a great movie. The story, acting, pacing, editing, etc. was just fantastic. Affleck's directing was solid, and the suspense will keep you entertained right through to the last seconds. I loved it.It did have one irritating thing, though, kind of a big one. It pointed most of the accolades to Affleck's character and the CIA. This really was not true. It was Ken Taylor and the Canadians who really pulled 'the Canadian Caper' off so successfully.""When Taylor heard a few years ago that Mendez had sold movie rights to his book (which, to be fair, is much more generous than the movie about Canada's role), ""I said, 'Well, that's going to be interesting.'....""The movie's fun, it's thrilling, it's pertinent, it's timely,"" he said. ""But look, Canada was not merely standing around watching events take place. The CIA was a junior partner.""""The old postscript sent the message that, for political reasons, Canada took the credit. A sarcastic kicker noted that Taylor received 112 citations. The clear implication was that he did not deserve them.""(Sept/Oct., 2012, thestar.com)"".So the USA does another revision on history here. I believe 'Argo' goes this far. Yes, it's based on a true story - the movie does it's best to allude that it sticks to technical accuracy. And it really does, in some ways. Historical pictures of flag burners, rioters, gate climbers, etc.. up against Argo film stills run by during the credits make it seem that the facts were adhered to down to the tiniest detail. In reality, it wasn't Tony Mendez or the CIA who were responsible for the success of this operation; actually they were barely there.Since the movie premiered, Ben Affleck has added emphasis on the movie postscripts since then that gives kudos to the Canadians' role. This was after Ken Taylor politely complained, as a Canadian would tactfully do. But Affleck did this only after pressure from Taylor himself.I can understand the need to spice up events to make them as exciting and entertaining as possible, don't get me wrong. But this film needs to let the audience know that more explicitly than it does, even after the changed postscripts.Still, a really entertaining and riveting film, very well done, and easily worth seeing. As a matter of fact, don't miss it.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
One of the Smartest Thrillers in Years,"Argo (2012)**** (out of 4)Excellent thriller based around the secret CIA mission to try and rescue six Americans hiding out in Iran shortly after the hostage crisis broke out. CIA agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) decides to hatch a plot to make a fake movie and get the six out. It's only early November as I write this but I'm going to make a bold prediction that ARGO hears its name called out quite a few times come Oscar night. Director Affleck has once again created an incredibly well-made, incredibly tense and downright entertaining thriller that works on all levels and really comes across as something special. We've seen hostage movies before and we've seen political movies before but there's never been anything quite like ARGO. Thank God it's based on a true story or else who would believe this story? The secret mission of the CIA is just so incredible that it has to be true and using the Hollywood backdrop just makes for some pretty fun scenes and especially when you know a couple of the names like Oscar-winner John Chambers. The actual look of the film is quite striking as you certainly feel as if you're in the middle of the 1979-80 time period. Affleck has a great eye for the style of the picture and the cross between the 2.35:1 aspect ratio and some of 8 and 16mm footage. The performances are also another major plus with Affleck, Alan Arkin, John Goodman and Bryan Cranston all doing terrific work. Each and every actor no matter how small or major their part really comes across terrific and this helps brings so much credit to the story. I'm certainly not going to ruin the final thirty-minutes but they'll have you on the edge of your seat the entire time. After GONE BABY GONE and THE TOWN, Affleck had certainly put his name on the map for young directors and now ARGO just takes that to a new level. This here is certainly one of the best movies of the year and one of the smartest and most intelligent thrillers in a very long time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Affleck delivers another amazing film,"After years of being one of those actors that was hit and miss with people, who would have thought he would become one of the most sought after great directors in the industry. After his last film The Town received so much acclaim and award nominations everyone was wondering if it was just a fluke. His latest film Argo takes on the actual events during the Iran Hostage Crisis finds him once again taking on double duties with directing and starring, but can he bring these events to life and create another great film along with it?Argo follows the unbelievable true story of six Americans that have found shelter with the Canadian ambassador in Iran when the revolution reaches a boiling point. The CIA works alongside some heavy hitters in Hollywood to create a fake film production to concoct a risky plan to try and get them out of the country. For a movie that focuses on a situation that was so dire and heavy, this film comes off a bit lighter than expected. Ben Affleck has crafted a brilliantly entertaining film on numerous levels. The story alone is intriguing watching their unbelievable plan come to life. During this time of the film it delivers some really funny moments, without falling to far off track and confusing the kind of film this is. The acting here is top notch with everyone involved, including Affleck himself delivering some awesome performances. The dynamic between Affleck and Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston is perfect creating a duo that both entertain as well as keep this story on track. The biggest treat in this film are brilliant and a lot of time funny performances from John Goodman and Alan Arkin. These guys really bring all the Hollywood aspect to the film to life while delivering Oscar worthy performances that will hopefully be recognized. The gritty look to this film really helps to capture the vibe and tone of the film while combined with the attention to detail, helps take you into the time period it takes place.Brilliant directing, acting, story and some fun sci-fi references throughout takes Argo into the realm of one of the best films to come along in some time. Affleck proves once again of his talent as a director and that The Town was no fluke. This is a must see film that will no doubt be all-the buzz when award season comes around and deserves every bit of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
No complaints,"Ben Affleck directs and stars in the newest political thriller, ""Argo"". It is filled with A-list actors such as Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Victor Garber, and Bryan Cranston who each contribute to this incredibly moving film, which is based on a declassified true story.It takes place during the Iranian revolution of 1979 and 1980 in Tehran. More than sixty Americans from the US embassy were held as hostages, but six of them escaped and were hiding out in the home of the Canadian ambassador (Garber). Tony Mendez (Affleck), a CIA extraction specialist, came along to concoct a plan to rescue these six Americans.After speaking to his son while watching a movie one night, Mendez had a creative yet genius idea. He and the escaped hostages would pretend to be the film crew of a new sci-fi movie called ""Argo"". With the help of Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers (Goodman) and producer Lester Siegel (Arkin), this fake crew made their story quite credible.Ben Affleck did a spectacular job directing this film, which pretty faithfully follows such an unbelievable story. Every actor is convincing as his/her character and the cast was impeccably chosen. Make sure you stay in the theater to watch the credits. You'll see some real photographs and clips that mirror Affleck's film and actors.""Argo"" is basically only rated R for language, making it appropriate for most teens, in my opinion. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, whether you're an adult who remembers watching this on TV or you're a kid who doesn't know anything about politics. It is extremely dramatic, exciting, and heart wrenching, but also hilarious on many occasions. When the movie ends, the entire audience applauds and cheers. It's an amazing story that deserves to be heard.I give ""Argo"" a 10 out of 10. I have no complaints.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Vibrant blend of humor, tension, and history","'Argo' presents maybe the greatest, if not the most absurd, account of American foreign policy espionage widely unbeknownst to the greater majority. The story, which falls perfectly into the category of you-can't-make-this-kind-of-thing-up, is based upon Tony Mendez's rescue of six isolated US diplomats out of Iran, during the time of the Iranian hostage crisis of 1980, through the means of creating a fake film production as cover.Director Ben Affleck proves here just how incredibly mature and restrained a filmmaker he's become, molding what is inherently a political story, yet wisely setting aside the politics. He masterfully handles the changes in tone very fluidly, from one moment being edge of your seat tension, to the next of inspired comic relief. It brings back memories of 70's thrillers, when craft and entertaining went together hand-in-hand.The cast of veteran character-actors is worth the price of admission alone. Nearly every speaking role is occupied by a recognizable face, with the likes of Philip Baker Hall, Bob Gunton, Michael Parks, Kyle Chandler, John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and more. This is easily the best cast of 2012 and, better yet, they all brought out there A game.'Argo' is not a film to miss, its subject matter being more relevant than ever and will be a major contender come award season (and deservedly so.)9/10 -Pycs",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Intense Film Packed With Emotion,"Argo is the political thriller based on the 1979 Iranian hostage situation in which 6 Americans were left to fend for themselves in the centre of Tehran. CIA Operative Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) is sent into Iran to evacuate the Americans out safely under the cover of being a film production crew working on a picture called 'Argo'.The film is absolutely amazing and definitely one of the best films I've seen in a long time, throughout 2012 and 2013 so far we have been treated with some great films such as Skyfall, Django Unchained, Life of Pi, Les Miserables, Zero Dark Thirty and more, but in my own personal opinion Argo takes the bait as the best of them all. Proof is present as it won 3 BAFTA's for best picture, best director and best editing, also nominated for a further 8 Oscars in 85th Academy Awards.The film is packed with a sense of threat, peril and intensity all portrayed exceptionally well through the ensemble cast including Ben Affleck (The Town), John Goodman (Big Lebowski), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Alan Arkin (Edward Scissorhands) and Victor Garber (Titanic). The ending is by far the most intense ending I have seen in a long time, visually presented in such an astounding way.Director Ben Affleck started out his auteur career after his directional debut Gone Baby Gone became critically acclaimed, three years later The Town came out with an Oscar nomination. Now 2 years on we have Argo, Affleck's best film by far.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Quite suspenseful!,"Ben Affleck continues hitting them out of the park. Based on a true story, Argo re-enacts the events that freed American foreign service employees from their hideout in the Canadian Embassy. The setup involves Affleck's character, Mendes, putting together the cover story of a Canadian film crew scouting locations in the Mideast for a sci-fi movie. Alan Arkin & John Goodman are hilarious as Hollywood hotshots producing this surefire scifi hit. The process follows Mendes as he enters Iran and has to BS his way to some skeptical and hostile Iranian theocrats who almost don't know how to respond to the possibility of a scifi movie set in Iran. Mendes must also deal with frightened and reluctant Americans who are being forced out in the open to pose as a movie crew. Affleck does a good job of injecting suspense and dread all through this section.But the real nail biter is their exit from Iran. As in other movies of this ilk, the chase heats up with the Iranians on the heels of the Americans. Affleck throws into this chase a huge boulder of an obstacle when President Carter pulls the plug on the film crew ex-filtration & decides to go with Delta soldiers instead. If you want to know what happens, I advise you to see the movie or read the news accounts.This just goes to show you that not all CIA covert actions are led by armed fighters like Jason Bourne and launched by the Treadstone department. Affleck's character doesn't even carry a gun--he carries a script instead.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Over-hyped,"This review may be coming a little bit late, considering i saw the movie back in November, but i wanted to check one or two things before i write it.I wanted to see whether or not the movie will receive any Academy awards buzz from the the Golden Globes and the various Guild awards.I wanted to wait, because i could not believe the hype surrounding it.I saw it, and i was not that impressed at all.So after some amount of time has passed and the seven Academy nominations have been announced, i thought it was time for a second viewing, in order to try and change my mind about the movie, but-no.First of all, i enjoyed Gone Baby Gone and The Town of Affleck's repertoire much more than i did with Argo.I would even recommend Zero Dark Thirty (Bigelow's recent take on historical events, that are important to American society)ahead of Argo.That being said, Affleck's based-on-true-story-sci-fi-flick has it's strenghts.The fact that the movie is solid enough and that a thorough enough background-check on the events depicted in it, are made, admittedly do the movie some justice.It's well and accurately written, but a nomination is as far as it can stretch itself.Never mind the fact that Affleck is still weaker in front of the camera, than he is behind it, this is clearly visible.One might even wonder how he has that experience as an actor and as a director and be so far ahead with the material when at the helm of a movie.So, the era is accurately depicted, even the jokes, sets, clothing, music-all fits the bill, although Led Zeppelin's When the Levee Breaks is probably 10-12 years earlier, thus not from this period.But i'm willing to close my eyes on this one, considering the love i have towards Plant&co.On that subject, Aerosmith and Dream On were more accurately chosen, although only for the trailer.The technical part of the movie was almost excellent, i mean there isn't any breakout aspect to put in the running for some awards (although some people obviously think there is), all in all everything was good enough.Maybe only William Goldenberg can get a nod over the others, but he'll have stiff competition from his other movie, Zero Dark Thirty and himself.As this is pretty evident by now, he has two nominations in one category for two different movies.So, it will be pretty interesting to see which movie do the critics hold in higher regard-this category will tell.For me, that should be ""Zero"".So, technically good, historically accurate, even a little tense, so what's the matter, you might ask.Very simple.Contrary to popular belief, that has been planted in most people's minds, there actually was no acting in this movie.Not a single part was properly played by nobody, including you, Mr. Arkin.I can't understand where did this nomination come from, but in my eyes it is totally undeserved.Arkin and Goodman were of course fine, fun to watch, but the parts they played, others have played so long ago and to a better extend.When we start off with Sunset Blvd. and stop at present-day Hank Moody, there are people much more prepared to the challenges of playing a movie guy.Arkin was fine, but for 10 minutes of screen time you just can't receive that kind of reception and you just can't make this big of an impact.It is not normal.Not that they are, those awards and guild-members.So, if i have to sum it up in a nutshell-the screenplay was good enough, the directing was decent as well, the acting was stiff at best (i'm looking at you, Ben), the era was pretty impressively(although inaccurately story-wise) depicted (still looking at you, Ben), the technical part was top-notch (William Goldberg), but all in all this does not make up for the ""masterpiece"" many of you claimed it to be.If i had to recommend it, i would, simply because of it's must-see- based-on-true-story(although if we have to go there, discussing how accurate it really is, we'd be in for a long night) factor.But, as i said earlier, i'm not that impressed and there is nothing all that much to be impressed with.And Best Picture?No way!!My rate: 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Historical Mission Impossible,"We already know that Ben Affleck is better as a director than an actor. He tells a story uniquely with his own cinematic art and style. In Argo, this is a new challenge for him. Making a large and historical drama thriller. Argo is based on a declassified true story about Tony Mendez rescuing six US diplomats from Iran. The movie depicts the story in a much suspenseful way. Affleck's directing talent shines once again with modern and old Hollywood vibe. The film is both dark and light, funny and thrilling. Argo is undeniably entertaining, compelling, and exciting.Firstly the performances, Bryan Cranston did what he does best. John Goodman and Alan Arkin are the delight and the comic relief of the film. Ben Affleck portrays Tony Mendez pretty well. He gave enough depth to the role. Now as a director, you may notice his trademarks(Though, it's not set in Boston and there were no masked criminals). He brings his style of suspense to the picture. The storytelling is not only straightforward, but it also builds the tension starting by exploring what's going on until it proceeds to the next action. It never stops being gripping.What's impressive is it can balance its various tones decently without being a mess. Outside the storytelling is a solid craft. The film looks credibly retro. They obviously wanted to make everything look the same to the real life story. The production design really captures the eighties like their vehicles, clothes, and the awesome mustache and beard. The camera is shaky which larges the scale and makes the absurd climax exciting.Argo is sensational as a film directed by Ben Affleck. It provides great suspense, drama, and humor which made itself so remarkably charming. This film proves that Affleck can make bigger films than just Boston crime dramas. His style of bringing tension is the classy formula of the film. The rest of the filmmaking is solid. Argo is simply a classic. No matter how ridiculous the premise sounds, it's still undeniably smart and spectacular.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
OK film but seriously flawed in places,"The storyline itself makes for a great film if time was given to explore characters more and background more, the film hits the ground running then its given the rest of the time it has to try and elongate a very specific part of the story which culminates in a fevered 15 minute ending.I would watch it again but not biased on the reviews that others have given it. I did not approach the film from an historical point of view only from an entertainment point. So please find that this review has no shouts of the film being racist, anti-Iranian, anti this and anti that I only wish that people reading this review do not take into account some other reviewers offering reviews biased on their political and religious opinion.

"Oddly, I couldn't find anything to dislike about this film!","I will readily admit that I am a very critical person when it comes to movies. After all, a normal person doesn't contribute over 13800 (and counting) reviews to IMDb! However, ""Argo"" is an unusual film because I honestly can't think of a single negative thing to say about it! Really...it's THAT good! The film is about a joint effort by the Canadian government and the CIA to rescue a group of six Americans stranded in Iran during their revolution in 1979-80. It seems that most of the Americans in the US embassy were captured by extremists but a small group of folks escaped and sought shelter in the Canadian embassy. What happened next? See the film.It's odd. In light of the film's greatest strength, how could the Oscar folks NOT have nominated Ben Affleck for Best Director? After all, in so many ways the film was wonderfully directed. Although I knew the fate of the six refugees, I STILL found myself reacting to the incredibly tense ending. I was actually chewing my fingernails and could feel my heart pounding. Additionally, the film was wonderful how it kept weaving the characters into a VERY complicated and wonderful story. The other unsung heroes of the film were the producers (and there were many) and makeup folks. They managed to really capture the look of the era and look of the actual characters in real life. And, finally, the script was just terrific. Overall a magnificent film--one that clearly is in the running for Best Picture this year. And, incidentally, the audience at the showing tonight broke into applause when the film ended! I can't say that it should win, as some of the films nominated are so different and I haven't yet seen them all. Heck, I'd love to see a couple take home the statuette as it's been a very good year for films.By the way, if you are the sort to leave when the final credits roll, DON'T.

"Don't listen to the hype, it's not bad, but it's not a masterpiece either","After hearing much about the hyped up Argo, I wanted to go see it as soon as it premiered. To be honest, it wasn't a bad film, but it wasn't anything spectacular either. I tried watching it 2 more times from the comfort of my home, but I still wasn't very interested. Where the nominations come from, I dunno. Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's a bad film, I'm just trying to warn you, don't go in the theatre or pop the DVD in the player expecting to have your mind blown away.At any rate, I'm getting ahead of myself.The film is a portrayal of the events surrounding the storming of the American embassy in Iran back in the late 70's/early 80's by an angry mob and the hostage situation that ensued. The CIA are trying to find a way to save 6 of the embassy workers who managed to escape the embassy during its takeover and are hiding in the Canadian ambassador's residence. The CIA comes up with the plan of creating a fake film company that's looking to make a sci-fi flick in the iranian deserts as a cover for bringing the escapees back to the US as part of the film crew. The historical accuracy is quite good, and it shows that there was adequate research done prior to the film.The direction was also very good, as is the usual norm with Ben Affleck, whom I always respected as a director. The acting, cinematography, soundtrack are also quite excellent and the movie doesn't fall short of anything.Especially towards the end it manages to hold you on your seat with suspense and then cheer at the outcome.The problem with the movie is the hype. I do not feel that this movie deserves an 8.2 on IMDb nor the several nominations it has received. It's not a bad film, in fact it's quite enjoyable and performs well in every sector. However, it's still nothing spectacular. It doesn't make itself memorable. It doesn't provide anything of note to the viewer, it doesn't go much further than any other film. It's an average movie. I recommend it for everyone but, don't go in expecting to see the masterpiece of the year. You'll enjoy it as long as you forget about the praise the movie has received PRIOR to its release. Just watch it and you'll enjoy it. The movie is above average 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
This is the second filming of this story,"The film is well done, and exciting, though Ben Affleck made clear in interviews that the actual rescue was not quite so dramatic but was punched up for dramatic purposes. It worked for me! Affleck does a nice job of subduing his own personality in the character he portrays. It is also clear from the pictures the end that the filmmakers were careful to recreate the scenes as closely as possible from archival pictures and videos. Affleck and company did a good job of balancing history and the artistic needs of a commercial movie.Does anybody know the name of the earlier version of this same rescue? I saw it on video cassette in 1991 but don't remember the name of it or who starred in it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Outstanding!,"Ben made a huge comeback after directing The Town and Gone Baby Gone - two movies more loved by the audience than by critics.. But now it's his time with 96% of Rotten Tomatoes, 8.4 IMDb rating and lots of positive (and even more) reviews. So, here is mine... Probably like most of other people I had great expectations to Argo and they don't fully matched with what I saw, but still this is one of the best films of the year. The good thing about screenplay is the story itself, a very dynamic, somehow intrigue and a beautiful plot. I liked the smart and very natural dialogues, the mix of documentary and film scenes. Even the happy ending was good because during the whole film I've got attached to those characters so much, I experienced every tricky moment, I felt nervous for police check they had to pass and I argued against president Carter to support Tony's (Ben Affleck) plan.The acting panel is perfect in the movie. Ben plays so well that he can be palced next to Robert Redford, Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Ron Howards - actors who turned to directors very successfully. He delivers a zero emotion performance of US government agent who aims to save hostages. He can probably get an Oscar nomination as a lead actor because Hollywood will love extremely positive hero.But real star of this movie is Alan Arkin playing Lester Siegel - a widely acclaimed Hollywood director helping Tony to make a fake movie. He portrays a smart and funny director being pretty close to most of real directors of our time. He's most natural act in the whole cast of Argo and that is why Alan can get his fourth Oscar nomination, this time for supporting role.What's the chances of winning Best Picture Oscar?Chance of nominating is over 100% but not sure about winning. It is good, definitely good, almost perfect. But lacks a polish that is so much important for best picture winner. In the end, I did not clearly imagine Argo holding that title in February. However this is still possible as we've got Les Miserable premiere ahead and Tom Hooper promises a lot this year.For Complete Review visit my blog: http://running-reel.blogspot.com/2012/10/movie-review-argo-2012.html",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Good Story Telling/Don't Take it as Gospel,"Had this movie been made twenty years from now, when facts become distorted, the people who followed the details are either dead or indifferent, and the whole thing is pretty much ancient history, this would be a great story. Just like ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" is a fun movie, even if it is about ninety percent inaccurate. This is because the producers would like you to believe all of the near misses, the interventions, and so on were truly what happened. There are enough people on the internet who will happily discount them, using good evidence to do so. Now, this leads us to an interesting pass. Can we accept any historical movie as being well done when those making it didn't have the wherewithal to see the events. LIke historical fiction, as soon as we quote dialogue, we are on untrustworthy waters. However, this would dismiss many great movies. I'm afraid this one is still too fresh in our consciousness. I'm wondering if someone in 2045 will see this and comfortably absorb the ""facts"" as presented. Divorcing myself from reality, I can see this as a great yarn. Like ""The Killing Fields"" or other historical dramas where people face their mortality at every juncture, can we enjoy the very intense situations that our people have been thrown into. This is a very individual thing. I enjoyed this movie for the most part because I found the characters engaging, the ""enemy"" human and righteous (considering our connection to the Shah), and the situation terrifying. I expect this will get a lot of attention at awards time. I saw Jimmy Carter at Obama's second inauguration the other day. This movie must not be a pleasant experience for him because he was vilified because of his performance. Reagan was able to pick up the pieces because the Iranians had already humiliated Carter, which was part of their agenda. Watch with a grain of salt and realize this is not a documentary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A solid film, not a masterpiece","The film falters most when it forces itself into comic and thriller molds. I was worried that the film would play up the ""isn't this SUCH a wacky, harebrained idea"" angle, and in the first act, especially the Hollywood scenes, it kind of does. And the third act is guilty of too much overt button-pushing; without giving anything away, a lot of it feels pretty artificial, which would be less of an issue if this weren't ostensibly a true story.Another fault I found was how thinly drawn the hostages actually were. I never really felt like they were particularly rounded as individuals, and the one with the most dialogue (Joe Stafford, I'm pretty sure) did little more than fret and grouse. By not developing the hostages as characters, the film undercuts, in my view, its own stakes and whatever level of emotional involvement the audience may have had.With all that, I still thought it was a well-made film; Affleck's direction isn't outstanding, but the film moves smoothly, the suspense is decently well-managed (the script may be more to blame than anything else), it's technically solid (some iffy CGI aside), and the acting is just fine. Affleck is muted, but that's acceptable for the role of Mendez; Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman all do quite well, and I personally wish they had more to do. The rest of the cast do just fine, but they aren't given quite enough to work with.And that's what I think might ultimately hurt the film's Oscar chances; there's no performance in the film to really latch onto. Arkin is being pegged as a contender, but he really doesn't have THAT much to do; the acting is perfectly fine, but really, I find ARGO to be a solid thriller and not much more.Perhaps what the film should've done is focused less on the suspense and more on the psychology of role-playing. Playing these parts was a matter of life and death for these people; that was a theme the film should dug into deeper.And maybe that's why I didn't love ARGO; it doesn't have much real depth to it.

Watch the last 45 min and skip the propaganda!,"I just saw this movie and unfortunately I was greatly disappointed, it was hyped all over the place so I was looking forward to it. I thought they didn't make American propaganda movies as obvious as this anymore. The historical inaccuracy and unrealistic depiction of Iranians clearly emphasize that Affleck went for a cheap shot. I hope Americans are happy with Argo and Zero Dark Thirty which both have high marks on IMDb and both are far from being great movies. Both suffer from a useless and incoherent build up leading to a fantastic 45 min ending.So yeah good job Affleck for creating something more interesting and a lot better than The Town, but two thumbs down for not putting more creativity and realism in there. He could've replaced the Iranians with zombies and this would've been more interesting to watch. There is nothing in this movie that hasn't been done before and everything in this movie has been done better.Good production value but if you're not American this will make your stomach turn. However If you do watch it, make sure you catch the last 45 min of the movie. Everything prior to that is just mediocre and bland and out right shameful.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Do go to ARGO,"WOW!! What a movie, talk about sitting on the edge of your seat, biting your nails, and wiggling your feet despite the fact that you know the outcome and how this event will all end. This movie is true movie making magic from the very start. The acting is exceptional, and the production and direction is truly outstanding. By now you know the premise of this story, but until you see how it all unfolded, you really don't know anything. Until this movie, I had never been in a theater where the audience actually claps at the conclusion. This one brings out several emotions as you view and a overwhelming sense of patriotism is just one that you will experience.Ben Affleck shows he is a class director, Oscar worthy for sure. The entire cast is so believable and engaging, especially Bryan Cranston who again shows great and exceptional skill in role development.I loved this movie, you will too.

"""Carter said you were a great American."" ... ""A great American what?""","Somewhat overrated suspense film with 'colorful' Hollywood overtures stars Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez, real-life exfiltration specialist for the CIA whose bold plan in 1980 it was to get six Americans home from strife-ridden Iran, where they have been in-hiding since November 1979 when the US Embassy was stormed by protesters over the CIA's involvement in Iranian politics. Mendez concocts a genuinely flamboyant plan--disguising the terrified group as Canadian filmmakers in the country to do pre-production work for a science-fiction film--but nothing about Affleck's lead weight performance suggests this kind of imaginative thinking. Affleck, who also co-produced and directed the film, does a good job at laying out the complicated scenario, however his button-pushing tactics at the final gate (leading to a nick-of-time climax) are a bit cheap. Audiences may feel the good will, and certainly the milieu is vividly captured. Alan Arkin, as a passed-his-prime movie producer, and John Goodman, as a Hollywood makeup artist, are both fine in support, though this section of the picture is undernourished. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A rather straight telling, but the story is engaging throughout","Argo interested me not only because it was rather breathlessly discussed by critics when it came to ""best film of 2012"" time, but also because it was a true story that I knew nothing about – from detail to the ending it was all news to me. Watching it I still took it with a pinch of salt simply because I think it is wrong to approach any fictionalized version of a true story and assume that it is entirely gospel. The film walks a fine line between the dramatic and the absurd, almost to the point where if you left the cinema during one scene and then returned during another, you would be forgiven for thinking you'd come back into the wrong screen. It does this but yet it mostly pulls it off.The film opens with an American embassy in Iran being stormed and the majority of people taken hostage, except a small group who flee to the home of the Canadian Ambassador and are hidden. The story is then about the extradition of this small group, before the Iranians work out that they are missing and hunt them down; with options limited, the plan is to send an agent into Iran posing as someone scouting for locations for a movie – and then leave the country with the small group acting as his colleagues and peers. This involves doing more than saying it out loud as it has to pass muster with the Iranians – so the CIA works with a Hollywood writer and a producer to greenlight a film, sell it to the press and take their small production into Iran. In telling the story the film pretty much plays it straight and allows the scenario to be whatever it is – so when it is a press junket then it is amusingly absurd but while it is in an Iranian airport it is really tense and the stakes are apparent. This approach works pretty well because it lets the film have these extremes alongside one another without one undercutting the other. The downside is that it does occasionally mean that the telling feels quite ""ordinary"" as it lacks an individual voice to the delivery – not boring by any means, but just surprisingly straight in the telling.This can be seen in the cast because mostly there are not really characters here, since the film focuses on events and doesn't leave a lot of time for the people (understandably). Affleck doesn't really work in the lead and I'm not sure why he cast him; he is OK but his presence is not all it needed to be in such a straight film. The various hostages in Iran don't really make an impression beyond them being just that, but there is color provided by solid turns from Goodman, Cranston, Arkin and a few others. As director Affleck does a good job to make the mix of content work so well, but the real credit to the production is how of the period it feels – there is nothing that really seems out of place, from office to street it feels like it was filmed back in the late 70s.Argo is an effective and engaging story that works partly because the telling is straight enough to let the events be however they are (absurd, tense, whatever). However this straight bat does also limit the film by making it feel a little ordinary in the delivery, without much flair or individual style to the telling, even if the attention to period is really well done.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Argo is a worthy drama of the events of the rescue of some Americans during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979-80,"The movie's title is the title of the script for a ""proposed"" film that Agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) suggests as a cover for a rescue mission concerning six Americans held as guests with some Canadian representatives in Iran in order to avoid capture by the Iranian terrorists during the hostage crises of 1979-80. It's presented like a real '70s film in a documentary-like style that takes its time in getting to the climax. Certainly having such worthy support from John Goodman, Alan Arkin, and Bryan Cranston contributes immensely to the compelling drama of the situation and Affleck's direction doesn't seem false in presenting the way things happened during that tense time though I'm sure some liberties were taken. So on that note, Argo is recommended as a historical docudrama. P.S. Loved seeing many of the vintage news footage including one from ABC saying a late night rerun of ""The Love Boat"" will be delayed for 15 minutes for Ted Koppel's report on the latest Iranian development. That would eventually become ""Nightline"". Oh, and this was the second time I watched a movie with the '70s version of the Warner Bros. logo presented this year. The first time was on Magic Mike.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Story worth Telling And Seeing,"I actually wasn't even sure what Argo what about but when a friend suggested it, but I just went for it. I'm really glad that I did because even though I was alive during the whole Iran hostage crisis I do not recall any of this fascinating part of history (I was only 10 at the time). It's a really good story and for the most part that film tells the story well and in a way that is both interesting and entertaining. A diverse cast all deliver solid performances. As one would expect suspense with a story of this nature, the film and solid direction are successful in delivering that suspense and through it all there is just enough levity to keep it from becoming oppressive. Argo is a film worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Average movie with a great cast,"I really love Ben Affleck as a director, as I do Clint Eastwood or pretty much anybody who is willing to make a movie that sticks to its guns, is honest and well constructed. This movie is all that, but I was never as intrigued as I was during The Town, nor was I not aware that my wine glass was slowly emptying. I was agitated and not that involved. I cared for some of the characters, but not all of them. I wanted an Oscar-potential movie like Munich, but I got a good solid family drama, although based on a true story, felt much more contrived. This is not a great movie, although it is good. Affleck takes on the lead man with ease, easily adapting himself into a look never seen before on him. The other actors are near perfect, reiterating that this is indeed a well made movie, but the way the movie plays out is much like an episode of the A Team or Macgyver where you know that the good guys will always come through, somehow. Not that I was routing for the bad guys, not that I don't realize that most movies are equally- contrived, but something about the story was missing, perhaps an insight into what makes the Iranians tick, so that my judgement from a viewer perspective does not remain completely abstract.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Affleck Brings Back 70's Cinema.,"As the Iranian revolution nears a climax, a CIA specialist comes up with a risky plan to rescue six Americans who are hiding at the home of the Canadian Ambassador. The plan? A fake movie.With two good films under his belt Ben Affleck has already solidified himself as a competent director. With Argo he ventures into the must see category. Argo is easily one of the best films of the year and reminds us of the films we use to love back in the 70's. Not only does the film look like it takes place in the 70's, but it feels like it too. Blowing the picture up to give it the grainy feel, greatly adds to the overall experience.Multiple times I got the feeling that Affleck was trying to pull off an All The Presidents Men vibe, especially in the CIA offices and it works. While I'm sure Affleck took some liberties with the events, it never feels like any of this couldn't have happened. Affleck is a CIA operative and not once does he fire a gun, fight the bad guys or be 007. This film is 100% talking, yet is one of the most suspenseful films of the year. Where does the suspense come from? If their cover is blown, they are all dead. Can these people fake being a film crew? Does everyone make it out alive? Even if you know how the real story turns out, Affleck manages to keep the tension throughout the entire third act intact.I do wish that Affleck would have given Canadians more credit though. They did most of the work, took most of the risk and in the film it feels as if they were babysitters while Mendez comes up with this Hollywood Option and does everything to get them out. So it does feel like Hollywood trying to take credit for something they were let in on, but that's a small gripe in a fantastic film.Boasting an impressive cast: Ben Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Bryan Cranston, Tate Donovan, Victor Garber, Clea DuVall, Rory Cochrane, Kyle Chandler and Ben Affleck staple Titus Welliver, everyone brings their A-game, no matter how small the role. Of course Affleck has to have his obligatory shirt off shot.Argo is everything a movie should be, a great story, compelling drama and light hearted humour. Like I said earlier, it brings back the days of 70's cinema, complete with thick glasses, dorky haircuts and goofy moustaches. The film's credits put up the actors with their real person counterparts. Plus images from the film are literally taken from pictures taken during the events. It's a scary situation to be in and Affleck puts that front and centre.Go see Argo",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Strong Hostage Drama,"This is a really good thriller based on the little known attempt to rescue 6 Americans hiding in the Canadian embassy during the Iranian hostage crisis. Director Ben Affleck skillfully ratchets up the suspense while delivering a believable performance as Tony Mendez a CIA technician who devises a highly imaginative escape plan that could easily qualify for an episode of Mission:Impossible. Chris Terrio's adapted screenplay explains the basis for Iranian hostility toward Americans before settling into a human drama focusing on a group of low level diplomatic operatives facing the possibility of imminent death. There's good supporting work from Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin and John Goodman.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Affleck has the goods!,"It's got history in it, but it's not a history lesson. It's more of an exaggeration/dramatization of the true events it is based upon. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I mean it's a movie and we see movies to be entertained, which I think it did a relatively successful job. The acting is solid, the script is solid, the directing is marvelous. I said before with The Town: it isn't so much that the movie in-itself is a masterpiece, but rather it's the fact that Affleck has managed to pull it all together all himself, having a role in effectively every department of the movie. He's a great actor, writer and director. But having said all that, I don't think Argo is special enough to walk away with a Best Picture Win. It will get nominated for sure, but the movie isn't extraordinary. It's simply a solid feature, but it doesn't go to the next level to make it amazing. However, watch out for Scoot McNairy for a supporting actor nomination, and possibly a victory.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Good movie but not really based on a true story.,"I'll put this out there right now. I'm no fan of Ben Affleck. I just never felt he was a good actor but I didn't let that keep me from seeing this movie everybody was talking about.And yes, let me also put this right out there, the movie is loosely based on the ""Canadian Caper"" in which 6 American diplomats were safely hidden away in the Ambassador's home and then using faked Canadian passports were flown out of Tehran. I say loosely based because as everybody knows it was 90% Canada's involvement that these 6 people got out. It was Ambassador Ken Taylor who came up with the idea, the Canadian government that allowed these 6 to be issued passports and they were then returned home.But that's not what this movie shows. No. It shows that Tony Mendez, played by Ben Affleck, was not only the mastermind of this but downplayed just about anything the Canadians did. Of course after a very Canadian, a.k.a. polite, dressing down by Ken Taylor Ben has since said that the Canadians did help much more than they did.Having said that this is a good movie. There's some A-list actors in it. There's some great cinematography which shows that maybe Ben's skill lies behind the camera. There's some action scenes because you need action scenes today and there's a feeling of triumph when they finally get airborne and are off to freedom.But that doesn't take away from the fact they played really fast and loose with the truth. It's like in U-571. It was the British that captured the Enigma machine but we need Americans to do it for an American audience because they don't like it when others are the heroes. And that's possibly the biggest flaw with this movie. Americans need to learn that they're not the greatest on the face of the planet and that other people have helped them along the way.So thank you Canada for what you've done for us. I just wish this movie could have shown you in a better light.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

A Rescue of the Ages,"A Rescue of the AgesAn Oscar nomination movie for sure. Argo is one of the best movies of twenty twelve and excellently combines historical fact with Hollywood drama. Adding in amazing actors like John Goodman (John Chambers), and Alan Arkin (Lester Siegel) was just a cherry on top. Lastly, the director (Ben Affleck) pulls off the challenging task to make the plot simple and never stops moving.Predictably, whenever a movie based on true events come out, Hollywood does an amazing job designing a movie with little semblance to what actually happened. However, in Argo the movie stays remarkably close to what actually happened with small parts of added drama; where the plane is taking off and the cop cars are chasing the plane down or when they travel to the market. Even the credits of this movie are worth watching; showing pictures of the Iranians in the streets that have been recreated in the movies paying close attention to minute details.Furthermore, the acting was superb. Alan Arkin (Lester Siegel) and John Goodman (John Chambers) were able to bring just the right amount of humor and playfulness to a serious movie. Meanwhile, Ben Affleck (Tony Mendez) brought the drama to the movie as the man sent to rescue the American hostages. Finally, the actors for the six Americans that hid in the Canadian embassy displayed an uncanny resemblance to their counterparts right down to their clothing.On the other hand, Argo does not accurately show several events and people in the story. For example, America had a part but Canada played the main role in the rescue of the Americans. In addition, in the movie the Iranian rioters seem contrived and unrealistic; this demonstrates that director (Ben Affleck) did not either have a) the budget to accurately portray this shot, or b) that this scene was difficult to choreograph giving the nature of where the scene was filmed. However, if you are looking for a great movie and don't mind small miss portrayals then Argo is perfect.Possibly, one of the hardest things in Hollywood to do is to keep the plot simple to understand and to keep it moving. Nevertheless, Ben Affleck pulls it off keeping the plot easy to follow and gripping. Moreover,with one quote from Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) he capture all the drama of the movie. ""Right... Look, I gotta tell you, we did suicide missions in the Army that had better odds than this.""Argo, featuring great actors like Alan Arkin (Lester Siegel) and John Goodman (John Chambers) keeps the plot simple and concise while combining Historical fact with Hollywood drama. All in all Argo is a must see thriller.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The True Mission Impossible Using a Movie that Was Never Made,"In 1979, the Islamic Revolution overthrows the dictator Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who came to power sponsored by the United States government, and the leader of the revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, assumes the power. The Iranian revolutionaries invade the American Embassy in Tehran and the American officials are taken hostages.However, six officials flee from the Embassy and are secretly hosted by the Canadian Ambassador at his residence in Tehran and the CIA directors summon the agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), who is an expert in bringing American citizens back to their country, to plot a rescue plan to save the group. Tony Mendez plots the most incredible plan to bring the six officials: to create a fake Canadian film to be shot in Iran and include the officials in the production crew. Without other alternative, Tony Mendez receives green light from his superiors and travels to Hollywood to set in motion his almost impossible mission to rescue the group.""Argo"" is another great movie by Ben Affleck with a story that is the true Mission Impossible using a movie that was never made. The introduction gives a good big picture about the political situation in Iran and the interference of the United States in this area, where Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan one day are friend nations and on the other days they are the greatest enemies, like the relationship of Oceania with Eurasia and Eastasia in George Orwell's ""1984"".The movie tells that the story is based on a true event, but kept classified for many years. Despite it is the truth or not, the plot is engaging and keeps the thriller until the last scene. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Argo""",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Utterly boring American drivel...

I think I fell asleep twice!I was so looking forward to this film but it just didn't go anywhere! I would like to be able to write more but there's just not much to say. I'm sure the real life story behind the film was very heroic but this certainly is not the film to tell it.As for Aflek, frankly his performance was flat and lack lustre, it was almost like the whole film was a private joke between the actors ""lets see if we can bag an Oscar or two without actually performing!""Watch the film as this is of course just my opinion, however take my advice and just don't pay to see it... you will thank me and if you thought the film was great, well hey you got a cheap night or entertainment!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
definitely Overrated,"Not a bad movie, keep the tense at high levels and I think its the best directing effort of Ben Affleck. In fact, his directing is so good that kept viewers watching an over simplistic - as it can be - plot (americans hiding in Canadian embassy, American walks in with fake passports in hand and puts them on a plane) that he managed to get great reviews. I believe they did not have much ground for a movie here, true stories that are very interesting are rare nowadays. Plus, I always reject the US propaganda in movies (we did it all and let Canadians take the credit but we want to take this credit away and restore the 'truth' that we saved everyone)Overall, I would really like to see some more Ben Affleck movies soon",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Operation: Dunces with Wolves,"Is there anything worse than competent mediocrity? Because, surely this is competent, perhaps more than competent, professional, well shot. I will put aside for the moment that there is no characterization to speak of here, that it is flimsy as procedural, that its politics are unnecessarily uncomplicated (good CIA battles evil Islam), its tone uncertain, with all the goofy movie-making stuff sticking out like a sore thumb. The film is soulless, painting by numbers.The movie was fake after all, but the mission was real.In Affleck's case, there is something worse. Because you see, he does not attempt to 'write history with lightning', as was said about Birth of a Nation a century ago. He softly rewrites the thing. The Canadian stuff has (rightfully) received the most backlash. Imagine this—the CIA analyst who advised Affleck, there had to be one, thought it would be a good idea to end this insinuating the CIA did all the job, but graciously let Canada reap the publicity.But this was too blunt and it backfired, bringing to the fore the more subtle marginalization of Canadian intelligence work all through the film, which otherwise would have perhaps passed with little notice. The film after all establishes that the Canadian ambassador has taken the six in, even though in his fleeting screen time, he hovers about as a 'kindly concierge', as another reviewer put it.You will see a more insidious version of this mentality in the opening few minutes of the film, sketching past US intervention in Iran—the film admits US backing of the Shah and his oppressive regime into power, human rights abuses and so on, but curiously, this part is mainly animated in the form of storyboards, mirroring those we see later of the fake film, as something near- mythical that happened in another time and world. Smart.So, why the heck are we celebrating Affleck? The film shows him to be a blockhead who can put the camera sometimes in the right place.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Another brilliant Ben Affleck effort,"Cinema these days is dominated by remakes and reboots and sequels and adaptations; there are rare exceptions, sure, but film studios and filmmakers seem too scared to attempt something original. Everything is based on something. There's always a source material. So it's no longer about how original a movie is, but how original that source material is. Which brings us nicely onto Argo, which is inspired by one of the most original source materials out there.It's more or less a case of truth being stranger than fiction with Argo. Six American diplomats living in Iran have to go into hiding during the 1980 Iranian Revolution. The CIA concocts a plan to bring them back, by making them pose as the film crew for a fake science fiction movie.It's hard to believe that all of this actually happened – that the American and Canadian governments were able to fool the Iranians to such a farcical extent is fascinating, and so it's no surprise that director Ben Affleck wanted to tackle it. He's also a producer on the film along with George Clooney, which tells you how much faith there is in the subject matter. This is a film about the strength of the human spirit, and the lengths that people will go to protect their own, a theme that seems to run through all of Affleck's writing and directorial efforts.Another staple of Affleck's films is his knack at picking a stellar cast; and the cast for Argo is fantastic. Bryan Cranston. John Goodman. Alan Arkin. Scoot McNairy. Victor Garber. Kyle Chandler. Chris Messina. And that's not even the full list of excellent supporting cast. So many brilliant actors acting brilliantly. It's a treat to watch. Each of the lead actors gets a moment to shine, whether it's Arkin and Goodman trading barbs, Scoot McNairy's airport performance, or Cranston's running around. But just like in The Town and, arguably, Good Will Hunting, Affleck is the one giving the best performance of the movie. He is a quiet presence, letting the personalities around him strut their stuff while he holds it all together. The comparison to Clint Eastwood is blatant: an actor-director capable of bringing the best out of himself.The film has flaws. There are inconsistencies, and a few logic slip-ups, especially in the climax of the movie. Sure, they help amp up the drama, but jars the movie slightly. Too many characters means a slight confusion about who and where everyone is. And I wish I had more emotional investment in the six hostages, as I don't care too much about their survival as I do about the whole plan itself.But I'm nitpicking, because I think criticisms are needed. Whatever faults there are in this film, they're overshadowed by so much good. Conception and execution of this story are top-notch. Ben Affleck proves once again that he is fast becoming one of the best actor-directors out there. Yes, this is not an entirely original film but, if you're gonna adapt something, make sure it's done properly. Argo is, fortunately; a must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
When Great Script and Great Editing Are Perfectly Combined,"Generally, there are three themes that tend to be favored by award community and film critics, the winning themes are about humanity (""Schindler's List"" {1993}, ""The Shawshank Redemption {1994}, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" {2008}, etc.), patriotism (""Saving Private Ryan"" {1998}, ""Black Hawk Down"" {2001}, ""Lincoln"" {2012}, etc.) and the world of cinema itself (""Cinema Paradiso"" {1998}, ""Hugo"" {2011}, ""The Artist"" {2011}, etc.). Well, thiz movie has all three of them. Producer, Director and Actor Ben Affleck is smart enough to realize it and takes advantage of that. Ben Affleck is Tony Mendez, a CIA agent who is responsible for covert operation to extract six American embassy employees out of the rage of Iran revolutionary by pretending to be Canadian film crew. It seems that Ben Affleck has done a tremendous job as the Director. He starts with an effective prologue to provide sufficient information and every time the scene heats up, particularly when the scene of American embassy is invaded, he cleverly adds relaxing piano instrumental music to cool things down and doesn't try to provoke audience into infuriated reactions. Thiz is his third feature films behind the camera after ""Gone Baby Gone"" (2007) and ""The Town"" (2010). For the acting, Ben Afflecks looks cool, calm and confident. John Goodman, Bryan Cranston and Victor Garber give brief but consistent performances and the last but definitely not least, Alan Arkin creates a powerful and believable emotion as fearless Hollywood Producer. I also have to put some credit to the Production Designer Sharon Seymour who successfully makes everything look like 1980s such as costume, hairstyle, glasses, car, furniture, television, telephone, everything! How they put attention to detail is undoubtedly amazing. Personally, for me, the power of thiz movie is in the last half hour. Thiz is a good example of what you can get when great script and great editing are perfectly combined. My heart nearly stopped while watching thiz final scene which takes place in Iran airport. They use almost all aspects to create tensions from ticket, telephone, soldier, bus, you name it and they have done it. When it's over, there will be some satisfying and gratifying feelings. In the closing scene, when the camera pans over the toys of Star Wars, Planet of the Apes and other sci-fi movies one by one.

Others have written more about that but this film is also heavily clichéd and portrays every Iranian as a mad mullah. Hell, when you consider the historical context of America's puppet the Shah prior to the revolution then I would be mad as hell and wanting every American collaborator dead. Perhaps the Iranians at that point were mad as hell and weren't going to take it anymore.I wasn't much taken with the build up sequences to the rescue between the movie moguls, found it boorish and conceited, meanwhile Affleck sniffs and shuffles his way through the movie equally conceitedly in a ain't I cool and up myself sort of way.Still the movie was watchable and happy to give a 6, I did consider 7 but given the negative aspects already highlighted I leaned more towards 6.

Everyone loves the movies...,"Ben Affleck's ""Argo"" opens with a stunning prologue depicting the siege and takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran during the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The whole sequence is exciting and extremely involving. The leading up to the main core of the film's plot is also as engaging.""Argo"" tells the true story of a fake movie which saved the lives of the Americans trapped during the crisis. There are obvious parts which are too ""movie-ish"" and ""Americanized"", however, without them it can't be considered a mainstream movie now can it?When all other plans fail, the CIA allows their specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck) to go ahead with his plan - with the help of Hollywood make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to front a fake movie studio, approve a science-fiction script, fly Mendez to Iran, and fly the Americans out of Tehran disguised as film crewmembers on a location shoot. No matter how ridiculous the plan sounds like, it's a true story nonetheless. And this is a thrilling depiction of the affair.It's also a reminder of how powerful the movies can be, both by itself and the making of. This story takes place when two countries are both on the edge, and tensions are spiking on the extreme. Movie magic apparently eases and spellbinds both sides, you'll see what I mean when watching this.The film also fiercely supports my notion that Ben Affleck is fast on his way into becoming a versatile filmmaker by his own right, and has already evolved into a promising one. Might he be the next Clint Eastwood? Too early to tell, yes, but Affleck shows no sign of sloppiness thus far. Affleck is fairly good in his performance but he directs the film with supreme confidence and skill, using subtle techniques to wring out the thrills.I especially liked how the film really is a pure thriller instead of the obligatory car chases and gunfights (although the climax is technically a chase, it is subtly directed making it helluva exciting). Affleck, in the past decade being typecast as an action hero, now doesn't even fire a single shot in this one. I like that.Technically, the film looks like it came out of a time capsule, with the production and costume design, '70s grain and even the vintage Warner Bros logo are at play - it delves you into the film even further. Editing is appropriately paced, yet Alexandre Desplat's music score could have been a bit better. Just my two cents.With a strong supporting cast (Arkin and Goodman are hilarious in their parts, injecting surprising cynical humor; Bryan Cranston as Mendez's supervisor; Victor Garber as the Canadian ambassador who bravely risks himself while sheltering the Americans) and an intelligent, fiercely exciting, intensely moving, and appropriately terse screenplay. However the film's flaws may be, ""Argo"" is still one hell of a thriller.Overall: 84%",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Fraught with Tension,"In 1979 there was a coup in Iran and the Shah was ousted being replaced by Ayatollah Khomeini. Amidst the melee and strong anti-U. S. sentiment in the country, the U. S. embassy was overrun and the Americans there were taken hostage. Six Americans escaped the embassy which sprung the CIA and other agencies into action to rescue them. CIA agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) would come up with the best idea for rescuing them.His idea was to pose as a movie producer for a movie titled ""Argo"" which was a sci-fi space movie in need of an exotic location. He first had to establish it as a credible movie in the U. S. before daring to take the idea abroad. He would enter Iran alone and leave with his six crew members who had all memorized new identities for their risky escape.""Argo"" was intense and fraught with anxiety. There wasn't a bunch of shooting, running, and close brushes with death in the action sense--and it was all the better for that. The goal was to avoid guns because once they were used the cause was lost. Affleck did a fabulous job directing and the cast was all top notch. It was believable, and what more can you ask from a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Definition: Science Friction,"Telling a story that not only alters the facts but does so at the expense of someone else (or another group) who, in the true telling of a story, deserves way more credit.Up here in Canada, we have a word for 'American' movies and television... we call them 'Movies' and 'Television'. As far as we're concerned, there is no difference between US and Canadian citizens when we watch TV. There are actually classes up here to teach Canadian actors to sound more American. Why...because a significant demographic of Americans don't want to watch 'Lesser' nations on THEIR TV. Shocking or abysmal to the more enlightened? Sure. So you change the facts to make the movie sell.This is why Ben made the main protagonist American... for the 'Canadian Caper'; It sells.

"Arranged, but it's fine","In French, we have this proverb saying: ""This was arranged by the filmmaker"". At the end of ""Argo"", we can guess that the conclusion of this story was arranged a little bit for more dramatization, but it's alright. I was a student during these events and I recall it quite well. The help of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor was essential for these people. I also remember the harsh comments made by Ronald Reagan, right after all the other hostages came back safely in United States. Everybody knows that the previous president Jimmy Carter did all he can to bring back these people. It's real fine from Ben Affleck to let Carter speaks during the credits. It's a well deserved way to thank him. Alan Arkin is absolutely great in here, and he certainly deserves another Academy Award for his performance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Smart, suspenseful and Ultimately Satisfying","Affleck has surrounded himself with an excellent cast to bring this incredible true story to life. The whole cast do a great job with fantastic turns from John Goodman, Alan Arkin and Bryan Cranston. Affleck delivers one of his best roles in a long time. His performance as a man that has put everything on the line, including his very life, to help these six strangers is what gives the film its strength. He's an unshaven, borderline alcoholic man that has set his mind to saving people on the other side of the world. That cocky-as-hell-smug-American thing Ben Affleck was once mocked for is no longer here.Behind the camera Affleck's work is equally as impressive. Realism is the key here. He pours a huge amount of detail into every single scene so that being convinced is one of the last things the viewer has to worry about. There aren't crazy visual flourishes or fascinating editing techniques to be found - just damn good filmaking to be enjoyed. Every moment is filmed with a confident hand that incorporates Rodrigo Prieto's excellent cinematography and Alexandre Desplat's great score. Chris Terrio's screenplay manages to work as a cracking thriller with brains. It's a true story but, of course, certain liberties must be taken when developing a true story into a movie. The climax is exciting and nerve wracking but a little bit too ""Hollywood"" in the way that plot-lines and events all coincidentally lead up to the same point in time. But hey, it works.Argo feels like a classic film. It's a great showcase for Ben Affleck's filmaking and acting abilities. He has crafted an excellent period thriller that will resonate with today's modern day audience and will please cinema-goers that want a smart, suspenseful film that leaves you more than satisfied. It ain't perfect but it's damn close.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Great Acting, Great Cinematography, and a Great Story","To put it simply, this is a great movie. From the opening scenes that set the stage all the way to the stressful and exhilarating climax, this film is jam-packed full of excitement.The movie starts with a few scenes from the revolution in Iran in 1979. The American Embassy is stormed and hostages are taken. However, a few of them escape the embassy, and getting these escapees out of Iran is the central focus of the film. The story is very well-written and thought provoking. While it does dramatize the events, it doesn't overdo it. The film never relies on action sequences, special effects, or even an epic soundtrack to create the tension; it's all directly derived from the story. I definitely see an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay in the near future.As far as acting is concerned, every character is great. I particularly enjoyed Bryan Cranston (although that may be because I love Breaking Bad so much), because he was believably hilarious and serious at the same time. Ben Affleck does a great job with the lead role, but his character is quite static and somewhat one-dimensional. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just could have done with some more back story of his character. All the other supporting actors are great, and I particularly enjoyed the actors who played the hostages. I'd never heard of any of them, but they all did a great job.All in all, this film is great. Great acting, great cinematography, and best of all, a great story. I'd definitely recommend seeing this, you won't be disappointed.RATING: 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Munich is better than Argo,"I expected more drive and suspense. The first part was a little bit boring expect the first ten minutes. Only in the second part the countdown began finally but too late for me to give Argo more than an average vote. There are some slow paced sequences that could have been better. Ben Affleck directed this terrorist movie quiet well. In my opinion the other drama movie Munich has been realized much more credibly and cooler. Perhaps the stuff was not enough to develop more depth. Anyway, a great plus in Argo Is the real created atmosphere of the late 70ies. All mixed with nice rock music hits of that time. I liked a lot also the last scenes with the plane taking off Iran. I think that Argo is too overrated here and I would still prefer Munich even it is longer to watch. A must see in this genre is The Debt. Final rating: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
excellent film directed by Ben Affleck,"For all of us to remember the Iran hostage crisis, the Shah's surgery, Nightline, Carter, and the disturbing nightly news views of the hostages, ""Argo"" is a revisit of these events and a lesser known true story.The embassy staff are taken hostages, but six of them escape and go to the home of the Canadian ambassador (Victor Garber). The U.S. government tries to figure out a way of getting them out of Iran, and a CIA specialist, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is brought in to consult.After exploring their limited options, Mendez finally suggests the cover story of making a science fiction film, having the escapees be Canadian filmmakers looking for foreign locations. One important element: It has to be a real script, with a real producer and director, publicity, an office, everything. When the option is brought up to the escapees, they're not enthusiastic.The Hollywood sector, played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin, supply the humor, and they're hilarious. On the Iranian side, we have suspense and tension as Mendez and the escapees posing as a Hollywood crew carry out the plan. The question is, can they get on a plane and out of the country? Affleck keeps the tension going and the ending is sheer edge-of-your-seat.I don't understand how this film can be nominated for a Best Film Oscar and the director ignored. Is it the best film of the year? I don't know, I haven't seen them all. I would guess that artistically speaking, it's not as good as Lincoln. But for a story that keeps you hooked, Argo is hard to beat with its easy blend of humor, drama, warmth, and suspense.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Another undeserved Academy Award nomination,"Not unlike Katherine Bigelow's 2008 decent, but overrated ""The Hurt Locker"", this is not a film that merited an Academy Award nomination, let alone a win in multiple categories, because it dealt with a very limited (in scope and human importance) specific time and place, rather than a universal and timeless theme. And so it will simply not enjoy or realize longevity in the must- have, always-want-to-watch DVD category. The fact that this was nominated for and did in fact win Academy Awards is testimony to the vapid mentality of the Hollywood establishment.

Heightened reality,"While the movie is based on real events, this doesn't mean everything happened exactly like it is portrayed in the movie. Actually quite the opposite is the case. And I don't think it would be fair to say it is unfair to all Iran. Especially because we are talking about a movie and because it does only portray the (then acting) government as evil. And as mentioned, there are quite a few things that are heightened for ""entertainment purposes"" and most of them work nicely.There are quite a few Iranians who actually help or try not to be pressed into doing evil things. The actual way of how Ben Afflecks character thinks he can help the people seems far fetched, but it is something that happened (again not as heightened as it is shown in the movie). The fact, that you actually know where this is heading from the start, does not change the fact, that you might be able to enjoy watching it (unless you want to read something into this movie that is).",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
level of Details in the Movie,"I was a 12-year old Iranian boy in Tehran during the actual hostage crisis, and I remember the events vividly. I have seen the movie three times and I keep getting amazed at the accuracy of little details embedded in the movie, 99% of which would be unnoticeable to all but the Iranians like me with be vivid memories of the events.For example, the rifles that the Iranian revolutionaries carried were not the prolific AK-47, rather the German HK G-3 rifles that were taken from Shah's military. The movie accurately shows that. They could have used the easily available and cheap Ak-47 in the movie and no one would have blinked.Or the Iranian visa stamp that Affleck's character received in his passport in Iran's consulate in Turkey was from the Shah's Imperial regime that had been overthrown a year before. And the Iranian consulate representative manually and diligently struck through the logo in Farsi, and replaced it with ""Islamic Republic of Iran"" by hand. This must have been lost to all but otherwise attentive Farsi speaking movie viewers, but is an absolutely small, but very powerful detail, given the historical phase the story is taking place. The fact that the movie production dug that deep into details is remarkable.As for dress code and make-up, they were also spot-on right.There is a glaring exception, however. Thinking that an Iranian revolutionary guard would pick up the phone and call up a Hollywood studio from Tehran airport on a moment's notice during passenger screening is simply preposterous :-) I also wish the 2-minute narrative at the beginning of the movie discussing the historic events was more detailed. It was all accurate, but not deep enough.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Entertaining yet troubling,"I liked how tense this film was, and how it reminded us of the six people who escaped the U. S Embassy when it was stormed by Iranian revolutionaries, resulting in the hostage crisis that lasted over 14 months. Embellishing history (more on this later), Ben Affleck tells the story of how these six escaped by pretending to be part of a film project just a few months into the crisis. At the outset of the film, to his credit, he helps us understand where some of the anger towards America came from, notably, the U. S./U. K. instigated overthrow of democratically elected Mohammad Mosaddegh, the 26 years of rule under the corrupt Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and the harboring of the Shah after he was overthrown.Unfortunately, by the time the film ended, it felt like it had devolved relative to historical accuracy, playing up American exceptionalism and an Us vs. Them mentality, and it also devolved relative to storytelling, with the invented drama through the airport and many last-second close calls getting the full Hollywood treatment. It's really kind of a shame, because the real story is so compelling. The film significantly downplayed the role of American allies in this operation, most notably Canada, who deserve the lion's share of coming up with and executing the plan, not the CIA, and also Great Britain and New Zealand. It's also guilty of portraying a nearly monolithic view of Iranians as enraged terrorists, as time and again we see anger and hostility that isn't even subtitled, playing up on stereotypes.I think the film tried to represent where the anger was coming from in the market scene, where a man tries to attack the Americans, telling them that the Shah had tortured his son, but a calmer scene here or elsewhere would have offered at least a little glimpse of humanism. One could argue, I suppose, that this is what it felt like to be trapped in Tehran during the tumult, and there was certainly a lot of vitriol directed against the ""Great Satan"" at this time. There is also a housekeeper who is shown to risk her own life to save others, but it's a very small role, and felt like a token. It's really too bad the film didn't offer some other Iranian perspective instead of the Hollywood roles, those played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin, which seemed like throwaways to me (though were in there for levity). It's also too bad the film didn't circle back more on some of the history mentioned in the introduction, instead of focusing everything on the patriotic homecoming, complete with flag waiving in the background.As for the depiction of Americans, aside from overly heroic lead character, it's a mixed bag. We get the nauseating quote ""John Wayne in the ground 6 months and this is what is left of America,"" which while reflecting the growing feeling at this time that certainly led to the disastrous Reagan years, was also voiced by one of the ""good guys,"" and unironically. There's a scene showing Americans beating up an Iranian American in a crowd, though it's brief, and we get the feeling that it's an aberration, long forgotten by the end. I did like how the film acknowledged Jimmy Carter, whose handling of this crisis and overall Presidency have long been underrated. I also liked the film's attempts to get the look of the people right, and the side by side photos of movie vs. Reality in the credit roll.I liked Argo for its drama and entertainment value, and how it provided a springboard to read up on history. I think it made some attempts at being balanced, but they were pretty weak, and it fell into cliches in trying to appeal to the mass market. Commercially it was thus a big success, but artistically it falls short, and it's hard to fathom how it won so many Oscars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A Tight, Suspenseful Dramatization of the Canadian Caper","I'm admittedly pretty late to the Ben Affleck/director bandwagon. His first film, GONE BABY GONE, went under my radar and I passed on THE TOWN because I wasn't interested in another heist film. He's been collecting praise for his directing efforts for years but it wasn't until ARGO that I actually sat down and watched one of his movies. The premise was one that had grabbed my attention since originally reading about the Canadian Caper in an article on Cracked.com. The movie is based on actual events, but I'm not knowledgeable enough in subject to tell you what's accurate and what isn't. So it's safe to say that I watched this as a movie for entertainment and not as a propaganda piece for America or the CIA, as some have appeared to view it. ARGO is the tale of six staff members for the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Iran during a tumultuous time in which citizens of the country were rioting over the United States' involvement in providing asylum for the former Iranian Shah while he sought treatment for cancer. The riots soon grow out of hand and enraged Iranian civilians overrun the embassy, taking its staff of 52 hostage. Six Americans escaped during the fray and find sanctuary with the Canadian ambassador in his home. The clock is ticking and the U.S. is worried that the Iranians will discover the escapees, so the CIA becomes involved in forming a plan to retrieve them. Enter CIA agent Tony Mendez (Affleck) with a plan to enter Iran and walk the Americans right out through a commercial airport under the guise of a location scout for a Canadian film crew. It's one of those ""so crazy, it has to work"" scenarios.ARGO is good. Best Picture good? Maybe. There might have been more deserving movies in 2012 but I don't feel that ARGO ruined any lives by walking away with the award. It's an incredibly good film that manages to grab its audience on an emotional level, and it tells an amazing story. Regardless of how it's portrayed in the film, the events depicted in the movie happened in one sense of another: the Iranians raged at the United States, 52 embassy staff were taken as hostages for a grueling 444 days, and six escapees were aided in escaping the country as a Canadian film crew. That alone is an incredible tale. This is Ben Affleck's vision of the events and, yes, they are very America-centric. You sort of have to expect that from an American film. Once you overlook that and just absorb ARGO as a piece of entertainment, it succeeds. Affleck does an excellent job of ratcheting up the suspense in the film. These characters are in a dangerously tight spot and you feel for them. They're terrified, paranoid, and never know if the next day will be their last. There is a scene in the middle of the movie where Mendez, in an effort to solidify their cover story, must take the six escapees into Tehran's bazaar where all eyes are on them after a few mere hours to try and learn their false identities. It's tense. Even knowing that everything turns out all right in the end, it's tense. I'd say that makes for a successful film.I also loved the alternating vibes of the film. The scenes in Iran are taut and ominous. We're treated to multiple scenes emphasizing the rampant anti-American sentiment and the dangerous conditions. The scenes in Hollywood are loud and boisterous, with mansions, glamorous parties, and a soundtrack including Van Halen and the Dire Straits. The only instance of Western music once we're in Iran is an excellent use of Led Zeppelin's ""When the Levee Breaks"", used perfectly to reflect the tension as the American's celebrate the night before their big escape while Mendez is confronted with the possibility of abandoning the mission and leaving them behind. Back in America, everything is a bit more light-hearted with John Goodman and Alan Arkin portraying the Hollywood connections that helped Mendez create a fake movie from scratch and pass it off as a legitimate venture to fool the Iranians. Goodman and Arkin are a couple of scene-stealers and provide a bit of levity to break up the gloom of the Iranian situation.If I have any complaint about the movie, I guess it would be that I was underwhelmed with the ending. The big climactic scene in Iranian airport where the Americans are within reach of freedom is a little too forced. The cuts between the Mendez and the escapees, the Iranian police, and the CIA offices felt as if they were trying a bit too hard to make it suspenseful. Still, I suppose it got the job done. ARGO is a fine movie and probably ranks somewhere in my top ten best for 2012.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Very American, very Hollywoodish, full of stereotypes and clichés, it gets worse when you read the real story, otherwise a watchable film BUT best picture award??","I had refused to watch Argo thinking that it would be a typical American film but after five years, I thought why not, let's see some action. I suppose the first thing non-Americans would notice is that it's immersed in stereotypes and clichés, making you say ""oh come on!"" many times. The depiction of Iranians, the CIA, Americans kicking ass as usual... When you read about the real story, a big ""come on!!"" comes out of your mouth. Either Ben Affleck really wanted to reflect things that way or simply applied the procedure for success by US standards. Now, if you just ignore all of these, you might watch Argo as a pastime BUT best picture award? Honestly, before watching the film, I vaguely remembered about Oscars but had no idea that it won the best picture award. How is that possible? Life of Pi was among the nominees that year and Argo won?? Affleck's formula seems to have worked out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Wasted potential because of a one-sided attitude with many lengths and a lack of depth,"Argo won three Academy Awards, including one for the best movie of the year 2012 and this award was even presented by honourable First Lady Michelle Obama due to the patriotic and political content of the film. On my list, this movie though didn't even make it into my personal top twenty of that year. Let me explain you why.Let's start with the positive things first. The costumes, decorations and locations of the movie are authentic and seem to be quite close to the actual events that inspired this film. The tension filled scenes in the very beginning of the movie at the embassy and at the very end at the airport are well done as well.Now, let's talk about the negative facts. The movie includes too many overlong dialogues that go straight nowhere. Instead of showing the raising pressure inside the Canadian embassy and conflicts between all involved persons, one sees a terribly faceless main actor going around to make publicity for his fake movie and talk to more or less important people of Hollywood nobody cares about. After twenty first great minutes, this movie falls flat and bores until the final fifteen minutes or so. Add to this that the movie has no depth whatsoever. It only explains in a quite short opening sequence what led to the revolutionary events in Iran. The movie never explains further how all of this could happen and what that country would become afterwards. The emotions, fate and suffering of the people aren't portrayed at all by this film. One only sees a bunch of angry citizens that play the bad guys while the American diplomats portray the good guys. This one-sided view is quite shallow and filled with the usual stereotypes but one starts to get used to it by Hollywood by now. Add to this a sometimes more or less audible sound quality and some annoying shaky camera positions even though the overall production is quite decent.In the end, the movie is rather disappointing for me. I was really looking forward to discover this flick as the historical events are really intriguing. The idea behind the script had in fact a lot of potential in my opinion. In the end, you won't learn anything new from this movie and it only superficially portrays the events that happened. Half of the movie or so shows us scenes in Hollywood or Washington instead of showing us what happens in the streets of Teheran and the true soul of that revolution. The entire middle part of the movie has important lengths, unnecessary dialogues and lacks of consistency. The actors are exchangeable and fail to touch me. This film is only saved by its promising beginning and its gripping ending.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
on the 33rd anniversary of the Embassy Take Over,"I saw Argo today. On what is 33rd anniversary of the start of the Hostage Crisis. While this was in fact a worldwide story, for me, I found myself awash with memories of that time and perplexed at the emotions this film triggered.I have no recollection of the six who got out, though I am sure I saw it on the evening news. I do recall trying to marry the idea of how I could be safe in suburban DC while halfway around the World it seemed as if everything was falling apart. And I wondered how things like this could happen in the World. (Sadly, a question I still ask to this day.)Superbly cast, an outstanding soundtrack, fantastic attention to detail. Argo is a story that is so far fetched that if it was work of fiction you'd struggle to find it believable. And yet. And yet, we sit in a dark theater, sniffling with strangers, gripped by a story that we all know the outcome of.It was also interesting to contemplate how far technology has advanced in such a short time. One wonders in this age of almost instant communication how different the story would have played out if there had been facial recognition software and email instead of teletexts and telephones. Watching a character make a telephone call and waiting for someone to answer sparks the examination of how different communication was in a World where an answering machine didn't yet exist.Also worth mentioning is the filming style. Cinematography was spot on. I started crying at the first shot of DC from the air. So glad Affleck didn't employ the popular ""hurky jerky"" filming method while shooting Argo. Though the times portrayed in the film were frantic I appreciated the subtle, patient portrayal of a story that unraveled like a spool of thread.As a 6 year old child in the midst of a decaying marriage, and really, the start of my parents divorce, the Hostage Crisis is forever etched in my mind as a time of change not only in the World but also in my house. By the time we got to Day 444 I was in single parent home headed by the father. Was very poignant for me personally when a character in the film says that kids..""they need the mother."" That they dobut they also don't need to be in a house full of fighting and tension all the time either.I challenge those of us old enough to remember that time to not be transported to who we were and what we felt back then; I challenge those too young to remember to learn about that time as see how years later repercussions still echo in our World today.Job well done by all.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Nutshell Review: Argo,"Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and now, Argo. Ben Affleck scores a hattrick with three acclaimed films that shows off his directing chops, and you'll probably find it tough to find anyone not convinced he makes a better director than in front of the camera as an actor. Producing the film with George Clooney and Grat Heslov, who did the award winning Good Night, and Good Luck, Argo is also based on history (with its fair share of dramatic licence of course) that uniquely combined Hollywood's role during the tumultuous times of the Iran hostage crisis of the late 70s to 80s.With US-Iranian ties probably at one of its lowest points, the historical backdrop of this film provides a reminder of sorts to the escalation of conflict and how the US foreign policy of the time had set the agenda that sowed animosity for decades. It's also very much one sided, given that it's after all a Hollywood film, that provides perspective solely through the eyes of the CIA protagonist Tony Mendez (Affleck playing the role himself), an exfiltration expert, tasked to find the best amongst the worse solutions available in order to save the lives of six US diplomats who were temporarily holding up at the Canadian ambassador's house, with each passing day a day closer to them being found out, and possibly publicly executed.There's the involvement of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber) since their cover identities happen to be Canadian, revolving around a film crew who are in Iran to scout for locations for the titular science fiction space adventure, not to mention real fake passports obtained, and the provision of lodging for weeks of confinement and safe haven. And things aren't put in any positive light as well on the Iranian side, with the checkpoints along the way falling down like bowling pins without too much of a fuss or fight, and being none too smart in the way the treatment allowed for the inevitable outcome.Like his previous film, Affleck crafts Argo with heist film tendencies, setting up the situation, the game play, followed by its execution, only for surprises to be kept to a minimum, but still having paced this with tension so high, you'll find yourself at the edge of your seat as the plan moved along at breakneck speed. Based on declassified material, some elements had literary liberty taken to spice up the plot, so it worked purely on the entertainment front, and not a substitute for a proper history lesson, which I suppose after this there should be a lot more interest in the Jimmy Carter administration's handling of the matters highlighted here. The inner workings, politicking and bureaucracy in various agencies from the CIA to the White House also gets its fair share of the spotlightAnd let's not forget the more fun moments of the film where Tony Mendez had to act like a big shot in Hollywood, in setting up the bluff with special effects/costumer John Chambers (John Goodman) and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) in making their pre-production efforts believable in order to lend credibility to Tony's cover when he moves into ground zero and provide the necessary training for his principals to memorize, with the usual spanner thrown in the works that come from within the group, and from external forces so that this is no walk in the park. Spy versus spy movies are always full of sexier moments, but this one pared these down to be closer to reality, where operations boil down to meticulous preparation, good old fashioned hard work, politics and to buckle down and be ready for any last minute emergencies that may come your way.Technically, this film grabbed me right from the start when the old 70s version of the Warner logo came up, together with great attention to detail paid in recreating production sets, wardrobe and even had its film quality made to resemble something coming out of the era, relying also on archived footage to lend that documentary feel to the retelling of the Canadian Caper, as it is known. The purposeful casting and makeup also made the supporting cast look uncannily similar to the persons they're portraying, adding a degree of realism as well. Production values remain top notch throughout, with an unobtrusive score provided by Alexandre Desplat, that lent a hand in accentuating the many moments in the final third of the film when the action for this high risk mission kicked into high gear.I guess everyone everywhere just can't resist the allure of Hollywood, so it makes it easy to pull wool over one's eye. The production of Saint Jack during its time to snook the authorities here is testament to it, though here it had a greater degree of danger attached, and through Ben Affleck's steady directorial hand, makes this one of the best films this year to sit through. A definite recommendation!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Funny how it's always about oil,"An excellent film, with more tension than the Golden Gate Bridge ;) The tone was set early on with the historical context, showing how the west created the circumstances that led to the Revolution in the first place, by installing the Shah and then supporting him irrespective of the human rights violations in his country (of which he claimed no knowledge, as the film shows). The filming of the protects and siege of the embassy were very realistic - at some points I thought they were using original footage.Being of an age where I remember the events quite vividly, knowing Iranians with family back in Iran and Brits working there at the time, the film brought all that back to life for me. I didn't need the events around the actual escape spiced up (as Affleck has admitted) as the tension was already there. Just having the housemaid quizzed at the gate showed the tension and menace graphically enough for me. The scene in the spice market showed the chaotic mayhem that existed at that time in the country - no one was really in charge, anyone could take it upon themselves to exercise a bit of revolutionary action of their own.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get a true feeling about what such an event is like, including the psychological impact on those involved. One wonders about the Revolutionary Guards who slipped up that day - did they make it or was an example made of them? It shows that whenever you have an upheaval in a country - just as in the more recent Arab Spring events - the outcomes are very uncertain and the forces unleashed are almost uncontrollable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A good political thriller - there are not too many of them,"The fact that it is based on a true story gives additional value to the plot - regardless of authenticity claims or wishes. As the embassies are usually the places where even the fiercest enemies dare not to attack because their grounds are considered territories of respective countries and unauthorized entry is equal to declaration of war. But this hostile takeover really took place in Tehran in 1979 and only more severe events in Afghanistan prevented this conflict from emerging into a real war.Ben Affleck has done a great job in creating true background and atmosphere, giftedly combining documentary and feature film frames. Tensions and race with time are maintained throughout the movie, characters are realistic and human, not self-destructing persons full of pathos as we see in many similar US movies. All the cast is good, but the finest roles are performed by John Goodman and Alan Arkin who - not being state officials - are more relaxed and witty.Recommendable to those fond of historical thrillers.

Well...this is Hollywood...Based on actual events that ...never happened.,"If you are aware about the Iran hostage crisis (1979–1981) and you want to have some insight about the famous rescue of the six U.S. diplomats from Tehran also known as the ""Canadian Caper""...well...just don't watch this movie!!!Supposedly based on the actual events of that mission, this movie is as fictional as could possibly be. So many inaccuracies and exaggerations, not to mention the casting of Ben Affleck as the of -Mexican-descent Tony Mendez.All the drama, all the tense and scary situations...well...never really happened!!!So, is this a problem? Well, no. It didn't bother me until after the end of the movie where the producers decided to present them as such. So many movies are stating ""Based on actual events but the names have been changed""...well...this is a movie that the names are kept intact and the events were heavily distorted for dramatic purposes.But that's the magic of Hollywood. The exaggeration. The building of climax. The fun. And this movie succeeds in all of those.The acting is good. As far as I know everyone liked Alan Arkin's performance in particular. The suspenseful scenes are efficient, especially for people from N. America or Europe who are somehow scared of the Middle East...and there lots of angry Muslims in this movie.Overall: The movie won Oscars and it was a commercial success. For me I would give it a 7/10 in terms of entertainment. Yet, I cannot endorse the exploitation of the actual events. In the end this movie is as fictitious as Rambo was for the Vietnam war. Otherwise it is fun, and check it out...",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Well Crafted but Lacking,"Argo is the third film in which Ben Afflect director and it won the 2013 Best Pictur at the Academy Awards. Having known of the film's success and critical praise, I was interested in finally watching. Argo is a Political Biography drama centered towards real live events. Argo opens with a breathless re-creation of the November 4, 1979, storming of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, in which 52 Americans were taken hostage by revolutionary forces. Everyone knows what happened to them over the following 444 days.Ben Affleck stars as Tony Mendez, the real-life CIA operative and ex- filtration specialist who concocted the improbable solution. His idea was to fly into Iran by himself and fly out with the six refugees posing as a Canadian film crew scouting Middle Eastern locations for a low- budget Star Wars rip-off called Argo. The plot is relatively simple but it is how the film is executed which is what is entertaining. Argo doesn't hold back and we see the raw glimpses of the real world, the directing is top notch along with the acting from the cast.Argo is a mix of political thriller and Hollywood satire. Maybe I was expecting more but Argo somewhat tends to drag along the way as it took me out of the overall enjoyment. It is very well done in its technical aspects but I wasn't too intrigued with the story. The film isn't too long as it feels appropriate. Argo is a specific film for a certain audience, and not everyone will enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Die Hard ending takes the edge of the ""docu-drama""","The tension throughout ARGO is extremely close to excruciating. The scenes of fanatical mobs on the streets of Tehran (Istanbul stands in very believably) are seriously scary. A shot of a man hanged from a crane reminds us of the fate that would have awaited the six escapees hiding in the Canadian residency - and their 52 embassy colleagues who were held hostage for a year and a half. The Washington scenes have the frenetic bustle and urgency of TV's WEST WING.The drama goes slightly over-the-top in the final scenes at Tehran airport, with some DIE HARD moments that threaten to undermine the story's credibility. Overall though, with excellent performances, a taut script, and direction (by Affleck) that gives the flavour of a documentary, this is a nail-biter of a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Fake but entertaining,"You know, Ben Affleck is a pretty good director. Remember the meme about how Matt Damon probably only wrote Good Will Hunting and Affleck just put his name on it? Over the years, it seems increasingly like it might be the reverse. That being said, while Argo is a tense, often exciting film, it also has hallmarks of Hollywoodization to up the tension in ways that betray its efforts to act like its playing things straight, taking what could have been a lower key and effective thriller into one that just feels a little too manufactured to be believable.With the fall of the Shah and the rise of Khomeini in Iran, anti-American feelings are rampant to the point of rioting and the mob running over the defenses of the American consulate in Tehran and taking dozens of people hostage, six getting out a back way and finding shelter at the home of the Canadian ambassador (Victor Garber). Word gets back to the American government, and the State Department wants to take charge of the rescue of the six, bringing in the CIA in to the planning session to get their signoff. The CIA is represented by the deputy director Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) who brings in his best extraction man, Tony Mendez (Affleck), who explains that their plan for a 500 mile bike trip out of Iran is ludicrous, eventually coming up with the idea of using a Hollywood movie production as cover for the six to get them out.One of my issues with the film is the tonal whiplash that Affleck doesn't manage all that well between these Hollywood scenes, which are colorful and satiric, with the more grounded look of six people hiding in a house in the middle of a revolution that wants them found and hanging by the necks from construction cranes. Affleck tries to smooth the transitions, in particular in a scene where John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) arrange a media event where a cast, decked out in crazy costumes, reads the script for their fake movie, the eponymous Argo, while a woman in a hijab talks about how they're going to murder all the Americans and the Great Satan. It's a weird contrast that I don't think Affleck handles all that well.After that, the film enters more of a purely thriller territory, and the action as Affleck gets into Iran through a commercial flight, negotiates official Iranian government channels with his front as a Canadian film producer meeting culture ministers and then meeting the six and convincing them to follow his cover story. Where this film works best is right in here because it feels the most real. There are serious concerns from some of the six, most notably Joe Stafford (Scoot McNairy) about the plan in general, but they have no real choices and start the process, stepping outside the ambassador's house for the first time in two months. This stuff is tense and elevated in realistic ways where they walk into crowds that feel like they could always just break out into violence because, despite their cover stories, the seven white faces don't belong.The actual escape ends up feeling so elevated, though, that it removes the action from the real of reality. It's a long series of little things that could go wrong, almost go wrong, and then turn out okay with a chase down the tarmac that feels cartoonish to end it all. I wouldn't call it ineffective, but it feels more like something from a Bond or Bourne film than this kind of realistic portrait of a real spy operation.So, it overall ends up an entertaining jaunt. Affleck is able to capture what seems to be the physical reality of Tehran in a terrible moment, Hollywood in the late 70s, and the bowels of the CIA (which he apparently got access to film in because the CIA needed a cultural win, gosh darn it). The tense moments all work at different levels (the opening sequence probably the best bit of the whole thing), though its diffuse approach to character (there are a lot) prevents a really solid grounding in one in particular, especially since the main character, Mendez, is a man of business without any kind of character arc or emotional involvement. He's a man on a mission, accepting his danger professionally.It's an entertaining look at a hidden slice of history in an interesting time. It's well handled by Affleck, well-performed by everyone, and looks good. It just betrays its realistic milieu by amping things up beyond the reasonable which, I think, holds it back a bit. Still, it's a good time at the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Another Affleck Masterpiece...,"It's not a surprise to once again see Ben shine through his directing, acting and in his producing give his audience such attention to detail. Ben gives a performance of a lifetime in Argo, and he definitely is the best actor to see in the film.Ben's attention to detail and his casting director have made this film incredibly accurate. Despite the fact that portions of the film are dramatized for entertainment purposes, I find the film not only informative but brutally full of suspense. I say brutally because some points I was holding my girlfriend's hand very tight and I had white knuckles out of fear for what might happen to these characters.The film plays out a story about six American diplomats trapped in Tehran, and in hiding for 444 days. The U.S. comes up with plans to get them out, but Tony (Ben Affleck) doesn't have good feelings about any of them. Finally, he's inspired to pretend to make a Canadian movie in Tehran to get them out under the guise of them being film crew.I understand that there some inaccuracies and it's to be expected but I still stand by saying that it's a highly accurate film. Many films out there based on or inspired by true stories take liberty and dramatize things for entertainment purposes.I enjoyed the acting from everyone in the movie, not just Ben. But all of the American diplomats had great development and some scenes with them seemed genuine and not even as if they were acting. I really enjoyed both Goodman and Arkin, and they give a lot of star power with their acting. I wasn't surprised that Bryan Cranston had involvement but I was wondering why he wasn't offered a bigger role since he can definitely handle himself.Most of the time period stuff seems on par, and all the history seems to be top notch. I really enjoyed the flakes of comedy that showed here and there throughout the film such as the one-line catch phrase said by Ben, Alan and John.Met with so much drama, inspiration to many, and topping it off with strong suspense, Argo is a film that is a memorable one to be viewed for a long time because it's an instant classic. Argo depicts many people of different nationalities as saviors, and heroic. That's something everyone can enjoy while watching this movie.Argo is one of those films from 2012 that should be on everyone's ""do not miss it in theaters"" list. It's truly one of the top movies of the year and certainly one of the best in that last few years. I'd go as far to say that objectively, this is Ben's best work acting and directing wise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"'If I'm going to make a fake movie, it's going to be a fake hit'","Alright, so 'Argo' may arguably be a bit propagandist. It's not easy making a politically themed film without taking sides. However, 'Argo' does attempt to stay true to the facts and historically accurate (even though a little dramatized). That aside, it's a highly entertaining film. Of course we know what will happen in the end but Affleck and his actors/co-stars succeed in creating tension and maintain an element of suspense.However, what I liked most about 'Argo' is the humour. The timing is superb as it never feels out of place. Alan Arkin and John Goodman are terrific. Their scenes, including those with Affleck, are among the highlights of this film. Together, they deliver some of the best lines. Other actors, Bryan Cranston, Kyle Chandler, Clea DuVall, Scoot McNairy, Chris Messina, Victor Garber and Kerry Bishé are very effective.It's quite a decently shot film. Sound designing is pretty good. The 'Iranian landscape' is exotic enough. Editing is first rate.Affleck has come a long way. After being written off as an actor once he reached the peak of his stardom, he's maintained a low profile, allowing his work to do the speaking and it's spoken well for him so far. He's grown as an actor (as is evident in 'Hollywoodland', 'State of Play', 'Extract', 'The Town') and 'Argo' shows that he continues to grow as a director.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Repetitive characters,"I felt like they wrote all of the characters in this movie as pretty much the same person, and personally that person annoys me a lot, I would like to leave a worse review, but I couldn't get through the whole movie and I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. I should also mention this isnt only my experience, me and a few friends were watching this movie, but about half way through we all decided to give it up.

"What's the title mean? Ar, go watch it now!","After a few minutes of setting the context(for us Westerners who might have forgotten or repressed it... this is very honest about the US' role in these things, even the negative; it does also make them out to be the main solution ultimately, but in ways, this is a Hollywood picture... a great, smart, entertaining one), we see the events leading to the hostage crisis, and six Americans get out of the backdoor, unseen, hiding in the house of the Canadian ambassador, though they still need further help... and when Jack Bristow calls for backup, you know things have gotten serious. This never for a second lets us forget the fury(this is tense from start to finish(and all from human beings, with next to no guns or chases - instead, methodically setting up and gradually escalating conflicts, you can follow it all never wondering how something suddenly happened), getting extremely close to being overpowering yet never crossing that boundary... in particular the claustrophobic scenes are unforgettable) of the Iranians(who are people, with faces, with tragic stories... we understand and sympathize with them, and there is basically no villain, nor a wholly wrong side), cutting between them, the codenamed Houseguests, and the CIA who frantically try to come up with a cover for sneaking them out - including exfiltration expert Tony Mendez(Affleck, too pretty to portray a damaged spy... alcoholic? Heavy smoker? Come on... sure, he's got a beard that makes him look like Garner had him sleep on the couch for a week, but still; in spite of this, he is otherwise convincing), who comes up with the idea of a fake movie(which becomes a big deal, making the point of how the medium captures our attention and inspires our imagination, a running theme). This leads to jokes about the business(done better than many other times) with Goodman as a make-up FX guru and Arkin as an eccentric producer. And with the intelligence agents, particularly our lead(who continues to be incredibly impressive as a director) and Jack O'Donnell(Cranston, determined), there is some black comedy, to relieve the pressure of knowing you might be dead tomorrow... it's funny(as two thirds of the material in this is, without detracting from it being nailbiting, rather, the two complement each other), and credible, as the entire thing is(until the contrived climax). The production design makes you believe it's the late 70's, with the huge glasses and porn moustaches. Every character has motivations that make sense, feel real, and the ones we don't spend much time with are effectively developed with the dialog and screen time they do get. The acting is great from all(the one complaint one could make is that there is no standout, no Jeremy Renner), and the cast is phenomenal(some of them getting far too little to do, like Philip Baker Hall!). There is a lot of disturbing, often violent(not bloody) content, a moderate amount of strong language, and brief female nudity(topless and from behind) in this.

"Hollywoodian, as expected, and nothing else!","Hollywood is really skilled in taking a line and wrap it in a bundle of exaggerations, lies and distorted images to the point to direct the spectator to forget the main story. I don't really know whether the story of the film is on exact reality of those years or is a mere adaptation. It is a custom in Hollywood films that are made about Korean, Iraqis, Iranians etc. to show them semi-barbarian people with deformed ugly faces and childish sinister characters. This cliché is always used to conceal truth. For example, as far as I remember, this was the story of the American female soldier who was wounded in action and was arrested by the Iraqi citizens who kindly hospitalized the girl but Hollywood later made a film showing how heroic American commandos rescued the poor injured girl from detention of Iraqis! The film tries to fairly brief Iranian contemporary history, national government of Mosadeq who was toppled down by a US-backed coup and the tyrannical regime of Shah, but when it begins the story you are suddenly plunged into untrue scenes. Though today, after three decades, almost all Iranians, even those students who stormed and captured the US embassy, reject this measure as a breach of diplomatic norms and international regulations but on those days, just coming out of a brutal US-backed regime, almost all political forces who played a role in the social life - including nationalists, socialists, democratic forces, students etc. - supported the move as an attempt to show disagreement with US policies in Iran and the Middle East. The people who gathered in front of the embassy were not only thugs and ruffians but university students and middle class members who favored modernism, independence and freedom. In fact, the hostage taking happened in a revolutionary era where no political force had monopolized power. There was a challenge between progressive and reactionary forces. Therefore, portraying Iran as a country of ""big brother"" in those months is absolutely unrealistic. The more ridiculous was the scene of hanging a man from a crane that was too queer to be believed. Such hangings were practiced when the new power stabilized itself and this had not yet happened in 1980. In those months, Iranian society was a vivid and interesting scene of debate on every issue including hostage taking. Everyday, in public places, in universities, in city squares, people freely gathered to discuss politics, and this is far from the pictures you see in Argo. The film is full of errors concerning names, pictures, customs etc. For example, IRGC members have uniforms like Cuban soldiers and even have long hairs that remind us of Camilo Cienfuegos and Che Guevara rather than IRGC members who never wear long hair! In Tehran Airport, a big picture of Ayatollah Shariatmadari was mounted while Shariatmadari, a moderate cleric, had parted his way from extremists from the beginning and was almost hated by them. The emblem of the Iranian airline and airport is a comic combination of Iranian lion and sward (used as national emblem before the revolution) and a mythical motif ""Homa"". Airport personnel mostly resembled servants of Imam Reza shrines who are responsible for cleaning the shrine and its yard rather than airport staff. Many other errors and guffs are seen and listing them is beyond the scope of s short note. At any rate, this was a Hollywoodian film, another sign that American mainstream always fails to grasp the true essence of events and phenomena.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Not worthy of an Oscar.,"From the neutrals point of view this movie is average American suspense investigation thriller, I mean yes that is how good it is an average movie, for its direction and production and actors and their roles, an average movie, what makes this movie worse that it fails to develop characters and so we end up emotionally detached from the movie characters, there is nothing splendid about any roles,from the American patriots perspective, it is great since the hero rises when needed to pull of a fairly good stunt by deception with the aid of friendly Ally Canada, so in patriotic terms to see your country pulling off a here it is always delight to watch, and it doesn't matter how the actors did or how good the quality of movie is, so overlooking those aspects of movie, an American citizen loves it.From the Iranian perspective. The movie will be bitter taste in the mouth becoz, every Irani fella won't want it's security breached and nation losing the captives at a very crucial time in the revolution, which in fact didn't have much impact on the total development of Iranian revolution. but still this movie is made to remind them that American people can be clever..So to sum it up the movie still is overrated leave the event in history aside, leave patriotism aside and see how much you feel for characters from the perspective of a neutral, I am sorry but I have a feeling I didn't find any such development of characters to give this movie a rating of 8, I give it 6 for not including any bizarre moments...",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"tense, gripping and full of realism","I didn't know much about the Iranian hostage situation, and thought that this film was going to be about how the hostages in the embassy were rescued, but it turns out that this is about six hostages that escaped and were holed up in the house of the Candadian Ambassador. Ben Affleck plays the CIA hostage retriever/negotiator sent to Iran to bring them back under the tenuous guise of a sci-fi film crew.I'm not a huge Affleck fan, or should I say I wasn't. In this - where he acts, produces and directs, he was brilliant. If he doesn't get at least an Academy nod for direction I'll be very surprised. The direction was tight, close and everything was done to increase the suspense and the tension. The whole style of the film was of the period (late 70s), with muted colours and even film logos were of the time, which was a clever touch, and wardrobe was great. It looked just like an old film! For a tense premise, there was some humorous moments and the audience reacted, which is always a good sign. Goodman and Arkin were so fun to watch, and Cranston had some hilarious lines - but he's an incredible actor in anything. Part of the tenseness of the film was - for me - that it was all so real. There were no SFX to speak of, everything was closely filmed and intimate; you were right there in the action.The downside of this film is that it is very flag-waving American, and damning of the Islamic Community. Yes, this is true story and yes the Iranians did do all this but, and it's a big but, in the film's favour, it did narrate at the start how it all came about and that didn't put America in a good light. It was presented factually and whilst not in an unbiased way, obviously you are 'cheering' for the USA/Canada, and it was fairly balanced.In the end credits - stay for them - the characters (the actors) are shown next to their real life inspirations. The only one that is not freakily similar is Affleck himself. As well as staying for the end credits, keep an eye out for a giggly extra in the car in the crowd scene. LOL!

The tricks are all there, the artificial tension moments, the eye tearing speeches and scenes, the brave people, the evil henchmen, etc.Ben Affleck received an award for this film, but I can't really see any reason why other than Americans really liking their own stories and rewarding people for telling them. The acting was OK, but nothing spectacular. Actually, there was no role in the film that felt particularly demanding. The ""dramatization"" of the story was so cliché that I felt like barfing and it all took two hours. Worst of all, all the good scenes were in the trailer already.Bottom line: this is an average film, made with leftovers from different TV shows and running on a recipe for this kind of movies. That isn't all bad, since we have enjoyed some of its kind before, but for an avid movie goer like myself, I've seen too many clones of the same thing and this brought nothing new.

"Exciting, enthralling,funny and engaging film with solid performances and awesome picture.","They say 3rd time's a charm, and in this is certainly the case with Argo, Ben Afflecks 3rd directorial feature.Argo is based on the true story of the 1980 joint CIA-Canadian secret operation to extract six Amercans diplomats from revolutionary Iran. Of course this is a one sided story depicting American heroism however it gives more scope than most of this sub genre.The blown up film effect used by Affleck to achieve a natural graininess to the picture made for a truly rich perspective.The performance from Affleck was decent, but it was the supporting cast that really brought the story to life particularly Bryan Cranston, John Goodman and Alan Arkin who was both a presence and hilarious. His thick accent lifts his dialogue to heights which reminds you why you watch movies. Also worth noting were efforts by the relatively unknown actor Scoot McNairy who played Joe Stafford and reminded me of Johnny Depp I could definitely see him climbing the ladder quickly. I wanted to see more of Bryan Cranston as that man brings so much intensity to a scene and it was also a shame not to have included the directors brother Casey Affleck in this film however all in all while some scenes tenacity may have been stunted the mounting tension pushed the plot to an almost melting point and had me on the edge of my seat gripped with empathy.The tension could be carved in half with a knife.In short Argo is exciting, enthralling and engaging film with some solid performances and awesome picture the grittiness of the dialogue and grainy footage truly encapsulated an overall wholesome authenticity,this is one that is definitely worth seeing in the cinemas.If you liked Steven Spielberg's Munich go see Argo.

"It's Supposed to Be Real Events, But Still Unbelievable!","When I saw the trailer of ""Argo,"" I already felt like the whole story was already shown. I did not feel like I wanted to watch it. The story of rescuing hostages in Iran by pretending they were shooting a movie is simply unbelievable. The star and director was one of my least favorite Hollywood actors, Ben Affleck. However, curiosity still got the better of me when nothing but stellar reviews came out when it was shown. There was even talk of Oscar nominations! This I had to see.Ben Affleck plays Tony Mendez who came up with this wild idea. He plays it smartly low key in the whole movie. But in that key scene where he announces his idea in the first place, I still feel that Ben was deficient as the lead actor. I would not have been sold the way he delivered the critical line about his suggestion to film a fake movie. It is great though that the rest of the supporting cast succeeded very well in their respective roles. Alan Arkin and John Goodman were very funny as the Hollywood people who help Ben hatch the fake absurd sci-fi project which they dubbed ""Argo.""The story is still as unbelievable as I thought. The whole scheme felt so shallow and lame, something only a B-movie producer would greenlight. We are talking about rescuing Americans trapped in Iran in the 70s under the Ayatollah Khoemeini here, and all they can come with was something as ridiculous and far-fetched as this one. But I guess what they say is true, that truth is stranger than fiction.Fortunately, Ben Affleck the director was able to sell the whole movie to us in a very tight, tense and assured way. The climactic sequence of the escape proper was done in a rather clichéd Hollywood-y manner, but you can't help but hang on to the edge of your seats. The film editing, the very late 70s style cinematography, the realistic set and costume design all contribute to the success of story telling.This is a very good suspense thriller yes, but to call it the next Oscar Best Picture I think is over reaching a bit. Like ""The Town"" before this, Ben Affleck has improved as a director, but the Oscar for Best Director for ""Argo"" may also be too much of an ambition. Nominations for both categories though are real possibilities, but are more certain in the Supporting Actor and the technical categories.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Unreal Suspense,"Knew nothing about this film going into it but was absolutely reeled in from the get go by its great and thrilling story.

You're gonna need a script.,"Argo is directed by and starring Ben Affleck and is based on the formerly classified mission in which the CIA and the Canadians helped 6 American embassy workers escape from Iran. The film is filled with great, old-school actors like John Goodman and Alan Arkin.The film itself is good. It is very enjoyable, which is to be expected from this genre of film. There wasn't one weak link in the whole cast if I'm honest. Not that they were great, but they were not all that bad either. The film, at first, grabs our attention and makes us what to know what will happen. However, the characters aren't so well written that we really care all that much. The only characters which I found the most interesting were John Goodman's character John Chambers and Alan Arkin's character Lester Siegel, who aren't in any danger throughout the film.The film then begins to center on Ben Affleck's character, Tony Mendez, and I don't personally believe he brings enough to him to make us care about his wife and child and also his desperate attempt to get the six men and woman out. Towards the end, the film started to drag out a tad bit, they were delaying the inevitable. And I found the whole last 20 minutes to be quite unnecessary and over the top, which didn't suit the tone of the whole film if I'm honest.The film is enjoyable and contains decent acting.

"Good And Very Suspenseful, But A Bit Lacking In Accuracy","I appreciated that I did learn from this movie a lot of background to what is probably better known - here in Canada - as the Canadian Caper. ""Argo"" is a depiction of the escape from Iran of 6 Americans who managed to avoid the hostage taking at the US Embassy in 1979 and made their way to shelter in the Canadian Embassy, later to be spirited out of the country posing as Canadians. Although I knew this event had happened, and I knew that there was substantial involvement by the CIA which went largely unacknowledged at the time, thus somewhat boosting Canada's role, I wasn't aware of the rather amusing backstory that was used by the CIA to pull off the operation - sending in an operative (Ben Affleck) posing as a Canadian movie maker looking for a shooting location, and setting up an entire movie production company to give credence to the story. I appreciated that background. And I give credit to the movie for being extremely suspenseful - especially in the last scenes at the Tehran Airport, as the Americans try to leave the country on a commercial flight while not blowing their cover as Canadians when being questioned by Iranian authorities. That was truly heart-pounding stuff. Unfortunately, it's also where the movie loses points with me: that was totally made up for dramatic purposes. The group actually sailed easily through the Tehran Airport without raising any suspicions, the plane was not chased down the airport runway by police. That was all made up. To me, that was an unfortunate way to end what had been a pretty good and accurate movie.It's true that while the Canadian involvement in the plot was deliberately overplayed at the time, the movie underplays the Canadian involvement. Basically, ""Argo"" portrays the Canadian Embassy as little more than a motel for the 6 Americans, with Ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber) being a friendly innkeeper. There was more to Canada's involvement than that - the curious decision to have the US Government debating right up to the end whether to pay for the group's plane tickets being rather silly, for example, given that the tickets had already been purchased - by the Canadian government. (And, by the way, since the events happen in early 1980, the correct answer to the question ""who are the last three prime ministers of Canada?"" isn't ""Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker,"" it's ""Clark, Trudeau and Pearson"" - Joe Clark was Prime Minister when this happened.)So, for heart-pounding drama, this is a very fine movie and it's worth watching for the look at the details involved in setting up the movie cover story. It just loses a little bit for some of the dramatic licence taken. (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

To the Americans he said: ""I hope it gets the academy award for best picture. I think it deserves it. The other thing that I would like to say was that 90 percent of the contributions to the ideas, and the consummation of the plan was Canadian.

A gripping blend of history and Hollywood spectacle,"Argo, directed by Ben Affleck, is a masterfully constructed thriller that seamlessly blends historical events with the absurdities of Hollywood. Set during the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis, the film follows a daring CIA operation to rescue six Americans hiding at the Canadian ambassador's residence in Tehran, disguised as a film crew scouting for a science fiction movie.Ben Affleck delivers a restrained yet compelling performance as Tony Mendez, the CIA operative who spearheads the operation. Bryan Cranston, John Goodman, and Alan Arkin provide stellar support, infusing the tension-filled narrative with moments of levity and humanity. Arkin, in particular, shines as a jaded Hollywood producer, delivering some of the film's most memorable lines.The screenplay by Chris Terrio is sharp and focused, skillfully balancing the high stakes of the hostage crisis with the satirical elements of the faux film production. The contrast between the chaotic streets of Tehran and the glitz of Hollywood adds a unique layer to the storytelling, highlighting the surreal nature of the operation.Affleck's direction keeps the tension high throughout, with taut pacing and meticulous attention to detail. The film's climax is a masterclass in suspense, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats even if they know the outcome. Alexandre Desplat's score further enhances the intensity, subtly underscoring the film's emotional beats.Argo is not without its criticisms-some have pointed out its oversimplification of historical events and underrepresentation of the Canadian effort. However, as a piece of cinematic storytelling, it excels in delivering a gripping and entertaining experience.Rating: 8/10 - A taut, well-executed thriller that masterfully combines historical drama with Hollywood satire.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Solid if expected,"There's been a lot of big buzz surrounding this movie that it's hard not too be a little disappointed. Let's just say this Ben Affleck is a great director and he always makes solid, interesting films but he has yet to make another film that excels that region into masterpiece territory. Argo although ambitious in it's storytelling and premise is sadly not that film. The film based on a true story focuses on a CIA agent that concocts a plan to free 6 American Hostages from Iran by posing them as members of a film crew. The scenes in Iran are suspenseful and the ones in Hollywood are pretty funny. Performance wise in my opinion Alan Arkin seems to steal the show as a big time Hollywood mogul and Bryan Cranston fleshes out his supporting role nicely. As for the others although it's nice to see Clea Duvall, Rory Cochrane and John Goodman amongst others on screen they aren't really given a lot to do. The Hostages in general are a bit underdeveloped and the film could have even been more suspenseful had a been a bit more engaged by him. As for Ben Affleck doing double duty he's a great director but still not the best actor. Although his skills have improved he would do better to let someone else take the leads in his films with a little more presence. All in all it's a solid film with very interesting subject matter told well if a little bit expected. And another notch in the actor/directors belt after two solid films he adds a third, at this point I'd definitely see anything he directs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"A consistent work by Ben Affleck as a director, divided harmoniously in three very distinct moments: ddrama, humor and thriller","This is a plot that could easily be turned into a vainglorious platform for US superiority. But Affleck's courage and assured historical detachment allow the filmmaker to tell this plot without fear of putting the proverbial finger on the wound. Right in the introduction of the tape, we are shown, through storyboards, how the disastrous American interventions in Iran led to the political pandemonium that allowed the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini to power in that country. This whole situation is shown realistically by the film, something even highlighted by the production by including photos of the events and real characters of this story in its closing credits. In addition, Affleck makes use of real images during the narrative itself, flawlessly integrated into the unfolding of the plot. The verisimilitude is such that we even find it a little strange when more scenographic elements appear on the scene, such as the shot that shows the central square of the Iranian capital, where special effects complement the landscape. Just the invasion scene alone is worthy of applause, shown by the director in a crescendo of incredible tension.Making an effort to avoid a boastful posture so common in productions of this type (remember the repulsive Black Hawk Down), the film contextualizes the invasion of the embassy by explaining the fundamental role played by the United States in the downfall of President Mohammad Mosaddeq and his replacement by the sadistic Shah Reza Pahlevi, who arrested and tortured dissidents and brought the country to misery while snubbing its opulence - and the script goes so far as to exaggerate by bringing CIA officials making an improbable self-criticism regarding actions in Iran. From there, the film jumps from Tehran to Los Angeles with fluidity as it follows the preparations of the protagonist, who is still forced to face not only infighting within his own agency, but also the unforgiving nature of Hollywood.In this sense, we have the urgency and tension of the sequences in Iran, which deal with the doubts and fears of the fugitives; on the other, the lightness and jokes involving the passages in Los Angeles (a difference highlighted by the good photography by Rodrigo Prieto, which oscillates between the desaturated and cold palette of Tehran and the warm and intense colors of California). Incidentally, it is admirable to observe the confidence with which Ben Affleck conducts the narrative, continuing to solidify himself as an exceptionally talented director while expanding his universe, which until then was limited to stories set in his native Boston. On the other hand, it is inevitable that the feature will lose some of its dramatic weight due to the humor present in the scenes in Hollywood, which is a pity.Ben Affleck, at his best as an actor and increasingly confident and mature as a director, took on the responsibility of telling this true story, but not without also taking the opportunity to criticize and lightly mock the very industry he makes it so clear to admire (the scene of the producers under the water tank at Warner Bros. Is proof of this, as the Hollywood icon appears as if it were a flag in the background, a slap from the studio on its own back). There's humor tapping into the industry's fads - which, again, highlights the system's lies and dissimulation - but it's in building tension that Affleck proves himself once again capable as a director. Every moment when it looks like the film is going to get too comical, we are reminded next of the urgency of the situation.Affleck makes a welcome retro film, not just because it takes place between 1979 and 1980, but because he uses editing and photography techniques typical of that era. No more frantic cuts and fancy actions. Everything is done calmly, slowly building the tension that, in its final minutes, will eat the nails of many viewers. Rodrigo Pietro's photography (""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Babel"") fits precisely into the spirit of the time, greatly helped by filters that serve to merge the real archive scenes with those of the film, in addition to coloring the image of beige and brown tones, in perfect harmony with the 1970s classics. The art direction by Peter Borck (renewing the partnership with Afleck, started in ""Dangerous Attraction"") and Deniz Göktürk and the costumes by Jacqueline West (""The Tree of Life"") are also worth mentioning for their precision in portraying both the West and the Middle East.The tape montage stands out not only for the incredible pace given to the narrative and for managing to balance all the different cores in a cohesive story, but also for its sensitivity. In one scene in particular, Affleck uses the reading of the script for ""Argo"" to anchor the escalation of the crisis with the hostages in Iran and the growing fear of refugees in the home of the Canadian ambassador, in a brilliant example of editing. Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack completes the dive into the 1970s setting, with the detail that the director knows exactly when to silence it to intensify the tension.With a cohesive cast (and loaded with television figures such as Bryan Cranston, Tate Donovan, Kyle Chandler and Richard Kind, among others) that Affleck efficiently explores, Argo creates an ambitious and complex narrative by dealing with a large number of characters without creating much confusion in the viewer's mind - and it is regrettable, therefore, that some ideas end up being poorly explored, such as the obvious alcoholism of the protagonist or the relationship between the characters of Goodman and Arkin, which seem to only offer comic relief to the film ( something they do admirably well). The chemistry between them, and their most inspired moments, help make us believe in the craziest moments in history, such as convincing the world that a sci-fi blockbuster is in the works.Argo has three very distinct moments. The first, more dramatic, puts the cards on the table and explains the whole situation to unfold. We know about the involvement of the United States with the Iranian black period, commanded by Shah Pahlavi, and how the people of that country suffered under the ruler's yoke, as well as the whole explosion of revolutionaries and the North American response to the situation. This excerpt is almost documentary, didactic in the right measure and manages to correctly transport the viewer to that situation. The second moment is more comical, when Tony Mendez begins to use the help of professionals from the world of cinema to help him in the task of creating a fake film. In these moments, the comic verve of John Goodman shines, as Oscar-winning makeup artist John Chambers, and Alan Arkin, as producer Lester Siegel. The third and final moment is devoted to suspense. We know that Tony Mendez needs to get those six Americans out of hiding, we understand the difficulty of the task and we are on the edge of our chair hoping that everything goes well. Even though we know the end of the story, the atmosphere of suspense printed on the screen by Ben Affleck is so intense that the immersion is complete. Impossible not to be worried about the development of the situation of those six people.A negative point of the feature film is the second plan given to the other hostages - these, yes, living in a deplorable situation and close to death every new day. The six Americans portrayed in the film, even if they were at risk if found, were living comfortably in the Canadian ambassador's house, eating well and living among friends. The other colleagues held captive at the embassy are completely forgotten by the script, which remembers them at the end, with a line about their fate. Obviously, the most curious story - and the reason it became a feature film - is the Hollywood presence in the issue, making everything look stranger than fiction. However, further development of the other half of the situation would come in handy. It would at least be more interesting than the whole parallel story between Tony Mendez and his estranged family.Some probably complain about the film's portrayal of the CIA. In it, we see companionship, normally associated with sordid acts of espionage and manipulation, as something more ideal, romantic. It turns out that the film is not about the CIA, but about the men whose courage and determination allowed such a plan - which is literally ""movie stuff"" - to be carried out. Whether it was successful or not, I won't reveal it to those who don't know the true story. But the simple courage of an American to take a plane ticket and step on Iranian soil during the highest point of the revolution that brought Ayatollah Khomeini to power after the overthrow of Pahlavi and tell lie after lie to remove six compatriots from a situation borderline, already deserves commendation. If there's a sin in the director's work, it's that he didn't know how to end the film at the most surgically appropriate moment, letting it stretch for tenuous scenes that don't add much to the tape and just try to close all the loose ends that could very well have continued. Like this. But it doesn't take anything away from the brilliance of the work. But ""Argo"" is, without a doubt, a consistent work by Ben Affleck as a director, a professional who seems to have found his hidden talent after a few years adrift in Hollywood. A film brave enough not to take all the blame out of the US government's hostage situation (after all, they were the ones who played the Shah for so many years ruling Iran) and correct enough to manage to get through all the anguish and danger those intense years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Overrated and Undeserving,"What is nothing more than a competent Political Thriller has managed to once again tick a lot of people off at the Academy Awards and rightfully so.

Argo review,"I always really enjoy films that are based on true stories. It's always fascinating to watch something on screen that (in some form) happened in the past. It reminds us that epic stories are happening all around us.This film is no exception. As someone in the film industry, its fun to watch Ben Affleck's character manoeuvre through Hollywood to create a film as a cover story for a rescue operation. (Given that its Ben Affleck pretending he knows nothing about the industry always makes me chuckle a little bit)As the film comes to an epic ending, you're truly on the edge of your seat with anxiety and excitement to see what will come of everything. Those who remember the true story will know how it ends, but even so, there's enough suspense to make, even them, anxious.Unfortunately, as many 'based on a true story' films, there are a lot of liberties. Canadians are relegated to nice neighbours who do very little to help, which is far from the truth of what actually happened.

"Good Thriller, but Should Have Been Better","To those of us who remember going to bed each night serenaded by Ted Koppel's voice on ABC's ""Nightline,"" the latest film by Ben Affleck will bring back vivid memories. Yet remarkably, even though we remember how the Iranian Hostage Crisis turned out, the personal stories and occasional acts of heroism behind the daily headlines remain mostly untold and little known.""Argo"" tells the griping story of a secret CIA-led mission to rescue six American hostages who managed to escape the doomed American Embassy on the day it was swarmed by an Iranian mob, which eventually led to a 444-day stalemate for those left behind, trapped in captivity. The six consular workers who managed to slip out a side door, just as the Embassy compound was being stormed, hid away for more than two months. They were housed at great risk inside the Canadian Ambassador's residence, in Tehran.Unfortunately for the hostages, the time clock is ticking. The Canadian Ambassador receives word that his mission is to close, leaving the hidden Americans in a proverbial lifeboat, now suddenly taking on water. This sets into motion one of the oddest alliances ever for a clandestine operation, bringing together intelligence officials working alongside Hollywood insiders who must concoct a phony film as a cover story. The wacky idea is to pretend to make a movie in Iran, and smuggle out the American diplomats. This remarkable tale makes for pleasing caper, which draws in the audience due to being loosely based on actual events.Maybe its having worked in Washington and having served in a couple of foreign embassies, but for me the part of the film that worked best was the dead-on portrayal of bureaucracy and communications to the overall process. This point cannot be overstated.Most movies only focus on action and conflict. But the real challenges to would-be superheros are usually getting people to answer telephones and moving through the maze of lazy bureaucrats. Getting things done is simply not an easy thing, and this film does as good a job as any at showing the intricacies of the diplomatic and intelligence circles. Just as the 1976 classic ""All the President's Men"" showed the grind of digging up the truth within a news organization, in a similar sense, ""Argo"" perfectly captures the day-to-day back and forth tug of war between (sometimes contentious) forces within government.I was also pleased the film did not attempt to gloss over the United States' appalling history of meddling in the internal affairs of Iran, the price for which we are still paying today. Not only did the U.S. assist in the overthrow of the Iranian prime minister back in 1953 (which happened, oddly enough just after he announced intent to nationalize Western oil companies). America also bolstered the Shah's brutal dictatorship with weapons and support for more than three decades, and then provided him sanctuary while Iranians demanded that he be returned to Iran in order to stand trial. One can probably make a case for these difficult diplomatic decisions which were made during the Cold War period. But the point is -- those decisions came at a heavy cost – and I credit the filmmakers for not casting the U.S.-Iran conflict in black and white as so many other films do, when the truth is often hued in shades of gray.This is not to say ""Argo"" is without flaws. I'm not much of a fan of Ben Affleck's work. I saw little in this film that changes that opinion. He's directed a number of horrible movies. So,saying this is his ""best work"" isn't saying much. As an actor, I have even less regard for Affleck's spotty reel of rubbish. Every Affleck portrayal seems to be exactly the same, and his role here as a CIA operative is no different.My final disappointment comes with one segment of the film which was a horribly missed opportunity. Although she appears in only a few scenes, the character portrayed by the Canadian Ambassador's housekeeper is absolutely pivotal to the overall success of the rescue mission. One peep from the housekeeper would have ended everything and probably resulted in executions. That a director with the experience-level of Affleck would not expound more on her role and the heart-wrenching dilemma she faces as a citizen of Iran without any means of escape is a terrible waste.Without spoilers, the Iranian knows the six guests of the Canadian Ambassador are Americans. In one brief scene, she is questioned by a gun-totting investigator and she lies to protect them. Yet we are given absolutely no insight into her motives. That the hostages could (and will) escape and her lie will eventually be exposed puts her in serious danger. We later see a 20-second clip of this woman (which I will not give away) which shows what happens to her, which I found a poor attempt to neatly tie-up what must have been difficult decision for many Iranians who tended to be pro-Western and even friendly with Americans. Alas, this housekeeper was probably the most courageous person in the film, yet we fail to gain any insight into her character or motives.Despite its flaws and some valid criticism about historical accuracy (the Canadians deserve more credit than they are given), this remains a film to see. This political thriller gives the audience a great ride and an emotionally-satisfying experience.www.nolandalla.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
ogrA,I actually really liked this movie. I thought it was going to be boring but it was really exciting. There was a lot of action and at some points it was actually overwhelming. This movie is about six US officials that escaped protesters and were hiding out in the Canadian tailor's house. They were hiding out for many days not sure exactly how many but it was a lot. It was very well filmed and scary. I never knew what was going to happen next. It was hectic and crazy. I loved it. All of them were so very heroic and did what they had to do to get out of Iran. After they got on to the plane the police in Iran started chasing the plane. They almost caught up with the plane but then the plane lifted off. It was still stressful because you never knew what was going to happen next. If you like action movies you will really like this movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Decent film, horrible timing (for anything but the Oscars)","While this is indeed an interesting retelling of a 'truth-larger-than-fiction' event during the Iranian hostage crisis, and while it's OK that it focuses entirely on the American perspective of the task of liberating six escaped embassy staff members, I cannot help but feel uncomfortable about the timing of this film.We're looking at the possibility of yet another war, after all, and the widespread hostility towards Iran as a nation is where the support for this film cunningly taps from. There is an introductory admission that the Iranian Revolution was the direct result of the US reinstatement of the absolutist Shah, who ruled via his suppressive secret police SAVAK. What's not mentioned, however, is that SAVAK was trained by CIA officers under the supervision of Herbert Norman Schwarzkopf, father of Norman Schwarzkopf who commanded Operation Desert Storm. So the rampant displays of Anti-Americanism are, as far as Iran is concerned, not without reason, and one would have wished that, in these sensitive times, the almost documentary style approach Affleck has chosen would consider this; after all, in the case of other countries (such as Chile) it is meanwhile generally accepted that such policies were crimes. SAVAK also has a special history with Germany (my country of residence), for their clashes with leftist protesters on the occasion of the Shah's state visit in 1967 was the starting point of the student revolution of '68, which eventually swept all across Western Europe. This event has been shockingly reconstructed in the first ten minutes of Uli Edel's 'Baader Meinhof Komplex' (2008).To be sure, it's a fascinating story, its pace and perspective are logically focused on the planning of the rescue and the plight of the persons concerned. However, Iranians are reduced to a backdrop of a fanaticized mob, and that must make anyone who's actually been there feel rather queasy. The only sympathetic Iranian character throughout this film is the (briefly shown) crew's guide; when the 'film crew' tours a bazaar there is a hostile altercation with an angry mob over the taking of a photograph; the Canadian ambassador's maid is a traitor... a little more balance or just one scene with dialogue for one of the Iranian characters could have relieved the feeling of this being a propaganda effort, but instead we get a lot of patriotic 'no-one-gets-left-behind' talk, and an unnecessary chase scene which evidently didn't happen.The way it plays, 'Argo' could well be interpreted as a rallying call for yet another war - AKA 'we've got every reason to bomb 'em for humiliating us 32 years ago'. And I was really hoping that Americans have grown tired of this, since it didn't work so well the last ten years. 'Charlie Wilson's War' (about financing Afghanistan's mujahedeen and then letting them slip out of control once the Russians were gone) was a lot more honest.In short, Iran is not the country you might think it is after watching this film, as last year's foreign language Oscar-winning film 'A Separation' perfectly illustrates. What these times need is a documentary effort about the thousands of Iranians living in the US since the Islamic revolution, and what their hopes and fears for the state and future of their country are. Update: now there is one, it's called 'The Iranian Americans', was screened on PBS and is available for free online streaming.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
i really liked this movie,"I think this movie was very enjoyable. I am a big fan of thrillers and movies that are good at or can build tension. Therefore this movie would be right up my alley. I believe that this movie was awesome, but my only issue with it is that some scenes felt very overdone, or like they were trying too hard to make you feel a certain emotion or to try and build suspense. I think sometimes they played up some of the scenarios more than what had happened in real life. Which i understand what they're doing because sometimes you need to be inaccurate for the sake of the movie but I believe that holding accuracy is very important to the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Great Escape,"Suspense thrillers most of the time work for me because the protagonist most of the time are forced to think outside of the box, which is part of why the bad guys lose because they never expect such an unconventional but well thought out move. Ben Afleck is one of my favorite actors and is really on track to becoming one of my favorite directors, out of the films he's made so far this is probably my favorite of his. This film is one of my favorite suspense thriller and what makes it great and all the more suspenseful is the fact it's based on something that actually happened.I really like most of the accuracy of the film, it captured the look and feel of the transitional period of 1979-1980. From fashions, hair styles, cars, some old news clips you name it it's all there. This helped in successfully portraying the situation of civil unrest going on in Iran and the hostage crisis going on. But also most of what happened in the film did happen, in the end credits we see comparison with real life photos and scenes in the film.The characters all are good. I really liked Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez, I love the fact he's not portrayed as some cliché stereotypical straight laced C.I.A. agent but just an ordinary guy that is best at his job of extracting people from nervous situations. You really get a good feel for him, as he is on mission you can tell behind the eyes he struggles to keep cool and is constantly concerned for the six people and if he really can pull this scheme off. I really like the fake movie cover scam Tony cooked up, which I personally felt was a great idea. It was unconventional, creative, plausible, most importantly actually worked. Let alone the fact the fake movie is a sci-fi and I'm a huge fan of that genre which made the scam all the more cooler.Bryan Cranston is great as Jack O Donnell. I like that he's not some cliché blowhole boss which I am personally sick of (honestly they can't be nice) but is actually a boss that is on the main protagonists side and a friend.Alan Arkin as movie producer Lester Siegel and John Goodman as the late great makeup artist John Chambers are both great, they both helped make the scam a reality but I just love the fact both are selfless, their simply taking an opportunity to save lives which I feel is what any good person should do. I even like that there is some humor with them, Alan Arkin's character has some really funny lines like ""If I want to make a fake movie I want it to be a fake hit."" I felt that was kinda funny because he's right, one of the best methods of hiding is to be in plan sight.Even like the six house guests which we don't know deeply but you do get a good feel for them which made them all the more sympathetic. Their all tired, on edge, just want to go home. I even like little moments like one of them has a little monologue where he regrets his dession to stay and should've listened to his wife at that time. That kinda thing I can sort of emphasize with, where in the aftermath of something you think back and realize if you did this or that at that time then you wouldn't be where you are now.However for me what really made the film was in the suspense and story. I wouldn't say it's so much edge of your seat because you already know the ending of the film, but it's nerve racking because you wondering how. The pacing is good, it's not boring, I like some of the technicalities to make the scam work and most importantly you are constantly concerned about Tony and the six as they are going though the motions and taking action. There are some moments that make things nervous and kinda scary, like the security checkpoints they have to go though, driving though angry protesters. But also how there are scenes where we see some organization is slowly but surely putting together to pieces of the shredded mug list, this is sort of the time limit element we know once they complete the mugs of the six missing then they'll catch wind of the scam which is something were constantly hopping won't happen.Overall this is a great film, Argo is an escapist journey.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A good movie to convince the Americans to enter yet another war.,"This motion picture was totally great, I actually enjoyed it a lot. But yet again there is one thing I find quite annoying and it is the fact that every time USA wants to go to war with a country, they surely woudld not mind making a picture to convince people that going to war against isn't really a bad thing. The tension between Iran and USA are coming towards a breaking point, and what could be better than to show to the American people how vile and dangerous the Iranian people really are? Iran isn't like anything the movie was trying to portrait. Yet many would believe in the story as true, and would think of Iranians as crazy religious maniacs who oppress women and enjoy killing and death. Once again there is always an agenda behind movies as such, they maintain a very rare kind of influence that we don't normally think about, but usually just accept because of the environment.I would just advice any of you who are going to watch the movie to have an open mind.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Argo,"Argo is being hailed as one of the best films of the year and has a very good chance of being nominated for many Academy Awards next year and maybe even winning Best Picture. When the film had ended in the theatre in which I saw it, most of the audience applauded, but I did not and to be completely honest, I do not get all the hype and praise that this film is getting. Yes, technically it is a well made film, but to say anything else other than that and then I would be lying. Critics have called it riveting from start to finish, but I actually found the film dragged quite a bit and to me was quite dull. I also didn't think the mix of the scenes of the characters in Hollywood and then jumping to the hostages in Iran worked. It did not work because in these Hollywood scenes they are mostly played for laughs and supposed to be humorous with Alan Arkin's character and his foul mouth and John Goodman's character who is kind of oblivious to the Hollywood scene. This all was supposed to be funny and whether I laughed, or not was not the issue, but I found having a good part of the film being like that and then going over and trying to be all serious and tense with the hostage situation in Iran did not feel suitable. I didn't find the film could find the right balance between the humour in the Hollywood scenes and the more melodramatic and political scenes taking place in Iran. It all felt quite out of place and I didn't feel it complimented, or followed up each scene well because of it. It just felt awkward and like poor screen writing. Another problem I had was that I found a lot of the characters, especially the hostages to be quite smug and arrogant. I really have no idea whether this was intentional on the film's behalf, or not, but I found that they got on my nerves after awhile and because of that I could not relate, or feel any empathy, or compassion towards them which is a big flaw for a film like this because I think the film wanted you to be very concerned about these hostages and by giving them more personality and allowing us to care for them, I think the tension and our relationship and attitudes about them would be a lot different and I think if they had done that, the film would have impacted me more. I know it was my own choice to go see Argo, and pay the almost ten dollars I spent to see it, but I have to admit that these type of stories are just getting tiresome to me. Almost everyday on the news I see terror in the world and different regions against each other and a lot of hatred and violence going around. I watch it on the news to see what is happening in the world and to keep up on current events, but at the same time it does get to me from time to time and sometimes I am flat out tired of seeing all this negativity and hatred towards one another. Because of that, Argo felt to me like a news story I had seen one too many times this, or any other week recently and I just was not in the mood to see a two hour movie about it. That may have been my fault walking into a movie like this, but I have to be honest and say my opinions about it. There were also parts of the film that felt overly glamorous to appeal to a wide audience and a lot of it seemed to be made in such a way that it would cater to people and especially Oscar voters. Oscar voters love films like this and going by the way the audience I was with reacted, they did too. However to me it just felt forced and like it was trying to glamorize everything a little too much for those miniature bald statues. I do commend Ben Affleck for trying to make a serious film and I think he has come a long way in his career and he showed great promise with his last directorial effort The Town, but Argo simply did not work for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Useless Movie.,"I will not engage on the historical fallacies of the movie, in spite of being Canadian. There's enough about that already.In fact, all of this polemics hides the fight that it's a pretty average movie right there. Sure, it was well-directed, well-acted, well-shot etc - you know, Hollywood at its best, but the history had no twist, and the suspense (represented by the apparation of women dressed in black) was minimal. It wasn't stylish and reeked of Islamophobia. In fact, the ""Argo"" movie they used as a pretext looked miles more interesting. Now that's a movie I would want to see.And yes, there's a couple of nice scenes here and there, but this could easily have been a direct-to-TV film - I just don't see what the hype is about.

"An outrageous, but real life plot, very good film.","A complex series of events sees Iranian people storming The US Embassy back in 1979, The CIA agreed a bizarre operation to save six employees.If I wasn't aware that this was based on a true story, I would have said the plot was outrageous, and impossible to believe, but once again truth is stranger than fiction.It's a bonkers storyline, but it's an incredible piece of history, a lesson in international cooperation, international dealings, and only in America could they have used Hollywood to pull off such a daring plan.Such a fun watch, it's a good mix, it has tension, suspense, humour, even the shock factor, some of it is actually quite nail biting.Ben Affleck did a great job on both sides of the camera, the only thing, he looks so thin here, it doesn't suit him.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Overdramatized for the viewer but else well done,"The hostage taking from 1979 in Iran is a current topic but I stumbled upon this movie by accident. It really brought this part of history closer to me, even if some events didn't happen like that and were added for dramaturgical purposes. Also 'Argo' focuses on a small but very interesting part of the hostage taking, so don't expect everything to be covered. In the end when the credits roll, you can see how scaringly close they came visually to the actual events in 1979/80. Actors were perfectly chosen, only Ben Affleck doesn't look like the actual Tony Mendez, but he still fits into the scenery.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Intelligent, nail-biting and darkly comic","Ben Affleck continues to prove himself one of our best, most intelligent 'mainstream' film- makers. In Argo he manages to combine nail-biting suspense created with a minimum of violence or standard movie action, a sharp, dark sense of humor about the weirdness of both espionage and Hollywood, and makes a film about getting American hostages released without giving in to jingoism.Affleck even takes the time at the beginning of the film to put the Iranian revolution into a larger context of American involvement, thus making the Iranians' hostage taking horribly wrong, but also somewhat human and understandable.The story itself is a doozey, and definitely fits into the 'you'd never believe it if it weren't true' mold. Using a fake movie as a cover-up for a long- shot rescue operation sounds like a bad episode of 'Mission Impossible' (or even 'Get Smart'). But here it is, a part of history.I have only two small complaints about the film. First, other than Alan Arkin's and John Goodman's deliciously funny performances as the Hollywood end of the deal, not many of the other characters are given as much texture as they might, especially considering how strong the cast is. Perhaps the fear was slowing down the film with character details, but I would have gladly watched a few minutes more to know these people better on a human level.More problematically there are a number of key moments where the suspense is trumped up needlessly by throwing in some very ""Hollywood"" conceits (coincidences, physical impossibilities, a climax that diverges pretty far from historical accuracy in pursuing 'drama' etc) in a film that didn't need them, a film where the whole point is how real world spy operations are miles from what we usually see in films.Neither of these flaws seriously damage a very, very good film, but I couldn't help some minor disappointment when I felt the film go for the 'movie moment' over truth. But this is still a highly entertaining and intelligent thriller, and that's to be applauded.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Another step in the right direction for Ben Affleck.,"This just a flat out enjoyable film that crackles with suspense, intrigue, intelligence (literally & figuratively) & some very sly humor. It also may be the year's best film.This outrageous tale of hostage rescue would be impossible to believe if it weren't true & that alone makes it a lot of fun to watch. However the fun is weighted down by the seriousness of what is at stake --real lives in real situations. This is first & foremost a very serious film that doesn't ignore the lunacy of its plot. I can't remember a film that had it both ways -- being both very tense & wickedly funny at times-- & gotten away with it like ""Argo"" does.Chris Terrio's script will be studied in film school. Director Affleck has been really good & really really good before (""Gone Baby Gone"" & ""The Town"" were hugely enjoyable), but here takes another big step forward by taking a wild, woolly, huge story & making it look so easy. The movie begins with a lollapalooza hostile takeover of the U.S. embassy in Iran (a great sequence that tops even the action scenes in ""The Town"") then dials that energy down a bit with never losing its tension & momentum. It also pulls off the trick that ""Apollo 13"" did by keeping us on edge with a story whose outcome was decided decades ago.On top of all of this are some very good, if not, great work by the actors. Alan Arkin should be a lock for a Supporting Actor nomination & Bryan Cranston should be considered too. Both have the benefit of having some of the best lines in a screenplay full of them & make the most of them. Affleck is suitably restrained as the CIA ex-filtration agent who is the fulcrum of the heroics here. That restraint is key in making his command of the situation believable without question. John Goodman is in fine form as well.I left the theater with a lump in my throat & damp eyes. It is that kind of movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Argo f**k yourself indeed.,"Out of boredom, I decided to insert the long-ago-rented DVD into my DVD player. I was on a movie drought for days and was dying for entertainment. It suddenly occurred to me that this was the best picture and most likely worth a watch. So, I sat myself back and was filled with expectations.Well, I have to say the movie started out good. Showing the background knowledge of the Iranian Revolution with a sexy voice for narration. I didn't know the history of the Iranian Revolution so I was considered myself enlightened. The first few scenes showing the Iranians intruding the American embassy was well-directed to say the least. The scenes indeed created tension. In the first scenes, we learned that the American embassy was overwhelmed by the mob and most of them were held captive. However, six Americans managed to escape from under the tunnel. Well, the incidents stirred up a hornet's nest with the related government agencies. The CIA decided to invoke their elite specialist, Tony Mendez, to extract the six trapped Americans, currently hiding in the Canadian embassy. Well, Tony was nothing short of a job addict, distant from his family. After talking on a phone with his estranged son , he stumbled upon an idea to pose as a fake movie producer to Iran to salvage the 6 Americans. To make the entire process authentic, he had to consult with an actual movie designer and producer, from whom he received significant assistance. When everything is set, he headed to Iran to implement his mission. In the end, he successfully rescued the 6 Americans from Iran and he got back with his family in the end.Surprisingly, I was completely devoid of emotion during the entire process of the movie. Thanks to the dull and less than mundane performance by Ben Affleck who simply could not switch his facial emotions from scene to scene. As for the 6 Americans, they were one- dimensional to an extreme. I didn't feel anything for him, maybe some double takes on the young wife who was relatively pretty compared to others, but nothing more really. They were in danger, okay, shrug...Why should I care? Perfect indication of the failure of the script writers who failed to make the characters fleshed out. As for the plot, it was exceedingly formulaic. Guy goes to Tehran, guy contacts the 6 Americans, guy successfully gets them past Customs, guy reunited with his estranged family. When the plot can be simply concluded into four sentences, you can infer the plot's tremendously shallow. You can't blame Ben though, you can tell he really tried, sometimes too hard, to make this an entertaining story. Sadly, history cannot be argued. The course of the entire rescue was so flat and anti-climatic that even adding the fictional car-chase scene can't save the movie from falling into a huge puddle of predictability. While watching the end credits go by, I felt puzzled about why even bother making such a movie. There was no emotional fluctuations or should I say, no feelings at all after 2 hours. Is it the director's fault or is this movie too good for me to appreciate?To conclude, this is an extremely over-the-top shallow, empty, with characters flatter than paper. You can't really blame Ben though, he really had extended to the end of his abilities. Point is, fundamentally, the source material was too boring to make it into a film. Whoever considered the source material should really examine his decision in retrospect. In a nutshell, don't believe the hype! This is far from the Best Picture league, no idea why even nominated in the first place. The award should've gone to Life of Pi but I guess Hollywood favors empty movies about American heroism to innovative stories about Indians. Shame on the judges, really. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Very Good,"Argo is a suspenseful drama, based on a true story, back in 1979, in Iran. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA specialist helps rescue six staff members of the United States embassy from a craze country that just lost their leader. As serious as the situation is, the director (Ben Affleck) is able to ""loosen up"" the audience with humorous quotes from his cast / costars, John Goodman, who plays John Chambers, a famous make-up artist, and Alan Arkin, who plays Lester Siegel, a famous movie producer. Like most of Ben Affleck's films, Argo is 120 minutes and is timed perfectly with no drawn-out scenes, or rushed actions. Even though this story was told in 1981, on a television-movie, Escape From Iran: The Canadian Caper, you should still see this version.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The CIA agent surely looks brave and smart but at the price of Iranian security looking too primitive,"ARGOBy Vladimir KruglyakIf you are a fan of James Bond, you'd like this film. Unlike the double-o-seven's fancy missions however, this movie is down-to-earth real. The American thriller directed by Ben Affleck, who is also a member of the cast as a CIA operative, is comparable to his previous work, The Town. As that movie, the current production is also imbued with authentic tension that will leave a long lasting impression of an eyewitness to the secret operation. Based on true events of 1979 hostage crisis, this movie captivates with its diplomatic contagion. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) leads the rescue of six diplomats caught in the revolutionary turmoil — militant Islamic students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took ninety hostages. The aggravated crowd demanded that the escaped to the U.S. Shah of Iran be returned for a trial. While the Iranian government delayed expurgating negativity of the protest, the CIA agent Mendez ingratiated the covert escape scheme for diplomats and after brief preparations at Hollywood Studios, took off for Iran. He figured that in addition to the spread of Protestants' beliefs, the U.S. citizens may have another reason to be inside the foreign country, that is, to make a movie, and that is the bat that the CIA intelligence officer made against the odds. But as at the most bureaucratic government agencies, at CIA everything must be approved. And when Mendez's idea of taking the hiding diplomats out as a fake movie crew is about to become reality, he doesn't get approval from the high office and acts on his own. The desperate breakthrough at the well secured civilian airport seems improbable, and the successful escape depicted in this movie serves not as a simple tribute to the brave and surely lucky CIA agent but rather as a derogatory remark toward Iranian security forces. Starting with black and white documentary shots of the conflict at the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979, the film establishes its authority. Next follows the scene of burning the American flag complimented by the address plan of Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise. This sequence sets the nature of the plot to both inquisitive and cautionary. Our attention is constantly captivated by close ups into details such as gun barrel, eyes, and calligraphic on documents. The six characters that look like Pink Floyd fans are realistically panicking and truly believe that their days are over. Yes, the truth is ugly — you may be called a hero at your home country but abroad, you are a fugitive criminal with forged documents and no excuses to make if justice comes. In moments of culmination, when captivity is seconds away, the heat of emotions that is captured through shaky camera gives an impression of a covert view. This effect dismisses any apocryphal thoughts a skeptical viewer might have had. It feels as if the movie producers wanted to show the austere reality and that is what you'll see. Namely — a group of apprehended U.S. government employees trying to escape undetected from the foreign environment, but an impasse is in place and only small chances can help. In depicting these chances, the filmmakers should have eschewed a play of probabilities because even in 1979, when no cellular devices existed, a chance that allows fugitives to fly away right from the civilian airport just doesn't seem plausible. This triumph of doubt begins from perfidious Iranian woman whose mission of a ""snitch"" at the Canadian ambassador's house is a bit overdressed, given her fear and loyalty based on Islamic religion. Thus, the failure of multiple stratagems creates a hard-to-believe pattern, but this is the only rationale for a happy ending to arrive. By delaying the climax to the very end of the film, the Argo keeps us motivated for entire two hours. And it will be unfortunate to have a bathroom call during the movie. So, be prepared and stay put, you won't regret the experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A tense, intriguing, sharp and witty thriller — incredible execution","Exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez received the highest honor that can possibly be awarded in Intelligence for his work during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979, and the man who played him and directed his story in ""Argo,"" Ben Affleck, will find himself quite decorated as well if he continues to make films at this quality of a clip.The ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town"" director has — at this point — completely erased his image as stale actor of the early 2000s and replaced it with a reputation as one of the most exciting directors working today. Those first two films depicted a gritty, hard-nosed America as seen through blue-collar Boston, and though ""Argo"" is a story that takes place halfway across the world and is so inconceivable it could only be true, he finds a way to make it unmistakably real and palpable.After explaining the events leading up to the crisis in clever storyboarding fashion, ""Argo"" opens with an intense depiction of the invasion of the U.S. embassy and shows how six Americans escaped and took refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador (Victor Garber). Several months later we meet Mendez, who is brought in to consult on the CIA's current plan to get the six out. After tearing holes in their various strategies, Mendez eventually concocts a plan to disguise them as a Canadian film crew scouting for shooting locations.In order for it to be a convincing cover, Mendez must build an entire movie from the ground up. He enlists the help of skilled Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and wisecracking producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to find a script and create some tangible buzz and legitimacy surrounding the film. They select a script called ""Argo,"" a bad ""Star Wars"" and ""Flash Gordon"" knockoff that calls for exotic locales with a Middle Eastern flair.""Argo"" (the real film) is a tense journey from start to finish. Even for those familiar with the true story and the outcome will find reason to pause and think, ""they do get home safely, right?"" Affleck keeps the suspense high by pristinely communicating the stakes should they fail. Brutal punishment and likely certain death awaits them if so much as anyone suspects them of being American spies. Affleck captures the unstable and erratic nature of the angry Iranian mobs, drawing upon imagery from actual television footage and photos taken during the duration of the crisis from '79 to '81.But much of what makes the film work can primarily be found in Chris Terrio's script, which is based on an article by Joshuah Bearman. It delivers the story in such a succinct manner and uses sharp and illustrative language to communicate the nature of the situation and the characters dealing with it. It's also impressively witty and clever even if a bit contrived in order to be so. Consequently, Arkin is at the top of his game as the lovable scuzzball producer, and Affleck, Goodman and Bryan Cranston as Mendez's CIA supervisor also benefit. This top-shelf ensemble cast adds every bit of legitimacy to the film as an Intelligence thriller.Although incredibly subtle, there are numerous nods to the sci-fi films and TV shows of the '70s. Geeks will appreciate a little shout out to a famous sci-fi show of the time, but otherwise, these films are the unsung hero of the movie. Without the ridiculousness of the exotic Martian locales and other hallmarks of science fiction, we would've all but surely failed to extract the hiding Americans from Iran.More down to earth and part of what gives ""Argo"" broader appeal is the way that it feels quintessentially American (with all apologies to the Canadians and their instrumental role in the events both real and depicted). Affleck takes the time to show moving imagery of how we responded to the crisis at home with the yellow ribbons and as far as saving the day, the film depicts us as not having so much pride that we couldn't let the Canadians get all the credit. Given international relations as they are now, it's refreshing to see this golden example of governmental collaboration.""Argo"" is a golden example in its own right. Movies based on true stories don't get more compelling than this. Despite some incredibly suspicious timing as far as avoiding the bad guys and other stuff we're more accustomed to from works of total fiction, this film represents a crisp, clean and maybe most importantly, accessible execution of a bureaucratic thriller, especially one based on true events. The delivery of the story is so impeccable that it ought to be used to teach writing for film. We don't ask all our films to be revelatory, but they should all be as thoroughly engaging as ""Argo.""It's true that ""Argo"" isn't loaded with big ideas. It might be the antithesis to another of this year's likely awards contenders, ""The Master."" But what it lacks in themes and conversation starters it more than makes up for in intrigue, suspense and intelligent entertainment.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Sparkling rah-rah go-get-em action adventure done to technical high standards.,"Argo (2012)The preview for ""Argo"" made me think of a dozen recent political thrillers, and the clichés lined up in my mind to the point I didn't want to see it. Then it won the Golden Globe, and I'm thinking there must be more to this than meets the eye. I wrote this review at first with the rush of having seen a really well made political thriller, but the blush has faded and I'm revising down a hair. It's good, but it really is formula movie making in some ways. And yet, in other ways, it's fast and fresh and funny.The first minute, the first ten minutes, are so riveting you can forget any doubts about the previews. In some ways this sets an unmatchable pace for the rest, outlining the history leading to the hostage crisis in Iran that is the crux of the plot later on. Mixing found footage (or what looks like real period stuff) with new shots, and editing in a whirlwind that will, even when it calms down, make your head spin, the pace and the energy is great. Gradually it becomes clear what particular focus the movie will take--the six embassy workers who avoided being taken hostage in the crisis (this is late 1979).When the plot broadens to include not only the Canadian Ambassador's house but a bunch of small time Hollywood professionals (played by big time Hollywood professionals named Alan Arkin and John Goodman), the fun begins. And as much as the movie is painful and gut-wrenching, it's actually fun, and in Goodman's case, downright hilarious. It's that famously classic mix of tragic and comic that makes the movie click. It's a bit glib and maybe even dumbed down, at times, but it still gets some sincere laughs.Ben Affleck directed and stars as the leading operative who tries to get the six out of Iran using a crazy concoction of chutzpah and genius. Whether it works you'll see. But the movie is filmed, and edited, with unusual clarity and intelligence. It's not just fast, it's kinetic and logical and irresistible. It's an artistic job of putting several plot lines together into one dynamic energized whole. It creates a really stupidly Hollywood fantasy of an ending (the airport stuff) that isn't true, and the personal life of Affleck's character is further sentimentalizing (also not true--check wikipedia).The only downside to the movie is that it is what it is--it's history, it has no surprises if you know the history, and it's laden slightly with the feeling the ""we"" are the good guys and ""they"" are not. And it's a conventional--though highly effective--action adventure political thriller beat the clock movie. I mean, there are ways these movies are put together and this follows the rules. I don't know if the Iranians are presented fairly, overall, but an Iranian student of mine (born and raised in Tehran) said it looked really authentic to him. It is, however, an very pro-American view of things, for better or worse.In the end ""Argo"" is just so smartly made and paced, you'll get sucked in. Guaranteed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
One of the finest films of the year.,"I was convinced after Gone Baby Gone and The Town that Ben Affleck was a director of the highest calibre, but for those unsure, Argo leaves zero doubt. Based on a true story (from 1980) about a crazy rescue operation to get six U.S. hostages out of Iran – by disguising them as a Canadian film crew scouting for a B-grade sci-fi flick, entitled Argo – Affleck captures both the life-threatening seriousness and funny-in-hindsight absurdity of the dangerous mission with absolute perfection. He's also brilliant in front of the camera as Tony Mendez, the CIA agent responsible for the creation and execution of the plan; his downplayed above-the-title performance supplemented by a wealth of fantastic supporting turns from the likes of Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, Scoot McNairy and many more familiar faces. The seamless blend of tones, in addition to the well-measured tension, razor-sharp dialogue and flawless period recreation, creates an enjoyable and absorbing experience that culminates into one of the finest features of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A reminiscence of WAG THE DOG and APOLLO 13 with Oscars reeking all around it,"Although heightened up for dramatic purposes, ARGO proved to be an intense thriller. Even with numerous inaccuracies portrayed in the film it never once strayed far from its clever storytelling techniques.Right from its opening sequence when the Time-Warner logo appeared on screen to its entire atmosphere of the film truly felt like it was a movie conceived back in the 70-80s era. Though not grainy or scratchy as one would imagine seeing an actual film from those decades director, Ben Affleck, cleverly brought the essence of the Iran Hostage Crisis of the late 70s as surreal as possible like we're watching an actual footage or documentary on film.I highly appreciate the intensity that Affleck brought to the story and his brilliant vision of this true event to contemporary audience who may or may not aware of the real story.Nevertheless, Affleck managed to capture not only the ""feel"" of the 70s but also the dramatic chronology of the events.Personally, I am aware of the Iran Hostage Crisis however I must admit that I had no prior knowledge that the whole rescue operation by CIA was made into a somewhat close resemblance to the 1997 film WAG THE DOG; in that the US government had some sort of collaboration with Hollywood studios to make up stories as a decoy for an actual political agenda.But needless to say Affleck did an excellent job in dramatizing the event.I would sum up ARGO as an intense rescue mission that has a more edge-of-your-seat moments a la 1995 APOLLO 13. However, ARGO brings the audience to a whole lots of intensity that I was practically tossing and turning in my seat in suspense.As such, with its surreal editing and great script coupled with brilliant acting and direction by Ben Affleck there is no doubt that ARGO indeed reeks of Oscars all around.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Best approached with lowered expectations,"I enjoyed the movie, but it seems a little odd that the real story of Tony Mendez's perfectly executed ""exfiltration"" scam had to be pruned back and simplified so much to make room for fictional scenes that would fit the pacing of a conventional action film. (See http://longform.org/stories/the-great-escape for some interesting details about the origins of the film-within-the-film and the houseguests' ordeal in Teheran that didn't make it into the shooting script.) All the name players (Affleck, Arkin, Goodman, Cranston) turn in fine performances; the escapees don't really emerge as distinct personalities, though Clea DuVall, as the most tightly wrapped of the group, is always good for a reaction shot at a tense moment. A few of the scenes leading up to the slambang finale at the airport seem a little implausible or contrived (the bumpy ride to the bazaar, e.g., which didn't actually happen), but as Donald Rumsfeld might have said, You go to see the movie that got made, not the one that should have gotten made and it's available on DVD from Netflix, btw.

This film really depicts the futility of trying to bargain with mad men. They are depicted as killer apes in human form; madness permeates the country from top to bottom. This is not religion in any way, shape or form; it is madness. Every scene is directed with such a deft touch by Affleck, and it is definitely one of the best films I've seen this year.

"Argo, The film America needs to see!","In today's cluttered movie industry, movie makers are required to dream up entirely new worlds, with complex endings, and a twist at every turn. But amidst all the clutter, and above all the complexity, a shining light of a movie named Argo breaks through, and director Ben Affleck delivers a flat out good movie.Perhaps what Argo does for me above all else, is give me hope for the movie industry. The fact that someone can still take a story that everyone knows the ending to, make it exciting, engaging, with a bit of light comedy, and keep us on the edge of our seats till the very end, gives me hope for future films. This proves, we don't always need everyone to die at the end, or for the main character to wake up and it was all a dream, to make a good movie, sometimes, a happy ending isn't so bad.I'll be honest, the only reason I even considered seeing Argo was because I saw the commercial during the final episode of the first half of season 5 for Breaking Bad. Me, being a huge Bryan Cranston fan, had to see if he could deliver in another role besides Breaking Bad. But what I got in return, was much greater.But what makes Argo such a great movie? Well, to start, the pacing. Argo is a slow movie, but at no point, did I feel like they were trying to drag on the story, they spent a good amount of time making the movie, and rightfully so, it's not easy making a movie that doesn't exist. Next in line, the acting. While Ben Affleck delivers a solid role as Tony Mendez, it is truly the supporting actors that carry the load. Alan Arkin, provides most of the laughs, with his catch phrase, ""Ar-go f#*k yourself."" he helps ease the tension in the movie. John Goodman, comes off as a honest to god good guy, that just wants to help, which is rare in Hollywood. Last but not least, Bryan Cranston, who has a medium sized role in the movie, does a fine job telling off government officials. While Bryan's acting is fantastic, it's really the roles that hold him back, but one of these days, he is going to find a role in a movie that perfectly suits him, and it is going to be glorious.Although Argo isn't a perfect film, (lack of subtitles anyone?). It delivers as an above average thriller, with a heart warming ending. It's not the movie America needs, but the one, it deserves.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Simply a  Treat......,"I would say one of the best flicks i 've seen lately with brilliant acting and a wicked story. I don't give a toss if the movie is based on true story or a myth, I just loved the idea and it has made me nervous and i did chew few nails off in the last scene where they were boarding the airplane. I think Ben Afflek has made a beautiful movie with so close to the reality atmosphere and each character justified with the character. I being a movie buff simply loved this one and recommends it to everyone. It is far better than Hollywood slasher movies or any teen comedy stuff, as it has its own charisma that involves you in each and every scene. I give 2 thums up to Ben for making such a wicked flick and surely deserves an Oscar,",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
good entertainment while it's running,"Argo exhibits an always risky blend of genres, in which comedy and political, here, and drama coexist in harmony for much of it and then make way for a thriller. it seems that Ben Affleck grown to a realization of his abilities and limitations as an actor; as he decidedly self-assign somber-looking characters in his films. the very good supporting cast make a success out of the comedy side of things. but this kind of film doesn't allow room for reflection, beside the skill of sustaining suspense, you're just supposed to follow; and in the end of the thriller when the issue is finally resolved, you're not left with much else to say after that. and there's really no afterthoughts. but it's good entertainment while it's running.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Three in a row for Mr. Affleck!,"Argo, the third feature directed by Ben Affleck, is simply stunning. Taking place during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, Argo takes your breath away as it very accurately portrays the covert CIA operation, led by Ben Affleck, to extract six American hostages. In the midst of the Iran hostage crisis, six American citizens escaped out the back exit the of the U.S. Embassy. They took hiding in the Canadian Ambassador's home but were very much in danger as they were constantly being looked for by Iranian soldiers. CIA extractor Tony Mendez (Affleck) hatches a scheme to disguise the six citizens and himself as a Canadian film crew scouting Iran as a location for a fake movie called ""Argo."" The plan is then for them to hopefully sneak back into USA using the Iran International Airport, leading to a nail-biting finish.At this point, Ben Affleck is a supreme director. The first two movies he directed (Gone Baby Gone and The Town) were outstanding and he has now outdone himself with his latest installment, Argo. Though Argo is not as gritty as the previous films directed by Affleck, the intensity level is just as high. As a viewer, you will have to wait patiently for the climax to build but I can assure you, you will be rewarded with one of the most tense movie experiences this year. Ben Affleck did a very nice job of letting the plot grow and develop on its own. You don't feel forced to care about these stranded American citizens. Instead, the movie sucks you into their dilemma and the film grows so organically that you find yourself worried and scared for these people without even realizing it. Even if you know the story, you will still be left in shock and awe as you witness this adaptation of the courageous mission that took place. Kudos to Ben Affleck for drawing me in and not letting go.You may feel confused when watching Argo for the first 45 minutes of the movie. Like I said, the plot slowly builds. By this I mean, it almost seems like comedy for a brief period. Ben Affleck is trying to pitch a fake movie with Alan Arkin and John Goodman and there are some moments that are pretty hilarious. However, this part of the movie is very necessary as it lets the story shape into an exciting thriller with a huge pay-off.Unlike Affleck's previous movies where the action is in, well, the action of the characters, in Argo, the action is all in the dialog. This is done with superb acting under the helm of Affleck. This is by far the best performance from Affleck thus far in his career. Bryan Cranston was amazing in this movie too but honestly, when isn't Bryan Cranston amazing? Cranston is one of the best actors around today and he shows that in this film. The best thing about Argo is that everything (the script, the performances, the dialog) was all very real.Argo is an Oscar worthy picture. It really is a movie event at its finest and gives you hope for the future of film making. I will have to say that The Town is a little bit better of a movie but Argo is still a damn good film that leaves me eager to see what Ben Affleck does next. You do not want to miss this exciting political thriller. A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Inspiring Story of a Movie which never got made...,"Affleck's 'Argo' is the story of a movie which never got made. It's a well-acted and well-directed inspiring true story. Affleck has grown as a director and guides his exemplary cast to perfection, in this political thriller. In just three films, Ben Affleck has reached quite far.The movie starts well, with a short glimpse of Iran's history, it gathers good pace and maintains necessary tension till the very end.The only complain I had was that it only focuses on he plight of the 6 fugitives stranded at the Canadian Ambassador's house. It doesn't tell much about the remaining hostages, nor does it tell about the plight of the Iranians. Iranians are shown just as bunch of violent hooligans; it's quite vague and inaccurate. What happened was the culmination of a long series of grievances harbored by many Iranians against the United States. Not that their storming into the embassy could be excused. But, there are lot of things excluded which doesn't give the big and clear picture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A good watch for short suspense drama,"Based on real incidents of an hostage situation in Iran in 1979, Argo is an Exfil drama of how a good deception worked in favour of not just the hostages but US as a whole.

The movie is simple and clean, with no extra action or added-thrill moments (except towards the end).

Genius,"'Argo' is a fantastic film directed by Ben Affleck. It tells the story of six US embassy workers who managed to escape shortly before the 1980 Iranian US embassy hostage crisis. The six people find refuge in the Canadian embassy but it is only a matter of time until the hostage takers find out they're missing.I have a massive amount of respect for Ben Affleck after seeing this film. It is brilliant and arguably one of the best films of 2012. The script and dialogue are fantastic; the film moves at a realistic pace (not to quick and not too slow) it builds momentum and the last hour is fantastic and is more like a fictional action film. The dialogue is funny, realistic and descriptive but the actors should be given just as much credit for this as the script writers.Ben Affleck, as well as directing, takes the lead role as a member of the CIA whose task it is to try and get the hostages out of Iran with no problems. It is his idea to create a fake film to get the hostages out. Affleck's performance is good but not too over the top to overshadow other performances. He gives a realistic performance here and has clearly researched his character. Bryan Cranston does not have a huge role here but he is great; he provides a lot of great scenes with his wise-cracking, funny character. I really liked him in this and I'm glad to see he is getting more mainstream work. Scott McNairy is great here; since seeing him in 'Killing Them Softly' I have looked forward to his future career and this is a good follow up. His character is completely different but he tackles it with great confidence and is convincing. I look forward to seeing where his career takes him next.Overall, I loved this film. It is a great, high quality film for modern history fans and even action fans to an extent (if you liked the Hurt Locker you might find this enjoyable). This is a fantastic film and I hope it gets some award recognition in 2013.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Thus, it merits a 10/10 in my book. It's so very well acted and constructed. I was captivated all the way through and Affleck made it suspenseful to the max.

So, off to the movies we go to re-live the events in Hollywood splendor. - While the story of the 6 American citizens that escaped the embassy and thus avoid being captured, is a good one, the film itself is terribly slow the vast majority of the time. If not for the fantastic characters played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin, this movie might have put people to sleep. That is, up until the last 10 min of the movie....... even when you already know the outcome, it's still fairly tense.

A pretty entertaining movie,"OK, this apparently only loosely based on the ""Canadian Caper"" of 1980 to smuggle out of Teheran the six American Foreign Service officers who get away from the embassy before the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised as students, overrun the embassy. While there are a lot of historical quibbles with the plot, there was a need to generate tension in places where it wasn't quite so tense. Not that it wasn't tense, and dangerous, but it seems that the ending at the airport was not so close, that the diplomats were long out of the country without the Iranians being any the wiser. The narration about Mossadegh at the beginning seemed a bit one-sided, not mentioning that he was likely to turn the country into a Soviet colony, and stealing billions of dollars in Western property. Yes, the shah was a tyrant too, but the nation is still tyrannized all these years later.

Blew me away!,"I'm and Iranian who's lived here all my life. I have to say, this movie caught my attention so deeply I couldn't even take my eyes off of it for a second. Here's why:First of all, it is amazingly made to be appealing. Yes of course, appealing. It's Hollywood and you are an idiot if you waste money on making a film that nobody wants to watch. So, naturally, there is added ""spice"" to the real story on which it is based.Secondly, it tells a tender story really carefully. I know that a political movie does get harsh criticism from countless ever-complaining different sides, specially this one which will not be safe from the Iranian's infamous patriotic enthusiasts and those revolutionists being paid to counter propaganda on the net, but according to what I know from Iran and the things happened back at the beginning of the revolution, it really delivers the story smoothly. It really manifests the horror and the religious idiocy that even today exists in Iran.I believe Argo is a really good picture. It deserved an Oscar nomination. Well to say that it deserved to win is simply a very difficult thing, as it always is, because choosing the best is usually contentious when there are other good movies around. For all I know, if Lincoln had won, there would be people complaining why not Argo! I think Argo does hit the spot in these most tender times, and I think it is as accurate as it can be without loosing the cinematic appeal. It's a must-watch in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Affleck is now 3 for 3,"A hostile nation is holding 52 members of the embassy staff hostage. While the majority of the State Department is focused on those hostages, six members of the embassy staff have sought refuge with the Canadian ambassador. How would you get them out? Could you get them out?Thanks to the U.S. allowing their deposed leader to seek refuge in America, the Iranian people storm the American embassy on November 4, 1979. The staff is rushing to shred or burn all their confidential files. The majority of the staff are held hostage while a small percentage escape unnoticed. The State Department begins planning a rescue and asks the CIA to consult. It's abundantly clear to the Agency's ""exfiltration"" specialist, Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck), that the State Department is in over their heads. With such plans as having the embassy workers ride to the border disguised as teachers on bicycles in winter. It was back in his hotel watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes and talking to the son Ian (played by Aidan Sussman) that Tony (Affleck) has an idea. Disguise the hostages as a film crew and sneak them out right under the enemy's nose. After bringing the idea to his boss, Jack O'Donnell (played by Bryan Cranston) the plan gets the go-ahead. Later, they approach the make-up specialist who worked on The Planet of the Apes who has also done work for the Agency in the past, John Chambers (played by John Goodman). Chambers in turn introduces Mendez to a well-known producer named Lester Siegel (played by Alan Arkin). Once they've chosen a script, Argo, a science-fiction fantasy in the style of Star Wars, they go the extra mile in establishing it as a legitimate enterprise. Where it was simply a poster in the beginning, Siegel organizes a table-reading with known actors, press, and studio staff. While all this is going on, the Iranian government has sweatshop labor assembling the shredded photos so that they can identify anyone who they failed to capture. Also, our six escapees become increasingly fearful that they will be discovered.I'm kind of a sucker for movies based on factual events, no matter how much the narrative diverges from history. A Beautiful Mind, The Insider, some that don't have Russell Crowe as the lead actor. That said, it doesn't guarantee I will like it. Case in point, I found J. Edgar unbelievably dissatisfying. Argo, on the other hand, is brilliant, in my opinion. The story is gripping, the comic relief is hilarious, and the suspense has me on the edge of my seat. As a lead actor, Affleck has had some notable flops. Gigli and Surviving Christmas among them. As the director of Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and now Argo, however, he is now three for three.

A beautiful cinematic achievement and another success for Affleck!,"'ARGO': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Ben Affleck's third outing as feature film director (following 2010's 'THE TOWN' and 2007's 'GONE BABY GONE'). This one is set during the Iran hostage crisis (that began in 1979) in which six U.S. diplomats fled the U.S. embassy in Tehran and hid out (for several months) at the Canadian ambassador's home there. It's loosely based on CIA specialist Tony Mendez's account of how he used a fake Sci-Fi film production called 'Argo' to get them out of the country. Affleck also stars in the film (as Mendez, despite the fact that Affleck is not a Latino) but he didn't write the script (like he co-wrote his two other directorial efforts). Chris Terrio wrote the screenplay and it's based on the 2007 Wired article 'How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran' by Joshua Bearman. It co-stars Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Victor Garber, Tate Donovan, Christopher Denham and Clea DuVall. The movie is funny, dramatic and extremely tense at times; like the other two films Affleck has helmed it's a grade A production all around!The film begins in 1979 Tehran with the U.S. embassy being invaded by Iranian revolutionaries (in protest to the U.S. supporting the Shah they recently deposed). Most of the embassy staff is taken hostage except six who escape and flee to the home of the Canadian ambassador there, Ken Taylor (Garbor). Their escape is unknown to the revolutionaries and their whereabouts are kept secret while the U.S. tries to figure out the best way to get them home to safety. CIA specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck) is brought in to help with the planning of their exfiltration. He devises a plan to use the cover of a fake Sci-Fi film, called 'Argo', and pretend to scout locations for the film in Tehran in order to get the six diplomats out under the guise of his film crew. Despite skepticism from Government officials Mendez pursues his plan with the help of a Hollywood make-up artist (Goodman) and film producer (Arkin). Cranston plays Mendez's supervisor on the operation.The movie is touching on some issues and politics that are very relevant to the times today (of course) and it's extremely dramatic and emotional because of it. It's also very funny (especially when it gets in to the fake film details of it's story) and, like I said, very tense and suspenseful at times as well (especially in the third act). You can tell events have been altered quite a bit from actual history for dramatic and cinematic effect and the film has been criticized for some of it's changes but Affleck has still mastered a beautiful film. Not taking factual accuracy in to account and just looking at it as a masterful suspense thriller it's a beautiful cinematic achievement and another success for Affleck, who has proved to be a much better director than he is an actor (although he's not a bad actor either and does fine in this film). The problem with Affleck's career a few years back was just the over hyped publicity of it (that and the fact that he did a lot of OK to bad films). He's actually a very talented actor as well as an excellent filmmaker (possibly one of the best working in film today). The rest of the cast is all exceptional in the film as well, especially Cranston and Arkin (who are scene stealers). 'ARGO' isn't quite as impressive a film as 'THE TOWN' but it does deserve all the critical recognition and Oscar hype it's getting and it's a must see for any true film fan.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7YhqgcaX3Q",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Quality old-school thriller from the man with the Serpico beard.,"The Ben Affleck career renaissance continues apace with this masterfully measured and understated piece of directing, which adapts the so-bizarre- it-can-only-be-true story of a fake movie used as cover for a CIA rescue operation, into an old-school '70s-style political thriller laced with shades of self-reflexive Hollywood satire. Argo successfully balances scenes of seat-gripping tension and joyously grouchy humour that feels effortless but takes a sure hand to pull off. Minor historical inaccuracies have to be swallowed along the way for the benefit of snappier pacing. But overall this remains a fascinating true story, delivered with great performances, pin-sharp dialogue and award-winning facial hair, and would make a fine double-bill with the underrated Charlie Wilson's War.

Mission Controlled,"This film is highly recommended.Does history ever really change or just re-invent itself? It's November 4, 1979. The American embassy has been under attack by extremist groups. Six Americans are in the midst of the Iranian hostage crisis. They have temporarily escaped their captors and are being hidden in the Canadian embassy nearby. Time is running out before they are found. The American government is trying to remedy this volatile situation as fast as it can. ( Sadly, the ordeal would last 444 days after a failed attempt to save the other 52 hostages. )Tony Mendez, one of the many C.I.A. officers on duty, devises a hare-brained rescue plan to help them escape: create a bogus movie, go into Iran as one of the film's producers, and leave Iran with the missing hostages in tow, posing as his Canadian film crew. It sounds completely over-the-top, but the plan is set in motion, all under the guise of working on a sci-fi movie called Argo. The truth is usually stranger than fiction, and in the real action thriller called Argo, solidly directed by Ben Affleck ( and based on declassified information ), this event did actually happen ( with a bit of real Hollywood tweaking in both scenarios).The film begins with a mini-lesson about the history of the weakening U.S.-Iran relations via storyboard form before going to live action footage of the typical but topical angry mob scene that one could readily find on the cover of today's Newsweek or other periodicals. ( The old adage that history repeats itself is quite evident throughout the film and one of Argo's strongest points. ) As the director, Affleck's meticulous research and attention to detail can be found in every frame of this film. The costumes with its late 70's vibe, the vivid art direction, and the casting of actors with similar physical traits as the hostages ( except for a more handsome Affleck himself in leading man mode substituting for the more average looking real counterpart ), all of these elements blend perfectly into that era. ( Make sure you stay for the end credits to compare for yourself. )At times, Argo seems to be two very good movies in one: it's one part comedy, one part action film. The early portion film concentrates on the film's origins as Mendez tries to establish some background history and fake publicity to authenticate a genuine Hollywood production in the works before the mission begins. Affleck incorporates Hollywood's faux- hipness very well, giving the film a marvelous satirical tone and rhythm. He gets some nice comedic performances by John Goodman as real-life make-up expert, John Chambers , and especially Alan Arkin as a completely fictionalized cagey producer, Lester Siegel . These two actors deliver their funny zingers with impeccable timing which attests to their fine skills as consummate pros.Later, when the actual mission evolves, the film becomes a tense political thriller, even if you already know the outcome of the rescue mission. Affleck is a bit bland and overly stoic in this section of the film. Granted his role is less showy and the actor downplays his action figure status, but it is still a fine portrayal of a man who takes his job and the lives of his fellow Americans all too seriously. The film builds suspense subtly in its airport scene and the impact never seems forced or remotely stilted.Special mention must also go to the insightful script by Chris Terrio. The screenplay is concise, the dialog is extremely well written, and its characters never grandstand or become preachy archetypes of the American ideals. All seem totally relatable and human, everyday people caught in an international quagmire.Argo is one of the best films in this lackluster year. ( It's mid-October already and only 2 films have earned highly recommended status from me so far. ) The film resists the urge to be a more profitable bloody shoot-em-up tale for a younger movie-going audience and instead chooses to be an adult political espionage thriller whose excitement is in its character development and complicated twists and turns. In Argo, Affleck takes his mission to make a compelling and intelligent film very seriously too. Mission accomplished.

It's a wonderful movie. It's a pity that the ending is known at the beginning of the story.,"The fact that the film won the Oscar for best film was partly political. But regardless of the external factors, it is still commendable that Ben has created a perfect arrangement of what actually happened in history. Whether it is the early planning and preparation for the plan, or the hostage rescue behind, Big Ben has the audience's mind firmly fixed in front of the seat. The spicy and interesting lines, the skillful and sophisticated rhythm control, the style of editing, the meticulous costumes and props as well as the suspense atmosphere are all outstanding parts of the film. But don't you just look at the beautiful things?

Argo Is Riveting!,"The Town was a movie that most certainly gave evidence of Ben Affleck's skills. Argo takes it a step farther. He has grown into, not only an excellent actor, but a smashing director as well. He is one of the best! Here he has created a film that has Oscar written all over it. Very likely for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor as well. From the first sight of the murderous mob of Iranians to the last frightening and infuriating moment, this picture moves you along with your interest totally intact. It is gripping! Many of us remember how this true story unfolded and ended, but never-the-less your attention will not flag. Not for a second. Alan Arkan has one of the best roles ever in this one, and John Goodman continues to get better all the time, too. As dramatic as this was, Affleck allowed Arkan and Goodman to interject a bit of humor to lighten things up now and then. Sheer perfection! This picture is the best I've seen in a while and I've seen some good ones lately. Affleck scores a winner with this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Great Movie!!!,"Overall---->This is a great film, hands down ****. From the beginning to the end there is conflict and great tension. The story is awesome thanks to its great pacing and complex intertwining story lines. Easily one of the best films of the year, done by an actor/director who rightfully deserves more credit; i.e. Ben Affleck.I would recommend this movie to anybody over the age of 18. The characters evolutionary arcs are fantastic and the ability to use metaphors and imagery is very visual. This is a movie you go to see more than once.Very well done is every regard.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Oppressive Atmosphere Places You in 1970s Iran,"Argo creates a tight, oppressive, pressurized atmosphere that stayed with me long after the lights went up. Affleck plays the CIA operative tasked with rescuing 6 Americans in Iran during the hostage crisis of the 70s. His understated performance is pitch perfect. John Goodman and Alan Arkin are great as the Hollywood counterparts that help Affleck pull off his cover story, and surprisingly the movie has some really funny one-liners. Byran Cranston is also phenomenal, as is the rest of the top-notch cast. While pacing slowed in a few places, it didn't take long to pick back up in each case. A nice touch at the end was seeing the photos of the real life hostages and players juxtaposed against the actors who played them.The movie was a little different than what I was expecting, however. I expected a ""nail biting, action thriller"" that I assumed -- knowing how the story ends -- would leave me feeling triumphant or at least feeling good. Instead, (and in a way this is to the movie's credit), the atmosphere it created was so oppressive that I was left in a negative mood, even though the film has a positive ending (since it is based on a true story I don't think that's giving anything away). If you equate oppression and pressure with ""a thriller"" and ""action"" then I guess you might see it different. In any case there are worse ways to spend ten bucks plus.It's a solid 7.5 stars for me, but not a movie I would watch twice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Old school Hollywood film making at its best.,"I have little to offer that others haven't already.But this is a movie you can't miss. When I mention ""old school Hollywood,"" I do it with the absolute best intentions. This is such solid film making because you don't SEE the moves the director is making. It just flat out works. This is all about story and characters, not about the director or the DP or the effects. It is a lot like watching a studio system movie from the 40's, when STORY carried the day. And yet, it IS about the director and the DP and the writer -- except that, as I said, it isn't thrown in your face....Bravo to Affleck for such a precision job that is, at the same time, so emotional....The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is that is isn't ""Dark Victory"" or ""The Thin Man"" :-)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Bad language,I just saw this movie and would definitely give it a 10 for acting. I would give it a 10 for storyline. I would give it a 10 for directing. The only question I have is why does Hollywood or maybe Ben Affleck feel that in order to convey strong emotion you have to have a lot of foul language in the movie? It just doesn't make sense. Take all of the curse words out of this movie and I say the movie would be a 10. But because of the foul language I knock it down to a 6. There are a lot of great movies out there with no foul language and they make a lot of money. Remember the Titans is a classic example. Movies that were made in black and white that people still enjoy today had no foul language. Come on Hollywood leave the foul language out and attract a broader audience. Come on Ben Affleck make a PG-13 movie with no bad language. I would recommend this if the language was out.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Affleck's Latest is an Enticing Blend of Fiction, Fact, Tragedy and Farce","Ben Affleck's Argo is a very good new movie about a very fake old movie, one ""made"" in Iran, during the volatile infant months of the Iranian Republic. Animated storyboard sketches at the beginning of the film offer a colourful crash course on Iran's revolutionary history up to late 1979 -the waning months of the Carter administration-, before Affleck jumps head first into his retelling of one thread in the Iranian Hostage Crisis, which saw 52 American embassy workers held captive for over a year.The opening sequence is electric, showing hundreds of outraged students surrounding the embassy in Tehran, and the workers inside nervously appraising the situation. The only thing keeping them together is the knowledge that the embassy is American soil, guarded by marines, gates, and high walls. Then, the unthinkable happens: one of the protesters climbs over the wall. Then another. And another, leading to a full-on invasion of the embassy. Much like the barbwire over the walls, the soldiers are only there to be a discouraging presence, not an actual defence; any shots fired would risk starting a war, leaving the Americans scrambling to destroy documents moments before their capture.An imagined sense of security is the first of many disguises, lies and imitations that constitute Argo's key fascination: falsehoods. When six of the Americans manage to flee to the home of an ambassador, the C.I.A. throws together a plan to exfiltrate the group by claiming they're a Canadian film crew, in Iran to scout locations for a new Star Wars rip-off, titled ""Argo"". The operation depends on creating a ruse so elaborate, and so intricate, that the mission's leader, Tony Mendez (Affleck), will be able to walk the fugitives -using assumed identities- through Tehran's heavily-guarded international airport, and onto a plane back home.Fake people and fake organizations with real motives all collide, and the most impactful objects aren't guns, they're stamps giving a seal of authenticity. The constant subterfuge creates a tonal dichotomy of tension and farce, with all the characters spinning their own brand of bullshit in order to save lives. Argo welcomely embraces the bullshit though, particularly in its second act, when Mendez brings in a Hollywood makeup artist (John Goodman) and an influential producer (Alan Arkin) to make his phoney movie look like the real deal. While the situation in Iran only intensifies the longer the Americans stay in hiding, the L.A. crew preps the rescue as if it were a human-heist movie. Titles like Mendez's Six, or The Tehran Job come to mind.Argo's mix of levity and suspense makes for a propulsive brio, but one that can create jarring contrast, such as a sequence that intercuts a convention-worthy table read of the fake movie's script, with hostages being lined up against a firing wall. While the Wag the Dog-style interplay between the entertainment business and covert government agencies is often very funny, it's sandwiched neatly between the dire opening, and the intense final third, which is mostly humourless, as it focuses on Mendez working with the hostages on their cover story.Mendez is as much an anchor as can be expected from a story that's more about events and environments than people, but Affleck makes him a compelling master of deception. The biggest lie he has to tell the rattled hostages is that he knows they'll make it out alright. Of course, history has already spoiled the end of the operation for us, so Argo tries to compensate by layering onto the facts with some additional fiction, which can undercut your appreciation for seeing real events recreated when the script feels the need to embellish them.But this is a crowed-pleaser, through and through, an Apollo 13 for the politically minded, and Affleck only ever feints at trying to deliver something more than a supremely well-executed thriller. In a recent interview, Paul Thomas Anderson claimed that having great actors was the key to his success, and if that's the bedrock for one of this generation's most celebrated directors, then it's no surprise that Affleck has managed such a strong career behind the camera, thanks to the kind of talent he can bring along with him. The actors are all excellent (Bryan Cranston in particular, as Tony's spitfire of a boss), the script is clean when doling out exposition, yet punchy when it needs to be, and Affleck directs everything with a sure hand.And it's that slavish devotion to making a the highest possible quality out of a familiar formula that makes Argo exceptionally good, but never great. When its blend of cloak 'n' dagger and showbiz bravado is really crackling, the film is effortlessly enjoyable, but one might hope a story of such great risks would merit a few of its own in the adaptation. I don't want to sound like i'm slagging on Affleck, but if he were to try pretending that he really is America's next great director -not simply its most reliable-, than he might turn out to be just that. Sometimes, you gotta fake it before you can make it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"""Zero Dark Thirty"" was better","Prior to the release of ""Argo"", I had never heard of the mission to rescue the six Americans from revolutionary Iran. The movie does open by talking about how the CIA overthrew Iran's democratically elected prime minister and left the shah in power to create a terror state. Unfortunately, the minimal focus on this leaves little understanding as to why Iran had the revolution, let alone why the Iranians took the hostages. It's especially important to understand this history given the tense relations between Washington and Tehran.Other than that, it's interesting seeing how they devised the plot to rescue the hostages in a scheme that involved Hollywood and the Canadian government. Even so, this was not the best movie of 2012. Even ""Zero Dark Thirty"" was better. ""The Master"", ""Lincoln"" and ""Django Unchained"" were among the best.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Best Bad Idea,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""Based on a true story"" is always a bit unsettling to see at the beginning of a movie. There are so many degrees to truth, that we are never really sure how big the dosage might be. With this film, we get the inside track on the all-too-familiar Iranian hostage situation that began on November 4, 1979 and ended 444 days later with the release of 52 U.S. Embassy workers. The story within that story is the focus ... six escaped as the Embassy was being seized.The film begins with a Cliff's Note history lesson on the fall of the U.S. backed Shah of Iran and the assumption of power by Ayatollah Khomeini. The six who escaped were welcomed into the home of the Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor (played with grace by Victor Garber). Of course, this had to be kept secret or a terrible situation could have taken a turn for the even-worse.This story really takes off when the CIA gets involved and drums up a scheme to extricate the six in hiding. Ben Affleck stars as Tony Mendez, the real life CIA Agent, who uses the international fascination with movies to create a plan that involves making a fake Star Wars rip-off with the help of award winning make-up artist John Chambers (Planet of the Apes) and a long-time and old school Hollywood producer named Lester Spiegel. These two inject the film with humor and positive energy as played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin. Their levity is much appreciated given the unrelenting tension delivered by the rest of the story.This is extraordinary filmmaking thanks to the script from Chris Terrio, realistic camera work from Rodrigo Prieto and top-notch directing by Ben Affleck ... yes, the same Ben Affleck who stars in the film. The team creates a period piece that has not just the look and feel of 1979-80, but some of the most gut-wrenching on screen tension since Three Days of the Condor or Munich. Many thrillers utilize car chases and gunfire. Here, we get personal tension thanks to politics and real life unknowns.The film is perfectly cast and strong support work is provided by Bryan Cranston as the CIA chief, Kyle Chandler as Hamilton Jordan, Bob Gunton as Cyrus Vance, as well as Chris Messina, Zeljko Ivanek, Richard Kind, Clea DuVall and Tate Donovan. There are also brief appearances by Philip Baker Hall, Adrienne Barbeau and the great Michael Parks.There are only two negatives to the film. First, Ben Affleck is miscast as Tony Mendez. The closing credits show what a perfect job they did in the rest of the cast, but to have a superhero looking American walking around Iran is certain to draw attention where it's not wanted. Plus, as director, Affleck suffers from Warren Beatty syndrome. He LOVES seeing his face on screen. The number of Alleck close-ups has to push 20. It's too much too often. Secondly, the final escape scene at the airport is just a bit too Hollywood and really stands out from the rest of the movie. There was no shortage of tension and the Armageddon style chase just looked cheesy.Those two things noted, this is Oscar material for sure. If you remember this era, the yellow ribbons and news clips featuring Cronkite, Koppel and Brokaw will bring back a frustrating time in U.S. history. If you are too young to remember, this acts as a reminder of just how powerful and quiet the CIA can be when it is doing its job properly.Don't miss the final credits as we hear Jimmy Carter narrate his memories as President, and we see real life photos of the six escapees.

Good.,"There is no doubt that Argo is well put together, but I am not sure that it deserves the 3 Oscars. Perhaps the Academy was surprised and impressed by just how well Afleck managed to pull this off and flattered by the self-referential content regarding the movie industry.The film takes on the story of the Canado-American mission to exfiltrate 6 US embassy workers during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979.The whole assault on the embassy is harrowing. It is intertwined with the real footage from the time, and the fear is palpable. The same goes for the final escape scene, where the writers clearly took some liberties with a fake chase.But this is the first issue with the movie. Of course, the movie is only based on the real story and is not the real story, therefore giving Afleck the creative liberty to do whatever he wants with the story, like giving most of the credit for the mission to the American agent. But it is surprising just how many scenes are made up for an event that is this recent and this well-documented. Usually, such a fictionalized approach is taken for events that are either very secret or happened thousands of years ago, so that there are blanks to be filled in by the film makers. However, with this hostage crisis, the facts are relatively well known, and reading the real story, there seem to have been enough exciting moments in the real story to fill the dramatic requirement of such a film.There is therefore a discrepancy between the film trying to be as realistic as possible in its presentation, while at the same time making a bunch of stuff up for dramatic effect. They got real footage from the event for one scene, but then made up the next scene.Once the plan to set up a fake movie production gets put in motion, the film becomes very humorous, underlining the ridiculous nature of the plan with such high stakes.High tension goes into overdrive any time we are in Iran. It's a shame this tension is reduced for anyone who knows how the story ends. There is a part when the whole operation is called off. Oh no! Now they will never escape?..Oh, right, you already know they will.Having said that, it is a testament to this movie's quality that the story remains interesting and tense, in spite of having a foretold ending.Argo was shot on 35 mm Techniscope and Super 8. It also uses a desaturated colour pallet. This creates the appearance of an old documentary. The makers nail the late 70s aesthetic, like the haircuts, the glasses and cars.There is some creative cinematography, like the shot of Afleck facing Khomeini's poster upon arrival, but most of the situations are very interpersonal, and therefore do not offer an opportunity for flashy visuals. There is a lot of handheld camera, where appropriate, and the close ups to make you feel like you're standing there with these people.Bryan Cranston gives an excellent performance of a person under stress and John Goodman sells a few excellent lines. I can't imagine how all these actors managed to go through their lines without breaking and laughing. Affleck's character is very calm and showing little emotion, so he is more of a vehicle for the viewer. The rest of the cast do the heavy lifting. Alan Arkin's performance earned him an Oscar nomination, which is another nomination I don't understand, because I feel like this guy is not acting at all. He is just saying stuff in the same manner as he does off-camera.Given the movie's treatment of the story, it would've been better if the story was completely fictional. Argo is then a fairly tense, well paced and well directed film. That is all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Although it blends its humour and tension very well, it ends up compromising to the point where it's just average. True or not, the ending doesn't satisfy what it builds up.","Ben Affleck has been slowly redeeming himself the past 5 years with his turn behind the camera with Gone Baby Gone, The Town and now Argo, one of the most hyped up films of the year to the point where it's a serious Best Picture contender. The only thing I think it potentially deserves is the screenplay which is excellent. But in execution, it's a really rough around the edges film, with (deliberately) sloppy cinematography and editing for the 70s feel, but it sacrifices tension and clarity too often. While it does a good job of delivering its exposition, sometimes it's at such quick pace that it's difficult to follow every piece. However, it does a great job of feeling both intimate and cinematic, feeling like a human story and a politically important story. I was very excited for this film earlier this year from the promo pictures and the promise of Bryan Cranston in second billing, but the trailer had me very worried that the thriller aspects and the comedy romp aspects would not gel together.Fortunately, in the film, it's utterly seamless and they blend together very appropriately but it's the little parts that don't feel like they add up which hold the film back. Many times I was thinking ""this could be even more tense."" It is a very good film, but it does feel too middle of the road and playing it safe when it could've been bold. The climax was something in particular I found unsatisfying as they built it up a lot and never paid it off adequately. It does seem that Ben Affleck has been enjoying a lot of TV lately as it was fun to TV celebrity spot. Scoot McNairy is a particularly great performance and was completely invisible as I didn't recognise him from when I loved him in Killing Them Softly. Argo does have its merits and ties together very well, even if it never feels like it touches its potential. Lets not give Affleck too big a confidence boost just yet or he'll continue not fulfilling his potential.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Argo See it!,"Another weekend arrives and so too comes another round of movies. To start things off I went with my friend to see Ben Affleck's newest film entitled Argo. Not only does Mr. Affleck star in this movie, but he was also the producer and director of the film as well, which has me worried he's following in Stallone's footsteps. Regardless, for those who haven't seen the trailers playing the last four months, Argo focuses on the Iranian crisis, in which 60 American hostages were held hostage by the Iranian public. Six of the hostages, played by numerous people, escape to the Canadian ambassador's house, where they hide from the radical soldiers. To help get these six out, the government sends in Tony Mendez (Affleck) a CIA specialist who has a crazy idea to get them out, produce a fake movie with the fugitives being the crew of the movie.So what can I say about this movie that is based on a true story. The answer is a lot of things, starting with the visuals of the movie. Argo's setting is well put together, taking a combination of three worlds and blending them into an amazing blast into the past. The hectic streets of Iran, the busy high and mighty world of Hollywood, and the stern, secretive halls of the CIA building are captured in very minute details. What does this mean to the audience? Well for me it helped pull me into the movie, helping me feel that I was a part of 1970/1980 world. Complementing the detailed settings is the integration of news clips from this time, blending them smoothly into the modern day filming. Instead of overdoing the news clips though, Affleck sparingly used these clips at just the right moments, my favorites being the Jimmy Carter addresses to the public. However, the setting and edition can only do so much, but none of it is possible without good camera work, and Argo does indeed have that. The visual crew managed to choose just the right angle to capture the emotions of the scene helping to bring out the chaos, intensity, and torment that filled the crisis. As a finishing touch, the grainy filter helped add a little edge to the film, making the movie seem like a live documentary.Although the camera-work was impressive, the acting was also another component that helped bring the movie alive. Affleck did a nice job playing the CIA agent role, using his lady pleasing scowl to mirror his intense nature. Bryan Cranston who played Mendez's boss was also well done, as Cranston's strong face and rough voice gave the character an edge that promoted challenge and driving force. As for the hostages, well they definitely looked the part with their 70's hairstyles and aviator glasses, but aside from some occasional spurts of dialog their facial expressions did most of the talking. My favorite actors had to be Alan Arkin and John Goodman, the two movie men who were the backbone of the Argo project. Both of these seasoned actors were hilarious, essentially a real life Statler and Waldorf who were happy to insult almost every aspect of the Hollywood world. My buddy and I couldn't help, but laugh as the two ridiculed the politics and laziness of the movie magic world, constantly working the system of corrupt agents and lawyers who were looking for a quick buck. The dynamic duo delivered there incredible dialog perfectly, adding another level to help the words strike home. These two may have made up a large percentage of why I enjoyed this movie.Argo has a lot of other qualities that make this a movie worth watching. For the older generation who lived through this event, the adapted story will most likely be nostalgic, especially the riots and new clips of incidents. Drama lovers will get their fill as well, as just about every group in this movie has some type of issue or struggle they have to overcome. As for suspense, well that really doesn't come till about the final thirty minutes of the movie, but once it arrives you may find yourself at the edge of your seat, (unless you remember the reality of the situation). People who enjoy making fun of countless systems will also be entertained by this film. As stated earlier, Goodman and Arkin's characters basically throw Hollywood under the bus, from getting contracts to designing a fake story. Those who love seeing government agencies getting shot down and made fun of, are also going to enjoy this film as well. While it's not like a typical comedy where the actors say lines that are targeted at the government, Argo instead uses the setting to make fun of it. When Affleck demands action, the big wigs instead say they have a meeting scheduled or say that's not allowed. The writers also threw a couple of quick dialog jabs in there to help bring some diversity to the humor, which also brought on some laughs. Of course those that are easily offended by such humor, or greatly support our political system's endeavors are going to be less amused. I'll also take this time to say that those who don't like seeing humans painted as monsters/animals are going to be angry at this movie as well. The combination of camera work and acting show the darker side of humans, and I'm sure there will be news stories of people offended by the portrayal of both Americans and Iranians. The only big error I can mention on this movie is that some editing could have been done about halfway through to make the movie a little shorter. Needless to say I enjoyed Argo a lot, and encourage you to see this movie in theaters, or at least catch in on Netflix.

Fabulous movie,"We lived in Iran during the 70's for four years and this movie took me right back. I rarely get that emotionally involved in a movie,but this one was different. The scene where they are in the VW driving slowly through a crowd and the crowd is beating on the car really scared me since I was caught out in a mob where they were bouncing my small car around and I think it would have been much worse, but I saw as one man looked into my car, saw the children and then told everyone there were children in the car and let me go. Please know that this behavior is not indicative of the average Iranian...they are really wonderful people and treated us beautifully while we lived there.

Thriller which should be more thrilling,"Argo is based on a true story. Somewhat loosely based it will turn out. Director Ben Affleck bends some historical truths in an attempt to make his film more exciting. The story of the rescue of six American diplomats from Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis is certainly compelling. But it turns out the real-life story, ironically involving a fake Hollywood movie, was not dramatic enough for a real Hollywood movie. Affleck had to jazz things up, create tension in places where there really was none. That effort fails largely because some of the fake incidents Affleck throws in are such obvious Hollywood creations. No way it happened like that you're thinking as you watch the movie. All the contrived razor-tight close calls fall flat and actually come across as a little silly. Silly is not what you're looking for as you ramp up to the big finish of a thriller. Seeing as it is more or less a true story, meaning you know the ending, it is admittedly hard to create that great dramatic tension. Some films which tell true stories overcome this problem better than others. Apollo 13 comes to mind, that was real edge of the seat stuff. Argo is not. It's not nearly as gripping and exciting as you would hope. Affleck seemed to realize this and tried desperately hard to make it more exciting but those efforts end up hurting the film more than helping it.So this is a bad movie then? No, not at all. It's a good movie, maybe not as good as you would hope, maybe not Oscar-worthy but good nonetheless. Yes it has its flaws but the overall package is more than acceptable. It is a great story, the CIA working with Hollywood to create a fake movie to get Americans out of Iran. It's in the putting together of that fake film that Argo really shines. The inside Hollywood stuff, helped immensely by great performances from Alan Arkin and John Goodman, works really well. Bryan Cranston also does fine work, bringing good energy to his role as a CIA supervisor involved in putting the plan together. The one real flat performance unfortunately comes from the star, Affleck himself. He plays CIA operative Tony Mendez, the man who will ultimately go to Iran to get the Americans out. And Affleck doesn't bring much to the role. Everyone around him is more interesting than he is. It's an oddly bland character, the guy is supposed to be some kind of CIA super-spy but there's very little personality there. The gang of six who are to be rescued don't infuse the film with much life either. We don't really get to know those characters very well which maybe doesn't make us as invested in their fate as the film needs us to be to really succeed.There is a lot to quibble with but there is a lot to recommend the film as well. The opening scene of the Iranian takeover of the American embassy is brilliantly done. The film may lack some needed tension later on but this opening gives the film a thoroughly gripping start. The real-life plan to extricate the six Americans was brilliant and this film does an excellent job as it puts that plan together. It's a story which has to be seen to be believed. The story draws you in and you expect the big, dramatic payoff to come with the ultimate rescue. But that rescue is not as exciting as you would hope. Affleck tries really hard to make it more thrilling. But he tried too hard, forced it too much. Much of the film's final act comes off as much too fake. You know it didn't happen like that so you don't really buy in. Couple that with the sense of inevitability that lingers with any true-life story in which you know the outcome and these final scenes can't help but be a little disappointing. It's a good effort from director Affleck but there is the nagging sense this film got much more acclaim than it deserved. A good film but greatness definitely eludes it. And movie star Affleck didn't help director Affleck very much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Perhaps Not the Best Film of 2012, But A Darn Fine Film","A dramatization of the 1980 joint CIA-Canadian secret operation to extract six fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of revolutionary Iran.Roger Ebert calls the film ""spellbinding and surprisingly funny."" He points to John Goodman and Alan Arkin as the source of the laughs (and this is undebatably true). David Edelstein concurs, saying, ""Arkin and Goodman have the only colorful parts in Argo. The six fugitive Americans are like glorified extras."" This brings up an interesting point: this is the story of how the CIA rescued six Americans, but not a story about six Americans who were rescued by the CIA. There is a second story in here that can still be told.Ebert further writes that ""Affleck is brilliant at choreographing the step-by-step risks that the team takes in exiting Tehran."" I have followed Ben's career for almost twenty years, starting with ""Mallrats"" (1995), and this is the first time I have ever read the words ""Affleck is brilliant"". If this is the last time, I would hardly be surprised.But seriously, Affleck's fall (the Bennifer years) have given way to Affleck's rise. Perhaps the only way he could get higher than he is right now is by giving up acting altogether and focusing solely on directing and producing. Because, for me, the biggest problem -- heck, maybe the only problem -- with ""Argo"" was that it starred Ben Affleck. His presence on screen always seems to have a layer of cheese just beneath the surface. (He wanted Brad Pitt for the part... and frankly, that would not have been any better.)As I write this, Affleck has just won Best Director and Best Picture from the Golden Globes, and the film is a contender for Best Picture at the Academy Awards (with Affleck's directing not even nominated there). While I have not seen any of the other contenders yet (and am therefore merely speculating), I find these wins hard to believe. Certainly, the film and direction are quite good and worthy of nomination, but if this was the best film of 2012, I feel like we might have been shortchanged.Although, perhaps I am being too harsh. We have here a story that is well-told, well-paced, well-acted... with elements of suspense, humor and enough realism to educate people about a time in American (and Iranian) history that perhaps is not as not ""common knowledge"" as it should be. There was no effort to throw in a forced, pointless romance. Exaggerations only existed where necessary to heighten the tension.I will have to return to this after further thought and seeing other contenders to make a proper comparison. But one thing is for sure: all eyes will be on Affleck to see what project he chooses next.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Suspenseful and Satisfying,"An unbelievable look at a CIA operation by an unsung hero. While I did not myself research the history of this operation, I have put my faith in writers, and have to say, it's an amazing story. Many covert operations are ignored, and Argo gives the viewers a unique opportunity to see the inner workings of such an operation. As a movie, it was brilliant. The acting and visuals were unbelievable, and the straight building of suspense was out of control. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. There was just the right amount of humour, although, I wouldn't have minded a few more moments with our 'Hollywood' members.The shocking moments and visuals were breathtaking, and amazingly, were copied directly from historical pictures (as shown) which I think was so creative and so striking. It really made the story 'real' and not just 'inspired by true events' like the Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Definitely stay after the credits.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

What I can say though is that, as a piece of entertainment, 'Argo' is well-made and interesting.I liked the informative start to the film - I assume that bit was accurate at least? It makes for a refreshing change to the many biographical films that give little or no background to the events that occur and instead rely on the existing knowledge of the audience.'Argo' is a well-made and, at times, unexpectedly funny film.

Middle East bad guys thwarted by the CIA and Hollywood,"Although ostensibly this is a movie involving hostages, ultimately you probably won't really care that much about their fate because they are never fully or even partially developed as real people who gain our empathy.

No significant or serious political issues are fully explored although the top notch cast is compelling and there is some good dialog. This is a film that wants to be taken seriously yet lacks gravitas especially considering it is a work of historical fiction as admitted by its creators.

Argo,"Review By Kamal KBen Affleck's ""Argo"" is a masterfully-told story of the successful effort to smuggle 6 American diplomats out of Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis. Supported by a terrific cast including Alan Arkin, Bryan Cranston and John Goodman, Affleck creates a terrific balance of emotion, humor and suspense as he takes us through different locations and periods on the timeline of the recon operation, in Cranston's character's words ""the best bad idea we have"". The attention to detail is amazing, and the movie works on so many levels, never slowing down until its thrilling climax.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Far better than I expected.,"As I said, Argo took both of us by surprise; we only knew the basic framework of the story and we were both unprepared for the intensity of the unfolding drama that to us seemed to begin in the first minutes of the show.I admit to not being an Affleck fan but kudos to where they belong; his direction was masterful as well as his portrayal of Tony Mendez who was on camera so much during the film. I am also not a fan of Hollywood movies but when the guys in Tincletown get it right, they can produce movies that are unique to them; even the bad Disney movies with talking animals is unique (what else can you say about them).I cannot say much about Argo. I have never been in Ira; I only know their great revolution from history and regarding the American hostage situation, my information is conspiratorial from progressive web sites. Those sites are fascinating with darkened reflections on the election of Reagan followed the next day by a deal to free the hostages. It was all too clever and coincidental for belief.I would strongly suggest that you watch the film. It is very good, in our humble opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Good solid film that is as relevant today as it was when it first came out,"Congratulations to Ben Affleck - he did a masterful job directing the film, while playing the important miraculous center pillar character of the script - Tony Mendez.There are those who argue about the 'truth' of the film however it is all glossed over by the first statement - Based on a true story - meaning this is not a documentary and to create the tension and suspense (even if you know the end) and the pace of bringing this to the screen - well worth all the 'facts' that aren't as clean and clear as many would believe or desire.But this is a film - and brings you into the historic moments with both real footage and reenactments.I don't want to give anything away if you haven't seen the film - it's too good.Acting is great, Alan Arkin is perfect, John Goodman couldn't be better - everyone - was well cast.Going back to Ben Affleck - taking an intriguing story with moments of a large cast interwoven with an ensemble cast - hats off to you Ben - and that the Academy ignored you - well Barbra Streisand was never nominated for Best Director and her masterpiece YENTL although a completely different genre - is equally great to your film.Go see it and if you are a film student study it - the music, pacing, casting, script, locations, props, costuming, the history - the era - wow!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A well made film that thrives on strategy, and luck and a bit of calmness and composure.","A well made film that thrives on strategy, and luck and a bit of calmness and composure.Sure, Ben Affleck has come a long way from a Good Will Hunting Script to this film named ARGO. Don't ask me why was it named ARGO, and why the caption reads, the movie is fake, the mission is real. If you want to know better see the film. There are a few things I liked and a few things I disliked about this.The things I liked are the production design of setting up a 1970's troubled Iran and making us believe how real the whole film was, it showed a great depiction of the Iran Hostage crisis. The sound was great too. The performances by almost everyone were great and I loved John Goodman and above all Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez. Now, this is a real story so we are bound and handcuffed not to disagree with a few things, like how come a sudden idea sprung up to Tony and how is it approved by CIA. It happened and so we see. All, in all, I liked the sound, production, casting and acting.Now the things I disliked was creation of a forced drama in the climax where they are caught then relieved again a fact comes to the rebels notice and they rush to stop the plane. I did not think that cinematically, it was so very needed we do not have to make a climax out of nothing. In reality, a call would have stopped the plane from take off. So this is where the director Ben Affleck needs to improve, yes undoubtedly he made a good film but if he wants to be more real and less cinematic, he needs to take out a few formulaic things. The direction has indeed faltered in few places like factually, 1950's depiction of the speeches, but I did give in to all the factual faults just that it was a bit more simpler and bit more restrained. Even the rushing up of getting an idea of making a film and getting an approval was not to my complete liking, had that been more restraint and more thought of, I would have loved that.By far, this comes as one of the better movies of the year and what it got is an Oscar, not sure if that actually deserved coz I like Amour more than any other film of last year as I saw till now. But surely, barring Amour, this may have been the best bet with what it had, it had a realistic appeal like that of Hurt Locker, an entertaining element like that of a King's Speech, where our hero is relieved from what he has achieved. So it's good good and good but I am not sure if it's a great film, I have so many questions in my own tiny mind that keep getting back and asking me, is this the movie of the year and the answer I got after watching this not once, but twice is that ""I don't think so, there are better movies than this for sure"" But who needs my likes and dislikes, the majority rules this world and since the majority feels that this is the best movie for them, this won the accolades all over. Mind you, this a thrilling documentary nevertheless and if you see it as a documentary film, then this is as fine as it gets, but as a dramatic film, it falls shirt a bit only.Ben, sure boy you did a great job, but I wanna see you in a better director's hat than this one. I am going with 3/5 for a sure good film but I better hope for a better film next time from this director.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
It's just a movie!!!!,"I was around 15 years old at the time of US embassy being taken and vaguely remember this being on the news. I certainly remember the images that were shown on TV. I LIKED THIS MOVIE. It was a small snippet of the bigger picture and i refused to let myself get bogged down with trivialities as creative input. the basics of the story are based on fact and thats good enough for me. It is not a documentary or anti-Iranian propaganda and i can't help but feel irritated when people complain that this is not what happened. according to Wikipedia - it is! I'ts just been ""jazzed"" up to fill up a couple of hours. It had an authentic feel about it, and I felt the characters portrayed what fear they must of been going through in such an unsettling and fearful time. Ben Affleck took the time to realize that this was not a film about him but let the supporting cast take the spotlight. Very mature for such an up and coming player in the movie world. I am looking forward to see what else he pulls out of his bag of tricks. I will certainly be adding Argo to my movie collection and rate it highly up there with other great ""true stories"" like Alive, Apollo 13, Munich, Schindlers List etc. I would of liked to see more of the actual hostage situation but that might be for another movie.Quick footnote: here in New Zealand there was a small outrage with the particular line ""New Zealand said no"". In fact the NZ embassy was unable to help in this situation due to political restraints. However what was not shown in the film was the covert behind the scenes help the NZ and a few other embassies provided. As in food, clothing, transportation and relaying information to the US.So remember folks ""its just a movie"" made to entertain and evoke emotion. Argo certainly did this for me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The scenes and period touches were so well done the effect was like a mental time-capsule for myself and others of similar age who've seen the movie. Well done Mr Affleck.On a personal note, I'm saddened that the sacrifices of my friends and co-workers on the ill- fated rescue mission authorized by President Carter didn't rate a mention.

Probably the best edge-of-the-seat thriller of 2012,"This is one of the best edge-of-the-seat thriller of the year (Currently has an IMDb rating of 8.4, which will take it to the top 50 films of all times). Ben Affleck pulls off an outstanding performance as the actor and a director. It is a real life story of an attempt to rescue six US embassy staff caught up in Iran around the time Iranian revolution, while another 52 are being held hostage in the American embassy at the same time. The rescue plan hatched by CIA is totally outrageous, and there is almost no chance of it succeeding, but it is pitched as the ""best bad plan"" under the circumstances.Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) lands in Iran in a hostile environment with most Iranians harbouring deep mistrust and hatred against the USA, and the revolutionary guards hunting down Americans and American sympathisers. And CIA is concerned that to have their operatives caught inside Iran would be a massive embarrassment for the USA. Also a failure of the mission would mean death for all the hostages, and even for the Canadian ambassador and his wife who have have helped harbour the Americans. Just as Mendez is all set to roll out the escape plan, CIA gets cold feet and the whole plan is ordered to be shut down. He alone has to take a decision if he should still take-on the responsibility for the hostages and to help them or not (this part is apparently stretching the actual story a bit, but what the heck, it is all beautifully done).Every element of this movie has been crafted to perfection – reproduction of actual events, the casting, the makeups (must see the closing credits for the references), capturing the chaos of the revolution on-ground, and the whole feel of the 1970's. Even the film processing gives it a 70s feel. The dialogues are sparkling (""If we wanted applause, we would have joined the circus"" ) and keep you engaged. There aren't many films where the audience break into spontaneous applause as the story unfolds. By the end you are emotionally invested in the outcome and Ben Affleck doest let go of you off the hook till the end.Go watch My rating – 9/10 (from www.Rahulbalyan.com)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

He's a very good director and I'll absolutely go see his next flick but i've got to say that TheTtown was much more enjoyable than Argo. It deserves praise as a decent movie and another solid directorial effort by Affleck. But it should not be nominated for any Oscars.

Dedicated  & suspenseful if unilluminating recreation from unpopular U.S. modern era,"This reviewer still owns an original copy of Jim Steranko's Mediascene Prevue Magazine, which states in a 3-page advance story on the upcoming movie version of Roger Zelazny's novel 'Lord of Light' in mid-1980 that famed comic artist Jack Kirby would be the film's visual concept artist. Amidst some large sized blowups of Kirby's sketches, the artist (known to have been a stereotypically jovial and saucy personality in the tough, deadline-demanding comics industry trade of the time) is quoted in a strangely awed and subdued manner this time. (""This film is going to have tremendous impact on the world. It will allow Eastern and Western Man to relate to each other...I believe the way we're conceiving this film could contribute to saving the world."", {Issue 41, Vol. 2, No. 1, pg. 26}. Mr. Kirby (portrayed by Michael Parks) is practically non-existent in Ben Affleck's dramatization of the events surrounding the use of the unmade film's material by the CIA during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-80. But the resulting film--titled ARGO in tribute to agent Tony Mendez' (Affleck) retitling of ""Lord of Light"" to create a bogus film company team that would be a cover for 6 State Dept. employees that he would try to sneak out of Iran before they could be captured by the military and possibly killed--is a concise, decently-staged, well paced caper film that recalls quieter, purposeful, politically informed works that were quite common during the intense days of the US/Russian Cold War by directors like Martin Ritt, Alan Pakula or John Frankenheimer. Mr. Affleck as director is not quite there yet in high-technical expertise of the medium as those three but the film's low-keyed photographic color tones, good contrasts in his art direction and props as the hostages see their world of mechanics and expensive travel replaced with ancient stone, wood, and handspun fabrics and circular containment, and his crosscutting between three separate story lines begins placing his craft toward their related achievements (the bogus film production in Hollywood includes the real-life makeup artist John Chambers {John Goodman, an uncannily accurate portrayal} calling in some old friends in the industry to help out including a rough-hewn film producer {Alan Arkin} who slowly sees the mission as a way of regaining some ethical ideals he appears to have lost in himself over many years. The third storyline at the CIA with Mendez' boss {Bryan Cranston, who provides a superb moment in his performance during a bureaucratic snag during the climax} is the most directly wordy and not entirely epic of the three (Affleck laudably has several real-life personalities from Pres. Jimmy Carter's top administration as characters riding herd or clearing the increasingly difficult details of the mission yet they don't quite come across as powerful or accurate as they should {Where was Chief of Staff's Hamilton Jordan's native North Carolina accent?}). Yet the film's central narrative trajectory--with Affleck being able to keep his very numerous locations and group motions distinct and geometrically designed to bring the small group of seven people finally--to the Swiss Air boarding gate at Tehran Airport and the edge of escape and freedom. Ultimately a thriller/suspense film merely dusted by politics (answering or correcting the supposed inaccuracies and dramatic liberties would probably have required an additional hour's length minimum), Ben Affleck's ARGO does at least very respectfully illuminate in both a Hollywood-nostalgic and Washington-heroic manner a frustrating and downbeat era regarding the Middle East for many Americans where (until between the release of the remaining Iranian hostages and the death of Osama bin Laden) the good guys actually scored a victory.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Cant believe they made it this good,"I actually read the whole episode (the actual one) before going to the movie and I still cant believe they made such a good movie out of it. The story as you might know, is about the hostage crisis in Iran, when the US embassy was stormed by the Iran guards. The chronological sequence of events leading to the storming of the embassy is nicely explained in the beginning of the movie, the storming itself is well captured. The story focus on 6 US embassy staff who manage to escape the storming and hide in a Canadian Embassy household. A CIA operative works out a plan about a fake movie location scope out along with a Hollywood make-up man and producer, and convinces the US government to go along with it. The movie explains whether his attempt becomes a failure or success with an incredible amount of suspense. The acting itself is top notch starting with Ben Affleck. The incredible thing was the suspense they manage to create till the very end of the film. The film has a good dose of humor especially involving Ben Affleck, the camera man and the producer which helps move the story along. The gravity of the situation in Iran is never allowed to be forgotten with scenes involving executions of Iranians by the revolutionary guards. Thankfully the politics of the situation is never brought up as to who is right or wrong. The direction is handled extremely well by Affleck and I am sure he will get a nod during the awards season.

Argo is a stunning achievement!,"Some stories are so incredible, they can only be true. Argo is one such story.In the year 1979, the Iranian revolution erupted in an attempt to overthrow the ruling monarch of the Pahlavi dynasty and replace him with religious leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, for a US and UK backed coup that saw him rise to power, and for human rights violations during his years in power.During the revolution, the American embassy in Iran was overthrown by revolutionaries, who then held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days in captivity.But unknown to them, six American diplomats escaped, and found shelter in the Canadian Ambassador's house. They were in hiding for 79 days since rescuing them was considered too risky. This was the status quo, until a CIA exfiltration specialist, Tony Mendez, came up with an incredulous plan: He would create a fake Hollywood science fiction movie, pose as its producer on location scout to the exotic Middle East, fly in solo to Tehran and fly out with the six Americans pretending to be his crew. Mendez's movie, Argo, was fake, but his mission was real. And in the words of Ben Affleck's new film based on this astonishing true story, ""it was the best bad idea"" they had.Affleck's third feature film as a director, Argo, presents this unbelievable hostage rescue mission on screen as a taut, well-paced suspense thriller with so much palpable tension throughout that along with you and the entire audience, even the seats, the popcorn, the soft drinks and other inanimate objects are on edge. You know the story but the drama of how it unfolds is of aiming-for-an-Oscar-nod quality, with powerful questions about morality, humanity and the wretched politics of it all intermingled with pulp Hollywood elements of 'Oh My God! What's going to happen next?' 'Kill the evil bas***ds, I say! Kill them all!' 'Nooo! Please don't let the good guys be caught!' and 'THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER *Orgasm*'Yes, the thing that elevates Argo from gritty art cinema that people would watch only after finding out that it's been nominated for an Oscar is that apart from being a classy period film about one of the ""highest- rated"" hostage dramas in history, the movie is spectacularly entertaining too. Affleck pulls out all stops to add enough ""dramatic elements,"" as he referred to them in a press conference, to make the movie that gives you hope, inspiration and the feel-good aftereffect, one that also provides you with the kind of potboiler twists, turns and unexpected laugh-out-loud moments that would make James Cameron proud.The entire cast is terrific, led by Affleck himself playing Mendez in the movie, but veteran acting legends, John Goodman and Alan Arkin steal the show with their delivery of some of the smartest lines on film this year. ""You want to come into Hollywood and act like a big shot without doing anything?"" rhetorically asks Goodman's character John Chambers, who was awarded CIA's highest civilian honour in real life, to Mendez in the movie. ""You'll fit right in!"" he answers with a punchline. Arkin's character of director Lester Siegel who takes it upon himself to not just make a fake movie, but a ""fake hit"" gives the movie it's most quotable phrase, ""Argo f**k yourself!""Unarguably, the full credit of one of the movies of the year goes to director Affleck, who has transformed himself from the guy best-known for being Jennifer Lopez' ex-boyfriend (aka the Ben-part of 'Bennifer'), Matt Damon's Sudama-type best friend and managing to pull off what is known as ""one of the worst movies ever made"", Gigli, to possibly, the next Clint Eastwood of direction.Affleck's embarrassing filmography as an actor has given way to an accomplished, assured and formidable filmography as a writer-director, one that only keeps getting better with every film. Watch Affleck's first two directorial ventures, the intelligent Gone Baby Gone and the gritty The Town to know why Affleck is one of the industry's brightest upcoming directors, who seems to have only gotten started. And of course, do *not* miss Argo this week because it is a stunning achievement in direction, screen writing, acting and filmmaking itself.Some stories are so incredible, they can only be true.

I really appreciated how they stuck to the facts and didn't let politics enter the picture, but watching the riots and protests makes you realize things haven't changed much in that country and probably never will. This movie actually has made me want to follow-up on that part of history. I thought Ben gave a subdued performance and was very serious, whereas some felt he was terrible. I appreciated that he didn't overact, which he sometimes does. All in all this is definitely worth the price of a ticket.

Not wholly true but wholly suspenseful,"Rarely can a film title have been so unilluminating about its subject matter - in this case, the astonishing true life story of how six Americans stationed in the US Embassy in Teheran when it was stormed in 1979 managed to walk out and take refuge with the Canadian Ambassador before being spirited out of the country by a bizarre CIA operation, the details of which were only declassified in 1997. ""Argo"" was the title of a science fiction film which was actually scripted but never made and provided the cover for the six who amazingly pretended to be a scouting crew for the planned movie.The work opens with a rapid-fire post-Secomd World War history of Iran which makes plain why many Iranians are suspicious of the West (the Americans and British arranged a coup in 1953 against the democratically elected Prime Minister). It then shows the 1979 storming of the embassy by fundamentalist forces in a style that is so real it is almost documentary (the credits show contemporary photographs which underline the verisimilitude of the movie). Most of the film, though, focuses on the planning and execution of the exfiltration (as the CIA termed it) by the Agency's top 'exfil' guy Tony Mendez. The final segment, a bit of post-escape bonhomie, should have been excised.in some ways, this cannot have been an easy film to make because we all know the outcome from the beginning and for this incredible tale to be credible on the screen it could not depart too much from the facts (it is unfair to Britain's role), so Ben Affleck as director has done a terrific job in sustaining the tension without adding too much fiction and his portrayal of Mendez is convincingly understated (this is an agent who never fires gun or even wields a fist but relies solely on guile and sheer guts). Among a fine cast of support actors, the stand out is Alan Arkin as a veteran Hollywood producer.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Very good, informative and very well made movie.","The movie excellently depicts the atmosphere in the 70-s in Teheran. The documentary component was making the story real. And the character of Tony was cool. While the storyline was focused on the actual event, it would be great to learn a bit more about some life details of the six diplomats. Perhaps the adrenaline would work stronger if some of the dangerous clips were lasting a bit longer. It was all recorded in a flash kind of pace. Not enough was 'told' about the other side to be absorbed as the enemy. After the attack on the American Embassy the Americans were under scrutiny in Iran. Everybody speaking fluent English was eventually a suspect of being an American. A couple of developed Iranian characters, searching for and hunting the Americans in Iran at that time would perhaps add more flavor to the movie. Still, it was a well spent time watching Argo. It is a movie not to be missed out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Accurate/False movie,"This movie seemed more of a documentary for me, as it portrays mostly accurate events which happened in the escape of these 6 Americans. The beginning was quite slow, but got interesting as the movie developed. What I disliked about the movie was how inaccurate they portrayed the country of Iran, and the Iranian people.For example playing Arabic shaheeds a numerous amount of times in the city of Iran which is a PERSIAN city filled with Persian people, not Arabic - even the prayer that comes on in Iran is mostly in Farsi, not Arabic.I also disliked the image and portrayal it gave to the Iranian people, it made it seem as if every single Iranian in the country of Iran wanted to mutilate the 6 Americans that were disguised as Canadians.So as I was saying, i'm giving it a 6 for the accurate events.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
This is the best bad idea we have,"The story behind Argo is so extraordinary that it hard to believe and that it couldn't be made up. But it is history and after making two successful Boston set crime thrillers, Ben Affleck has stepped out his comfort zone to make a historic spy thriller.In 1979 the Iranian Shah has been overthrown by the Islamic Revolution and the American is the Great Satan for their support for the dictator. The American Embassy is under siege and on 4th November the Iranians overtake the embassy and hold the Americans hostage. But six Americans escape before the invasion and find sanctuary at the Canadian ambassador's (Victor Garber) home. In Washington D.C. the CIA and State Department have few options to get the Americans out: they cannot use the usual cover identity of journalists, charity workers and English teachers. One expert at extracting people, Tony Mendez (Affleck) comes up with an unconventional way of extraction, pretend the Americans are all part of an Canadian film crew on a location scout and goes to Hollywood to form a fake production company.Affleck has already shown himself to be a skilled director and Argo shows he is one of the best thriller directors around. Argo is different to his previous two films and Affleck was able to balance the tension and thrills with healthy amount of humour, satirising Hollywood and Washington. One of my favourite scenes that shows this is the fake film has a press conference intercut with the Americans in Iran watching an Iranian spokeswoman and Jimmy Carter making a speech. Alan Arkin supplied plenty of humour as the guff, old film producer, but it was never his expense. Bryan Cranston also has some fun lines. But for the most part the film is serious and the stakes as people's lives are on the line and there is every chance the Iranians can find. In the background the Iranians are reconstructing documents that can show who the missing Americans are and their counter intelligence operation is always on the go.Argo is filled with period detail and does an excellent job blending a realistic spy operation and how the CIA operates with a more outrageous operation. It makes an interesting counter to piece to the Bond and Bourne series and the very realistic Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. This is a film that shows a CIA operation is all about the details, making sure there are no holes in cover stories, all the documentation is correct, etc. There is no gun play and the whole point is the CIA are trying to avoid any conformation, especially any situation could lead to a war.I am personally a history, politics and spy nut, so this film was always going to appeal to me. The spying preparations were interesting but some of the moments I really enjoyed was some of the discussions between the characters, particularly the Americans in Iran about what's happening: it felt very real and nature, like there people really living in the time period, not a screenplay benefiting from hindsight.Whilst the film is strong throughout the story does take a few liberties, namely making out Britain and New Zealand in Iran were useless when they were involved in the operation and nor showing Canadian Intelligence's part in the operation when in reality they must have been involved seeing it involved their ambassador. Also the final third of the film felt like everything that can go wrong will go wrong, building up the tension. But it all felt a bit too fault when so much bad stuff is happening, when the characters' nerves would have enough to build the tension.Argo is a very enjoyable adult film that is deserving of its steady box-office success. It should get a few Oscar nominations and it does entertain.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Biggest Upset At the Academy Awards,"Before I get into it winning Best Picture, I'll actually review the movie. One word... boring. You could argue the opening was exciting, but it wasn't at all and the characters that were taken hostage at the U.S. embassy were beyond bland. The only positive thing I have to say for this movie is the acting of Alan Arkin and John Goodman, and the rest is negative. Ben Affleck was one of the most boring leading actors I've seen in a movie, and I felt the screenplay would've been adapted into a much better movie with a better director and cast. This movie is also, purely lazy considering we ONLY get to see the ""safer"" hostages while we hear nothing of the other hundred or so that were being tortured. If the Academy would've went with another Best Picture with this genre, Zero Dark Thirty could've won, I would've been happy with any other nominee winning Best Picture winning, and I was in for a devastating blow when this crap won. The fact people could really like this movie is beyond me. My personal pick was between Silver Linings Playbook and Life of Pi for Best Picture... Oh well, maybe next year will be better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Lies and propaganda,"My review was approved at first by IMDb, but then the next day they silently removed it without any notification! This NEVER happened to me or friends of mine before, so this movie must get a lot of bad reviews that they try to limit, I guess! Well here it is again, assuming IMDb ""made a mistake"" (which in this case is hard to imagine). To IMDb: If you do not place this review, that please re-instate the old approved one, thanks!Mr. Affleck does his normal wooden acting, earns some millions, gets the awards they promised him, gets his head on the poster and DVD packaging etc for vanity reasons. And the rest of the team never thought about anything but the money they would earn from making this film, not about the effects of it.Some effects:Canadians hate that the escape looks like an American CIA operation, just Google: ""Canadian Caper"" and find the real info on Wikipedia. This film says it is based on a true story, but that is hardly the case.Iranians hate that they are portrayed as stupid/bad guys, when they brought forth numerous arts, artists, and renowned scientists, and their land is used as only a background for riots, while they are peace-loving people just like you and me and their land has great nature and landscapes. Also the Persian Empire is the oldest empire in the world that has brought more to humanity than you know, just Google Persian contributions to humanity, the list is very long and nowhere near complete.Everybody that is involved in making the world a better place will boycott these hate filled movies from Hollywood, especially with Ben Affleck and the producers of this film involved, but not exclusively.Best tip: grab a camera yourself and make your own film that shows us the truth, instead of these Hollywood lies.A lot of people have done this, and by now most people know that we all are ruled by non-tax paying corporations with puppet politicians on a leash. That is what globalization is about. For these people and organizations, you are only good for providing cheap workforce, paying taxes and spending your money, oh and to keep your mouth shut and belief their propaganda.One day this whole system will collapse, cause hate and greed will only lead to more hate and greed.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A realistic depiction of Revolutionary Iran,"As an Iranian, I watched the movie with tremendous doubt about how accurate and unbiased it will depict Iran, and Islamic revolution of 1979.

However, the movie manages to provide a very solid story line, prefect acting, appealing dialogs all based on a magnificent plot.

The Great Caper,"Ben Affleck's latest movie has been getting a lot of buzz. And while it is not nearly as triumphant as his previous directing jobs (Gone Baby Gone, The Town), The finished product is both fun and smart entertainment that makes for an intense experience.The story of Argo is based on the rescue of 6 hostages from Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis. Affleck's character works for the CIA, and comes up with the idea to pretend to be a Canadian film crew going to Iran to scout out locations. Since the other ideas are absolutely awful, this is the one they go with. Affleck flies out to Hollywood to meet with people that are on board to make a fake movie. John Chambers, a makeup artist, and Lester Siegal, a producer, decide to try and make it work. Affleck then flies over to Iran to try and get the 6 escapees out of the Canadian ambassador's house and on an airplane.Since the story is historical, it takes away from the movie at times. The scene where Affleck finally finds the right script is tedious, and the suspense of them trying to sneak around and eventually trying to escape also at times is a bit annoying. However, as Affleck has proved in his previous films, he is a genius at creating suspense. The scene in the airport is entertaining and impressively original in its execution. Affleck also gets the feel of the late 70's down exquisitely well, and the Hollywood aspect allows for a multitude of self referential humor that is very well done.The acting is all great, especially by Affleck, and John Goodman as the makeup artist. The six hostages are all interesting characters and finely portrayed. The real problem with the movie comes from the script, written by Chris Terrio. His depiction of historical events is almost absurdly derivative and predictable, which limits the movie quite a lot. The characters, too, seem to be a little too basic, but perhaps that is the fact that this is a Hollywood movie about a high concept Hollywood movie that actually happened in real life.For all of its shortcomings, Argo is a thrilling suspense movie. Affleck is certainly no Hitchcock, but he gets the job done nicely. The movie is American all around, and that gives it both its greatest strengths and biggest weaknesses.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Great film,"Due to travelling I'm a bit out of touch with what's going on in the movie world. I decided to pop down to the cinema and had little idea about any of the movies that were playing. I logged onto IMDb and of the movies that were playing Argo had the best reviews.Argo is the story about a rescue mission to repatriate 6 USA citizens that escaped to the Canadian ambassadors private residence during the Iranian Hostage crisis in 1979. The us embassy was taken over by militants demanding the return of the shah from America. During the takeover the 6 escaped and were in more danger than the other hostages because the media were unaware about them.The film focuses on the mission to get the 6 out of Iran. It is a very tense film that has you on the edge of your chair frequently. It is very well acted and directed and I can imagine Affleck having a chance of an Oscar nomination for direction. There's also a great supporting cast including John Goodman and Alan Arkin. Something tells me the ending was a little over dramatised for Hollywood, but that's only a small quibble in a very enjoyable film. Go and watch!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Affleck will have staying power, a la Eastwood","ARGO, from Warner Bros. Pictures, is a well-padded film that tackles the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis (52 American hostages were held hostage inside the US embassy, during Carter's presidency, for a gruelling 444 days!) but with a fanciful twist that, in the hands of a lesser star-director, would have come up shorthanded or even mundane and trashy. But Ben Affleck has come a long way from goofy performances (1997's CHASING AMY, 1999's FORCES OF NATURE) and ever since his marvelous team-up with Matt Damon for 1997's GOOD WILL HUNTING (for which they won the screen writing Oscar), Affleck has shown he IS a force of nature to be reckoned with. Take THE TOWN (2010), a heist movie that was an uncanny character study as well, which Affleck starred in and directed (culling an Oscar-nominated performance out of costar Jeremy Renner), with 23 nominations from various bodies and academies. Even earlier, take GONE BABY GONE (2007), an abducted-child thriller, with Affleck also directing an Oscar-nominated performance out of Amy Ryan, the film replete with 12 nominations from various fronts. The 42-year-old Affleck has, as of press time, the distinction of sheperding a CIA-thriller into an astounding 63 nominations! For the 2013 Oscars alone, wit: Film Editing, William Goldenberg; Original Musical Score, Alexandre Desplat; Sound Editing, Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn; Sound Mixing, John T. Reitz; Gregg Rudloff; José Antonio Garcia; Best Motion Picture of the Year (Affleck, Clooney, Grant Heslov) Supporting Actor, Alan Arkin; Best Screenplay, Chris Terrio. If you've loved films like STATE AND MAIN (2000) and THE LAST SHOT (2004), ARGO will stun you, despite its taking ""poetic"" liberties (part of the actual events are glossed over, some parts in the film are fictitious, etc.) -- as it straddles the fine line between movie-making tract and CIA thriller. Affleck scores well by underplaying CIA agent Tony Mendez, who helped rescue 5 State Department agents to safety. How did Mendez do it? By pretending to be part of a filmmaking crew shooting in Tehran! Affleck disappears into the role, sporting a goatee and appearing meek yet hardworking, bedraggled and contradicted by superiors, yet his mind devising a million ways to lead both his team and the hostages to safety. Alan Arkin (Oscar-nominated), John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, Victor Garber and Kyle Chandler lend solid support, while the 6 important hostages (Tate Donovan, Clea Duvall, Scoot McNairy, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham, Kerry Bishé) convey terror, anxiety and (later) collective relief grittily. Much like his earlier project THE TOWN, Affleck directs with an eye for detail, creating nerve-wracking situations and interspersing it with comic relief from the faux film crew (Goodman is especially luminous, Garber hilariously spot-on). Affleck's technical crew is splendid as well (aside from the Oscar nominees, cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto telegraphs the terror of the hostages, the nastiness and utter evil of the hostage-takers, and the grace-under-duress whimsicality of the faux film crew, beautifully; Oscar-nominated Alexandre Desplat has also created evocative music to convey all those mixed emotions. I wasn't impressed much with Affleck from titles I've viewed like Armageddon, PEARL HARBOR and even REINDEER GAMES (dismissing his popularity as just a fluke, more so with the laughable DAREDEVIL), but his involvement with PAYCHECK (from my favorite sci-fi author, Philip K. Dick) and his articulate helming of THE TOWN has changed my mind about his just being ""an ex of J-Lo and Gwyneth."" Here is an intelligent actor-director that will have staying power for years to come. His good looks are a bonus! ("",)",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Emperor Has No Clothes,"After hearing all the good reviews, I was very much looking forward to seeing this film. However, after watching it I was confounded as to why this is being considered for best picture.From the opening scene to nearly the end, this film walks along at a pace that resembles the flat line on a heart monitor. I don't mind films that develop slowly, but they must have brilliant cinematography, compelling characters and some sort of rising tension to keep the audience interested.The cinematography was routine. The only bright spot were the interesting retro details and the 70's look of the actors. Meanwhile, the characters were in every way the definition of two dimensional. I defy the audience to remember the full names of any of them. And while the movie opens with tension, it then proceeds to just go downhill like a sedative. It's not until the final car ride to the airport does the sleeping movie-goer wake up.Many have gone on about the lack of historical accuracy, but Hollywood has never cared about that or has the illiterate audience. So that's beside the point because this is fiction. But I do smell a CIA public opinion operation going on. As noted by others here, the CIA coup in 1953 was a joint CIA/MI6 venture that overthrew a democratically elected government and we're still suffering the consequences. How has the CIa become heroic in this movie? You'd think the truth would be a much more interesting story, but I suppose it would require writers and directors with more skill than I saw here. It would also require reexamining other things America doesn't bother with, facts and nonexistent WMDs. However, a movie that really honestly revealed that insidious plot might also go a long way to warming relations, but I digress.The bottom line is that this film is just not great. I gave it a 6 because it's better than average and mildly entertaining when Arkin or Goodman are talking. Affleck's character, however, was particularly insipid, nearly monotonal and had the effect of lulling me to sleep.I honestly don't think this movie would have sold more than a couple of thousand tickets if the Canadians had made it. Somehow it's going the Oscar route of that masterpiece called ""Jerry McGuire"". I don't know why anyone bothers with ""Lawrence of Arabia"" when we have these jewels of perfection to watch over and over.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Authentic and Riveting,"I felt as if I was in 1979 Iran as I watched this fine movie. Ben Afflect who plays a CIA operative posing as a film producer, has proved himself again an excellent director after his previous directorial debut, The Town.Six Americans, having escaped their own embassy where 60 or so Americans are being held hostage, are depending upon Afflect to get them safely out of Iran.The cooperation of the Canadians was key to this effort. The six hide in the Canadian ambassador's official residence while mobs scream, ""Death to America.""

"Ben Affleck, arguably becoming one of the finest modern action directors","Director and lead actor Ben Affleck is likely to get even more ""cred"" for this one. That's saying a lot about someone who's already directed 'The Town'. Well, his new film is suspenseful, entertaining, and surprisingly funny.You may think this film is about the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. The reason is because it starts off with the beginning of the US embassy break-in, etc. However, it really does more of following Ben Affleck's mission to try to get the six hostage-evading Americans out, and the CIA's excuse: them being crew members of a fake film named...you guessed it...""Argo"". I won't reveal any more after that, but that's not really a spoiler.The acting was top-notch, especially by Ben Affleck. The casting was excellent except for a thing that some are already talking about: why does Affleck (a Caucasian guy) play Tony Mendez (a Hispanic guy)? Personally, I think it's not enough of a gaffe to bring the whole quality of the film down, but it's really something the crew should have considered a little more. The pacing is good; people should rarely, if ever, be bored by the combination of a fake sci-fi film and a CIA rescue mission in Iran anyway.The suspense is amazing. You'll constantly be watching to see what happens with Mendez and the six Americans. There's also a good amount of humor packed in these two hours, and it's not just a bunch of forgettable one-liners, it's recurring jokes, lots of them delivered by just the right guy: Alan Arkin, who is the producer of the movie-within- the-movie.Overall, 'Argo' is amazing.

"A persuasive, funny, and nerve-wrecking movie by an astonishing actor","When it comes to deciding what movies to watch, there are a few certain things that I carefully consider. It narrows down to the cast, types of genre, and the length of the movie. When I watch the trailer, I feel ""This is not a type of movie that I would be interested in. But, that changes my mind after finding out the identity of protagonist whose face is covered with bushy beard, Ben Affleck, who is both director and actor with experiences of delivering a heart-breaking performance in ""Town."" In ""Argo"", he plays Tony Mendez, CIA technical operations officer that is destined help six Americans escape from Iran with a risky plan.As it is based on a true incident that transpired in 1979, collecting old references, thorough research, and casting actors/actresses who closely resemble the real people that are involved in the event must be a challenging and time-consuming task. Surprisingly, it is by far the most nerve-wrecking and plausible film.The reason would be the editing and composition. In order for us to easily and quickly grasp the story, it promptly begins with a narrative introduction of how and when the incident occurs by showing the actual clips from the past. Secondly, a shout-out to the herd of intimidating Iranian citizens who show an enthusiastic emotions that keep the entire theater petrified and quiet. Especially their skeptical and scornful glare towards the Americans in disguise was memorable. Last but not least, the realism. Do you want to feel an overwhelming atmosphere that pushes you to the brink of banishment?Also, try to avoid presuming it is all about seriousness because Ben Affleck and the writers know how to make audiences laugh with a unique sense of humor.

A good film - pity about the factual inaccuracies.,"This is the film about the rescue of 6 American diplomatic personnel out of revolutionary Iran in 1980. It is directed by and stars Ben Affleck.The movie has won almost every award going and Affleck picked up countless best director awards, and even though he was not nominated for a best Director Oscar, he did pick up the Oscar for best film. This type of movie has never particularly appealed to me, but I have been a huge fan of Affleck ever since his excellent film The Town in 2010, and given the universal acclamation, I decided to give it a go. I wasn't disappointed. It is a very good film. As I heard someone say the other day, it was so good that you got totally caught up in the drama and excitement of the rescue, even though you already knew the outcome. A good movie has the ability to do this, as is evident in such blockbusters as 'The Titanic', where everyone knew exactly what was going to happen.There is little I can find to say in criticism of this movie - but I will try... The cast provided a great ensemble performance, with no single actor being particularly outstanding, and the story romps along at a good pace to prevent our interest and excitement from flagging. All in all a highly enjoyable, and expertly made film, but whether it deserves the superlative accolades that have been showered upon it – I remain unconvinced. Personally, I think that 'The Town' is a much better movie.It's probably just me; I'm sorry but I just cannot find John Goodman believable in any role he has played since he was Roseanne Barr's husband in the long-running American sitcom. To my mind, he always has been and always will be that slob of a working-class father with dysfunctional kids and a nutcase for a wife. Everything else he has tried to do, in my opinion, simply doesn't come off. He certainly doesn't ruin Argo, and does his best to deliver as good a performance, but for me, he is always the slob from 'Roseanne'.There are also a number of totally unnecessary and silly factual inaccuracies. These deliberate errors glorify the America's involvement while disparaging or ignoring the contributions of other countries. This is quite sad, and it took a number of protests before Affleck conceded he had indeed misrepresented the truth. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth - a pity, because in all other respects, Argo is a pretty good film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Well Paced and Well Done,"""Argo"" could have descended into the kind of explosions and car chase thriller one would expect from such a topic, namely the successful extraction of 6 US Embassy workers from Tehran at the beginning of the Islamic revolution in 1979. Based on a true account, Ben Affleck (who deserves all acting and directing kudos) maintains a tight leash throughout, using tension and what-if dread as the main adrenaline builders. It is a testament to his ability that even knowing the outcome does nothing to keep you from the edge of your seat. The CIA operative he plays, Tony Mendez who masterminded the plot, is no James Bond. He uses his brains, not his gun to achieve his goal, one that seems insane to his superiors.The acting is precise and realistic. Comedy relief is provided by John Goodman as Hollywood special-effects guru who has all the good lines. He and Alan Arkin as producer Lester Siegel have a rollicking good R-rated banter together. This being a suspense thriller, there are some fabricated scenes of last-minute miracles (phones picked up at the last second, etc)but they can be forgiven considering the excellence of the whole.Sharp viewers will be treated to modern Iranian history at the intro and it doesn't put the United States in a good light. When the freely elected Mohammad Mosaddegh nationalized the Iranian oil industry in 1953, he was overthrown by a CIA coup and replaced with the Shah of Iran. The Shah was a dictator as brutal and bloody as Saddam Hussein but as one of the CIA bureaucrats in ""Argo"" suggests, he was a tyrant, but he was OUR tyrant. In short, you can violate human rights all you want as long as you don't mess with our oil supply.The only things that redeem the CIA in this film are that the Islamic revolutionaries were just as brutal and the bravery of Mendez and his team.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

It may not be the most historically accurate film, but Ben Affleck's ""Argo"" proves that he is not only the best actor, but also a great director, able to pay attention to tension, character moments and tense conversations.

Excellent movie that's memorable and historical. The tale of a real fake hidden mission that worked!,"No matter what side of the political side your on you will enjoy this latest political thriller as ""Argo"" is an intense and raw suspense filled tale of the real life fake mission that helped free six of the American hostages that were held during Iran in 1979 and 1980. And wow the mission was for them to pose as a fake sci-fi film crew! Many just like me are just now learning of this actual CIA work, but it did happen as it was classified for many years and then declassified and brought to light. And actor and director Ben Affleck does wonderful work in bringing this real life tale to the screen. This is one film that after watching touches your political emotions.Set in 1979 and 1980 during the early part of the Iran hostage crisis it focuses on six American officials who depart the torn embassy and take up secret living at the home of the Canadian ambassador. So just how are these hostages going to be freed well enter the raw and rugged shaggy looking CIA agent Tony Mendez(Ben Affleck) who's plan is that the six will pose as a fake Canadian film crew scouting for a filming location for a low budget B sci-fi look ""Star Wars"" ripoff film called ""Argo"". Everything starts to be put in place from the fake names, passports, and new looks to the escape travel routes.Seeing Iran in 1979 and 1980 shows an extreme Muslim world of uncertain and tense feeling as Mendez sees this after he fixed everything up in Hollywood with the help and money backing from a legendary movie producer Lester Siegel(the always good Alan Arkin)and he gets monster movie make up artist the well respected John Chambers(the always folksy John Goodman)to help start up the fake campaign for ""Argo"". And believe it or not this all has approval from CIA boss Jack O' Donnell(Bryan Cranston). As they do it different sometimes the strangest plans work! Along the way from watching ""Argo"" you get intense feelings of suspense and political drama this film can relate a lot to the every day world and international political climate it's message shows the world is always involved in power and political struggles fueled by religion, greed and the need to stand alone at the top. I was only one year old in 1979 I still have small little memories by seeing clips of this time, and clearly this excellent historical political picture brought to light and revealed the story behind this troubling time in U.S. history because for me I was to caught up with Kenner's ""Star Wars"" action figures!

Now Argo feck yourself!!!,"Argo Affleck's Argo blew me away! 4/4 starsI had a feeling upon seeing the first trailer for Ben Affleck's 'Argo' mostly due to the story within as i remember as a child still to this day watching in anticipation to the news channel as the 6 hostages were escaping the iron grip of the country Iran. I always new even back then even though at my age and still to this day the Star Wars movie was mostly in my thoughts , that the story of the escaping hostages would make one hell of a movie and thanks to Ben Affleck's directing abilities that far outshine his acting endeavours, we got a brilliantly executed story here, although with a lot of historical inaccuracies, still kept close to what actually went on during that frantic time.The Iranian hostage crisis took place from November 4, 1979 to January 20, 1981 444 days in total that ended up with then President Jimmy Carter not being voted in for yet another term in the oval office. The CIA upon hearing that the American embassy had been taken over immediately spoke to their disguise and exfiltration expert Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to figure out a way to get the '6' out of Iran and it's confines before being captured, which unfortunately if happened, would've surely meant the execution of the 6 diplomats as we all know quite well that the United States government do not answer to threats of terrorism...Mendez comes upon with the idea of enlisting a top movie producer and director to fabricate the shooting of a new sci-fi film named Argo that would go head to head with the then debuting sci fi giant 'Star Wars' with principle filming to begin in the deserts of Iran, with the end result being safely and quickly getting the '6' out of country before the Iranian militia get hold of them first.Apparently a lot of people have voiced their displeasure, mostly Canadians, saying that the film and Affleck didn't show a lot of Canada's participation in this secret mission, making it more of an American deal. Myself a Canadian didn't get bothered at all of this and actually thought that Affleck did a good job (sure their are some or should i say a lot of liberties taken with this story, you know what though? It all = up to be a damn fine edge of your seat political thriller) and Canada got their dues in reality and not those that watched the events unfold on television during those 444 days know that the States were indeed grateful for Canada's participation through to the end.

"arGO Watch it, Its pretty good.","First before I start, Once you watch the movie you will come back to this pun and maybe think its a little funny. Honestly, I had heard about this movie for some time. I saw the actors playing in it (John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, Ben Affleck.) and thought it has to be a pretty well acted movie. Whhat drew me away from watching it was the trailer that didn't really do the movie any justice. Evenutally I said ""Hey lets give it a shot"". I came to this movie with very low expectation. (I mean at best I was hoping maybe a 4/10). I am gladly saying now that this movie is very well deserving of a 7 star. It has a calm build, But what keeps you in it is the fact that you have a feeling throughout the whole movie that at ANY moment something is about to go down. That feeling takes you all the way to the near end of the movie where I found myself on the edge of my seat and wondering what is going to happen. Not only this, but this movie has superb acting(as I expected). All the actors/actresses do a very good job a selling the intensity in the parts they play. The only couple of flaws I see in the movie is that there are parts in the first 30 minutes that are slow paced. Which kind of mess with the movie. Also think they could of had a better opening in the very beginning. Overall. Even though is not an over the top awesome movie.

Big Budget Reconstruction,"This movie illustrates that even with a fantastic plot based on true events and a substantial budget, a good film isn't always guaranteed. 'Argo' features great actors, but they lack the room to showcase their talents due to limited dialogue. I find it perplexing that Ben Affleck, as both director and actor, ended up with such a minimal and uninteresting role. Why didn't he give himself a more prominent part?It's unclear why 'Argo' won two Golden Globes-perhaps there's a nationalist element that foreign audiences might not fully grasp.What I appreciated about 'Argo' were the locations. They managed to make Turkey look convincingly like Iran, which is quite impressive. As a Turkish director, I find this particularly noteworthy.

The art of movie-making is not lost,"I travelled in Iran during the era of the Shah. I knew his was a puppet regime set up by the UK and USA to protect their access to Iranian oil.

The movie states all of this quite unequivocally at the start.I also know that what followed him was every bit as oppressive and brutal, and the movie depicts the reality of this. It is not anti-Islamic to show the truth, the summary executions, gun-happy revolutionary guards and many people strung up in the street from mobile cranes, a barbaric practice that continues to this day.I remember when the Ayatollah flew back in from France, and I really do remember the high hopes all around the world that a new dawn of freedom had arrived for Iran, but unfortunately it never happened. The movie is not inaccurate in its portrayal of those troubled times. The streets were indeed full of angry mobs day after day, usually chanting slogans demanding death to all Americans.But this is a movie review, not a political analysis, nor a fine examination of the factual details. Ben Affleck has taken the bare bones of a true story and used artistic licence to direct a brilliant thriller, absolutely gripping.It's top movie-making, and for that I award 10 marks.Those mean spirits who dispute this - Ar, Go f-ck yerself!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Its fiction people...,"This is a movie! Not a documentary... Most of the facts are exaggerated and most of the historical details are inaccurate. In my opinion if you go see this film without any bias its actually quite enjoyable and brilliantly directed.Maybe it is propaganda, but what movie doesn't have a social/political message in it??(Lincoln & Django both about black oppression, both released before Obama's re-election and lets not even mention Bigelow's absolute crap)If you want Hollywood to depict history accurately you'll be disappointed 99 % of the time. For example, most of Hollywoods war films are complete garbage, only showing one side of the story and the American army being the mighty hand of God himself while the enemy is portrayed as cruel and ruthless.Actually Argo doesn't glorify the US. It shows a critical political situation and a government that is failing to get out of it cleanly. A CIA agent comes up with a daring plan to rescue the embassy staff who survived without harming anyone... The mistake was not giving enough credit to the Canadian government who actually saved the day and took most of the risks. Iran was the villain so obviously everything about the people, police etc. was exaggerated to the extreme. But hell if you know a little about history you wouldn't give a damn.Again Argo is fiction and it has to be viewed as such. The plot is great, the editing superb and the acting was decent. Affleck's directing is also excellent, giving a realistic feel to the movie and always keeping you on the edge of your seat. Worthy of an Oscar for Best Picture? Probably not, but the Oscar for editing was well deserved.Watch this film without trying to understand the political aspect of it or taking parts and I am sure you will enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Calm down: Argo is just a good thriller,"I enjoyed this film, it's a interesting lost story, with many good jobs by the actors. But, i can't just imagine this film winning best picture in the Oscars, like many people are saying. I'm sorry, i just can't imagine, it's not a film for the ages, although it's really a good thriller. All of it shines like a natural thriller, and nonetheless is understandable that people like this film much, because of the tension it carries with itself. If you look for a good thriller, and very well directed, this is for you, but there's no ensemble cast shining nor a great score or that kind of stuff that Oscar winning pictures always have...An excellent surprise, yet, but nothing more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Good Job Ben.,"I read some of the reviews of this movie on IMDb and Moviefone and they looked pretty good so I decided to see it. Then a part of me became skeptical because I thought it is was going to be one of those long boring movies what a lot of people give too much hype. After seeing the Oscars and watching Argo take home the award for best picture I decided to rent it anyway still with some hesitation. Let me tell you, I'm so glad I rented this movie. It had me on the edge of my seat and yelling at the screen at times. This was basically a perfect movie. It was well written, directed and produced.Ben Afleck is doing a real good job directing and producing movies. Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and this one, they keep getting better and better. I hope he can keep up the good work. Pretty soon I'm going to put him up there with Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Spike Lee, and Steven Spielberg.

A sure-fire contender for Best Picture,"I've had the great pleasure of seeing this movie before the rest of Australia, and it was such a great film. A mix of thriller, drama and satire, Argo is a sure-fire contender for Best Picture at the Oscars.Taking place during the Iran Hostage Crisis, Ben Affleck plays a CIA 'exfiltration' specialist who finds out that 6 Americans from the US Embassy have escaped and are now sheltering at the home of the Canadian Ambassador. After watching TV, he comes up with an improbable plan: make a Canadian fake movie and disguise the 6 Americans as members of the Canadian film crew doing location scouting.The film has lots of tension and some hilarious moments as well. Fantastic acting from the cast and great direction, and the last 30 minutes will have you fearing for their lives. It's one of the best films of the year, and my pick for Best Picture at the next Oscars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Worth the watch,"When I first sat down to watch Argo, I was immediately pulled into the gripping intensity of its opening scenes. The tension in the first half of the film is a palpable. The pacing, the stakes, and the way the story unfolds with attention to detail all contributed to the pleasing experience. I found myself fully immersed in the plight of the hostages, the uncertainty of their situation, and the daring plan to extricate them from Tehran.Ben Affleck, both in front of and behind the camera, does an exceptional job of setting the stage. The mix of historical footage with dramatic reenactments adds a layer of authenticity that grounds the film. I particularly appreciated how the movie managed to balance the weight of the real-life events with moments of levity, thanks to the clever script and memorable supporting characters like John Goodman and Alan Arkin. These early moments are a perfect blend of suspense and wit, capturing the absurdity of the Hollywood option as a rescue mission.However, as the film progresses into its final acts, I found that the initial energy started to wane. While the tension remains, it feels a bit more manufactured, with some scenes leaning on Hollywood conventions rather than the nuanced storytelling that dominated the first half. That said, Argo remains a compelling film that showcases the complexity of the situation and the ingenuity required to navigate it. It's a movie that gets so much right, especially in how it portrays the tension and stakes of the crisis. Even if the last acts don't quite reach the heights of the opening, they still deliver a satisfying conclusion to the story. For those who appreciate historical dramas with a dose of thriller elements, Argo is definitely worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Argo is Phenomenal,I'm always eager to watch a movie based on a true story or history of events. Argo did not disappoint me in depicting a great piece of recent American history that I had absolutely no knowledge of. I was born in 1979 so I was not really familiar with the Iran hostage situation although I had heard a little bit about it in passing. I thought the topic was very relatable and appropriate considering the current events in the world today. Ben Affleck did a remarkable job playing a CIA agent. Ben Affleck also deserves kudos for directing this piece of work. He really paid attention to detail in this film from the style in which the movie was shot to the set and costume design. This is the type of movie I can see high school history teachers playing to their students. I hope this movie gets an Oscar nomination.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

After reading some feedback and also done some research on the facts, I was a bit upset regarding the historical content change.

"The ""Fake Picture"" becomes a real hit","In the film ARGO, producer Lester Siegel, played by Academy Award winner Alan Arkin, puts forth real effort into making a fake film a success as a perfect ruse to rescue six wanted Americans hiding at the Canadian Ambassador's residence during the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. The triple-threat of Ben Affleck (ARGO's Producer-Director-Star) must have channeled the spirit of Siegel (the character for the film was the amalgamation of real-life f/x coordinator Bob Sidell and producer Barry Gellar) as he, along with fellow producers and Hollywood heavies George Clooney and Grant Heslov, created a very real, very memorable film crafted with the utmost of professionalism in detailing the story's plight and rescue.Affleck ups his game with his third directorial stint and moves away not only from his usual Boston locales but also from the present day. In doing so, he completely immerses the viewer into the period of the film. Alongside the requisite horror show that was the 70s fashion style as well as carefully-placed Star Wars memorabilia – that no doubt brought a tear to the eyes of fanboy friend Kevin Smith – Affleck restaged the storming of the US embassy with the all-too real documentary feel and cast lesser-known actors into the roles of the Americans allowing their performance, not their celebrity status, to carry the show.Interchanged with this, is the flawless, and at times welcoming, editing of the situation in LA as Affleck's character, CIA operative Tony Mendez, wheels and deals with Hollywood to create a tight cover story, the kind that only Tinseltown can. Affleck portrays LA as an open, bright and aloof place, contrasting the tight, grainy and oppressive situation in Tehran. Modern-day Hollywood itself makes the most subtle of appearances during the film's climax through some of the drama during the airport escape including an almost-forced chase scene.Backed with John Goodman's smile and Bryan Cranston barking orders like he's on the set of a Glen Larson TV show, Affleck delicately builds the tension leading up to the escape. Much like Cameron's TITANTIC, the ending of the film is known, but the wielding of the personal dynamics, which is just one of reasons that made THE TOWN so incredibly good, proves Affleck's acumen. Affleck provides a fast-paced, suspenseful and, at times, humorous film that makes for great storytelling. Even more importantly, ARGO furthers solidifies Affleck's talent as writer/director and distancing himself from his roles in a host of truly-poor rom-coms and actioneers from the early 2000's.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Interesting even if not that accurate,Saw this recently. Interesting enough though the comments about the emphasis on US role versus that of Canada are something to look up further.

Other than that the movie was amazing and Ben Affleck did a great job and so did the cast and I would gladly see this movie again!!

Great movie overall. A bit of typical...,"Hollywood leftist propaganda in the beginning, where the narrative paints the Shaw as SO terrible (yes he wasn't good, but many living there at that time told me they MUCH preferred him to A$$ahollah, peace and prosperity versus violence and a collapsed economy) and goes on about the west as being ALL to blame for the situation. Never-mind the fact the west was the reason they had a developed economy in the first place. Nationalization of another companies investments is wrong. Period. The rest of the world no longer trusts you nor wants to ""play"" with you anymore! Then it goes on to say how good the revolution was; oh only except there was some ""score settling"" which was ""kinda bad""... Anyway after that bit at first it was pretty great action/suspense-filled and brought back high school memories and memories of conversations I had with many Iranian students here at university who were glad to be here in the US and decided they were never going back (to live under Sharia Law).

A must-see movie despite the historical inaccuracies and some story unevenness,"""Argo"" is a solidly built, but not always historically accurate drama with the several interconnected plot lines of varying quality masterfully woven together by the little known until now screenwriter Chris Terrio and by Ben Affleck who directed the movie and was one of the producers.The Oscar-rumored ""Argo"" is another successful step in the Mr. Affleck's transition from one of the most unrealized promising young Hollywood actors to one of the most prominent young Hollywood directors, previously known for the well-done ""The Town"" (2010) and ""Gone Baby Gone"" (2007).While I like ""Argo"" a lot and even consider it a ""must-see"" movie, the uneven quality of its intertwined story lines as well as some relatively easy noticeable historical inaccuracies do not allow me to call this heartfelt movie a masterpiece.The first plot line is based on the historical events of the Iranian revolution of 1979, from its beginning, to its progression, to its results. While flawlessly executed from the professional perspective and offering the highest level of authenticity in almost every small but expressive detail, the powerful emotional tale told in ""Argo"" is plagued with the avoidable historical inaccuracies and simplifications. As a result, the movie misses an opportunity to seriously and thoughtfully explore the tragic historical events. That somewhat reduces ""Argo"" to merely a high quality entertainment piece that just happens to utilize the real life tragedy to skillfully play on our raw emotions provoked by it.The second and the core plot line in ""Argo"" focuses on the remarkable story of the six American embassy workers. It features the escape from the occupied by the militant crowds embassy building, the difficult time they spent trapped in the Canadian embassy without much hope, and of course the complex and risky rescue operation that even included a fictional movie production company setup in Hollywood.Just as the story of the Iranian revolution, the hostage rescue story, while well-written, well-directed, and well-acted, regrettably contains some historical inaccuracies. In a nutshell, ""Argo"" over-emphasizes the role of CIA at the expense of the Canadian and British allies whose role is unfairly distorted and downplayed in the movie.In addition to the avoidable distortions, the story contains some pretty much unavoidable ""enhancements"" that I do not count against ""Argo"": the added suspense elements absent in the real life story the movie is based on.Spicing a thriller up with some artificially injected suspense is often a necessary evil as in many cases it is almost impossible to create a watchable, appealing to the audience thriller and keep it fully realistic.In the story told in ""Argo"" everything happens at the last possible moment, everything routinely hangs by a thread, and everything requires a little miracle to move forward. The reality, of course, was a little more uneventful and a little less suspenseful.Unfortunately, the two remaining story lines of ""Argo"" – the ""government agencies"" line and the ""Hollywood cover up"" line are far less authentic, far less original, and far more formulaic and ""Hollywoodish"" than the hostage rescue mission and the Iranian revolution stories.Every time ""Argo"" attempts to reveal how the various government agencies worked together on the rescue mission details, the powerful original story yields to the one big, long cliché that has been shamelessly wandering from one movie to another for a long, long time.The other quite unimpressive plot line was a secondary in nature story of the CIA operation getting a cover-up in Hollywood. While not bearing much significance in the movie, the ""Hollywood cover-up"" story has ironically become the most popular, the most well-known by general audience thanks to the movie marketing campaign effort.It was painful to watch good actors Alan Arkin and John Goodman in this predictable, forced, and unauthentic low farce much more appropriate for a bad TV show than for a gritty political drama based on a true story.In a striking contrast with the rest of the movie, this lightweight superficial story does not seem to make even a slightest attempt to seriously explore a captivating topic of the secret cooperation between Hollywood and CIA to save the lives of American citizens.From the acting perspective, ""Argo"" is mostly a delight to watch.The actors who played the hostages were believable in their memorable portrayal of the ordinary people experiencing an immense stress caused by the extraordinary, life-threatening circumstances.Ben Affleck had a difficult task as well. In addition to directing the movie, he needed to be very careful in his performance as CIA agent Tony Mendez, ""Argo's"" main character. The key was to avoid the temptation of playing James Bond, Jason Born, or any other traditional action movie hero at all costs and instead, to portray an ordinary man with an extraordinary courage, honor, sense of responsibility, and unfailing love for the people who need help and protection.Fortunately, Ben Affleck found all the right accents for his role. As a result, his decidedly restrained, unflashy, but nuanced and powerful performance was arguably the best acting work in the movie.Bryan Cranston managed to overcome the limitations of his clichéd ""boss"" character and was good as usual in the supporting role of Jack O'Donnell, Tony Mendez's supervisor.Another solid, memorable performance in the movie was by Victor Garber who intelligently played the role of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor.Overall, ""Argo"" once again proves that life is the best story teller. The movie is at its best when it remains close to the historical truth. The further it deviates from the truth, the more fictional elements it adds, the less satisfying, deep, and convincing it becomes.Despite the historical inaccuracies and some story unevenness, ""Argo"" nevertheless remains a must see movie, and arguably one of the best movies of 2012.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Vomit inducing propaganda,"Few films have angered me more than this entirely predictable, utterly facile and dreadfully formulaic piece of Hollywood excrement. The only advantage gained from wasting an evening witnessing it was a fuller appreciation of the systemic corruption within the media industry that threatens to award it several Oscars.The faults are obvious and well documented. The events concerned are ridiculously exaggerated as the most exciting incident actually occurring was the provision of wrongly dated visas by the CIA who didn't appreciate that Iran had a different calendar to the West. Otherwise the whole operation was largely mundane. The main contribution by the CIA had been the provision of fake passports and visas whilst it was the Canadians who were most pivotal in the execution of the project. Naturally Hollywood did not wish to publicize this inconvenient truth about the matter.But the film itself is equally mundane. Ben Affleck is arrogantly wooden and the hostages appear to be more cartoon stereotypes than actual people in that situation. All suspense is lost as we know from the outset what the outcome will be and to be frank I found it difficult to remain awake for the duration.

Affleck continues to rebuild his career with another home-run,"Now here is a thriller I'm willing to catch in theaters. I weary so quickly of action films employing stiff quick cuts, minimal character development, and macro events taken with micro focus, and am constantly tiring of seeing characters return in a sequel to a film that shouldn't really need one. Ben Affleck's third directorial effort, Argo, is a cinematic triumph; a film so grand, so impacting, and so implausible that it's undoubtedly one of the tensest pictures of the year.It's 1979, in the dawn of the Iranian Revolution. We open with archival footage of news clips and attack footage of the time, and are quickly presented with anarchic unrest outside the gates of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Iranian revolutionaries are disgusted at the United States' support of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah at the time, and begin to break into the concourse of the embassy and take most of the workers as hostages.Lucky enough to escape are six employees, who hide out in the home of Ken Taylor (Victor Garber), the Canadian ambassador, while the State Department devises a plan to return the hostages safely to America. Brought in on a whim, CIA specialist Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is called to evaluate multiple plans to return the hostages, and after watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes with his son on TV, he believes he has it.He proposes the preposterous idea that if they can convince the Iranian public that the six escapees are a Canadian film crew scouting for ""exotic locations"" in the country, that they could potentially meet up with the six, and return them safely. Tony quickly gets in touch with Hollywood make-up artist, John Chambers (John Goodman) and film producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), who hop on board with the idea of creating a fake film, even though you can see they find the idea to be highly questionable and, above all, dangerous.After paging through screenplays, they settle on a film called ""Argo"" as their fake film, a science-fiction film about God-knows-what. When asked by an executive what ""Argo"" actually means and how it is relevant to the film, Lester replies, with much frustration, ""I don't know, Argo f*** yourself,"" a line that will be continuously used in the film. That's right, as surprising as it is, Argo loosens its belt and concocts a witty, sometimes uproariously funny screenplay, not afraid to dive into cheeky humor or sometimes come close to tugging at the heart-strings.Affleck becomes fully immersed in this story, from a directing standpoint and an acting standpoint. He is barely recognizable in his role, with shaggy hair and a scruffy beard, a look that fits the macho figure himself, yet surrounded by a group of mainly unknown actors portraying the hostages, he becomes one with them, and his presence doesn't feel forced or abruptly out of place. It is simply fitting. His supporting cast, also serving as his film crew, Arkin and Goodman, show audiences why they should be credited highly, with serious performances when need be and comedy pleasantly punctuated throughout.The story's darkest points come in the latter-half of the film, and I dare not spoil them, but I'll propose this question in the meantime that I hope some will seriously contemplate; what if you had to completely change your identity and memorize precise details that rewrote your life? What if you forgot just one detail or did not recite it fast enough, your life would be ended or in far greater jeopardy than you could imagine? Behind the camera, this is easily Affleck's most uncompromising, incredibly entertaining piece of work; flawlessly directed, craftily edited, acted to near-perfection, written with wit and heart, and keenly glossed with the look and feel of an intoxicating and fulfilling espionage from the 1970's. The film-grain adds to the dated-effect this movie wants to achieve, and with precise detailing in the cinematography and aesthetics (right down to the original Warner Bros. logo at the beginning), it is clear that Argo is a meticulously crafted, remarkable picture filled to the brim with everything a traditional moviegoer and a full-fledged cinephile could ask for. It's one of the best films of the year.NOTE: I strongly advise viewers to stay well into the credits. We see pictures of the real six escapees alongside their screen-counterparts, and we also see scenes alongside the real-life images to prove that director Affleck, writer Chris Terrio, and the rest of the crew went to mold the film into a truly accurate piece of art.Starring: Ben Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, and Victor Garber.

3rd time is still the charm for Affleck,I am still not sure of Ben Affleck as a actor but the guy can certainly direct movies. And third time is still the charm for this actor/director. So Argo is basically a crazy true story about Americans working at a U.S. embassy getting taken hostage by in Iran. But six of them escape and is left of them escape and stay at a home of a Canadian ambassador. That is when the CIA come in to try and free the six hostages and bring them back home. The best bad idea comes in from Tony Mendez(Ben Affleck) to make a fake movie and act like a film crew to bring the hostages back home. While working under the supervision of Jack O'Donnell(Bryan Cranston). What I liked about this movie is how it didn't try to intentionally convolute the story while still showing it in a intelligent manner. Personally I think the movie as a whole could have been directed a bit better but Affleck still did a good job. Especially with the editing and witty dialogues. There is also quite a bit of tension in this movie and although you don't really know much about the six hostages I just couldn't help but root for the mission to get accomplished. Definitely looking forward to Affleck's next project.7.9/10,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Certainly, this movie deserves Oscar and it's gonna get it","When Ben Affleck came up with the idea to direct this movie he thought this way: ""OK, I'll never gonna get my Oscar for best actor but if I direct movie that rises patriotism it's gonna happen for sure. American movie academy likes that. Remember Kathryn Bigelow and ""The Hurt Locker"". It doesn't really matter anything else."" And it is what is going to be. This movie has so many flaws that makes me think where to start. The storyline is one-sided. One side is a good one and wants to save fugitives from certain death and second side is a bad one and wants to kill them as being spies. Totally cliché. The plot is shallow, barren, predictable and after while becomes boring. I don't think that the events described in the movie really happened this way and are authentic. Many countries protested about it (Iran, Great Britain, New Zeland and even Canada) so the storyline is very disputable. Acting was in the background cause the purpose of the movie was patriotic. Ben Affleck acting skills are weak as always. Alan Arkin and John Goodman are great actors as always but hadn't chance to show more themselves cause the script is barren. Directing is disputable and you may not like it. If you expected to see a good and realistic political drama watch ""Syriana"". This movie is not what you were expected to be.

Wow----What a Tremendous Movie,"""Argo"" is absolutely amazing and guaranteed...no one is sitting relaxed on any theater seat for the final 20 minutes. And is there any need to emphasize it will be up for Best Picture of 2012? Count on it. And Ben Affleck, John Goodman and Alan Arkin will likewise be nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting. And the cinematography's amazing too.The story is so intriguing, it's impossible to think it's true but IT IS. I'm not going to write anything that might be construed as a spoiler and to actually discuss the plot is, so all I can say is that if you're old enough to remember that fateful day of 11/4/79 when our Embassy was taken over by Iranian thugs,Islamic fanatics and it lasted under Jimmy Carter's watch for 444 days, you will go ape over ""Argo."" Word has it they held 52 Americans as hostages. Think again.What a great title for this movie. What does ""Argo"" bring to mind? Somethng planetary? How about the name of a spaceship? How about the leader of aliens? And what in heaven's name does all this have to do with Iran under the Ayatollah Khomeini? It's bewildering, isn't it? It certainly bewildered the Iranians.See this movie. It's absolutely sensational.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Powerful but Inaccurate,"This film is a fictional account about the hostage crisis in Iran in 1979-1980 in which several Americans were held captive while six of them were hidden in the Canadian Embassy before eventually escaping. Director Ben Affleck also plays the main character Tony Mendez, a CIA agent who arrives in Tehran under a different identity in order to help the six Americans escape.Affleck's directing is superb in that he achieves the near-impossible: creating edge-of-your-seat tension and suspense in a story where the audience already knows how the story will end. He also does a great job in evoking details of the time period with styles and events of the time (not to mention the absurdity of allowing smoking on airplanes back then). The ""time travel"" worked so well that I was even able to recall what was happening in my life at that time.The script has troubles with its inaccuracies. While the Canadian efforts in the operation are well portrayed, they are seriously minimized from a historical perspective. Also, there are unfair inaccuracies of the roles of New Zealand and Great Britain during the beginning of the crisis.Despite these major script troubles, this is truly a victory for the director who raises the film to a higher level.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Excellent!,"This movie is impressively good! I enjoyed the movie a lot and I felt absolutely involved in the movie plot. Ben Affleck has been a perfect movie director, producer and actor! Honestly, from the moment the movie began up until the end, I was gripping for the characters the whole way, the way movies should be. Brilliant directing, acting, story and some fun sci-fi references throughout takes Argo into the realm of one of the best films to come along in some time. Affleck proves once again of his talent as a director. This is a must see film that will no doubt be all-the buzz when award season comes around and deserves every bit of it.

Suspense.. disbelief.,"A useful writer's lesson in how suspense is created. If you separate the true story from the invented fictional overlays you'll find in one hand a finely crafted collection of reversals, all is lost moments, narrow escapes and races against time that never actually happened (when you see Jimmy Carter in the DVD extras talking about how the unbelievable story is all true, he's not talking about the movie).By the way, the movie within the movie wasn't some preposterously stupid Star Wars rip off like they made out here either. The Argo cover story was based on a failed adaptation of a Hugo award winning novel (Lord of Light) by one of the foremost science fantasy writers of the 60s and 70s (Roger Zelazny) and also had names like Jack Kirby, Ray Bradbury and even Buckminster Fuller attached.

Excellent acting and atmosphere!!,"This movie directed and staring Ben Afflack really shows you what fear looks like. I was on the edge the whole time! Very few movies grip me like this one did. Afflack really knows how to do just that.The other actors did a superb job with their roles. You actually felt for them, and you could feel the tension that they were feeling. I really loved how they never overreacted to the situation they were in; they didn't scream the whole time, but were silently and impatiently waiting for someone or something to come and try to rescue them.All the things that were happening around the main cast were well put throughout the movie( like the people who hung from different places.) It all felt very real! ( I would give other examples but then I would give stuff away) most movies can not make the situation feel real, and when that happens it is usually for one scene.

Yet another inaccurate historical film,"This film spends half its time calling Hollywood a bunch of phonies and liars, then makes a phony film that tells a lie. The true story is amazing. This one completely misleads on the actual events, and leaves out some of its greatest heroes. I've seen Ben Affleck on multiple talk shows talking about politics. This film had a chance to tell an amazing story of diplomacy, cooperation and bravery, but failed to tell the story.I know it's not a documentary, and I know that a director needs to add in dialog that no one could know, but even Titanic, a story about two people who never existed, got the facts right.

Argo! Go Find Yourself an Oscar! Brilliant movie!,"I promise I will not hold you hostage with a myriad of corny puns in my film review of the exhilarating ""Argo"", but then again I am free from pun censorship so just please bear with me. Director Ben Affleck has just catapulted to exemplary filmmaker status with his masterful direction of ""Argo"". The movie is based on a true story during the Iran Hostage Crisis when CIA Agent Tony Mendez masterminded a plan to free six American Hostages held in a Canadian Embassy in Iran by pretending to make a sci-fi movie called ""Argo"" in Iran in order to return them to the states. Hollywood came calling in support of Mendez' Argo cinematic plan of action in the form of assistance from Oscar-Winning Makeup Artist Tony Chambers and Hollywood Producer Lester Siegel. Hollywood Awards will also come calling to Affleck for his utopian direction of ""Argo"". How he was able to incorporate an infamous international crisis and the satire of Hollywood movie-making was phenomenal. Affleck was also solid in his starring performance as Mendez. It will not be justifiable if I don't give Chris Terrio some props for his captivating screenplay of the picture. The supporting acting of ""Argo"" was also spectacular. I am not making this up when I say that John Goodman deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his charismatic performance as Makeup Artist Chambers. And Alan Arkin's comical scene-stealing work as Producer Siegel should produce yet another Best Supporting Actor nomination to A.A.'s resume. And you can never go wrong with having Bryan Cranston in a movie; Cranston plays Mendez' CIA Boss. The steady Bryan has still not broken in a bad acting performance. Many will argue that ""Argo"" played around a bit with the facts of what really happened during that crisis, but one cannot argue that ""Argo"" is one of the best movies of the year and is probably headed for Oscar royalty. So that is the end of my review, which means you have been officially rescued from my Argoistic puns! ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Better than ""The Town""","Ben Affleck has made some excellent dramas and thrillers over the course of his career, and Argo is no exception. This true story of the joint American-Canadian operation to extract six American diplomats from revolutionary Iran is one of the best historical dramas of the 21st Century.The film opens with a narrative description of the events which led to the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979, and then displays a gritty and realistic depiction of the occupation of the U.S. Embassy. In spite of the 52 that spent 444 days in captivity, six escaped and were taken in by the Canadian Ambassador to Iran. When the C.I.A. finds out about this, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) proposes an idea to get them out of the country. His plan is to make the Iranian government think the hostages are Canadian filmmakers there to scout locations for a movie. Once he manages to get approval, he contacts producers Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) and John Chambers (John Goodman), friends of his who work for a Hollywood studio. The fake film they schedule to make is Argo, a science-fiction picture set in the Middle East. With the help of this crew and his partner Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston), Mendez embarks on the most daring mission of his life to save these men and women.This is one of several films Affleck has both directed and starred in; but what makes it even more gripping than ones like 2010's The Town is how it delivers the story with an incredibly emotional appeal, and a tone that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats throughout.Chris Terrio's script provides the basis for Affleck's artistic direction. In spite of this being a Hollywood thriller, Terrio puts such emphasis on his characters that the action itself proves to be a less significant component of the film's success. While the main story is centered around the mission, there are some great subplots involving the hostages, as well as Mendez's relationship with his wife and son. From the opening sequence to the climactic finale, audiences are immersed in both the characters and the distorted world which they find themselves in.From a cinematic standpoint, it's quite remarkable how Affleck makes you feel a part of the story. By implementing actual footage from the events depicted into the film, and at appropriate times, history is brought alive. Using primarily low-key lighting and a good number of close-up shots, the dramatic plot-line is made all the more intense. This is a dismal atmosphere in a time of fear and confusion, and Affleck utilizes a wide range of elements to make viewers connect with these characters' lives on an emotional level.Acting wise, it couldn't have been better casted. Cranston and Affleck embrace their roles with a spirit of fierce determination. There's a scene at the end after the hostages have made it out, where Cranston's display of joy and relief is very reminiscent of Ed Harris' performance in Ron Howard's Apollo 13. Goodman and Arkin also give great performances, as their characters provide the film with a humorous element, while still maintaining serious objectives and motivations. Other noteworthy actors include Victor Garber as Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor, and Kyle Chandler as C.I.A. operative Hamilton Jordan.All in all, this film is nothing short of breathtaking, presenting itself as a unique and brilliantly constructed thriller, after a series of flashy and unoriginal action movies over the last few years. Two thumbs way up.Note: This review can be found on my blog: www.kevinschaefercinema.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Ben and his beard to the rescue,"'Argo' is one of those films 'based on real events,' which basically means that Hollywood has beefed up various aspects to put bums on seats.It's set at the end of the seventies when six Americans are left stranded in Iran, leaving Ben Affleck and his beard to hatch an ingenious plan to make them pose as science-fiction film makers and fly them out of there.If you want to know how it ended, Google the true story. What you have here is Hollywood's interpretation of it. And, looking at it from an entertainment point of view, it does do the job. It's pretty intense in places, which, if you're after an edgy thriller, should leave you satisfied.However, if you're looking for something a little more true to life, then you may find it hard to get over some of the major Hollywood views. As usual, the Americans are ultra-heroic, whereas the Iranians are presented as bungling incompetents who are too busy burning US flags to be any more terrifying that your average Scooby Doo villain. Of course there are the little alterations, too. In real life, the escaping Americans were temporarily sheltered by the British. In the film they take great care to point out how the British turned them away - grumble, grumble, grumble.Bottom line: if you look at it as entertainment with some terrible seventies haircuts and a fantastic beard co-starring on Ben Affleck's face (which definitely should have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, in my opinion) then it works. Historically - well, let's just say it will pick up more than its fair share of criticism for its version of 'the truth.'",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A skin-tingling, nerve-wracking five-star experience, politics aside","There are some who have shouted very loudly that Argo is nothing more than a well-timed slice of propaganda intended to influence the presidential election. Firstly, I'm sure Barrack Obama is hoping that something more tangible than a mere movie will allow him to keep his home on Pennsylvania Avenue. Secondly, that's a terribly scathing view of the American voters. Okay, we'll ignore the embracing of pseudo-patriotic claptrap Act of Valor and the attacks on Kevin Smith for Dogma but you know what I mean.Lay your political bias aside for 120 minutes, regardless of whether you're red or blue. Argo serves up the kind of tension that modern day horror meisters dream of. Such a film faces an immediate challenge in that most of the audience already knows the outcome, although that didn't dampen the fervor for Titanic or the tension created in Bryan Singer's Valkyrie.But like Valkyrie, it doesn't matter that you know the result of the audacious plan in Argo although, if your USA/Iran historical knowledge is patchy and this episode passed you by, perhaps it's better to maintain your ignorance and watch as it unfolds. Let me know how it hits you and we can compare experiences from each other's perspective.In 1979, in the aftermath of the Shah's exile and the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini, the American embassy in Tehran was overthrown and fifty-two hostages were taken. Six, however, escaped and were given refuge by the Canadian ambassador. With the situation volatile to say the least, the CIA floundered looking for an escape route for the six before being presented with the 'best bad idea': smuggle them out as the production crew of a fictitious movie called Argo.The story is remarkable. If we didn't know it was true, who would believe such a ridiculous, life-threatening escapade could be undertaken? This film of that story is absolutely riveting. At times it is genuinely very funny, both for the dialogue and the absurdity of what unfolds in Hollywood and Iran. More often it is terrifying. My skin prickled with the fear and tension in a way I haven't experienced since, oh, probably The Exorcist. The danger most of the participants are in and the likelihood of a brutal death is palpable even from the safety of a cinema seat and I found myself desperately hoping, wishing and willing them on, incapable of stepping back and viewing Argo as simply a film to which I knew the conclusion. Argo is not a film one can sit back and watch, it is an experience that sucks you into its midst.This is Ben Affleck's third feature as director after the superb Gone Baby Gone and equally impressive The Town and yet again he proves to be a far finer director than he is an actor. That said, as Tony Mendez, the man behind the madcap idea of Argo, he proves he is more than capable of holding a film and commanding our attention on both sides of the camera. Affleck is this generation's Clint Eastwood or Sean Penn and his work is proving to be of an extremely high calibre.The cast is superb and greatly varied, in some instances the likenesses to their real-life counterparts is almost uncanny. There isn't a standout performance amongst the hostages but neither is there a character that takes the limelight. They form a desperate ensemble careering towards mortality while supporting, laughing and bickering like children who are being forced into actions they have no say over. It is impossible to judge their petulance or negativity when the reality of their predicament is so obvious.Alan Arkin as Lester Siegel is the light but cutting relief in a film filled with characters starring into an horrific abyss and John Goodman completes the double act in his most enjoyable performance since The Big Lebowski, proving he's worthy of more than the light pap he so often finds himself in. Bryan Cranston is a revelation for those who know him only as Hal from Malcolm in the Middle. The strain is evident in his face and the emotional turmoil he is enduring is barely masked by his occasional smiles and blatantly obvious when he momentarily allows the dam to burst.The greatest delight with Argo is the sense that it is real, that we are part of the dangerous fiasco and not merely observers from the future. For those who stay, there is a lovely touch at the end with photos of the 'reality' paired with stills from the film as the credits roll. These, like the actors playing the parts, are strikingly similar and the horror of the situation is subtly emphasized.Who needs schlock fantasy horror when you can enjoy a genuinely chilling horror of the reality?For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Argo see this movie... JK,"Prior to this movie, I had only known the basics of the Iranian hostage crisis. And honestly, I don't think this was the best portrayal of it. I know Hollywood loves to glamorize history but this seemed too far even for their standards. One thing I will commend is Ben Afflecks double threat status in this movie. He's not my favorite actor but I really liked his character and the depth he gave his characters. If it weren't based on a true story I probably would've liked it a little bit more. But the dramatization was just too much for me. It was interesting, however, to see the hostages and get a full grasp on the humanity of the situation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
hero complex,"When I was a child I remember playing out in my garden, on my own because the best fantasies are when we are solitary, I would imagine I was in a shootout or crawling through a blizzard something out of a western or Star Wars.Argo is an excellent film. What about the politics? The message here is that America should get out of Iran in a hurry, this applies to the current political climate although it is set safely enough in the past. Otherwise the opening explanatory sequence which denounces American interference for the sake of oil is balanced by a condescending(racist) approach to Iranian fanaticism, the politics are half-baked and balanced to please as many people as possible but ultimately glorify America, a child's fantasy to please the paternal nation and the President and those good-at-heart fellows at the CIA. What's wrong with this? Nothing really, the intentions seem good enough and Argo is an excellent film...Argo brings to mind Super 8 by J.J. Abrams. Both films are about movie-making that acts as a vehicle to bravery and heroic actions in the real world to save people (Americans).If a patriot makes a work of art which is an expression of their beliefs and prejudices is that propaganda? Is Argo as innocent and childlike as it appears to be? Americans love playing dumb, it allows them to keep their cards to their chest and remain under-estimated, a secret to their success because if your enemies regard you with contempt they are liable to slip up on their own superiority complex. Get out of Iran is a good message though, leave other nations and their oil alone is a good idea, not invading people is an honorable proposition.In Dog Day Afternoon Al Pacino is trapped in the bank he has robbed for a sex change operation for his lover, the audience is breathlessly dragged through his ordeal and its oppressive atmosphere of suspense and tragedy, in Midnight Express Brad Davis is caught in Turkey trying to smuggle hashish back home, his nightmarish imprisonment is a harrowing succession of miseries that make Romero's zombie films seem like a day at Disneyland. The seventies and early eighties were a time for movies which threw us into nightmare situations with an alarming intensity. The danger infused in these films was rooted in the cold-war era, where the instability of the political world was keenly felt by the post-war generation of filmmakers who had seen the horrors of Vietnam rise up in front of their eyes and create a cultural revolution.Ben Affleck takes the central role in his well-made, involving and highly suspenseful drama. He gives himself a very good part and acts extremely well in it. This is a vanity project of the kind that Warren Beatty and Robert Redford have made in the seventies; low-key acting and serious dramatic subjects. Despite his skill and poise I felt that Chris Messina in a smaller role threatened to steal the show, maybe all this false modesty has a limit and if you keep underplaying for long enough the audience will want something more substantial. An ego trip is a personal affair in the end it pleases you more than anyone else.The film-making here is excellent - although, however accurately copied, at the beginning the 'seventies' visual tics (framing the actor way off to one side and then the other way round) are a little distracting - the acting is wonderful, the script full of energy and good lines, the music sensitively composed, the editing is particularly good; especially the montage sequence cutting between the preparation of the fake movie and the real events taking place in Iran.At heart the theme of popular art being a vehicle to saving lives is both the subject of the film and its purpose. Through the drama played out the audience is sensitized to the dangers of profiteering foreign policy and warned against the arrogance of the colonial spirit by spending two hours in virtual house-arrest. Above all at the end we all just want to get home safely and stay home if we can.Have you ever dreamed that you were trying to catch a plane and that you couldn't manage and the whole thing turned into a nightmare of suspense and tension? Welcome to Argo Airlines!Compared to Dog Day Afternoon or Midnight Express Argo is a sort of regressive child-like fantasy where we can escape the worst if we put our faith in the good hands of benign Hollywood producers, make-up men and earnest CIA guys who love their sons and country in equal measure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

These can be a lot of fun to watch when done right.Or you can make a film that is something in between, where you intersperse actual events and people to trick viewers into taking the pulp fiction seriously. It is important to make sure that most of the audience was not alive when the events occurred - just stress the few cultural references that they know and give a slide show at the end to convince them how real it all was. And add a one sentence disclaimer so that all those friends that did help aren't too offended.I personally prefer the first two types of film that either give credit to the very real people who actually did risk their very real lives or be honest with the audience that this is make-believe.Or at the very least - make something that can stand on its own without having to pretend that most of it actually happened.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
'We did suicide missions in the army that had better odds than this.',"There is so much hype regarding the Oscars now that viewing any of the contenders is met with confusion. That is unfair to each of the films because it automatically places each in a police lineup for who is going to win. ARGO is a solid film based on a true incident and the significance of that very important mission to free hostages is one equally share with our good friends the Canadians. That is what makes this film important - the courage and fortitude shared in freeing 6 American citizens form a near hopeless situation. But on to the film itself.In 1979, the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries and several Americans were taken hostage. However, six managed to escape to the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador and the CIA was eventually ordered to get them out of the country. With few options, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) devised a daring plan: to create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew. With the help of some trusted Hollywood contacts (John Goodman and Alan Arkin, both brilliant in their comedic roles), Mendez created the ruse and proceed to Iran as its associate producer. However, time was running out with the Iranian security forces closing in on the truth while both his charges and the White House had grave doubts about the operation themselves.The film opens with a brief but well edited history of the fall of the Shah of Iran and the rise of the Khomeini, actual footage that lends a sense of credibility form the start. For the first hour of the film the plans are set into motion - plans that seem absurdly Hollywood but the options are non-existent. Once the actual exfil mission is begun the film become tense and suspenseful and the cast of characters selected to show both the resistance of the home front and the terrifying situation happening to the hostages in the shelter of the home of the Canadian ambassador makes this a finely tuned thriller.The cast of actors includes, in addition to Affleck, Arkin and Goodman, strong work from Victor Garber who plays the Canadian ambassador, and Bryan Cranston, Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall, Scoot McNairy, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham, Kerry Bishé, Kyle Chandler, and Chris Messina. Though the film was basically shot here in the US (with a bit of footage in Istanbul, Turkey) the action appears authentic. The film was written by Chris Terrio but based on the book ""The Master of Disguise by Antonio J. Mendez and Escape for Tehran by Joshuah Bearman. Affleck directs, produces and stars.

ArGo Look Yourself,"Being consumed by film marketing in the 21st century western world is almost an unavoidable right of passage for any owner of modern technology or in fact anyone who has ever been outdoors. As I do, and have, I was given great expectations for Argo that were not quite fulfilled to the capacity I had hoped.Despite my slight sense of disappointment, Argo is a splendid piece of work by director/producer/actor Ben Affleck. It is essentially a film about film, the latter not really being a film. Confused? Well you shouldn't be, the premise is rather straightforward and enlightens its younger audience (including myself) on the historical conflict between Iran and the United States of America in 1979. The non-fictional reality of the declassified event that occurred 32 years ago, while presumably slightly sensationalised for cinematic purposes, is rather inconceivable. While thoroughly engaged in the atmosphere the film creates, you continuously ask yourself if this genuinely happened. Knowing that it did is perplexing at a severe magnitude.In all honesty, Argo fails to really grasp the undivided attention of the audience until the final 30 minutes of the picture, though you appreciate the reservation of the best until last. It is as if you have been presented with a plate of food; knowing you must eat it all, you start on the vegetables to get them out of the way, then consume the adequate yet necessary side dish, before being enriched by the most prominent presence on the plate; it has the ability to satisfy the taste buds in every way possible, or cause a look of disgust and sickness dependant on its quality. Argo consists of the former of the two, as everything nearing the climactic resolution leaves you involuntarily paralysed in your seat as you await the next revelation or obstacle for the characters to endure. The tension that the feature generates results in gasps being heard around the theatre as the unpredictable nature of the characters' actions are unveiled.Whenever we relocate to scenes of lesser tension, we are more often than not gifted with tremendously suitable comic relief. Its situation in the narrative is not just present for entertainment purposes, it also facilitates in allowing us to feel as though we are experiencing the characters' endeavours. This is because the humour makes the best out of a bad situation for those that have been affected by the events at the start of the film. Everyone must keep their composure in order to get the job done, and the comedy is used to simply give the characters something to smile about and as a coping strategy, as when they feel this, it synchronises audience's emotions.The first 90 minutes of Argo is albeit very slow, though quite necessary to give us enough fuel to make it to the phenomenal conclusion. This also provides the biographic thriller with a pleasant structure, as no sequences are prolonged or too short and it builds itself up to behave like an amalgamation of necessary processes in order to achieve the goal the CIA have set out to do. The Oscar 'buzz' surrounding Argo are not feelings that I personally reciprocate due to the fact I did not feel absolutely immersed in the cinema screen throughout the showing, yet more so at specific moments, and also because it really does take some time for the picture to gain momentum, which is really the precautionary point the film conveys, but it just is not that engaging. This is one of those films whereby you are very glad you watched it; though do not feel that it requires you to sit through it another time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Well, it really is not supposed to be and quite honestly who cares. Most movies are not dead on accurate but I would say having grown up during this time this movie does a pretty good job of telling the story. Affleck deserves a Best Director nod for this and it appears there was much research done to try and be accurate in the way the events unfolded. Again, this is a movie and not real life so I am sure there were things that were not as accurate as well.

However, a younger person watching this might assume that it's a fictional story anyway....so, why get all upset about fidelity?The film has an all-star cast: Ben Affleck, Bryan Cranston, John Goodman, Alan Arkin (hilarious), Victor Garber and Titus Welliver (of BOSCH fame, for those who have Amazon Prime TV - if you don't, you should and you should watch BOSCH, a great gritty crime series). All deliver lifelike performances. The cover story Tony Mendez (Affleck) weaves is audacious! It means taking the 6 American hostages concealed at the Canadian Embassy OUT, as movie production staff, on a so-called location-scouting tour of Tehran. Can it work? Will it work? Well, it's hide in plain sight-fly 'em home next day under the hostile Iranian noses.Wanted to add a point that could be overlooked: one of the 6 Americans speaks Farsi, and this turned out to be a vital component in 'selling' the Con when the Iranian authorities start asking questions (hilarious when a few accept gratis promo material from the 'movie'). Hence, I will give this a 10! I hunted down a DVD copy afterwards so that I could enjoy it again. A word of caution-language is fierce in places. I switch soundtracks, and use sub-titles.

Argo is a tense but enjoyable cinematic trip with a 70s feel,"Craving a tense, heart-pounding political thriller that doesn't let go of its grip until the end? Look no further, we have Argo.Argo is a skillfully directed and shot film that keeps the audiences riveted with its colorful cast of characters, extreme moments of tension, tight script that doesn't offer any slow moments, and a subtle political undertone about the continuing crisis that occur in the Middle East between the ruthless leaders and the citizens that are always inches from exploding in pure anger.Based off of a compelling true story that takes place in the Iran Hostage Crisis of 1979, Argo follows one man creating a fake film studio and film production so he can pose as a Canadian filmmaker as he searches for the missing Americans that fled the embassy that came under attack by angry mobs of Iranian citizens. The first half focuses on the planning, and the more riveting half focuses on the execution.This movie has 70s political thriller written all over it, from the substance to the style. Ben Affleck gives his best directing performance here as he shoots the film with a 70s look and feel to add realism to the conflict while at the same time paying homage to classic dialogue-heavy thrillers like All the President's Men and Dog Day Afternoon.His old-school, close-up style of filmmaking helped his first two features, and it definitely enhances the anxiety of the moments when the characters can be seen in the hostile environment of Iran. You will hear your heart as the cast drives through the heart of the rebellion.The best of movies can successfully combine drama with humor, and the dark humor of Argo helps the viewer relax and breathe a little as the stakes get raised higher and higher. This movie is actually surprisingly funny, with the best lines being delivered by the veteran actors John Goodman (where's his Oscar?) and Alan Arkin. The rest of the cast does a wonderful job being likable and being people you want to root for during their highs and their low points.Bottom Line: 120 minutes of heart-pounding drama and heavy content is what makes Argo one of the best films of the year, and pretty much certifies Ben Affleck as a successful and good director that manages to erase his ugly streak of bad movies. There isn't a dull moment here as you will remain glued to the screen up until the very end. Its good old-fashioned gritty filmmaking at its finest, with characters moreso than action running the show.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Gripping historical drama,"If you enjoy gripping historical dramas, you'll enjoy this film. This movie is intelligent and edge-of-your-seat riveting.It tells the story of the ""Canadian Caper"", the joint covert rescue by Canada and the CIA of six American diplomats who evaded capture during the Islamist seizure of the United States embassy in Tehran, Iran, in November 1979. Most of the other hostages had to endure 444 days of captivity, but three months into this ordeal America was delighted when it was discovered that six had managed to hide in the Canadian embassy and to make their way out of the country.Yes, there are a few liberties, changes, omissions and embellishments in the movie, but this was mostly for dramatic purposes, and the result is a movie that manages to combine historical accuracy with drama. Only once did the drama lapse into unrealistic melodrama: the take-off scene. It's clear that the director went to great lengths to try to replicate things as realistically as possible. It was a messy complicated event, so some details had to be smoothed over.For an American movie with a political theme, I found it to be relatively neutral, balanced and not overtly anti-Iranian; however, you may wish to pass if you're an Islamist or an Iranian nationalist. Some of the police/immigration scenes reminded me of Midnight Express. We all know that Iran is a great country that has only temporarily lost its way.I also am quite certain that if this movie had been made by Canadians, it would have shown more of the pivotal roles played by Ken Taylor and the other Canadians who risked their lives. Perhaps we'll see a movie some day about Ken Taylor's spectacular evacuation of 850 Canadians from Tehran in January 1979. (But would Americans go see it...?)This is surely the movie that will confirm in everyone's mind that Ben Affleck is not only an accomplished actor, but also a good and perhaps even great director. Perhaps we already knew that from ""The Town"".I would rate this movie as 8.5, but this is a movie for which the score deserves to be rounded up.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Not my favorite genre but a good movie,"This is a good movie although the context of the movie is a rather sad one. It is definitely not my favorite genre but my wife wanted to watch it and it had received generally favorable ratings so I added it to my collection.The historical accuracy of this movie has been questioned. I honestly do not remember any details of the events of this sad episode in Middle East history so I cannot really judge this. As far as I know the general plot is consistent with reality and in this movie it is good enough for me. I fear that, if they would have made it 100% historically accurate, the movie would have turned into a rather boring documentary instead of a fairly enjoyable drama movie.Surprisingly enough the movie was quite funny at times. The dialogue between the movie-people when they were setting up the fake movie was sometimes quite hilarious. Some parts of the movie was rather tragic of course, like the Iranian mob taking over the embassy and the crazed idiots at the bazar.Other parts where a bit silly. Why did the Iranian security have to break down their own doors at the airport instead of just calling the tower and stop the plane for instance? And the cars chasing the plane was just rubbish. The plane would have gone much faster than the cars could go long before they caught up with the plane. Also the fact that the cars basically had to panic-break in order not to hit the barrier at the end of the runway meant the plane almost ran into the barrier which, given that it made a normal take-off, is just nonsense.In general it is a good movie although it is not really my type of movie and the movie's context, the take-over by the Iranian extremists, is a rather sad one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Surprisingly good,"I historically have not been a fan of Ben Affleck, however I have to admit he has made a fantastically entertaining film, his acting was also superb.Before going to see this film I thought I might not like it for 2 reasons. The first I have stated above. The second is that I read some of the unfavourable reviews before I saw the film and it sounded like it would just be another 'Smart American saves the day, Arabs are stupid,' and I hate these type of films.But it wasn't like that, it set just enough historical context to give you some understanding of what was going on and why the American Embassy was stormed. I felt sympathy for the characters, I wanted them to escape.

I have little knowledge on the original story, nor do I like movies with high political connotations, its not that I don't understand them, I just don't want too. However Argo is not like that, although I was a little cautious at first Argo is a fantastically gripping series of acts from start to finish. Ben Affleck deserves all the plaudits on this one, i never expected to like this one but due to his raw talent of filmmaking as well as acting he has created a masterpiece out of a little known but technical story. The end is sheer suspense. That is due to the built up scale of terror and trouble you know these victims are in.

Did you know that Jabba the Hut was guarded by Iranians?,"What about Argo? Well, it's no denying that Argo is an enjoyable espionage movie. The pacing is tight, there is some tension and an interesting story arc. It's easy watching and certainly no waste of time. But it gets lavished with all this praise. Just take a look at some professional reviews and you see what I mean. This movie is meant to show how much Ben Afleck (let's face it: he used to be a horrible actor) has grown over the years both in terms of acting and directing. It is indeed hard to deny that his acting skills have greatly improved (his directing skills I cannot comment on). He is far more reserved, and far less cheesy: just very composed and steady. But it's also not difficult to improve on the horrible performances he used to give. Only the smallest bit of self-reflection should do it. But let me ask: is all the praise he gets for the film really justified? I don't think so. Firstly: it's just an entertaining movie, no more, no less. We've got millions of 'm. Secondly: it's hugely patriotic; think the 'subtle' inclusion of American feelings/flags etc. Thirdly, and most importantly: the angry Iranians are either being portrayed as generic Orcs in Lord of the Rings, or as the generic aliens surrounding Jabba the Hut in Star Wars. When we see them driving the car through the streets we see exactly the same angry mob we always see on the tube: a false stereotype is being reinforced here, without any subtlety whatsoever. More importantly: when one of the American guys was talking to an Iranian official he started to talk in a Jabberish Irianian accent that sounded like ""Jabba di Jabba"", just like 3CPO said it. I thought that was a little dumb to be honest. I thought that at the time I was watching that scene. And guess what... right before the end credits they even showed us the friggin' Star Wars action figures for crying out loud (!), and lo and behold who figured prominently... 3CPO. You're honor, I rest my case.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Anti-Iran Propaganda,"The timing of this film is highly suspicious as reported by Patrice Greanville of The Greanville Post: ""Appearing in late 2012, prior to the US presidential election, and in the midst of an all-out propaganda campaign to demonize Iran and take America to war against that long-victimized country (a stealthy dirty war of sabotage and assassination has been waged against Iran for quite some time now by NATO assets and the Mossad, with probably ample support from the Gulf royal mafia), the film can only add fuel–what else–to the flames. This film, under the guise of a thriller, can only exacerbate anti-Iranian feeling in America and elsewhere, and, in passing, perhaps as an unwitting bonus, give the sinister CIA a cuddly wink of approval. Which is exactly what you'd expect from nincompoop liberals like Affleck and Clooney."" This film is also a whitewashing of CIA history. No, the CIA is not a force for good. CIA officers are not cool. There's nothing exciting or honorable about imperialism.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Excellent: 9.5,"I've never thought much of Ben Affleck. He was in that awful Daredevil movie, Armageddon, and Paycheck. All in all, not exactly the greatest resume for any actor. But then he made The Town, and my opinion changed dramatically. Here was a well-written, smart, suspenseful action thriller set in my native Boston that also happened to be the best heist movie in years. But I thought it was just a fluke then. Argo proves, without a shadow of doubt, that not only is Affleck capable of acting, but of directing as well. And not only does he pull off a feat of Hitchcockian suspense, but he makes what just might be the best film of the year. Argo takes place in 1979 during the Iran Hostage Crisis, during which the U.S. Embassy was stormed by political extremists and all but six Americans taken hostage for over eighteen months. The film follows Tony Mendez (Affleck), a CIA extraction specialist charged with escorting the six out of Iran safely. He ultimately chooses to create a fake film, and cast the six Americans as some of the production crew. From this point forward, the suspense is continuous, somehow never, ever pausing for a breath. The crew nearly starts a riot for photographing a storefront. A political protest blocks their only exit. The pictures of the six are reassembled by the Iranians, and are recognized to be missing. One of the men can't remember his fake credentials. The entire operation is cancelled while Mendez and co. are still in Iran. Not even the occasional jab at the Hollywood mentality can lighten what is a heavily emotional film. The writing is absolutely superb as well. Each character is a fully realized human being, with hopes, fears, and doubts about their survival. Each one reacts differently to their situation, a remarkable feat that makes each one a unique character, rather than a bunch of differently-colored flags that must be returned to base. In addition to simply being a superb experience, the historical aspect is very well realized. This is not a film about the Iranian Hostage Crisis; this is a film IN the Hostage Crisis, right down to the smallest details, from the post-Star Wars sci-fi craze to Russia's invasion of Afghanistan. Of course, I will not reveal whether or not the entire caper succeeds, but know that there as much hope as doubt throughout the picture, making success and failure seem equally plausible. Political thrillers everywhere have a higher bar to leap. Trust me when I say this, people: this is a good one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Slick, stylish caper from the increasingly quality Affleck staple","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1979, after a deposed leader is refused to be returned home to Iran to face trial for human rights abuses, an army of militants storm the Canadian Embassy in that country and take everyone inside hostage, save for a few who escape and hide out at the Canadian ambassador's residence. They desperately need to be rescued, and so the CIA turns to specialist Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to hatch a plan to get them out. Naturally, he comes up with the most insane idea imaginable- to disguise them as a film crew scouting for locations for a new science fiction fantasy called Argo. It was so crazy-it worked.It seems some of the best stories are real life ones that are so outlandish and far fetched they could be believed to be fiction. Clint Eastwood showed us as such with Changeling and now another former actor who proved to be a much better director, in the shape of Ben Affleck, showcases this dramatization of the real life rescue of a few escapees in a hostile climate.The big ask here is: can you make a story you already know the outcome of genuinely thrilling? And the simple answer is: yes. As the film draws to a close and the group are racing against the clock to make it through the airport and onto the plane, it is genuinely a nail biting, seat edge experience, that can only be down to impressive writing and a smooth, even pace. His third film at the helm, this certainly feels like the most dynamic and ambitious of Affleck's projects, and while it's historical accuracy and attention to detail could be called in to question, it undeniably brings a colourful and vibrant chapter in American history in to the light.The most notable thing, actually, is the smooth, balanced transition between the tense drama and the more light hearted, easy going feel, where the character's turn the film's title into a rude but imaginative play on words over and over, which, along with the general zaniness of the idea, makes the whole thing that little bit more of an involving, enthralling ride. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
An incredible true story,"'Argo' was the title of a fake sci-fi film used by the CIA as a subterfuge to rescue six US embassy workers during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. Ben Affleck's accomplished third feature as director (in which he also stars) avoids being a dull reconstruction by being rather incredibly among the funniest films I've seen all year.Affleck plays the lead role of Tony Mendez, the CIA op who led the audacious rescue and whose book prompted the film. He portrays Mendez as I imagine he really was – as a quiet American. Less the flag-waving brand of patriotism than an innate and unquestioning loyalty to the stars and stripes.Although the taut hostage narrative is the epicentre, it is mercifully overshadowed by the comedy arising from the film production difficulties. John Goodman stars as John Chambers, the legendary Hollywood make-up artist and Mendez's adviser. But it is Alan Arkin's wickedly funny and cantankerous Hollywood producer (the only one depraved enough to go along with the caper) who steals the show. It's his grandpa character from 'Little Miss Sunshine', only about a million times funnier.The film was criticised for its portrayal of Iranians, but I didn't think it was overly harsh. Militants can hardly be sanitised, can they? Affleck has the courage to admit to his country's (and the UK's) culpability in draining Iran of its oil in the chilling opening sequence, and he gives one of his characters the line, 'We did it to them first'.'Argo' is a deliriously energetic and compelling 'declassified true story', even if it shows a patent disregard for historical facts. I can hear Arkin say 'Argo **** yourself!' if we don't like it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Smart and enjoyable political thriller,"The Pentagon and C.I.A have been inextricably linked to Hollywood since the 1920's, offering their ""advice"" and influence on many productions. According to a spokesperson for the intelligence agency, Todd Ebitz, the C.I.A. even post story ideas on their website. Usually their collusion with the film industry is a propaganda tool to promote ideologies, or to glamorise, and mystify clandestine organisations. In Ben Affleck's Argo, a declassified (in 1997) narrative develops in a secret collaboration between wily Hollywood producers, and the Central Intelligence Agency, in an effort to rescue six diplomats from Iran, during the 1979 to 1981 hostage crisis. Whilst the story used in the film is a footnote to the eventual complexity and over-long nature of the whole event (which lasted for 444 days, with 54 American hostages in total), it could be argued that this ""little moment"", is more enticing as a narrative about organisations (whether political, ideological or mass media), and the power of western (specifically Hollywood) popular culture around the world.In 1979 the pro-American Shah of Iran (Mahammed Reza Pahlevi) was forced to flee into exile after a series of increasingly violent protest against his regime, by Islamic fundamentalists. The US embassy in Tehran was targeted by the revolutionaries after Jimmy Carter saluted the exiled Shah in a toast, stating that Pahlevi was a friend of the nation. Argo opens as the embassy is stormed, paper documents are frantically shredded, computer files hammered into fragments. Six diplomats exit and find refuge in the Canadian Ambassador's home. C.I.A. agent, Tony Mendez (Affleck), determined to extricate the escapees, is enlightened with an idea to create a fake Hollywood science fiction film, create false identities for the six, and act as a film production, scouting for locations in Iran. Mendez's connection to Hollywood, is special effects veteran, John Chambers (John Goodman), who is most famous for designing the simian prosthetics for Planet of the Apes (1968). Along with ageing, and out of work, director, Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), - who might or might not be Don Siegel, I'm not sure - they create a script and concept artwork for a ""cheap science fiction Star Wars rip-off"", with the title Argo (a reference to the ship in Greek mythology, sailed by Jason and his Argonauts).I'm not a particular follower or fan of Affleck the actor, finding his abilities to be somewhat one-dimensional, but it is always an intriguing prospect when an actor makes the move to directing. This is my first experience of this with Affleck, having never seen Gone Baby Gone (2007) or The Town (2010), but I have heard encouraging things about his previous films, so I was looking forward to watching how he worked with other actors. Whilst not a great actor himself, he understands the acting process, and casts brilliantly, particularly the very undervalued Bryan Cranston. Chris Terrio's dialogue is sharp, effective and referential (with many nods to contemporary sci-fi, to salivate the generation that Affleck is a part of). Science fiction aside, Argo is a project that understandably fell into the hands of an actor/director (even George Clooney co-produces with Affleck), much of the mid-section of the film is about the acting process, the six escapees having to become the fictionalised characters that might get them back to America. When it's a life and death proposition, this process seems excruciatingly hard. To fully portray these people, they have to become every aspect of that person.Throughout the film, systems of hierarchy and levels of bureaucracy are eluded to, from the offices of the C.I.A., through the dealings with Hollywood, to the levels of security and multitude of check points found when attempting to leave a fragile, destabilised country. The latter of these systems is used to great effect towards the end of the film, where the Mendez-led ""film crew"" pass through increasingly excruciating encounters with Iranian security at an airport. Argo juxtaposes the machinations of the openly narcissistic Hollywood industry, with the more secretively narcissistic C.I.A., whilst they are inextricably linked to the heightened processes of government, these intelligence agents almost appear comical at times, unstable, with a tendency towards incompetence. The audacity of Mendez to assume he could pull off a legitimate looking fake film, shows this innate narcissism, and Chambers even relates the concept when asking him, ""So you want to come to Hollywood and act like a big shot, without actually doing anything?"" When told yes, he says ""You'll fit right in.""Of course Afflect's character is morally stable, but an ineffectual sub- plot involving an estranged wife and son, is like an unnecessary, staid, use of cheap emotional manipulation. Towards the end it becomes uncomfortably saccharine, the image, music and text utilising generic, over indulgent climactic rubbish, using the common signifiers of the worst kind of Hollywood drivel. However, this is a very small indiscretion in a smart and enjoyable political thriller. Frightening Argo also highlights the fact that the west's relationship with the middle-east has changed very little, with heightened hatred of the west from Islamic fundamentalists, and the nature of terrorism having not altered significantly with the current hostage crisis in Mali.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Many reviewers contend it is not.It is a wonderful premise, and could have been so much more, with proper development of the characters, even if not true.It does bring out an idea I have been convinced of since the unarmed folks trying to make their way across a bridge to better conditions in Texas were shot by authorities during the horrific aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The government is definitely our enemy as normal working folks.

Quit the Hatin',"At first I was a little pensive about this movie because of all the hoopla and fuss surrounding the real historical facts of the story (or lack thereof), especially with the Canadians, and I now live in Canada. Every second person I encountered would mention how it was actually the Canadians that pulled off the rescue etc. Get over it people! The same thing happened with Braveheart (I'm from Scotland) and U-571. I used to feel strongly against movies that are supposedly based on true stories or fact, but now I just don't care; it's an American movie, so the heroes are going to be American! It's an American movie so the heroes are whoever they bloody well choose! The day Canada makes a similar movie, that's the day they can correct the historical inaccuracies! Let's just enjoy Argo for it is; a phenomenal effort from Ben Affeck, a taut and intense thriller with moments of sly humour, especially from John Goodman and Alan Arkin, and solid acting from the rest of the players. For what it's worth, the story-line does actually acknowledge Canada for its efforts when it could easily just overlook it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
6.8 - good movie but too much unnecessary drama,"The movie has a very good tone, I would say something like ""Air"" where also Ben Affleck starred. Starts of good, nothing much happening, more like a setting up for the drama that follows.Tony was a nice character, not like out of world directed but I would believe its a true story the way the characters are setup and the way the story is displayed.So my objection and the reason on giving the rating is because the movie took a little late to take off and when it did it was a little to dramatic that, it being based on true story, doesn't hold in the real world. Yes, its a movie and they want drama but man they little were putting suspense that wasn't even required like something less and more realistic would have also worked. If I be honest I was on the end of couch all invested in the drama so it was good in a sense.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
One of Ben Affleck's finest directorial works so far..,"After watching ""The Town"" from Ben Affleck, i was waiting with anticipation for his next flick and boy was it worth the wait. Basically, the movie one of his finest work. Suspense, action keeping you on your seat wanting for more and more, until the end of the movie.OK, the Iranians are not portrayed in a very positive light in this movie, but lets not forget this is a movie made by an American, celebrating the hardship of the American embassy staff that was held hostage in a country that was bound to make a point that American imperialism was not going to fly in their country..Having said that, Ben Affleck does not go into the politics of the Iranians too much. The situation was very tense and you can feel it throughout the movie.There is no moment where things get easier for the protagonists of the film.Great performances all around although i found Affleck's character to be one dimensional at times.So, if you like Spy movies, inspired by real events and a real political background to them and suspense all around, this is definitely a good flick for you.Have fun watching this, I know i did ;)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Affleck continues his good form,"The television show 'Family Guy' once made a joke inferring Matt Damon did all the work towards 'Good Will Hunting' and Ben Affleck did none of it. With Argo, Affleck proves (if he hadn't already with the likes of 'The Town' and 'Gone Baby Gone') that he's actually very switched on indeed as to what makes for a good film. He has received seven very well deserved Academy Award nominations for Argo, and only time will tell how many of those it wins, but at this stage it is odds on to win Best Picture.Argo is set in revolutionary Iran, 1980. It follows a secret operation to extract six fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of Iran led by Affleck's character Tony Mendez. It is based on a true story. Affleck gets the feel of the 80s and the location just right. The story flows exceptionally well and has the audience captivated throughout. The final 20 minutes or so are incredibly tense and brilliantly filmed. The editing is as sharp as you could ever hope for.The amazing story always takes precedence and the actors are allowed to thrive amongst that. Affleck is commensurable with his usual performances and his laid back style fits in well here. But the star for me was Oscar nominated Alan Arkin. The man has an unbelievable amount of charm about him. It doesn't matter whether the joke he's telling is hysterical or a complete dud, he'll make it work. But he's not limited to telling jokes. You want him on your side, that much is for sure. Bryan Cranston is Hollywood's go to man at the moment. He can do no wrong, and Argo is no exception. Long may it continue because the man is an acting phenomenon and an Oscar nomination can't be far away for him. The rest of the cast support brilliantly and their Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture win at the Screen Actors Guild Awards was as deserved as you'll ever see.Hollywood and The Academy love a film about a film, as seen last year with both 'Hugo' and 'The Artist'. And while Argo doesn't do this anywhere near the extent those two films did, I still think it'll be enough to win the Best Picture award. Naming the film 'Argo' (the title of film within a film in the movie) is rubbing this in everyone's faces a little for my liking, because it doesn't actually have that much to do with the story, but this is forgivable because it could be said this was a centerpiece for the events in the story. Don't get me wrong, it'll win it for a lot more reasons than this (most are mentioned above), but this will be the clincher. Argo is what I would call a solid film. It tells its story in a very neat and polished way, which is a good thing. Affleck can feel robbed of a Best Director nomination in my opinion, but I'm sure he'll be satisfied with the success it has had throughout award season.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Argo saves the day,"I enjoyed how the movie Argo, decided to star Ben Affleck. I enjoy him as an actor. The plot of the film was very interesting and you never knew what was going to happen next. They choose to create a fake movie to fake characters to bring those six Americans back safely. I would have never seen a plot like that. The whole time, I was on edge, which I felt the director did on purpose. My only complaint however, was that the start of the movie goes at a slower to medium pace. However, it gets made up for the pace towards the end being the absolute highest and nail biting. Having the Iranian police driving with their loaded trucks and weapons towards the plan that the Americans were escaping on. And the Americans barely departing off the runway, was the craziest way that the movie could have ended. It was a terrific ending because the movie ended off action packed. I would definitely recommend this movie for you to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Wise Words from C.P.A,"I wasn't able to see this movie in all its glory but from what I was able to see. The actors did an amazing job to bring the emotions to life. Specifically the fear and Torment, I mean a lot of people can act those things. But I felt that they truly brought those emotions to life in this film. And not just that the frames used were pretty good. Though when it came to intense or suspenseful scenes I felt it wasn't very well set up. Looked almost like lazy work. At first I didn't get why certain music was chosen but the more time I spent watching and listening it started to make sense. Though i haven't looked into the story of this whole piece of history I felt that it was pretty well reenacted how it might've gone down. This movie wasn't truly something to recommend but if I had to say someone who likes to watch some really fast and really broken down movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Not Picture of the Year but still really good.,"Argo was a very good film but Picture of the Year it was not. Sorry Academy but you got it wrong once again. Don't mistake this for bashing. Like I said, Argo was a very good film. Ben Affleck has proved once again that he's not only a fantastic and underrated actor but that he's becoming one of the better directors in Hollywood. Argo had great pacing for the type of movie it is, the plot developed perfectly, the characters all felt real and authentic, etc. The only negative I would really have is that some of the suspense felt cheap and forced. Sure, they truly did escape Iran. That part is a true story. However, how close they were to getting caught is not necessarily known. So the fact that the final 30 minutes of the movie was close call after close call and that these scrapes didn't develop authentically but felt manufactured was not ideal. Nonetheless, I'd say this is a really good movie that, while it's a little overrated and over-hyped (it won Picture of the Year when I'm not even sure it's the best true story CIA film of the year - that would probably be Zero Dark Thirty), most people would still enjoy.

"Certainly it's okay, but hardly one of the best films of 2012","Kind of a big disappointment for me, though it's certainly a pretty good movie. Affleck's direction is excellent, it's beautifully shot and it feels like a really good film, but, honestly, I think the story is kind of thin and never very interesting. You can tell that the screenwriter had to add dozens of moments of fake tension to the real story to make it filmable. None of the characters really pop out as interesting people, and it'd be a shame if someone like Alan Arkin was nominated for an Oscar just for getting a couple of chuckles. Affleck himself probably gives the best performance in the film, but it's of a blank kind of person, a CIA spy who is meant to be that way. The movie's perfectly entertaining to watch, but it evaporates immediately. It'll certainly be the kind of movie the Oscars go for, but, I'm calling it right now, no way it wins Best Picture (it might very well, however, win the Best Adapted Screenplay award, though it's totally undeserving of even that).",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Poor movie,"The movie moves at a good pace, the street scenes are nicely filmed. The 80's - or rather the late 70's atmosphere is well present in the movie despite somehow simplistic set-ups and presence of spare era elements - cars, clothes, etc.The movie does a poor job of expressive the Iran atmosphere of that era, or at least the daily life or a hint of the culture of Iranian people under the regime, probably because it was filmed on a budget and mostly not on location.So the plot line is quite well written and filmed. What's is shocking is the rave reviews considering the main character play is null. Unless you are a hard core fan of Ben, there is just no play from this character. He has decent play in other of his films, but here it seems he's forcing himself not to show emotions or expressions. The remaining of the cast does an OK job, Goodman is up to the job but all of them seem detached from each other, acting individualistically.There are other historical hostages crisis movies out there, some of them are magical, tense and impregnate with local atmosphere of the specific times. This movie is not even at the bottom of the list.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Nail biting!,"I can see why this film has got such good reviews and received so many awards. When I watched the Oscars I wondered why it had received so many awards, especially best motion picture. And now I've watched it I can see why. It was so gripping even from the very first few minutes and that's what made this film so good. I could hardly look away even when I wanted to.It's an incredible story of how one man saved the lives of others. As well as this one man he had some incredible people behind him and helping both him and the other six people out of the awful situation they were in.Each character was beautifully portrayed and that's what also really made the film. The acting was superb. Ben Affleck plays Tony brilliantly. He acts like a hard, CIA man but really he's feeling every emotion as he goes through the nail biting journey into and out of Iran.I can't even begin to imagine how those people felt but they show us how to be brave and we should take inspiration from these people.Tony is an unspoken hero, until now that Argo has been produced and released.

a strong political thriller that manages to look like those of the 70s,"Based on true events, ""Argo"" chronicles the life-or-death covert operation to rescue six Americans, which unfolded behind the scenes of the Iran hostage crisis—the truth of which was unknown by the public for decades.The film is based on the ubiquitous and apt directed by Affleck, who with his third work, after the loaded Gone Baby Gone and unequal The Town, collect and process mastery a wealth of material, the introduction of hot situation in Iran and some original images from television broadcasts to the plausibility of the season and the actors, and gives a voice and a role in more than 20 main characters, without losing the tempo and the target.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A mission as unbelievable as Ben Affleck's Oscar snub for its direction ...,"An ingenious plan like in ""The Sting"", a hostile environment like in ""Midnight Express"", a gripping cat-and-mouse chase like in ""The French Connection"" and a life-and-death crisis like ""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Argo"" borrows so many elements plot and style-wise from 70's classics, that for one second, I wondered if it wasn't from the same era it was grippingly depicting.""Argo"" is based on the 1979 Iran hostage crisis that hooked the American audience for more than a year and sealed the political fate of President Jimmy Carter, but while it takes places during the crisis, the plot focuses on the close escape of six American diplomats from the Iranian ""devil's claw"", thanks to a cover plan, meticulously crafted by Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA agent and expert in ex-filtration with the help of his best friend and colleague O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston). Ben Affleck stars as both the lead actor and the director of ""Argo"", which makes the mention of Warren Beatty in one of the film's funniest line, quite fitting. Indeed, with his black dark beard and eyes constantly full of angst and concentration, he reminded me of Warren Beatty in ""Reds"", the epic he both starred in and directed. Affleck, never too demonstrative or showy, displays the same level of maturity and technical realism that places him among the most actor-directors of his generation (or has he still something to prove?)The main accomplishment of ""Argo"" is to be one of the most suspenseful thrillers of the last years, without exploiting the ordinary archetypes. No gun fights, no car chases, no explosions, the film is structured like a cat-and-mouse chase where each step is a life-and-death situation, and no mistake can be allowed. But let's get back to the 'plot'. The hostages' escape remained Top Secret until the case was finally declassified in 1997, and it's unbelievable that no director thought of adapting the story, if one thing, the material begs for a film. I don't want to reveal much of ""Argo""'s plot » because I suspect it would spoil a significant part of the enjoyment, which is the elaboration and the application of a clever plan: simulating the making of a film like ""Battle of the Planet of the Apes"" set in an exotic location.With the help of John Chambers, an award-winning make-up artist, played by John Goodman and Lester Siegel, a producer, played by a scene-stealing Alan Arkin, Mendez understands the necessity of not omitting any single detail, everything must sound plausible. The film must have a script, a producer, and publicity, like an article in ""Variety"", all precautions that would reveal to be determinant. This is where the real delights of ""Argo"" are: once you get deeper in the plan, the film takes off to a series of disguises and manipulations punctuated by the project's catchphrase: « Argo F-yourself ».The film blends many elements of drama and comedy but never distracting from the spellbinding suspense. The tension remains intact because at any moment, the plan can either fail or be canceled. One IMDb user complained about the predictability of the ending that ruined all the suspense, but we know the film wouldn't have been made if the plan had failed, so, it's all in the how that our hearts are hanging. On that level, suspense, action, the film has nothing to envy to today's overly spectacular and noisy actions films. ""Argo"" is a captivating thriller, absorbing you at each step of the escape, from the Canadian embassy to a local bazaar and pinnacling in an airport where you could feel the same tension than Billy Hayes in ""Midnight Express"".And the reason I mentioned Parker's film is to tunnel the review toward the only seemingly flaw or invitation for criticism, which is the relatively unflattering portrayal of most Iranian people, as a cruel and angry-driven mob or easily fooled people in the best case. Granted the timing of the film isn't the most inspired with the whole accusations pointed against the Persian state, and the way it kind of damages the positive effect, last year's Oscar-winning ""A Separation"" had on the perception of Iran.But I'm inclined to give ""Argo"" the benefit of doubt, for simple reasons. The film doesn't make big heroes out of the main protagonists, they are only trapped people trying to save their skins. The religious fervor and violence displayed can be associated with the troubled times induced by the Iranian revolution and the hostility toward the United States. Besides, the film is obviously told from the US perspective, so we can't deny that there were facing some hostility because of the US political choices, but this hostility is handled with the same realism than Gavras' ""Missing"", a whole country can have a nightmarish feel, but it trusts the viewer's intelligence, to put the film in its context.And like in ""Missing"", in the same degree of partiality, America isn't spared from criticism, since some political involvements are discussed, and subtly denouncement like the opening monologue that established the role of the United States in the coup d'état that installed the Shah as a puppet leader. ""Argo"" is intelligent enough to make us close our eyes on some negative portrayals, quite insignificant. On the whole, it's a plot-driven film rather than a character study, which should be watched for the thrills, the suspense, and a sort of educational value, to know how to deal in time of crisis, and realize that sometimes, the craziest plans are the most successful. As O'Donnell says ""this is the best bad plan we have"".What else to say? Well, ""Argo"" is a splendid achievement on the field of film-making, definitely one of the year's best if only for the scene when an agent talks Sci-Fi film with an Iranian civil servant, you wouldn't believe it happened? Hell, since Ben Affleck was spared a Best Director Oscar nomination, anything can happen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"If we wanted applause, we would have joined the circus.","Directed by Ben AffleckStarring Ben Affleck, Bryan Cranston and Alan ArkinWritten by Chris Terrio, Tony Mendez and Joshuah BearmanArgo is 'a dramatization of the 1980 joint CIA-Canadian secret operation to extract six fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of revolutionary Iran.'This film surprised me. I was coming in with a so-so attitude. I wasn't expecting it to be good but I wasn't expecting it to be bad. But when the film ended, immediately I knew that I just finished watching an excellent picture.There is one man who I give so much credit to in this film and his name is Ben Affleck. He did a great job. This was my first film directed by the actor. His vision of the 80's was excellent. Everything was there; set design, appropriate cars, signs, clothes and cameras used in the film itself. The music chosen was great. It gave an 80's edge to it. There is also music given the Iranian tone as well. Gave a great atmosphere to the film.Affleck's great directing skills came into play in the beginning of the film and in the climax. The beginning gave the film it's voice. It couldn't have started any better. All the facts were there. It presented why the hostages were threatened and Iran's anger. The climax was some of the best film making I've seen this year. The music, acting and camera movements blend really well together. The cut scenes from the airport and the FBI agency was superbly edited. As the hostages along with Ben Affleck's character are boarding the plane, I was on the tip of my seat. The film doesn't let you relax because new information is being thrown at you every second. I don't want to give much of the plot away because it is something you certainly have to see for yourself.That all being said, this film also has it's flaws. There were times in the film where I was questioning this picture because there are long bouts of dialogue in the process of getting the 'film' made with a few witty remarks. it kept me border lined entertained.

The production is straightforward, avoiding such things as noir or atmospherics, electing to let the storyline carry the picture.

"""This is the best bad plan we have...by far, sir.""","November 4th 1979, Iranians violently stormed the American Embassy and seized hostages for 444 days. It was an intense and frightening era in modern history; this film chronicles the daring operation to rescue six of the hostages after they fled the besieged embassy.I'm not at all familiar with the Iranian Hostage Crisis, so I have no idea how much of Argo is fiction and how much of it is fact (reading up on it, I see that the film is criticized for over-emphasizing the role of the CIA, and for presenting more peril than what really happened). Regardless, the film made the events feel very real. The film does it best to replicate the era, the settings, and the danger to immerse the viewers into the situation and make them feel the suspense. I certainly felt the suspense, as the characters ran up against all manner of political, diplomatic, and cultural barriers in a frantic race to escape a treacherous and unstable country. The film definitely kept my attention and had me at the edge of my seat.The story is well-told, presenting its ideas and sequence of events on a manner that's both logical and sensical. Even though there is a lot of political intrigue involved, the film never loses its audience with jargon or politics. It also looks and feels very realistic; despite some thrilling scenes, the events appear plausible and the various interactions between people and governments appear authentic. Characters have just enough depth and emotion to make audiences care for them, and once again, come off as seeming authentic.Even the film itself feels authentic, featuring some rough and gritty-looking camera work and editing. The camera is steady and solid, as is the editing, but it looks like a film that could have been made in the 70s, due to the way it's composed and put together. Same goes for its production design, which goes to great lengths to replicate genuine-looking sets, props, and costumes. Acting is decent: Ben Affleck is surprisingly strong in his role, Bryan Cranston is a fun to watch as ever, and everybody else fulfills their parts admirably. Writing is great. Music isn't bad either.Argo might just stand as a new favorite among political thriller movies; it's certainly one of the most real-looking and historically interesting films I've seen in the genre. Above all, it's intense enough to maintain interest. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

I will not talk about the plot here because I don't think that plot matters for most movies: the premise is basically this: the CIA has to deal with a situation where you have to evacuate a bunch of people from a hostile country.

The strength of Argo lies in its ability to blend humor with high-stakes drama, making even the most intense moments surprisingly enjoyable. While the music may not be a standout element, it effectively underscores the urgency of the mission. Cinematography captures the grit of Tehran and the glitz of Hollywood with equal finesse.

A great entertaining film but...,"While the film is great, I wish it didn't downplay the involvement of the Canadians in the rescue. The film makes it seem like they mostly ran point for the CIA and basically just provided passports and safe housing. In fact, Canada did a lot of the logistics and the mission was primarily of their design. Likewise, the Hollywood aspects of the story were beefed up and fictionalized. Lester is at best a composite character; at worst he is entirely the screenwriter's invention. These flights of fancy make the film less serious.Nonetheless, the broad outlines of the story are true and the script's slanting of the material into the darkly comedic really works as a thriller. The laughs makes the scares more intense and vice versa. Lester might be an invention but in Arkin's hands he is an endearing lovable curmudgeon. The script contains several brilliant moments of exposition to keep the plot moving. A lantern at the end of the film is one of the best uses of the technique I have seen and Cranston delivers the line hysterically.The period aspects aren't overdone and the blending of archival footage is quite neat.

A solid movie,"Argo is the best Affleck movie that I have seen so far. To start with, the story is so solid that the production doesn't need any embellishment for further dramatization. The script is very well written and acting is good. The scenes are very realistic although the shots seem to be taken in Turkey rather than Iran. This becomes especially obvious with women on streets without a headcover and more so with female airport agents in knee high skirts. In 80's Iran after revolution, it was impossible for women to dress like that, regardless of their nationality. It's amazing Affleck missed this important detail during the shots. Besides that, the editing and directing are in general above average keeping the tension up throughout the movie. Although the movie was criticized for slighting Canada's role in the operation the historical references are generally accurate and realistic. Recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Argo Scenario,"The movie Argo is an interesting concept that many people do not even know happened. This movie does an excellent job of getting its story out there but from an entertainment standpoint I feel like it could have been better. It felt slightly rushed with the concept but gave plenty of time to display American officials' opinion on the idea of making a fake movie to get the six out. Many officials felt that a different scenario would be better and that making a movie is risky and the movie displayed this very well. The movie also displayed well what they were doing in Iran with riots. It showed some of the violence that the Iranians were doing and how dangerous it was to do what Antonio Mendez was doing. In all the movie Argo is worth a watch but I wouldn't say it is super entertaining, it is interesting and has some funny jokes but isn't one of the best movies I've seen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Another Directorial Home Run for Affleck,"Argo is the story of six Americans who escaped the captured embassy in Tehran, Iran while under siege by the Iranians during the Iranian Revolution and the man whom took on the task of their rescue. This is Ben Affleck's third directing effort after having great response to both Gone Baby Gone and The Town. Affleck also stars in Argo as CIA evacuation specialist Tony Mendez. The film also stars Alan Arkin as film producer Lester Siegal and John Goodman as Hollywood make-up artist John Chambers.Mendez is tasked with the daunting assignment of getting these six Americans out of Iran and imminent death. Mendez and the CIA have a long list of possibilities but none of them are plausible and each has a high expectancy of failure. Mendez comes up with the idea of him flying to Tehran and bringing the escapees out under the guise of being a film crew scouting a location for a Hollywood Science fiction film. It is here where I believe the theme of the film lies. I believe Affleck is trying to portray the sheer power of Hollywood and the emotions that a movie can evoke while also telling a gripping tale of international intrigue. It is evident that the American film industry carries great weight with the Iranian diplomats and officers as, even in this time of uncertainty; Mendez is able to take the six escapees to the center of Tehran in the middle of the day with the Iranian Ministry of Culture. The films basis is in that of international intrigue and on more than one occasion reminds me of Munich, Steven Spielberg's 2005 film about the Israeli government's secret operations after the Munich massacre at the 1972 Olympics.Affleck uses lighting in a way that adds a great deal of detail to the feel of the story. Being a period piece set in 1980, the film is in widescreen high definition but has a grainy and dark feel throughout. I believe this captures the essence of the time and takes the viewer to that period. Everything about the film screams early 80s from the lighting to the text used in the subtitling. If Affleck wanted to give the film an authentic feel, he succeeded greatly. Additionally, there is the reoccurring motif of Mendez's desire to reconnect with his wife and son. This is brought up on several occasions throughout the film, with none being more memorable than when Mendez and Siegal are discussing family at Siegal's pool.In the end, Argo is exactly what Affleck set out for it to be. It is a Hollywood hit and film-making at its finest. He draws on every aspect of the true story as well as earlier experiences behind the camera to create a well done, however historically flawed, film that captures the audience from the beginning and doesn't let go until the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
I couldn't decide,"I couldn't decide, should it be monitored? Should not be watched? I think it's a weak movie compared to other movies that have received an Oscar.

It will be remembered for depicting the true story with accurate details and amazing direction,"Argo was easily one of the best film of 2012 with fantastic direction , tight screenplay and catchy story line.Argo is the name of a fake movie created by CIA-Canadian collaboration to escort 6 fugitive Americans from highly-tensed Iran.Ben Affleck ( Gone Baby Gone , The Town ) is getting better and better with each film. Gone Baby Gone was more of crime-drama where as The Town was more of action-thriller but with Argo , he has cemented his status as a matured director. Argo , loosely based on the true events taking place in the 80's era, was directed with aplomb. Affleck made sure he handles the sensitive subject effectively and the outcome was awesome. Screenplay is engrossing. The moment you are in the film , you will be impatient to know how will be the hostages freed from devastating state of Iran. Cinematography is eye-catching capturing the beautiful city of Istanbul ,Turkey. Art direction is great. The 80's period has been shown very-well. Performances by the star cast is good. However it Affleck show all the way. Not only is he a good director but a great actor as well. His action spoke more rather than words and was very expressive. Alan Arkin gives in a good support.Overall , ARGO was one of the finest movie produced in 2012. It will be remembered for depicting the true story with accurate details and amazing direction.

Revolutionary forces were and are real savages!,I gave it a 7 stars rating. I really liked how it captured the savagery of the revolutionary forces and the killings they did and still do to this day. Of course most parts about shah were a huge lie! and the whole Americans being the real hero BS. Was a good movie and people in this review section that are taking side with those savages that have taken us hostage over 4 decades are completely clueless and know nothing about these murderers.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Expertly Crafted, Standard Espionage Thriller","Why you shouldn't see it:The strength of Argo also happens to be its weakness. More so than a lot of modern Hollywood fare, this is a film about its story, and that story is about people in a not envious situation. It has been branded as a ""thriller,"" but despite a riot at the beginning and some brief ""action"" at the end, the majority of this movie's ""thrills"" and plot advancement are presented in the form of dialog and tense expressions. Accordingly, if you aren't one to care about the story of a hostage crisis in the early 80's, you probably won't care about this movie, since there isn't much in the way of real exciting set pieces or even off-color moments to take your mind off of the tension of it all.As I'm sure you're aware, Argo is based on true events. I can't speak for everyone, but movies that are supposed to have any relation to true events can make me uncomfortable. Did you know that Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Silence of the Lambs were both ""inspired by"" the same events? I'm a big fan of getting things right if you're going to try to tackle actual history, or you may as well just make up your own story and let it succeed (Silence of the Lambs) or fail (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) on its own merits. I can't speak for the veracity of any of these true events, since they're based on a top secret operation that no one even knew about until 20 years after it happened. Even now most people just remember the events surrounding this movie and not the events of the movie itself. That can be a smart move by a filmmaker, as it means you can tell the story how you think it needs to be told. On the other hand, it can be a risk, because you're telling a story about which no one necessarily cares.Why you should see it:Ben Affleck. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, ""Blake, I've seen Ben Affleck, and I've seen enough Ben Affleck."" Well you're kind of missing the point. Honestly, he does a fine job acting in Argo, though I wouldn't say his work is anything special. But did you know that Affleck also directs movies? He has only directed two movies (Gone Baby Gone and The Town) previous to this one, but I wouldn't rate either of them below ""very good,"" and this one follows in their quality footsteps.I just finished saying that Argo is about very little other than its story about people talking about a stressful situation. To further complicate the task for the filmmaker, everyone already knows how the story ends. And yet, despite these handicaps, Affleck somehow makes a suspenseful movie! There was a woman next to me in the theater, saying things aloud to the screen, along the lines of, ""No, don't go through that door!"" It's hard to explain how exactly this suspense is pulled off, but I think it has mostly to do with skilled actors playing identifiable characters in intimate settings. When the embassy gets stormed, you feel like you're about to get blindfolded and gagged by the mob yourself. When Affleck's Mendes is talking to Cranston's O'Donnell about how six Americans are about to get lynched for no good reason (depending on your viewpoint, I guess), you feel like you're standing right there next to them.Speaking of Affleck and Cranston, it's possible I didn't give enough credit to the former earlier. The role of Mendes as a character is to be the steadying force for the rest of the characters and story, and he performs that role admirably. Because Affleck is able to pull this off, the character actors like Cranston, Goodman, and Arkin are able to present their own characters as the film's much needed engaging changes of pace. That being said, the highlights of the movie as far as entertainment factor goes are definitely those very same character actors. Their interplay with each other and Affleck is always worthy of screen time, and I spent a good deal of the movie waiting for the next time one of them would pop up.In Short:As you may remember me saying before, this movie isn't about anything more than a fairly straightforward story, so you're left at the end of it wondering in part what the point was. But I will say that the ability of the filmmakers to take a story that everyone knows the ending to and turn it into a suspense thriller is, well, impressive. Honestly, Ben Affleck as a capable storyteller doesn't come as a surprise, as he has a - admittedly limited - pedigree of making quality films. To make this particular quality film, he successfully turns an otherwise straightforward story into one of entertaining and empathetic characters in a surprisingly suspenseful situation. As far as talking movies go, I rate this one as an 8 out of 10, and I recommend it for anyone who can appreciate a good historical suspense/thriller/drama.Exceptions to the recommendation: if you have had too much Ben Affleck; if you positively identify with revolutionary Iran; if you have incredibly sensitive ears; anyone for whom suspenseful situations lead to nothing more than stress and high blood pressure; individuals who would like to go on thinking that the ""Canadian Caper"" was, in fact, Canadian; if you prefer to keep Hollywood as far as possible away from your understanding of historical events; people who would like to remain blissfully unaware that Ben Affleck is a worthwhile Hollywood type when placed safely behind the camera.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Perfectly solid movie with vivid detail to the time period and filled with a list actors,"Good as expected but I wouldn't say great. I guess I was just expecting more somehow based on all the accolades this received however I can't fault anything here either. Argo is a perfectly solid movie, filled with A-list actors and flawlessly delivered. What really blew me away was the attention paid in vivid detail to recreating 1979/80, it was like stepping into a time machine and a fun flashback for me.Based on a declassified true story we follow CIA exfiltration expert Tony Mendez who uses the production of a fake science fiction movie called ""Argo"" as a cover for a rescue operation in the middle east during the Iranian hostage crisis. Mendez creates a phony Canadian film project, scouting locations with Iran as a possible shoot and then smuggles the Americans out under fake passports as its production crew.Directed by Ben Affleck, my guess is that he was distracted as his portrayal of Mendez was pretty flat, his mood never changed, he was just tense, miserable seeming and kinda grumpy throughout. Was this his character? It is filled with A-list actors though such as Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Victor Garber, and Bryan Cranston who contribute in a big way to making this a great movie. 9/20/15",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Slow paced but interesting story based on true events.,"Ben Affleck did a fine job directing and starring in this slow paced (my opinion of course) but interesting story based on true events.

I'm not going to whine about it like other reviews on here, as I do understand it's the decision of the writer and director, but it would have not been a huge effort to add a few scenes to show some appreciation.

Intense,"Against the backdrop of extreme anti-Americanism in Iran due to its support for the Shah, six American citizens manage to escape the American embassy and take refuge in the home of the Canadian Ambassador. The problem is that they cannot remain there for very long as eventually their identities will be revealed and they will be captured and possibly killed. So a plan is devised to send in a C.I.A. operative named ""Tony Mendez"" (Ben Affleck) under the guise of a movie producer to attempt to take them out as part of the film crew. But before that can happen he has to get cooperation from some people in Hollywood to lay the groundwork for an actual movie in order to fool Iranian intelligence. At any rate, what I liked about this film is that it captures the intense anger the Iranian people had during this time without involving Islam as the main culprit. No doubt some used it as a conduit to gain political leverage and they are still doing it now. But it was the Shah--and our support for him--that was the catalyst. Even so, because of its strict religious leadership and the hatred they have for the West, I doubt that the current regime in Iran will allow its people to watch it. But that's another story entirely. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to those who also like political dramas of this type.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
May Very Well Be the Best Film of 2012,"""Argo,"" among the nominees for the 2012 Best Picture Academy Awards, may very well be the best film of 2012, and Ben Affleck may very well be the best director. Unlike other frontrunners, ""Lincoln"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" ""Argo"" is a movie-movie. Like those other two films, it tells a true story, but unlike those other two, disappointing films, ""Argo"" is not a starchy and lumpy docudrama. ""Argo"" is a smoothly running machine.""Argo"" tells a gripping story in a gripping way, never preaching (""Lincoln""), never getting too caught up in one aspect of the story to distort the narrative line (""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Lincoln."") ""Argo"" wants to entertain you, and it does. It's a thriller. My palms were sweating as much while watching this movie as while watching an old- fashioned suspense flick by Alfred Hitchcock, even though, like most viewers, I know how the story ends. I found the opening scene of the storming of the US embassy in Tehran so frightening I could hardly watch it. This is all the more remarkable given that I'd heard a radio interview in which Affleck joked about finding only older actors to perform the part of the ""students"" storming the embassy.""Argo""'s cast is full of actors I know well, have seen in many other films, and whom I like a lot: Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Victor Garber, Bryan Cranston. It's testimony to the film's power that I stopped thinking about these actors and got lost in the characters they were playing.""Argo"" tells the true story of a CIA plot to release six Americans from Iran during the hostage crisis. The plot: pretend that the six Americans are Canadians there to scout locations for an upcoming Sci-Fi flick.John Goodman and Alan Arkin are utterly believable, funny, and moving as the Hollywood part of the team. There's a brilliant, throwaway scene in which Alan Arkin and Richard Kind bargain over the price of a movie script. The scene doesn't advance the plot, but the dialogue is perfect and fast. It's just a witty respite in a tense movie about a life-and- death situation. Ben Affleck is perfect as a CIA operative. He keeps his cards very close to his chest.Farshad Farahat plays an amazingly hairy airport guard. He screams in Farsi. Most audience members, not speaking Farsi, will have no idea what this man is saying – there are no subtitles. Even so, we are terrified. Farahat deserves an award for his brief but pivotal performance as the face and voice of the enemy the entire world now confronts, an enemy driven by incoherent, focused, murderous rage.""Argo"" has a little bit of heartwarming family drama, a little bit of arcane CIA in-shop detail, a little bit of Hollywood behind-the-scenes banter, a very little bit of nightmarish torture.

A good movie with a lot of propaganda,"First of all, I really enjoyed the movie, despite the fact they showed Iranians very bad, hostile people. I feel sorry about the Iranians who are watching this movie, it should be very sad to see how the billion dollar movie industry in US can show any country whatever they want. I know this because another movie (Taken 2) showed Turkey as a 3rd world country with all the women covered and the streets like hell.They never showed any single educated Iranian, their arts, etc. All of the Iranians were angry people except the housekeeper.I don't know the actual history behind this movie but the acting was good, I am very surprised to see Ben Affleck as a very good acting in this movie.The story evolved very nice keeping the tension up until the plane passes over Iranian air border. I was thrilled until the last 5 minutes.John Goodman and Alan Arkin added a nice taste to this movie but their part was not that long.I took 3 stars out because, this movie is full of propaganda. But still it is a watchable movie and I don't think it deserves any Oscar since this movie is made because of the propaganda reason.

No Surprise,"There are mixed feelings about this engaging flick.

Is this the best picture made last year? I sincerely hope not. If it is, lets just close the doors to lofty proclamations, and just be entertained. I did enjoy watching this movie, and found myself thinking that it is better than I expected. But, does this little confession of mine make it a masterpiece? Oh, no, not in thousand years. Money, as usual rules. Promotions, agencies, right connections, aggressive advertising, that's what is all about.

A repulsive American hijacking of a great Canadian moment in history,"Essentially, Argo is a movie that takes a proud moment in Canadian history and hideously distorts it to create a film about how great the US is. The sheer volume of outright lies (not just historical inaccuracies, these lies were inserted to make it an American story) is honestly mind boggling. I'd rather not spend too much time explaining each of the fabrications individually, but I highly recommend you look them up yourself (such an interesting story). It's not like all Argo does is claim that the American's did all the work either, there's moments where the Canadians are disparaged by the CIA team that we're supposed to believe did all the work themselves. A particular low- light occurs near the end of the film when a member of the CIA team outright says that they did all the work but they'll let the Canadians take credit for it. I'll admit that being a Canadian, I'm definitely biased, but this film is too disgusting for me to give any more than a 1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Ben Affleck with another hit,"I'm going to be very honest: Ben Affleck is not a good actor, rather descent. But as a director, Ben Affleck is INCREDIBLE, whether you want to admit it or not.

The film has a very beautiful mixture of tension, drama, and even dark comedy. The casting is totally phenomenal with how much each actor emulates the real person. Since this is a true story, most people will go see this knowing the outcome, but the film isn't about the outcome, but rather the outrageous tactic the CIA took to bring back the Americans.

Based-on-a-true-story filmaking at its finest!,"The often-ridiculed future The Batman Ben Affleck deservedly picked up an Academy Award for Best Film for a suspenseful retelling of a complex rescue operation during the Iranian Revolution. Much like Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13"" the movie builds far more audience anxiety about how the story ends than any event that actual happened and can be pulled up on Wikipedia has a right to. Between these films, Argo stands as the superior accomplishment given the degree of difficulty. The complexity of the times portrayed and the number of conflicting constituencies involved in the story could have easily turned this into a morass of indecipherable political intrigue. Yet Affleck keeps the parties and their motivations straight in the minds of the audience. Casting choices add strongly to the entertainment value particularly the always fascinating Bryan Cranston, John Goodman and Allan Arkin. The proceedings go a little long but this adds to the eventually drama around whether all the pieces would come together to get the six hostages out of the country rather than being hung from construction equipment.

"I nearly cried at the end, true story!","Thumbs up for Ben Affleck. He did a great job making a political story to a film in a very fair way. I respect that. And as an Iranian I believe that this is not a political game at this time, but a movie that can entertain you.As an Iranian who is not a big fan of his country specially at 80s, but a big fan of cinema, I see this film is pure art and nothing else matters. You are watching it, not thinking about why or how this is, which means script has a lot to discuss, but instead, you think about people in it, characters, about Tony's son, about the house keeper, about the mad man at bazaar and yet, this is it! The film got you in! Why would I destroy such an entertaining moment watching this by an unfair political and nationalistic look? And why is this film entertaining? Because of Mr. Affleck's solid way of direction. That not only helps you to believe the story and people in it, but helps you involve and think about it and worry about upshot as well.Not so long ago a revolution had happened in Iran and then, some bad mistakes happened too. I know that most of the people in Iran in 1979 and 80s were strangely violent and this film is all about a mistake that I can't ignore it as a human being, but I can't ignore the US government's involvement at Shaah's crimes at the moment. So, what I wanted from this picture, was a fair perspective of what happened and that is exactly what I got! Film is not trying to tell you that all Iranian People were bad and Iran is Devil! Also is not trying to tell you that USA is saint. See?I can tell you that some important issues ... forget it! I almost cried at the end and nothing else matters, so ...

Average Movie..........Vastly Over-rated,"In the ""Golden Age"" of great cinema (the 70s) this would not have got a nomination for a best picture Oscar. To-day ?? it actually won B.P. It is the way things are now...progress ..? not at all, just change and in what the studios can get away with. Having said that, 2013 will go down as a weak year for films. Ben Affleck directs well in the easy parts. But Robert Altman would be turning in his grave at the dialogue scenes (particularly those with more than two characters). It is an art that only the great (or very good directors) get right. O.K., its BASED on a true story (big deal). It is like an old 2nd world war movie...the Germans were shown to be stupid. This time its the Iranians. People are calling it clever...and only the Americans could have pulled it off. That is total rubbish. Enjoy this for what it is...a run of the mill adventure flick...and that is all.

tremendously entertaining Hollywood nonsense,"While based on a true story, perusing wikipedia revealed that pretty much every time you see something in this movie and think, ""that can't be true,"" it's not. And you will constantly be thinking, ""that can't be true."" But while it's not much of a historical document, often, in Hollywood fashion, altering the truth even when the truth was interesting, on its own terms as a movie loosely based on a historic event, this is a whole lot of fun.The basic premise is terrific, combining spies and Hollywood. The script is witty and the ending layers one suspenseful last-minute crisis after another (none of them remotely true).I know there's an article in Wired that tells the real story, and I need to read that.

"Ben Affleck is a director, not an actor!","When I first watched ""Argo"" I have do admit I had my doubts. Mainly because I have an ambiguous relationship with Ben Affleck, I was very nervous in terms of what to expect from him. As an actor he has always confused me, mainly because he's managed to cement himself as one of the top A-listers despite some horrible performances and choice of roles. Daredevil, Reindeer Games, Bounce, Jersey Girl were all titles that made us doubt the handsome brown- eyed actor. It seemed that he played the same role over and over again. For whatever reason we tolerated it for a while. Probably because we still remembered the glory days of Good Will Hunting and Armageddon. I remember seeing a spoof on Family Guy with Ben Affleck sitting on a dirty couch drinking beer. He suddenly exclaims ""Whoah! I gotta be Henry the 8th in twenty minutes!"" He practices saying ""Hello"" with a terrible English accent, snaps his fingers, says, ""Got it"", and leaves through the door. This 8-second clip pretty much summed up how I felt about him for many years and in 2003 he finally dropped the ball completely with Gigli, a movie often credited as one of the worst ever made. I for one, lost all respect.We forget about him until 2007 where his little brother steps into the light with a strong performance in Gone Baby Gone directed by Ben himself. A well crafted fast-paced thriller that showed a new side of the forgotten star. 3 years later, it's clear. Ben Affleck is back with yet another brilliant movie. The Town. We realize that this man is a director, not an actor. His way of telling his stories is absolutely unparalleled and he manages to pull the viewer into the plot with wonderful character developments. The Town garnered Jeremy Renner an Oscar-nomination, and this is as much a compliment to Affleck as it is to Renner, since the viewers' involvement with the character and empathy is one of Affleck's main traits as a director.Argo is no exception to Ben Affleck's brilliance as a director. It is so very easy to make a fast paced action movie with gunfights and car chases, and so extremely hard to make one with the finesse and fine-tuned timing that makes you sit on the edge of your seat. It simply goes to show you don't need all the violence, and fast paced hardcore action that currently dominates Hollywood. It is a revolutionary and brave attempt at bringing the thriller genre into a new era.The movie sets off at the escalation of the Iranian hostage crisis. With no prior knowledge to this event, the viewer has no doubts about what is happening, and the conflict is as clear as daylight. 6 American diplomats working on the American embassy in Iran flees when Iranian rebels attack the Embassy. They seek refuge at the Canadian Ambassador's estate, who has to keep it a secret in order to maintain his peaceful and diplomatic relationship with the Iranians. When the CIA learns of the attack they hire their very best ""extractor"", Tony Mendez to extract the six refugees out of Iran. He comes up with an ingenious plan to make a ""fake"" movie, and use it as a cover to extract the Americans. He teams up with two Hollywood experts, director Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) and special effects man John Chambers (John Goodman) to fake the movie and travels to Iran to extract the refugees.The tone of the movie is set from scene 1, and the tension is build up exponentially from here. The before mentioned finesse shines through so brightly, since you never know what will happen next. It's an extremely exciting and intense storyline, and Affleck manages to keep you interested without your typical big, visually spectacular action sequences. Alan Arkin and John Goodman manages to breathe some fresh, lighthearted and witty life into the otherwise serious movie. Through their amusing dialogues, they give the movie a charming twist and elevate it to a whole new level. Goodman and Arkin seem to be very comfortable in their roles and Arkins' Oscar nomination is indeed deserved.Ben Affleck's choices of actors for the roles always amuse me. In The Town he chose actors like Blake Lively, John Hamm and Titus Welliver who are all strong and well-known actors, but mainly in TV-series. The same goes for Argo. Bryan Cranston, Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall and Rory Cochrane dominate most of the main cast. Whether or not this is intentional, it is worth mentioning since it says a lot about Affleck as a director that he doesn't necessarily choose the most famous actors, but the ones that are best suited for the role.It pains me to have to write this last section of my review, but someone has to do it. Ben Affleck's role is not particularly good. It's not particularly bad either, but he just seems incredibly unnecessary in the sense that his performance is a bit spineless. I know a lot of people will disagree with me on this one, but his character just didn't speak to me at all. I read that Affleck originally wanted Brad Pitt to play Tony Mendez, but he had to back out of the project because of scheduling problems. Maybe that's why he decided to take over the role himself, and maybe that's why it seemed a little ""rushed"".In conclusion Argo is literally the point where art meets action, and the result is a redefining piece of film history, that has cemented Affleck as one of the top directors of our time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Truth is stranger than fiction,"Americans are usually very good at making films about their own historic events. Just a few examples that come to mind are 'Frost/Nixon', 'Milk', 'J. Edgar', 'A Mighty Heart' and 'The Social Network'. 'Argo' is no exception. It's a well-crafted, solid movie about a bizarre event that took place during the hostage drama at the US Embassy in Tehran. In a clear case of truth being stranger than fiction, the CIA smuggled six US Citizens out of Iran, disguising them as members of a Canadian film crew making the sci-fi movie Argo.Director Ben Affleck used this event to make a suspenseful thriller. He knows how to make a story exciting: by showing parallel developments that put the audience on the edge of their chairs. While the CIA is working on the escape route, the Iranian intelligence is assembling photo's of the six by puzzling together pieces of shredded paper. Who will be the first to succeed? Although the audience knows how the story ends, the suspense is being built up through the entire movie.Immediately after I left the cinema, I planned to find out how much of what I had seen has really happened. As it turns out: quite a lot of it is made up. Just read CIA-agent Tony Mendez's own account of the operation on the website of the CIA. (His report is titled 'A Classic Case of Deception'). He describes how the operation went 'as smooth as silk'. There was no problem whatsoever getting the six out of the country. Let alone revolutionary guards driving armored cars on the runway to stop the plane, as is shown in the movie.But of course, a feature film is not a documentary. It's okay to spice up the historic facts in order to make a better movie. Argo is very well-made, with a genuine period feel and a clever script. The only thing that bothered me a bit was the too-good-to-be-true last-minute escape against all odds. The film would have been more realistic if it wouldn't have emphasized the breath-taking thriller elements so much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
I Wonder if the Original Argo Would Have Been Good...,"Way back when, I was not a huge fan of Ben Affleck. I didn't think his movies were that good. I called him a wannabe Matt Damon and The Town was a wannabe The Departed. I still stand by the statement about The Town but after Good Will Hunting Affleck started to grow on me. He is a very talented actor no doubt but he isn't as good as the other actors that are very similar to him, meaning Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg. Then I saw Argo. I hate admitting when I'm wrong but Ben Affleck may as well change his name to perfect.It's no secret that Argo won the academy award for Best Picture, and I think it deserved it but after seeing the movie a second time I wouldn't say it is flawless. It 100% deserves the Oscar but there were a thing or two wrong with the movie itself. I will start with the hate before I praise for 80% of this review. The basic plot is to rescue six Americans trapped in Iran during a mass protest and death to America ordeal in the late 70s. Affleck comes up with the idea to get them out using the idea of Canadian film crew. That is a great idea but I wish they spent more time in Iran. The idea of Argo is a cover up and they have that one intense scene and then the climax and the movie is over. There was so much time emphasizing the point of Argo and little work on the actual plan. The second problem is a nitpick and that is the movie only has a real impact the first time you watch it. The close encounters become less intense knowing the ending. I think that is important for a movie but it isn't the downfall of any movie at all.OK, that is out of the way let's move onto the brilliance, I mean Ben Affleck. This guy has been around the film industry all his life and he directed and starred in this movie. He was absolutely flawless. The writing was near perfect. Each scene flowed into the next so well and there was a lot of emotional attachment to many of the characters. The opening scene into this movie is crazy and sets the movie off in the right direction. The beginning is always important and it does a great job of hooking the audience to the story. That then led into the John Goodman character and the other guy bringing laughs and entertainment which led into the intense and thrilling ending. The ending to this movie the first time is so special. Little words are spoken but there is so much tension and a race against the clock.I never heard of this story before and I say this because it is historically accurate. These are real people and the fake Argo movie was really thought up. I'm surprised kids don't learn about this in school because the character Affleck plays is a hero and yes, the CIA kept it secret but when the story became public by Bill Clinton I thought schools would have taught it. In the credits of the movie they show real pictures of the events and people compared to the movie and they were spot on. Affleck and the producers did their research and down to the slightest detail made this historical moment come to life. From the shredding to the flag burning to the lady on the mic on TV.Like I said, the characters are fantastic in the movie. John Goodman plays the funny man in a lot of movie but the fact that he pulls this off in such a serious movie like this is commendable. The six Americans each brought their own likes and dislikes into the movie and they portray the stress of the situation so well. Some of them don't like the Argo plan and how can you expect them to? It was easy to put myself in their situation which made it easy for me to sympathize for them which allowed me to love this movie.The race against time and tension of almost getting caught is exciting. Audiences love covering their eyes, praying the Iranian police don't figure out they are American. It is that excitement that was probably exaggerated for Hollywood, especially the end, but this is necessary. This movie didn't have to be 100% historically accurate to be good. I can see people complaining about that but not me. It's a movie, sometimes you have to accept that the reality of the real life situation is not good for the big screen or business. I know the first time I saw this I was on the edge of my seat, holding my breath, waiting for the situation to unfold.Overall, Argo is an Academy Award winner for best picture and of all the movies nominated it was the right choice. Do I love this movie? No, but it was very good and very deserving of the honor of best picture. This movie is a roller-coaster the first time but gets less exciting after that. It is still a great movie and it completely changed my view on Ben Affleck. So, for that I say touché to Argo and give it the WillyT Seal of Approval.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Captive audience,"Truth really is stranger than fiction. Really, if the remarkable events depicted in this film hadn't been declassified by President Bill Clinton and instead pitched as a movie itself, it would surely never have gotten off the ground. Sometimes though, a story is so good that it doesn't need the Hollywood treatment and while I admit I was completely caught up in the drama of the six Iranian hostages that got away (in more senses than one), I felt at times manipulated by the what seemed at times artificial ratcheting up of the pressure as the group, led by sole CIA man played by director Ben Affleck edged ever closer to freedom. For a film that tries so hard for the authentic documentary feel, I just doubted if their escape was just so last-minute with their would-be fundamentalist captors learning if their true identities just as they were actually boarding the plane and then were chased down the runway by pursuing police cars and trucks.This grandstanding detracted from my enjoyment as for me there was more tension in the scenes where up-till-then reluctant unbeliever in Affleck's plan, Bryan Cranston has to improvise storyboardjng the imaginary movie under the scrutiny of gun-toting revolutionary soldiers smelling a rat, or the interminable wait before John Goodman's back-home movie producer picks up a call which again is make or break for the would-be escapees.With its mix of original news-clips of the day and edgy hand-held shots staged today, I was certainly taken back to the dark days of the long-lasting original crisis. Affleck, behind a nostalgically thick beard last seen on Al Pacino in ""Serpico"", also didn't quite convince me as the cool pragmatic agent who imperils his own life to attempt to get the six out. On the plus side though Alan Arkin and John Goodman are both fine as the behind-the-scenes Hollywood schemers trying to make the back story look real.Although I found the direction a little too busy at times, I fully understand the likely attempt to recreate the chaos in Tehran and the desperation in Washington to provide a solution, any solution to the situation. I was amazed at the way the Iranian revolutionaries put young children to work to establish the existence of the six refugees (the moral of the story, always use a criss-cross shredder) and likewise shocked at the sight of a suited businessman hanging by a noose from a construction crane in the middle of what otherwise looks like any other city centre in the world.Images like those stay long in the memory as does much of this revelatory film which in my opinion just overdid the climax to what is a compelling and blood-thumping story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Not even worth a nomination, let alone an award","I never saw Argo when it was in the movie theaters. Mainly because i think that Ben Affleck is a lousy actor and also because I read a lot of reviews telling me that the story was inaccurate. Well, I finally saw the movie on a slow afternoon at a friend's house without paying for it. Thanks for that. Because it certainly is not worth to pay for and it is not even worth the time . First of all I fell asleep several times while watching the movie and had to start it over and over again. So much for suspense. I am so tired of movies depicting Americans as the saviors of this world. I am so tired of American movies showing the people of other countries as bad and dangerous and inferior. Maybe the Hollywood movie people should remember that the US is a melting pot of people from all over the world and there is nobody living in this country, who did not come from somewhere else originally. I will never understand how this movie got nominated and won Academy awards. Actually that is not true, I understand that these awards are bought and obviously that year the gang around Ben Affleck spent enough money to win the price. I also understand that even IMDb is a forum where people vote and review just to promote a movie because they are paid for it. So whatever rating we see on this movie is not really representative of people who actually paid for seeing the movie. Well, I did not pay either and I am so glad I didn't.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Best movie of 2012,This was by far the best movie i have seen so far in 2012. I am a sucker for thrillers and this was just that with really smart humor built in to lighten it up a bit. The acting was amazing as it should be with such a brilliant cast. Alan Arkin was spot on as well as John Goodman. Well worth the prices of movie tickets. If you don't catch this in theatres consider yourself missing out! I will be recommending this to everyone I know. Best picture is definitely in the cards for this fantastic movie.

The Vidiot Reviews,"ArgoA great way to make a fortune in the Middle East is to sell Zippos and American flags during anti-US protests.However, the American in this thriller opted for saving hostages instead.When embassy workers (Tate Donovan, Christopher Denham, Clea DuVall) take refuge at the Canadian delegation during the 1979 Iran Hostage Crisis, CIA extrication agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) heads up the rescue mission.Flummoxed by the lack of believable cover stories, Mendez sees the operation as a wash until he watches a sci-fi show that inspires him to use Tehran's terrain as camouflage.With help from Hollywood heavy weights (Alan Arkin, John Goodman), Mendez hopes to exit Tehran with the hostages masquerading as film crew-members.Based on actual events, Argo is an exhilarating extraction anecdote with solid performances, intrepid direction and dark witticisms.Nevertheless, it would be easier to smuggle the hostages back to America disguised as opium.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Good film that shows events with varying degrees of accuracy,"The film does well to build and hold tension throughout the film. The acting is great, the story compelling, and although there's some dramatisation here and there, the film shows that action isn't needed to hold attention.At the end, the film flicks between the film's depiction of events
and footage from the time. The casting, hair and make up, and set designers did a fantastic job of recreating the feel and look of the Iranian Revolution. This is one of the most impressive aspects of the film, but the adherence for historical accuracy in one area also makes it far sadder that the film engages in revisionism in another. As others pointed out, it was mainly a Canadian operation, not American. The American film industry repeatedly side-lines allied nations' efforts in media at others' expense.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Affleck strikes again,"Argo was one of those films that I wanted to watch before the Academy Awards, since it's been nominated and won so many awards so far (especially after Critics' Choice Award for Best Picture) it was on the top of my list. I honestly have no idea what took me so long. It was impressive and I think it really is the best film that's been made last year.The film just sucks you in from the very beginning and doesn't want to let you go before it's done. It is very authentic, super realistic and every single detail in this films is so well-made, Affleck put a lot of effort to make the best out of it. Even the film itself was colored as an old one. I loved how they re-created places and clothes, even hairstyles. I really felt like I lived in the 80's, while I watched it. Apart from the visual part of the film, the story line was super tense and rather interesting. You wouldn't let yourself to miss one second of this masterpiece and at some places, you don't even want to blink and the closer the end, the faster your heart beats. The acting ensemble was brilliant and Ben Affleck, himself gave a performance to remember, I honestly think that this one is the tip of his career, he never did so great, before this I admired him as a director more, now he's equally good as an actor, too.All in all, I highly recommend watching ARGO, not only to sneak a peek at the real historical events, but also to see a well-made and intelligent motion picture, which allows you to take a look at the cinema industry - Hollywood from the inside, a little bit. http://citizencinephile.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/argo.html",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

""Ha Ha....Amerika"" (Sounds extraordinary like Gotham's reckoning one).Then the real show starts and movie takes you to different world.The screenplay makes you feel so real that you wouldn't like to step in Iran during any revolution.The acting by all the cast has been good too.Dialogues are wonderful it makes you laugh in such serious issue movie.The last 15-20 minutes of movie are breath-taking and you just wish them to escape asap.

Argo is the story of the invasion of the American embassy in Iran during the U.S. hostage crisis in Iran in 1980.,"I recently saw the movie Argo and I was very pleased with it. It's definitely a film to remember.Argo is an American movie based on a true story. It is a political thriller that has been directed by Ben Affleck. It is a gripping and interesting movie. It has won three Oscars. It tells us how the 6 Amercians who managed to escape of the invasion, try to get back to America with the help op the CIA and the Canadian embassy.They couldn't find a better cast. The director itself has played the main role in the film. He plays the CIA agent who is planning the rescue of the 6 Americans hidden in the Canadian embassy.The only negative point is that the important role of the Canadians in the help of the rescue of the six Americans, hasn't been shown as it should have.In conclusion, I would recommend this movie to all the people who are interested in historical events.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Ben Affleck at his Finest,"A story that, for many Americans, will forever be a distant memory. For others, a fresh memory that is taught to us and brought to life on the big screen. I am too young to remember when the six disappeared in Iran, but ""Argo"" puts the story on the big screen and gives a cinematic view point to the story. Is it 100% accurate? Maybe, who knows. No matter what, this movie is based on history.In 1979, the United States had an embassy in Iran, during a period of Iran's history consisting of much change and great turmoil. At the center of that turmoil was the United States, blamed for providing refuge for a leader which most Iranians wanted executed on their soil. They were furious that the United States was allowing this man to live out his days, dying of cancer, comfortably and without fear in the States. All this anger and hostility towards Americans had to be channeled somewhere. And channeled it was. The Iranian people attacked and stormed the American embassy in 1979, taking dozens of American hostages. It was their hope to trade the hostages for the leader in refuge on American soil. What the Iranians did not know was that six Americans escaped the embassy as it was being stormed and sought a hiding place with the Canadian consulate. The CIA sent in their best man to rescue the six escapees, a man by the name of Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck). In order to get himself into Iran, Tony devised, with his boss Jack O'Donnell (played by Bryan Cranston), a plan to fake a movie which would be filmed in Iran, with himself acting as one of the producers of the film, and the six escapees being part of the film crew. In order to make the cover story legit, Tony gets the help of famous film executives Lester Siegel (played by Alan Arkin) and John Chambers (played by John Goodman). These four men work their hardest to rescue the six escapees, but the question on everyone's mind until the of the movie is: Will is work?Ben Affleck has had some real duds over the last decade or so, Daredevil, Paycheck, and Gigli, being a few. But his role in ""Argo"" is by far the best of his career. He, along with cast members John Goodman, Alan Arkin, and Bryan Cranston, does a great job of really portraying serious danger and drama, while at the same time using perfectly timed humor to lighten the overall mood of the film, without cheapening the story or the movie. This movie is by far a drama, but the comedy that is thrown into the mix makes it an incredibly enjoyable movie to watch. This is not a movie for the kids, but a great date night movie if you're tired of chick flicks. In the words of Tony Mendez, ""Argo f*** yourself!"" A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Affleck Takes A Big Step Forward,"Over the years, I have given Ben Affleck a lot of crap. For whatever reason, I always saw him as the ""second fiddle"" to Matt Damon after ""Good Will Hunting"" and didn't give him much respect as either an actor or a filmmaker. With ""Argo"", however, I got a nice helping of crow, as Affleck proves to be more than a capable director, and in fact turns in an incredible effort.For a basic plot summary, ""Argo"" deals the the Iran Hostage Crisis of the President Jimmy Carter administration. When all other ideas to extract the U.S. hostages being harbored by the Canadian Embassy in Iran fail, CIA agent Tony Mendez (Affleck) concocts the craziest idea yet: posing as a fake Hollywood production in order to get inside Iran and smuggle out the Americans.The main reason this film works so well is because the direction from Affleck is superb. The movie contains action, tension, drama, and even some humor, all the while staying focused and ""tight"" (never losing track of the overall narrative). From the opening scene until the closing credits, the viewer is sucked into this story and never feels bored or let down.The film also works as a bit of a history lesson regarding the United States and its relations with other Middle Eastern countries (Iran especially, obviously). Since those hostilities still exist to this day, the story of ""Argo"" does not feel old or outdated in any sense.Also, Affleck is given a fine supporting cast to work with, including such talent as Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman, to name a few. Each of the cast members add a little bit of their distinctive talents to the overall production.Thus, ""Argo"" is an extraordinary film for its ability to re-create the tension of the Iran Hostage Crisis. I never thought I would ever say this, but if I were voting in the 2013 Academy Awards, I would give the ""Best Director"" nod to Affleck over Steven Spielberg.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

From superb production values - the 70s really look right, (not just the clothes and hair, but also a wonderful lack of self-conceit), as does the Iranian Revolution - to great solid acting, a superbly sparse script, and above all, excellent directing this is a film to simply watch and be carried along.The true story of the rescue of six Americans who escape the Storming of the US Embassy in central Tehran is told with verve and great attention to detail.It is not often we see a film that scores so highly in all categories and still remains simply tenterhooks watchable - this is suspenseful, watchable, and exciting stuff - and to balance that are nice low-key performances - one of Argo's key qualities is its ability to avoid melodrama while still piling on the tension - it's a very smart balancing act.For this reviewer it certainly does stand as one of the better films of this or any year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The Town made me watch this and I am glad I did.The cast is super-awesome with Alan Arkin's over-the-top performance; the screenplay is the best among others. Background score is good, too!Never a story told in such a thrilling, nail-biting way that I bet this goes for a couple of Oscars for sure. Best Picture? No doubt.The intricacy involved in this one (although along with a bunch of inaccuracies), is so sharp and honest and fragile, you are totally entertained. Ben Affleck is proving to be a great director than an actor, I would say.If you've been searching for a thriller all during 2012, go for this! Argo, ***k yourself!WATCH OUT FOR: the Start Wars tribute minutes before the credit roll.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?
