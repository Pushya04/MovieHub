"Good, except it feels like an unnecessary epilogue to a fantastic trilogy","I liked many things about Toy Story 4, except the fact that it came after Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 was such a perfect conclusion to the iconic trilogy that this feels like a tacked-on epilogue. I enjoyed the characters, I thought the story had some clever moments, but I just would have preferred it if they would have changed a few minor details and made this movie occur between Toy Story 2 & Toy Story 3.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Weakest in the series but animation was great,"Greetings from Lithuania.The few things i admired about ""Toy Story 4"" was amazing animation and some sweet moments and few funny ones here and there. Also there was an incredible chase sequence in the middle. Other then that i think it was the weakest in the series. I loved parts 1-3 and was surprised when they did the 4th one, because third one kinda perfectly ended the series. But money wheel needs to spin i guess, and here we have ""Toy Story 4"".Overall, i think ""Toy Story 4"" was unnecessary and kinda even felt like direct to DVD. Yet as a animated film it does look amazing and it was pretty OK overall, but nothing to write home about.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A cute sequel, but I still prefer Toy Story 3","I personally think that Toy Story 3 was the perfect finale for this movie series (With shorts such as Toy Story That Time Forgot as the colophon) but this was an okay follow-up.I guess all those fans who had Bo Peep as their favorite character would be more than happy to see her again after her notorious abscence in Toy Story 3.Overall, it was a pretty decent movie, fun to watch but without the same emotional impact of the third part.7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Toy Boring. No. New. Ideas.,"Same old same old since #2. Woody needs to make a kid happy. Another toy is in trouble. Woody struggles to help that toy & also the kid. Buzz, etc help when Woody needs them.
Well, somewhat different in this one is that Woody always needs to be told what to do & when to do it by Bo Peep. This is not surprising given Hollywood's current need to portray women as strong & noble and men as weak & nasty.
And then there is Gabby, who is alternately sweet(ish) & evil. The only thing more creepy than Gabby are her accomplices. How/why did they decide to make Creepy Story with main themes being emancipation and emasculation?",,Anonymous,Animation
Why does this exist!?!?,"I'll never forget seeing Toy Story 3 in the IMAX. Especially the ending.
That heartwrenching moment when our main character has to grow up and put his childhood behind him is burned in my memory and is a surefire way to make me cry during a movie. It wasn't so much what was happening that made it such an impactful scene, it was what it meant for each of us on a personal level that made it just... work so well.
Toy Story 3 was the perfect spot to end the series. The ending of that movie was a perfect bookend to the story.Toy Story 4, therefore, is the three or four additional chapters tacked onto the end of a long novel that should've been left on the cutting room floor. Take the heart and adventure of the first 3 films and the emotionally wrenching conclusion of the third one, suck all the life out of them and you have Toy Story 4 in a nutshell.From what I saw, I couldn't pick out any distinct message the film was trying to portray, really. Maybe it's something that requires another viewing or two; I have no idea. But my first impression of this movie is that it's just... pointless. It's fluff. It shows that Disney is fine putting out a story about growing up and leaving your toys in the past only to rush right back to them as soon as its nostalgic enough to turn a decent profit. I guess it worked; it performed well at the box office (and, yes, Disney sold me the BD combo pack) and it apparently got a high rating (likely for the sake that it's a group of animated things that resemble the characters you know and love. They felt like hollow shells of themselves, however; lacking anything of substance.Ultimately, this movie left me with a sour taste in my mouth. The original trilogy were such perfect pieces of storytelling, each serving its purpose, telling unique stories and developing the characters. This one, if anything, undoes that. It's a presentation of these characters for no other reason than that Disney knows we'll buy it again.I really hope this is the final instalment in the Toy Story series. Anything beyond this will enter into self-parody. It should've ended on the third one, but it didn't, and now we can only hope that this is the last toy story.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
*A Beautiful Exploration of Identity and Belonging*,"Toy Story 4 takes us back to the beloved universe of Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and their friends, while introducing a fresh perspective on what it means to find one's purpose and identity. Released a decade after its predecessor, this installment captures the charm and emotional depth that fans have come to expect, while carving out its own unique narrative.The film begins with Woody grappling with his role in a world where his owner, Bonnie, is no longer a child who plays with him as much. This poignant shift raises questions about purpose and self-worth that are relatable to anyone who has experienced change in their life. When Bonnie creates a new toy named Forky, a spork that believes it's trash, Woody takes it upon himself to help Forky understand his value as a toy.The heart of Toy Story 4 lies in its exploration of identity and belonging. Woody's journey of self-discovery is beautifully juxtaposed with Forky's comedic confusion and existential crisis. The humor is wonderfully balanced with deeper themes, making the film accessible for children while resonating with adult audiences.In true Pixar fashion, Toy Story 4 shines with stunning animation and meticulous attention to detail. The visuals are breathtaking, from the vibrant carnival scenes to the serene backyard settings, immersing the audience in a richly created world. Each character is brought to life with distinct personalities, and the new characters, especially the loveable vintage doll Gabby Gabby, add depth to the emotional narrative.The film also explores the theme of letting go, as Woody faces the reality of moving on from being Bonnie's favorite toy. In a powerful climax that emphasizes the importance of choice and selflessness, audiences are reminded that love can sometimes mean making tough decisions.While Toy Story 4 may not have the same groundbreaking impact as its predecessors, it beautifully serves as a continuation that honors the legacy of the franchise. It leaves us with profound reflections on what it means to find our place in the world and the relationships that shape us.As the credits roll, we're reminded that although toys may not be real in the traditional sense, the emotions and connections they represent are genuinely impactful. Toy Story 4 is a thoughtful, heartwarming addition to the series that reaffirms the idea that every ending is, in fact, a new beginning. It stands as a testament to the enduring power of friendship and the ever-evolving journey of self-discovery.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Disappointing film, especially for Pixar","As with every Pixar film you have your small, genius details and beautiful animation that brings there films to life. But here I found that there was no substance behind the beauty. Lots of our beloved characters were given minimal attention and seemed somewhat useless to the story. The story seemed impulsive with little direction, our characters jumping at anything that moved. The films villain seemed like subplot and didn't seem like a real threat. The first 20 minutes were my highlight. It seemed reminiscent of earlier Toy Story films and explored experiences that we can all relate to. Despite an uninspired villain, chaotic plot and underdeveloped characters I still enjoyed myself. Within the film there was so much creativity, humour and some genuinely moving moments. I just couldn't help but feel disappointed when this film is compared to its predecessors in the franchise.(Also please stay to the very end of the film, you will not be disappointed)",,Anonymous,Animation

"There was a time where Disney movies were telling stories, now it's all about sending messages...","I know time is up to dust off a few gender-driven stereotypes. For that, ""Frozen"" was a landmark. But there's a fine line between creating new characters and promoting their differences and deconstructing old characters that belong to a whole other storyline in order to promote a difference, that's when I get the feeling that Disney is dangerously toying with its own legacy.To make myself more specific, I would have no problem with a film centering on a gender exclusive romance and maybe that will be ""Frozen II"" novelty, but I would have a problem if they made a sequel to ""The Fox and the Hound"" in order to suggest that there was more than a friendship between Todd and Copper. Watching ""Toy Story 4"", I felt betrayed by the way the whole relationship between toys and owners, that took a trilogy to be built, was demystified in one single film to shine a light on Disney's 'new order'.All the previous ""Toy Story"" movies had a specific story. The first was exploring the psychology of toys within their relationships with their owners. Anyone could relate to that, kids who own toys and adults who used to. It also sealed the friendship between Woody and Buzz, as two of Andy's favorites, not rivals. The second film established the issue of growing up through the Jessie situation and the impeding doom of hormone-driven rejection. Still, Andy and Woody realized that they were not articles among others or valuable items to be worshiped, having ANDY written on their feet was their value and it was perfect while it lasted.The trilogy ended with the perfect tone (and note), Andy, now grown-up, realizes that the sentimental value of his toys depend on their current utilization as much as their past, so he gives all the toys, including Woody, to Bonnie. For the first time, there's a voluntary separation between the partners, it's an end of era but also a new start. And the toys' ""circle of life"" has always been about children having toys not toys having children, the song wasn't ""I've got a friend in you"" after all. In that fourth opus, there's such an obsession with that notion of ""having children"" that it felt like they were procreating them. I'm not exaggerating, it's used so many times it became a whole overarching theme.But I didn't have a problem with that because the film started with a rather touching scene. Feeling rejected by Bonnie, Woody follows her in her first day at school and helps her create a new toy, ""Forky"", I just loved the way the ""Spork"" came alive on the sole basis that he was considered a toy, and the way Woody felt responsible in a fatherly that wasn't totally out of place in the film's context. Because the motive was still Bonnie: he didn't want her to lose her new toy, Woody was still thinking of his owner, and that's the way all toys behaved, not because that's the way it should be, but because that's the way it was established as soon as the series began.This is why I just hated the way Woody admitted at the end that he did that because he had nothing else to do, as if toys were supposed to have an existence of their own, and being a lost toy was an option. Woody cared for Bonnie and Forky and it was out of character to describe this as a weakness. But the film constantly shows Woody as a weak character, both morally and physically, and for that, the studios came up with the right contrast: Bo Peep who is of course the incarnation of the Disney heroine, she's brave, bad-ass, perfect, not one ounce of vulnerability and nothing is impossible to her. Meanwhile, Jessie was relegated to a tertiary character while she could have been the female lead after all.The character of Gabby Gabby was a great addition though, acting like a Disney villain (especially with her scary minions-automatons) but displaying a hidden depth that broke my heart. That Gabby had the potential, but Bo was such a caricature that I could hear the marketing strategy behind her creation ""let her awesomeness put Woody to shame"" and she did a great job at that. Naturally, she's proud of not ""having children"" which seems to associate parenting with a form of commitment a girl should be proud to reject. Quite hypocritical from a studio whose main audiences aren't seniors.Now, maybe I'm overanalyzing, but when you also have two toys who insist on ""having children"" since they've been ""waiting for three years"" and they're males, it's of course a nod to the right for adoption, which draws the obvious parallel between belonging to children and having children. Which says in subtext, women shouldn't make raising families a priority but it's clearly one for those who've been denied this right. The message isn't wrong but just off-topic in the context of a series where a/ toys have always been the possessed ones not the possessors, b/ when the possession was a mark of friendship and nothing else and c/ when viewers could relate to owners, even from the toys' perspective. By over-humanizing them to make them timely relevant, something of the series' charm was lost.My view is rather conservative but only in the sense that I wished the spirit of ""Toy Story"" to be conserved the way it was in the first three films, I enjoy a progressive film like anyone, but I wish Disney could do that with new characters, not with series whose arcs were perfectly closed. But I think I see where they're coming from, they're probably preparing a spin-off prequel that will center on Bo Peep, so maybe ""Toy Story 4"" is only a vehicle for her. Ironic that in the film, it's a skunk.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A masterpiece of film-making, story-telling and animation. Delightful and devastating in equal measure, it might well be the year's silliest and most soul-stirring film.","THE LOW-DOWN: 24 years ago, Pixar's Toy Story quite literally changed the face of animation as we know it. The film presented an entirely new way of telling a story, bringing characters to life via CGI - pixels over pencils, so to speak. At the same time, Toy Story set a new high standard for storytelling in film, proving conclusively that animated movies aren't just for kids. In the intervening decades, the franchise has even made a strong case in favour of sequels - demonstrating that they're not necessarily soulless cash-grabs. Toy Story 4 is very much a part of that grand tradition. This is smart, soulful, sublime film-making: somehow entertaining and profound all at once.THE STORY: Sheriff Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is trying his best to adjust to life with Bonnie (Madeleine McGraw) - the little girl who inherited Andy's beloved childhood toys at the end of Toy Story 3. Even though he's forgotten more often than not, Woody remains intensely focused on Bonnie and her happiness. This means going into full babysitter/bodyguard mode when Bonnie creates Forky (Tony Hale), a spork with twists of wire for hands and clumsy wooden popsicle sticks for feet. As Woody tries to keep the trash-oriented Forky safe, he's swept into an accidental adventure - one in which he meets old friends and learns new truths about who he is and who he has yet to be.THE GREAT: Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Toy Story 4 is the fact that it feels like the natural, necessary final chapter of a story told in four parts. There's no way that any of this could have been planned when Pixar first introduced us to Woody in 1995, but the progression in both narrative and character development feels utterly organic. Woody has spent the last three films grappling with his existential fear of being lost, forgotten or replaced, from his first meeting with the brash Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) to the day Andy outgrew him and went away to college. This film challenges Woody - and his audiences - to think hard about second chances, about changing how you look at yourself, about finding and embracing a new purpose in life. As such, Toy Story 4 might be the most philosophical movie you'll see this year, in the best possible way.THE NOT-SO-GREAT: There actually isn't all that much to complain about. The plot machinations can feel a little clunky at times, but Stephany Folsom and Andrew Stanton weave so much joy and humour into their screenplay that the film still zips along. As this is very much Woody's movie, fan-favourite legacy characters like Buzz and Jessie (Joan Cusack) inevitably end up taking a back-seat. Even then, however, they each still get moments to shine. You might find yourself both thoroughly amused and mildly annoyed by the antics of Ducky (Keagan Michael-Key) and Bunny (Jordan Peele), a symbiotic pair of new characters who were clearly inserted into proceedings for comic relief.FORKING FUNNY: Give it up for Forky, surely the best new animated character of the year. Voiced with a bewildered tenderness by Hale, Forky is a delight - a walking, talking identity crisis created out of one little girl's love and imagination. Even better? With his magnetic attraction to all nearby trash-cans, Forky is a fandom meme just waiting to happen. A close runner-up is daredevil stuntman Duke Caboom, who reportedly owes his ridiculously charming posing and personality to current internet darling Keanu Reeves' commitment to the role. Toy Story 4 even manages to make its main antagonist, Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), both terrifying and endearing - although there are fewer shades of grey when it comes to her ventriloquist-doll minions, led by the determinedly creepy Benson.COWBOY BLUES: Ultimately, Toy Story 4 belongs to Woody, and rightfully so. He is this franchise's Captain America, in more ways than one. This film pays loving tribute to Woody's big heart and unwavering, self-effacing loyalty, even as it shakes up his life and world-view when he encounters old friend and possible paramour Bo Peep (Annie Potts) again. (Bo, by the way, is now super-cool and as far away from a fragile damsel-in-distress as anyone can be.) Woody's decisions and revelations about himself will make you weep with the most complex and bittersweet of emotions. There is joy and sorrow here, hope and heartbreak, final farewells and new beginnings, often in the same moment. In other words, it's the stuff of life itself, and it's glorious.CREDITS WHERE CREDITS ARE DUE: You'll definitely want to stay throughout the credits of the film, which are peppered with closing scenes that are essential to tying up the overarching narrative. At the very end, you'll even be rewarded with a happy ending for one of Toy Story 4's most minor of characters.RECOMMENDED? In every possible way. Toy Story 4 is a masterpiece of film-making, story-telling and animation. Delightful and devastating in equal measure, it might well be the silliest and most soul-stirring film you'll see this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"There's going to be haters, for no good reason.","There's going to be people who are going to hate Toy Story 4. It's pathetic that people go to the movies wanting to hate this movie and that every time they see a flaw, they're going to talk about it too much, and bring out the film as if it would be bad. We're here. It's definitely not a perfect movie. When was the last time we saw a flawless animated film. For my part, it never happened. In the first few weeks, people will love the film but the more the weeks go on, the more bad reviews will come out. That's what happened with Incredibles 2. For those who will pay to go trash against the movie, try to enjoy all the excellent moments that Toy Story 4 offers us. I've always been a fan of the trilogy and when I knew they were going to make a fourth film, I was a bit worried but I didn't think it was going to be terrible and when I went to the movies I wanted to love the film. In the end, I adored it. Josh Cooley has demonstrated that he loves the trilogy and the characters. A few people will say that they were missing minutes on screen for several characters but we had a lot in the last film. Directing, cinematography and animation for this movie was arguably the best of the Toy Story films. The pacing wasn't quite perfect and at one point it looked episodic but it was a film with beautiful morals and very touching moments. The first 40 minutes or so were more than excellent. The ending (without spoilers) was sad but not as much as Toy Story 3. Yet it was heartbreaking. It's the funniest Toy Story movie from my point of view. The villain was very well written and her acolytes were scary. Forky was hilarious. Tom Hanks vocal performance was his best. All in all, the movie is really great and it is my favorite movie of the year so far. For haters, enjoy the film and do not try to put everything on small details.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
No magic,"Toy story was special because of the bonding between the toys themselves and between them and Andy. Now that they are with Bonnie, you'd expect to get that same feeling. It did not develop. In contrast, she bonded with Forkie and the gang was an excessory.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best of the Toy Story movies,"There is no reason that a movie about toys should be this emotional affecting, but there's no denying it. Woody's journey in this movie feels as real to me as any in recent memory. It takes the fantastical situation of living toys and applies a recognizable metaphor that relates to the human experience, all done with possibly the most realistic visuals of any animated movie and in a lively idiom that can appeal to children at the same time. It's a delicate balancing act that the movie pulls of perfectly.Toy Story 3 seemingly left off at the perfect spot. The toys had said goodbye to Andy, their previous kid, and they were placed in the hands of a little girl named Bonnie. All seemed well with the world, and there should be nowhere else emotionally for them to go. Well, they found something really good for Woody, and that was uselessness. Bonnie just isn't interested in playing with Woody anymore. This is a very different dynamic than when Buzz showed up in Andy's room in the first film. Woody had his long life with one kid and is trying to start another, but it's just not taking. He doesn't feel indignation at a lost place, because he's never had it with Bonnie, but simply uselessness. He's spent his life giving joy to a kid, and now he's in a position where he can't help.When Bonnie goes to kindergarten orientation and isn't allowed any toys along, so Woody sees his chance and sneaks along, helping her to find solace in the creation of Forky, the new marketing opportunity for Disney. Forky, though, is a handful, and requires Woody's every attention as he tries to throw himself away, convinced that he's nothing more than trash. What makes this Forky bit really effective is that Forky is a mirror image of Woody in every way. Forky is thrown together from a spork and other simple materials while Woody was lovingly crafted decades before. Forky knows his purpose is to be trash and not help a kid, but Woody is effectively trash and knows that his purpose is to help a kid. Their bonding helps provide Woody with the beginning of clarity that maybe his time as a kid's toy is done.That doesn't come to complete fruition, however, until Woody meets Bo-Peep again. Lost for more than seven years and without a kid, Bo has lived her life of freedom to the fullest, getting played with by random kids but never tying herself down to a single kid. The two are at odds because Woody is desperate to get back to Bonnie after having been separated from her and Bo simply cannot understand why he would want to continue in that life having given so much already. Out of their past friendship, though, Bo helps Woody track down Forky after he's been taken by Gabby Gabby, the queen bee toy of the local antique shop.Gabby Gabby has a similar journey as Woody. She's useless, in her mind, because of a broken voice box and all she wants is to fix it so she can appeal to Harmony, the granddaughter of the woman who owns the shop. When she eventually gets the voice box, she gets as rejected as Woody has been by Bonnie, and she enters a deep depression.There are four characters in this film going through similar and related journeys, which is a lot, but the movie makes it work specifically because they're similar and related. They're all touching on the same idea of purpose and just approaching it from different directions. The other key is that three of them play as support to Woody's journey. They help inform Woody's emotional reality. Through Forky, he can see that his purpose isn't always to actually play with a kid. Through Bo, he can see the value of living without a kid. Through Gabby, he gives away a part of himself that makes him a toy in order to help another find a kid. When Woody eventually lets go of his life as a kid's toy, it's a decision that makes perfect sense for him, providing him with an enticing alternative life with Bo. It reflects, in a certain way, the empty nest of a parent who's seen their children off to college, looking for a new life to live not centered around another person dependent on them. It's a relatable feeling that bridges the emotional gap between living people and a rubber toy in a movie.In addition to the movie's strong emotional and narrative core, there are strengths abounding. The voice acting is great. There was a technical innovation that provided Pixar the ability to more accurately reflect light levels that gives the visuals a far more textured and realistic look, making the whole affair more sumptuous to simply look at. There's a wide array of side characters both old and new (from Buzz and Jesse to the new Duke Caboom) that fill out the edges of the frame to entertaining effect.From beginning to end, the film is thematically rich, entertaining, and a joy to watch. This is one of Pixar's best films.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The story is same as the premise of the third part of the franchise but only this time it deals with a much wider variety of topics: self-association in the society, loyalty, shattering of dreams, search for your purpose in life, definition of friendship, dissatisfaction with your current life status and the list goes on. Kids are only looking for fun and jokes to keep them entertained and they will not be entertained by Toy Story 4 what I clearly saw sitting in the movie theater - this is a movie that has grown with its viewers and is almost a quarter of a century old now.

"Good, but not near the level of it's predecessors","Toy Story 4 (2019)Watching this animated film as an adult, I was thinking during the first half an hour why was this even made? Why am I watching a cartoon about a pathetic looking spork made of chewing gum and why all the fuss about it? Couldn't they come up with something better in 9 years? As it went along, the story improved and at the end I did enjoy it but no way near as the previous ones.The new toys are different from what we saw in the earlier movies and have some interesting personalities which lead to good toy-chemistry and some funny moments. The plot has some originality but at times feels repetitive with decisions being forced and characters acting inconsistent to their personalities not to mention some of them being left behind as a whole. Also, the fact that the entire plot hinges on a spork, makes it difficult to fully appreciate despite the philosophical points and messages that it sends.I did enjoy the first 3 Toy Stories but I felt that this one fell short of its predecessors in establishing an emotional connection and leaving me with a feeling of overall wholesomeness by the end of the story which is sad because this is what Pixar has always been known for. As an adult, I would not say that this one is a must watch unless you are a die hard fan of the franchise or have children. Its good but not as phenomenal as everyone is saying.#moviesshmovies",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

This is disgusting! How depressing this movie was; it's far from the original one. Just because they have famous voices doing their parts in this movie doesnt mean this movie works.

Toy story 1 was good Toy Story2 was OK Toy story 3 well OK but this Toy story 4 shows series should end it now. This wasn't meant children under 11. People just want to relieve the past thinking what was good in the past is same now........no its not. As a parent I don't recommend the movie, Because of surreal settings that seem more gloomy and depressing than happy and cheerful. At some point I can't believe this was a Disney movie it's hard to believe it was. I feel sorry for the parents who brought their five and six-year-olds to this movie because if they did those poor kids will have nightmares right after.

Four films in and 'Toy Story' is still charming,"As this film opens nine years prior to the main action when Woody is still one of Andy's toys; his friend Bo Peep, is being given to another child. After this prologue we return to the present where he is now one of Bonnie, Andy's sister's toys. He finds himself left in the closet while she plays with the other toys. Then, on her first day at school Bonnie makes her own toy out of a spork, this she names Forky. He is her new favourite toy. Forky doesn't think of himself as a toy and only Woody's interventions stop him throwing himself into the trash. Then on a family road trip Forky is lost and Woody determines to find him and return him to Bonnie. In the process he meets new toys and is reunited with an old friend.Each time a new 'Toy Story' film comes out I fear it will be the one that proves unnecessary and is disappointing... one day that may happen but it doesn't with this film. It provides a solid story, good action and some mildly frightening, in a child friendly way, scenes. Some may be disappointed that many of the old favourites amongst the toys have almost negligible roles to play; this is balanced by some great new toys; I particularly liked Forky, even though he was slightly disturbing with his mismatched eyes and desire to throw himself away. Other great additions are Duke Kaboom, a Canadian stunt-bike toy and Gabby Gabby, a doll with a faulty voice box. As before this isn't just about the toy's adventures; it is an emotional story which may bring a tear to the eyes of some viewers; particularly during the final scene. Overall I thought this was a great film which can be enjoyed by people of all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar on the road,"Am a big fan of Pixar and have been for two decades or so. Have not loved everything they've done, 'Cars 2 and 3' and 'The Good Dinosaur' (to a lesser extent too 'The Incredibles 2') disappointed though certainly didn't dislike any of them. Their best work though are masterpieces, for me the previous three 'Toy Story' films, 'Inside Out' and 'Coco' fit this distinction as do most of their short films.Was in two minds when hearing that there was going to be a fourth 'Toy Story' film. Am somebody who would see the latest Pixar film, regardless of critical reception, at the earliest opportunity, not for nostalgia but for being an animation fan and having appreciation for high quality stuff. But it is very understandable that people are saying that they questioned the point of this being made and that 'Toy Story 3' was a perfect end, that was the very first reaction felt when first hearing of it. Those who weren't bowled over by this shouldn't be crucified for feeling underwhelmed and feeling that it was unnecessary.My aforementioned initial reaction was still not completely quashed finally seeing 'Toy Story 4' for myself. Thought actually it was still a good film, namely on its own, but if quickly getting any comparisons out of the way it is quite a bit below the quality of the first three 'Toy Story' films and as far as Pixar films go it's towards the bottom in my opinion. Which is actually not a bad thing, it says a lot about how brilliant much of their work is. A lot of great qualities, but the disappointment from some is understandable.The story is a slight one and can feel over-stretched, especially when in the latter antique store scenes. This is the only 'Toy Story' film where the pacing was flawed in my view. It is a shame too that most of the original gang are underused and their material not being much of note.Buzz didn't have the same spark and it was like those involved had not remembered what made him so memorable. The ending is proof that the ending of the third film was the perfect note for the 'Toy Story' films to go out on, because this one is one of the most anti-climactic and unsatisfying-in-outcome for any recently seen film (for me that is).However, the animation is superb and the component that actually improved with each film, although that in the first is ground-breaking. Was transfixed by the vibrant colours and rich background and character details, toys and humans. The antique store and fairground settings are vividly done. It was great to have Randy Newman back on board again, not easy to imagine a 'Toy Story' film without him and the magic hasn't been lost. Reprising ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" was a genius move and that was what stuck out most memorably in this particular regard.Enough of the dialogue is witty and sharp, 'Toy Story 4' is far from laugh a minute but it is a long way from humourless. The best laughs coming from Ducky and Bunny, Duke Caboom was fun too. 'Toy Story 4' is not without soul either, found Gabby to be one of the Pixar's most empathetic and interesting supporting characters of their 2010s output (a ""villainous"" character that is not really a villain). Forky is likeable and his chemistry with Woody, on top form, is charming. It was great to see more of Bo Peep and her personality more developed, a mix of sympathetic and sassy. Her chemistry with Woody, which one really feels, is one of the film's biggest pleasures.Voice acting is terrific, Tom Hanks, Annie Potts, Christina Hendricks and Tony Hale standing out. Didn't recognise Keanu Reeves either.Overall, good film but not a great one. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
To Infinity and Beyond.,"Toy Story. The animated franchise that has defined me as a filmgoer, filmmaker and writer. I'm turning 24 next month, and Toy Story has damn-near been in my life for all of those years.The first film was released on Thanksgiving of 1995. I was 4 months old, sleeping in cribs, without any indication of what movies where, or for that matter, any kind of entertainment. But little did I know it would be the first film I would ever watch. The VHS was released the year after, and as I was learning to walk, talk and play, Toy Story played in the background. Something inside me clicked while I watched it. I was enchanted by it's world of make-believe. A world of talking toys. What more could a little kid want? My mother swears that I knew every line of dialogue from the film by the time I was 2 years old. Woody and Buzz where my bread and butter. I had both of them as toys of my own. To me, I was no different than Andy, because Andy was every kid in the world. What Toy Story so astoundingly captured was the bond between a child and his toy. It's unmistakeable and iconic. Needless to say, Toy Story was the family film we never knew we needed, as as a feat of technological genius, one of the finest films ever made.Toy Story 2 was released 4 years later. By that time, I was old enough to see it in a theater. I'm happy to tell you that I still haven't forgotten the memory of seeing it nearly 20 years ago. My parents took me, and I took my Woody doll with me. We went on a cold and snowy November afternoon. I placed Woody next to me in my seat as the theater lights dimmed to darkness. We loved it. Not to mention, not a single dry eye in that audience during Jessie's ballad, ""When She Loved Me"". But from that experience, I vividly remember leaving Woody behind in the theater, and we had to drive all the way back to retrieve it. Life imitates art.The gap between Toy Story 2 and 3 was 11 years. That's an eternity to a child. That's your entire elementary and middle school years in the books. I had enough Pixar movies in between to hold me over. By the time Toy Story 3 was released in the summer of 2010, I was already finished with my freshman year of high school. This time, I didn't see it in theaters, and I still don't know the reason. Was I going through a phase? Was I becoming cynical? Did i think I outgrew the material? Lord knows. I watched it when it premiered on cable later that year. That same spirit still stuck with me. The trilogy was complete, the toys left Andy and there was nothing else left to say.. or so we thought.Toy Story 4 is here. I wouldn't blame you if you feel weary about that. If ever there was a film franchise that shouldn't be milked to death and exploited until every last capital of it has been exhausted, you are looking at it. To even justify a fourth installment, they needed to work hard and get it right. The weekend isn't over and the jury is still out, but i have my verdict. Toy Story 4 is necessary and beautiful. To all fans of the series and any fan of animation, drop what you are doing and see this now. This is worth an hour and change of watching non-streamable content. This is how cinema lives on in the year 2019. For me, as a grown man, this brings it all full circle.We pick up right where we left off, with the toys belonging to little Bonnie. Still going on grand adventures in the bedroom. It's the first day of kindergarten for Bonnie, and she's too shy and scared to make any friends. Lucky for her, Woody comes to rescue and provides her with supplies to make her own friend. From there, we meet Forky. The product of what happens when toys play God. He's a stick figure made out of a spork, with a serious existential crisis. He keeps throwing himself in the trash. That's right, Forky is suicidal. You couldn't have a Pixar movie without throwing in a little dark social commentary. Bonnie and her parents take a road trip to an amusement park and the toys come with. But Woody gets carried away while guarding the troubled Forky. Woody and Forky get left behind after another episode, and vow to catch up to the park in the morning. As they walk into town, a vintage antique store catches Wood's eye with memorabilia attributed to Bo Peep, the toy that got away long, long ago. The antique store is filled with lost, abandoned toys, including a lonely girl doll named Gabby Gabby who's only friends are creepy ventriloquist dummies who stand upright on their own.. yeah, they are just as creepy as they sound. Forty is captured and Woody escapes the store. He lands in a nearby playground filled with even more abandoned toys, where he is reunited with none other than Bo Peep. It's been a long time since Woody has seen her and she's gotten a 2019 upgrade since. She's a swashbuckling badass now, accompanied with her tiny adorable sidekick, Officer Giggle McDimples. Woody and Bo join forces with Buzz , two smart-ass plush toys (voiced by Key and Peele) and a Canadian daredevil biker (voiced by Keanu Reeves) to save Forky and return him in one piece to Bonnie.I could gush about this film for hours. First, on a technical level, Toy Story 4 is the most gorgeous looking film of the series. You can see every scratch, blemish and texture on every toy. Gone are the awkward polygons and fuzzy graphics of the Windows 95' generation. I was captivated by everything, from the photo realistic backgrounds to the shining reflective porcelain that gleams off of Bo Peep. It's as sharply funny as any of the Toy Story films, with enough adult asides to keep anyone in the audience from being alienated. It brings the series to an appropriate end that, while wasn't entirely necessary after the third film, concludes the journey of Woody and friends in a totally satisfying way.Do I envision watching Toy Story 5 at 40 years old? Or 6 at 60? I don't know, but if indeed they are in the works, and if they are as lovely as all 4 previous films have been, I'll warmly invite the opportunities to see more. These movies awesome. To infinity and beyond.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A sequel we didnt need,"Honestly my title may seem cruel but that was honestly my first thought after finishing this movie. I did enjoy watching it, but that end just mad me realise that I hadnt wanted this. I had been completed by the third movie and its conclusion to the sToy story saga. But here i was watching a movie that sort of felt so ... unfulfilling and sort of like it was diverting so far from the third movies message.I would only suggest if you want a movie, completely focusing on Woody and none of the other toys. And only if you want to feel like your been drained of all joy",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Pixar Delivers Again, Toy Story 4 is a Sleek and Finely Tuned Addition to the Franchise","We all know Woody, Buzz and the gang but we get plenty of new additions to the toy chest of characters we have in this franchise. Forky (Tony Hale) will be the most recognizable one from the trailers and I liked him more than I expected to. I wasn't as in love with the trailers as everyone else and I thought the Forky bit would get real old, real quick. They do find a way to organically work him into the plot and they pull back on using him too much. Bo (Annie Potts) gets a lot more to do and while her connection with Woody is sweet, she gets the job done all by herself. You have Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves) who is pretty funny, and my 2 favourite new characters in Bunny (Jordan Peele) and Ducky (Keegan Michael-Key) who had me laughing hard almost every time they came on screen. The small trade off for getting these new characters is that the older characters in the cast don't get as much time (Buzz was great but his arc in the movie was kind of disappointing) but the movie doesn't lose a step because of it.Where Toy Story 3 was a prison escape movie that was made for kids, this is more of an adventure with a dash of romance thrown in. Woody (Tom Hanks) is on a mission to return Forky to Bonnie but he runs into his old flame Bo (Annie Potts) and they slowly rekindle what they had years ago. There's plenty of exciting scenes with this new road the movie chose to go down but I also want to note that I didn't get the same emotional gut punch that I got out of Toy Story 3. There are emotional moments that tug at the heart strings but it wasn't as gripping from a dramatic standpoint (I cried once in Toy Story 3 and was almost there a 2nd time). So you do have a strong through line with Woody finding out there may be something else out there for him other than playing with Bonnie or Andy but if you're worried about it being too tough to handle, you'll be okay. I also would note that while 3 had a very threatening and ruthless antagonist for Woody and the gang, the movie goes a different route with the obstacles placed in front of Woody and co. here.I don't want to go on about the voice cast too much, the number of celebrities doing voice work in this movie is a long list and there isn't enough space to cover everyone. I love the characters in this franchise but I love the actors and actresses performances that help bring them to life. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack even Bonnie Hunt and Kristen Schaal have all been around the block and all perform with the required energy and emotion that we expect from this franchise. I loved a lot of the new additions and overall, the performances were well done.As much as I'm praising this movie, I still think this is the weakest of the Toy Story films. Its got the sense of adventure, the eye-catching animation, the interesting characters, the emotional core to the story and the funny jokes but it still didn't hit that 10/10 level for me that Toy Story 3 hit. Those movies are not only iconic, they represent THE GOLD STANDARD in animated movies. So while this is truly excellent, its competition within its own franchise is as high as it gets. For less discerning viewers, maybe this won't be a problem but I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who has seen all 4 and say that this is their favourite.I applaud Pixar for adding another stellar addition to this franchise. It has everything you could want in an animated movie and it will be a joy for everyone in the family to watch (unless you have a heart made of stone). Is it the best one in the franchise? My answer is a definitive no, but that doesn't make it any less good or dampen my overall praise for it. My reviews are usually a little longer but this is a movie that covers all of its bases and doesn't have any obvious flaws. If you haven't gone to see Toy Story 4, I don't know what's kept you but I recommend it wholeheartedly. My final note is that I hope this is the last one, you've done a great job Pixar but its time to hang the Toy Story franchise up before it starts to run out of magic.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Doesn't justify its own existence and takes away from the emotional ending of the 3rd.,"This is a prime example that in today's day of age, when stories are being compromised whether it's by politics, cash grab, laziness, or lack of creativity, that some stories are better to be left alone, and leave the good, emotional impact as being a product of their time.Toy Story 4 is one of those. It takes away the powerful impactful of a 3rd film that was just just shy a bit of a decade between them.It doesn't feel like it has any genuine emotional story to tell, and actually wastes some of those characters that we grew and loved so much, and try to cash on some nostalgia trips and emotional scenes, though they lack an actual impact or creativity behind them, and feel over stretched and forced because Disney need to push the narrative and toy sales.Sadly, Disney keep exploiting their classics, instead of creating new ideas, that we can look back fondly same way as we looked on those. And compromise them for cheap political messages (that may have be a bit more subtle here) for just flat out laziness and cheap cash grab from a loved franchise that only shows that its not enough to justify its own existence.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Creativity is gone,"First, I suggest avoiding looking at total score and instead reading reviews, it's much better for understanding viewers feedback as, unfortunately, a lot of scoring is paid and performed by pr agencies so we can see that especially Disney movies magically get rather high scores on IMDb.Regarding movie, this is just another standard Disney sequel intended mostly for reheating their franchise licensing business. It felt like some spin off, instead of sequel. And with ending really loosing a touch with main message of all previous parts. Story is weaker than any of previous three parts so question was - why even making this unless there was a story at least strong as in previous parts to be told? But after cars 3 this was hardly a surprise, at least we will get some nice socks and lunch box with Buzz and friends.Now with Pixar claiming they do not plan any new sequels for some time, let's hope that there is any creativity left, as not only they failed to push new original ip for quite some time, but even sequels are lacking a spirit of originals.",,Anonymous,Animation
Toy Story 4 is as great as the first three in the series,"For anyone who ever wondered whatever happened to the Bo Peep doll in Toy Story 3, this next installment believably answered that. And with that, Annie Potts makes a return voice appearance doing that character as for once, she becomes a really important part of the story with the theme of being independent and learning to let go when one becomes separated from one's closest friends for whatever reason. As she was something of a love interest for Tom Hanks' Woody voice, they wonderfully share the lion's share of scenes. But there's hilarity plenty still especially with the arrival of a new toy made by new owner Bonnie herself named Forky who for quite some time keeps going to a trash can... This was as worthy an entry for the series as the first three as I laughed and cried quite a bit during this one. So on that note, Toy Story 4 is very highly recommended. Oh, and I also definitely recommend you watch this to the very end when the Disney and Pixar logos come up again...",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Pixar's worst movie,"While I'm not gonna spoil anything, I'm just gonna say that this movie completely defeats the purpose of the previous movie. What was good about Toy Story 1-3 was that those movies had offered great meaningful messages to children. Not only does this movie lack a good message, it also goes against everything they built up in the first 3 movies.I consider this movie to be non-canon (meaning it never happened), and if you don't want your childhood to be ruined, you should too. They should've just ended it with Toy Story 3. That being said, just stick with the first 3 movies and pretend Toy Story 4 doesn't exist.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

New toys and more that I don't wanna spoil.
To be honest they didn't need to make a sequel, because
Toy story 3 was one and probably THE best toy story ending.
But this new toy story (in my opinion) is better than toy story 3
Anyone in all ages will have fun watching this!

It's not a good thing to re-draw the characters and change the plot, but they did it without overdoing it. So it wasn't annoying.

Sure, it has the benefit of characters that have been fleshed out over the span of 3 movies, but it does something new and beautiful with them.

Made me cry,"I wasn't expecting to cry watching a movie aimed at kids about toys. But then again, it is a Pixar movie. Oh my, where do I even begin? Toy Story 4 is simply wonderful. It has everything it should have. It's funny, it's tense, it's filled with adventure, and most importantly, it will make you feel warm and fuzzy inside.It's been a while since I last saw the previous films. As such, this felt for the most part like watching a standalone film. Yet, when the ending arrived, I was taken back many years, to when I first learned about one of the most iconic duos on the big screen, Woody and Buzz. And seeing that ending, with these two characters, was both sad and heartwarming. It was, in my opinion, the perfect ending to this saga, and I sincerely hope that this was the last installment into the Toy Story adventure. That ending also taught perhaps the most important lesson that any of the Toy Story films have taught. Learning to move on and let go of the past when the time is right. This movie is as much about letting go of the past as it is about following your heart and moving on.What I have always liked so much more about Pixar films compared to Disney ones, is that the great lesson isn't rubbed into your face. Instead, you get to explore it yourself and find what it means to you personally. And I think that we can all relate to the message in this movie in our own ways. Be it a kid scared of starting school, or an adult scared of changing jobs or falling in love, Toy Story 4 matters to both.This has been one of the hardest reviews I have written. It's not because I have nothing to say. Instead, it's because I can't seem to find the right words to say what I want. Toy Story 4 made me feel a lot of things. Happiness, excitement, sadness, and ultimately, closure. Trying to unpack these feelings and create some sort of coherent text about them turned out to be quite the challenge. Indeed, I do not think that this movie can really be written about effectively.
Everyone should see this movie, be it by themselves or with someone else, and really think about what it is that is keeping them in place, and whether it might be time to let go and move on to where the inner voice wants to go.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Can't believe other viewers ratings!!,"It was with some trepidation that I prepared to watch Toy Story 4. Would it be any good? It was dark, moments of pathos, humour, edge of the seats moments. I have watched thousands of films over the past 55 years, studied film making, scriptwriting, set building, photography & 3D design (the last two still actively involved on a daily business. Why do I mention this? It's because I am wondering if I am watching the same film as others who have given it such low scores. Perhaps they didn't want others to enjoy a good film, I simply at a loss to think of a valid reason. Do go and see it and make up your own minds. Fair enough if you don't think it's worthy of being in the same league as Toy Story 1, 2, 3 but give it a go. I think you will love it. Please note it has a few scary moments in it esp if you have a phobia of Automatonophobia",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not Impressive,"For the last segment of the fantastic and iconic Toy Story films, this is quite and unexpected and sad ending. Now, this film had more than it needed to be the best ending and mean something more to people that hold Woody and Buzz so highly in their hearts. This story was pretty disappointing to say the least; this film was dark and at times scary and creepy, and you constantly wanted to smack Bonnie and yell at her. This was something that meant so much to people and to so many, it was an outstanding let down.

Sequel-hungry Disney once again forces Pixar to produce mediocrity,"Unnecessary. Forced. Repetitive. Redundant. Mediocre. All words I could easily use to describe Toy Story 4, without fear of being unfair. While not as bad as other previous Pixar misfires, this sequel sadly does a disservice to a perfectly crafted trilogy that had its sunset... but now is reborn out of necessity and not quite as well-shaped as its predecessors.I had to see Toy Story 4 because I believed the producers would not allow their prized movie series to be tainted by Disney's requests for cash-grab sequels. Surely they had something in mind that could surpass the third installment. What could it be? I had to see it. Sadly, it was nothing worth it.The movie repeats the previous movie's general plot (lost toy tries to go back to it's kid), but not as cleverly. It's tiring and repetitive, with the same rescue scenes again and again, making the whole thing seem tiresome and badly paced. There was nothing new that was brought by this film that wasn't already covered or portrait in previous films, but they just had to do it. It sticks out as a bad outlier, as an anticlimactic finale.While not necessarily bad, it pales in comparison, suffers from pace issues, has a terribly unmemorable antagonist and taints the third film's ending and purpose.Like Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I say, stick with the trilogy and forget about this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Pixar's done it again,"I know I'm about to parrot what everyone else is saying, but it's true. Toy Story 3 ended on a very definitive note. It felt the like the final chapter had closed and that there didn't need to be another film. Not to mention that after having created what is generally considered one of the strongest film trilogies ever made, Pixar would be tempting the fates by creating another one. But they did it! Toy Story 4 is an utterly entertaining film.This film's feel seems to be created to directly contrast with 3. Whereas the last movie was darker and felt stretched out, this film feels more lighthearted and fluidly compact. This is the installment that is trying the most to have fun.Don't consider this purely a frivolous film. The ending is almost as strong as in the last movie, and I felt that one was only better only by a thin margin. Things get pretty emotional.The entire film is about Woody (Tom Hanks) having an existential crisis. Once a favorite plaything and the leader of Andy's toys, Woody is now one of his new owner's least played with toys and being a newcomer, no longer the leader. His whole journey is pretty compelling.The biggest reason this movie justifies it's existence is that not only do we have closure for Bo Beep (Ghostbuster's Annie Potts), but her character is finally given justice. In the original film, it seems she was part of the cast just because they needed at least a couple female characters. Her role didn't serve much purpose other than to be Woody's girlfriend. Same with the sequel. You could've cut the character out, and it wouldn't affect anything. Then, in number three, she was just out of the story entirely, having already been sold to a new owner. The writer's reasoning at the time was that due to the heavy action scenes, I'm guessing primarily the moments where the toys are roughed up by toddlers, Bo Beep being porcelain and fragile was difficult to include. Here she's finally give her due. She has more personality, she has agency, and she is finally part of the action and story.New character Forky (voiced by Veep and Arrested Development's Alan Hale) is an inspired creation, a handicraft toy made out of a spork who's dealing with sudden sentience. He works well interacting with Woody as they share questions about their existence in the world. I actually felt the character was underutilized a bit. (It did annoy me a little that the writers were selective about how much or little knowledge of the world Sporky had.)The new villain Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks) is yet another emotionally damaged toy. Don't worry about her being a clone of the last two. They go down a refreshingly different path with her.Though I enjoyed the story, I do admit that the movie basically copies the formula of the first two films by having a few characters separated from the others and going on a journey. The movie may as well be called Woody Story as the majority of the cast is sidelined for the film and even Buzz is more of a supporting player. A lot of time is spent on the new characters. Though I can't complain much as they all are pretty entertaining. (Ducky and Bunny (Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele) bring us the funniest joke in the entire series.)I'd rank this only under number 2. TS4 is a blast and I recommend this to all Toy Story fans.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The most noble thing a toy could do,"Having seen all Toy Story movies in movie theatres since I was 10, and having been under the impression that at the end of every movie it was the proper ending, Toy Story 4 was one I wasn't going to miss seeing first thing on opening night, and it did not disappoint one bit!Woody comes to terms with no longer being ""top toy"" and learns there are other ways to support and help a child, various female role models are strengthened in their portrayal and sometimes things that seem selfish can in fact be done for a goal that are entirely selfless.All in all, PIXAR has once again created a movie that ticks off all boxes a movie could possible have to offer an audience of all ages, with a rich story presenting layered characters in dazzling graphics.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Afterlife,"So a fourth Toy Story movie? Even the teaser trailer made fun of this, because we all knew (got told), that there would be no more. Now what do we make of this? You could bury your head in the sand and act like a friend of mine, who in a way denies this movie exists and really presses that if it was called something else he might have liked it.Now if you can be a bigger person or just able to distinguish and get un-stuck (if you were in the first place that is): there is a really good movie here. Pixar almost always gets it right and you kind of know they would not mess with this or rather just do something for the sake of it. So while the third put a really good lid on it (full circle, great ending, whatever you want to say about it), this finds a way to give us a new story ... and a new satisfying (?) ending ... that depends on the viewer of course.Great animation, great voice work, good new and old new characters, although there is an emphasis on some of them and your fave may not get as much screentime as you'd like. Still all good - no pun intended.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Toy Story finally introduces a wide variety of new characters, most sequels would fail at this introduction, but not Toy Story.

Of course it's gonna get bad reviews.....,"It was good. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but this was a movie about Woody realizing his true meaning in life, and finding a long lost friend.

I'll take this movie over ""Minions"" or ""Secret Life of Pets"" any day.......Too bad the 1 star reviews that completely missed the point of the movie are reigning on this platform. Just proves that we can't have nice things anymore when well done movies like these are treated like dirt while Secret Life of Pets 2 and UglyDolls gets high praise for whatever reason....ah well if people want more Minions movies what are we gonna do? Sigh......",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fans won't be disappointed,"I gotta admit, I was a little skeptical about the idea of a Toy Story 4. I thought Toy Story 3 was a satisfying ending to a great series. It wasn't until I gave the new edition a chance that I realized how much the series needed this.
The most obvious thing about TS4 is the incredible animation. WOW. Looking back at the original, it's insane how much the animation has improved. When you watch, pay attention to the details, specifically the human characters. Some scenes look almost real.
A great accomplishment of TS4 is the balance of giving old favorites screen time and adding new characters to the mix. This is something not just every sequel can pull off, and it can make or break a movie. Although, scrolling through some reviews that have already been posted (seriously, how do you guys get these up so quickly?), it seems that some of the new additions aren't very popular. On the contrary, I thought the perfect amount of screen time was given to good ol' Jesse, Buzz, Rex, and Hamm, as well as enough given to new characters such as Forky, Duke, and Gabby Gabby.
I was glad to see Bo Peep again, along with seeing how things were going at the toys' new home with Bonnie. The opening to this movie, with the famous ""You've Got A Friend In Me"" along with a montage of Andy and eventually Bonnie playing with the beloved toys, is emotional and nostalgic.
And finally the ending. The ENDING. I shed a few tears (Nearly as much as I cried at Toy Story 3).
Overall, Toy Story 4 told me to not doubt sequels. Every single addition to the Toy Story series has been great. This is the first series that I have seen pull that off. I wouldn't mind a Toy Story 5, but for now, we'll let this be enough. :')",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""So Long, Partner......Or So We Thought""","As a fan of the Toy Story Franchise, I can't help to be disappointed at Toy Story 4. Don't get me wrong, the animation is still colorful, the voice acting is good, (both veterans and new-comers), and I did buy Woody & Bo's relationship throughout. But it came at the cost of an engaging story, and great character development; something that the first three films excelled at. Here, the writing tarnishes Woody, rushes Forky's arch, and has TOO much plot holes. The only new character I ended up liking was Duke Kaboom as the others provided little to nothing; and I hated how the recurring characters were terribly side-lined. At the end of the day, it just ends up being mildly decent at best, which isn't surprising due the many red flags in its production; but I gave it the benefit of the doubt that it would subvert my expectations. This is the best that they could do I guess.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A risky gamble, but pays off in the end","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningWoody and the gang are back, and their new owner Bonnie is preparing for her first day at Kindergarten. By a freak accident, Woody gets taken with her to Kindergarten, where Bonnie ends up creating a toy of her own- Forkie, made with a discarded plastic fork and some accessories. When Forkie gets separated from Bonnie, and the little girl gets upset without her favourite toy, Woody, driven by a sense of duty to keep his owner happy, embarks on a desperate mission to find him, leading him into all sorts of triumpths and trevails.Toy Story 3, the last Toy Story film, was already released over ten years after the previous film in 2010, which shows how it was already seen as a sure fire box office success even back then, and therefore safe to regurgitate after such a long lapse since the last one. Toy Story 4 emerges with less (but not much!) of a time gap in the shape of nine years since that film, but once again there's the feeling of the studios being in desperate need of something safe and easy to make a quick buck. And, that aside, three is the magic number. Things were wrapped up nicely that time around, with the grown up Andy going off to college, and handing his beloved childhood toys over to the little girl Bonnie, who is the focus of their attention here.And yet, from this new stand point, director Josh Cooley, making his feature length debut, still manages to evoke the magic and charm that made the first three such successes, albeit from a different stand point. While not featuring massively in the film, Bonnie's attachment to her toys (especially the one she created!), and their reciprocated affection makes for as endearing a film as any of the others, with Woody's devine sense of duty and loyalty to his owner shining through. Buzz fits in nicely in a background role, as contrasting and wise cracking a sidekick as ever to his mismatched counterpart.There is a feeling of pushing the boat out too far, tarnishing the originality and magic, certainly of the first two, and even the third film, but Cooley proves them totally unfounded, creating a production that, certainly for the most part, maintains the magic and excitement of the last few, whilst keeping the same high standard of spellbinding animation. Nobody could rule out a fifth film, but on the basis of this, I'd at least give it a go first. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

This film contains amazing memories, memories that make all of us tear up, old pals, never ending friendship, difficult decisions to make, change, and new modern characters that make this film so much more lively as well. It's one of the best Disney films I have ever seen, and I had to admit that my eyes were reflecting under the light with tears, because of how far we have all come, how far Disney has come, and how lovely they have made this film, how simply relatable and loving it is for everyone. A reminder of simple and hard childhood, heartbreak, understanding. The villain of this story has a backstory and is not just a scary doll for everyone to fear.

The end of a beautiful saga,"This saga has more or less my same age, and it is amazing that Pixar decided to end this it after 24 years, with an ending that does justice to the entire franchise.

We find all the old toys that we love, plus some new funny characters that will make the movie worth to be watched.I also like the setting: it is different and fresh, something that in previous movies we did not saw, a gigatic open world that made possible to develop more narrative options, all this by keeping the same animation style, mixing something new, with something old. The result is a movie that entertains because easygoing and funny.I have to be honest: I was a little bit skeptical about this Toy Story 4. This is a movie that is part of the childhood of many, many people, so Pixar had to pay a lot of attention, the probability to ruin this saga were pretty high, considering also the latest remakes that Disney is releasing, but in the end they made esomething unique and I have to really thank creators for this gift.

"Better than anticipated, but destroys magic of previous installment","This was better than I thought it would be, but I couldn't help but feel it went and partially destroyed all the magic of Toy Story 3 (my favourite in the series).I didn't start watching the Toy Story films until I was about 28. Unlike many of my peers, I hadn't grown up with these films being dear to me. It was because of this, I was perhaps slightly less emotionally attached to the characters.Despite that, I still found myself quite emotional by the end of Toy Story 3 - it was the perfect end to a classic trilogy. Toy Story 4 seems to have contradictory and confused messaging, while also struggling to find a reason to exist.It looks fantastic. The animation is some of the best I've seen and the use of colours was a feast for the eyes. The storyline itself was captivating (mostly) and very action-packed, which kept things engaging.The introduction of a few too many new and unlikeable characters, detracted a little.

High entertainment but not quite the pathos of previous,"Pixar has set a high bar for other films for many years, and has also done the same for itself. This is particularly evident within the Toy Story franchise, with such a high bar to try to hit or top, the challenge was really there for Toy Story 4, particularly because the ending of Toy Story 3 had seemed so perfect and so touching. The premise for Toy Story 4 seems to be more about Woody himself, finding his way and learning how to be more than just 'someone's'. This is less engaging as a theme, but does still work well enough to have some emotional weight to it, even if it doesn't get close to the impact of the previous films.Of course this doesn't mean that the film is somehow poor, but just that it doesn't meet the very high standards associated with the franchise. It is still a very good film indeed - I watched with people spreading across a 65 year or so spread, and all enjoyed it for its comedy, action, and solid plotting. There were some 'modern' elements in there that I thought clunky within it, but this may have been me more than the film. Otherwise it is a fun adventure which serves Woody well, even if it is not quite a match for the films before it.",,Anonymous,Animation

Beautiful Epilogue to a Masterful Tetralogy,"""Toy Story 4"" comes 9 years after ""Toy Story 3"", giving us another tale of the toys after their saying their goodbyes with Andy. To be honest, I felt ""Toy Story 3"" was the perfect conclusion, given that Andy had been the toys' owner over the course of the film series, and their separation and Andy moving on just felt like the apt place to end things. I was a bit skeptical that this installment would feel unneeded, and out of place, because what could possibly be there to explore. It would be a shame if a redundant installment ruined one of the best trilogies of all time, but I'm glad to say it may perhaps make it one of the best, if not the best tetralogy of all time.This installment is mainly focused on Woody, dealing with the aftermath of no longer being with Andy, and being left with Bonnie, leading to questions of his self-purpose and what-not. Bonnie is an adorable character but she's no Andy, and perhaps because of that, I associate ""Toy Story 4"" as more of an epilogue instead of a full-fledged installment. It's not a bad thing, but it does stand out being the only movie where Andy is not in the background.There are a bunch of new characters here; Forky, a newly made toy struggling to cope with his sentience, Duke Caboom, Canada's greatest stuntman voiced by everyone's favorite actor right now Keanu Reeves, Ducky and Bunny, the fluffy duo brought to life by the comedy duo Key and Peele. These characters are plenty of fun to watch and each of them have their own unique charms. They are excellent characters and an appropriate amount of screen time is dedicated to each of them. That said, this means that the characters we have been familiar with (Jessie, Rex, Mr. Potatohead, etc.) are sort of given the backseat. It would have been great if they had been given a more central part in the action but it's understandable to manage the time to give to the newcomers.The story itself is beautiful and not as dark as Toy Story 3, with Lotso essentially transforming the kids' center into some sort of prison camp. It deals with questions of what it means to be a toy and what a toy dreams life should be. I feel it to be somewhat more existential questions than I had expected, especially with the arrival of Forky, a newly created being brought to life from trash. Perhaps with age comes the boldness to ask more challenging questions. This is after all, a 24-year-old franchise.The animation is beautiful and some of the scenes just stood out as being immaculate and gorgeous. Some of the scenes are set in a carnival with lights and serving as a backdrop with all the lights illuminating in the background, it was just a feast for the eyes. That said, I have to point out that the movie does not really have a wide setting, it's pretty much limited to certain locations. It's more expansive than ""Toy Story 3"" but not as diverse as ""Toy Story 2"". Somewhat with the ever-growing ensemble of toys, it also is narrower in scope.Ultimately, ""Toy Story 4"" is an amazing movie and wiped away any notions I had that this movie would be a letdown, considering how ""Toy Story 3"" acted as a very sweet conclusion. I personally think ""Toy Story 2"" is still the best and this one particularly acts as more of an epilogue, but it is a damn good one.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nothing new,"Whilst still amazingly clever, latest lacked the originality and humour of TS1 and TS2 in particular. More a story about Woody and Bo with all other characters relegated to bit parts. Rex, Hamm, Potato Head, RC barely feature at all. Clearly time for the toys to feature in the next yard sale!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A beautifully well done addition to the Toy Story saga.,"You always worry when they dig up old property to make a new film. Will they do it justice? Will they be true to the original? Is there really a need for another movie? Toy Story answers all these questions with a resounding YES! The original toys, along with some new additions, are brought back for a new adventure that hits all the notes that you love about the series. The laughs are there, as are the tears. A beautiful new chapter is added to the toys' saga as is the beautiful underlying lessons and morals of the story. Truly well done.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Was really pulling for this one...,Obviously the animation and art is stellar. Always is. My kids weren't really interested in this one. I think it was too depressing for them and me. And Buzz light-year was pretty much nonexistent in this one. And when he was there he was super quiet and not entertaining. Definitely didn't have the consistency of character for Buzz from the previous films. Glad this is a done deal. My kids are bummed though.,6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cute Movie,"This movie was cute and if you are an avid fan of the series, you should watch it. Definitely worth the price of a movie ticket.

Loved it!!,Toy Story 4 isn't really necessary but I am pleasantly surprised and so happy it exists. Going in I was really nervous because I felt Toy Story 3 was a damn near perfect way to end this franchise. With that being said this movie was almost as good in my opinion. So many references to The Shinning which reminded me of the carpet in Sid's house from the first movie. The animation in this movie is absolutely superb! Keanu as a Canadian stunt motorcyclist was great. I completely see why Tom Hanks and Tim Allen choked up on their last day of voicing Woody and Buzz. The last act pays off in an extremely emotional way. To infinity... And beyond! Go see it! <3,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"If you didn't like the ending, maybe you didn't see it!","I thought this movie was mostly unnecessary, and ""getting the key"" was one of the only original (and very fun) sequences. Also Forky!But I'm concerned that many people think the movie ends with Woody and Bo uniting, just to stay behind.In fact, there are two more major scenes in the credits, each wrapping the picture far better than the ""pre-credits"" ending.And finally, there are several gags on the closing Pixar logo, that will make cinema nerds glad they stayed to the end!

A movie to send you to sleep,"There's nothing you can say about this movie except ""I've watched all the toy story films!"" Now that's a flex. The animation and the lighting are really good, better than the previous movies. This is an uninspiring sequel as just an ""add on"" to the other movies, or if you will it's just there to make money. It's such a shame that all of this animation and effects were wasted on such an uninspiring movie, that has no story to tell.Despite all of this, the voice acting, as always is on point, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, as well as the supporting cast, are amazing as usual.The writers have clearly forgotten what Woodys character was all about, and has been butchered to an annoying and ignorant extent, that cannot be ignored. To the point where it felt like a new character entirely.Maybe it's just me and I'm just sad to see toy story taken a new direction, but this movie just wasn't for me :(How did forky turn into a toy??

"Never really watched Toy Story before, but loved this. A movie for both adults and kids.","I was introduced to the Toy Story series as an adult. I tried watching the first movie a few years ago but it seemed too childish and I abandoned it after a few minutes.After seeing this movie's reviews and high rating compared to non-animated films of 2019-20, I decided to give it a try. At the beginning, this movie also seemed very exclusively aimed at 5-10 year olds. But there were enough funny moments for me to continue watching. And I am glad I did. While on the surface it looked like it was meant for a much younger audience, the movie ended up being very touching and had strong messages. It beautifully portrayed selflessness and giving, gaining happiness from spreading it, and realizing that everyone has a reason for what they're doing even if they seem unjust and evil to you.Surely some great lessons especially for young kids, but I must warn you that it made me cry, like many other reviewers. It's not an ideal movie if you're looking for a fun and light kid's movie, but I still recommend it. Making a movie that both adults and very young kids can enjoy is a very difficult task, and I commend the team that made this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I hope they will never do the same with BTTF,"Unneeded, definitely. Technically awesome for sure: Pixar is the best in this no doubt at all (although some dejavu feeling is there with the evil toys recalling partially the third installation's plot), but the trilogy had the very perfect conclusion for each of the characters' storyline. Disney does not need this commercial stuff to make easy money. This is exactly what i do really hope they will never do with back to the Future.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved It,"Just seen the film and unlike others I'm way behind
the rest and when it hit the screens. Like a lot of the people reviewing this film I saw Toy Story from when it first opened in cinemas, bought the original Toys for my children etc ( who are now adults). What I can't believe is the negative reviews. 1,2 and 3 have been excellent, but, like most films that continues for ever and a day this had to come to an end. Please, please, please don't make a 4,5,6 etc.
As a film with a conclusion, at the heart of the story it hit all of my targets, you had funny, you had sad, you had action and a good story line in my opinion. The only thing which I wasn't happy with was the bodyguards of the so called baddie as they were very creepy and didn't need to be shown in this way, ( think back on the original Toy Story and the baddies, even though we knew they were on the wrong side of good, they were still ok characters without being creepy). As we knew this was the final chapter and how the toys sorted themselves out, I thought the last dialogue between Woody and Buzz said it all and left me happy with outcome. Many remarks have been made about Forky and being silly in its concept. I'm the wrong side of 60 and also made toys and as far as I'm concerned the toy that can can give you most enjoyment doesn't necessarily have to be a toy that comes out of a shop.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is a story for parents,This is all about parents get lost when their kids grown up. You should let go that adhesion in time. I think many of negative reviewers see Toy Story series as their own kids. They want to keep unchanging memory of infancy. But you know life goes on. This series should be seen as Woody's developing story. Not these good-old-friends-always-mix-with-each-other story. So it's true TS4 is not for low teen kids.

A Toy-Driven Adventure That's worth The Buy.,"Toy Story 4 was an absolute delight, and especially for those who have followed the franchise from it's debut in 1995. This film is just as good as the first, in some cases might be better, with it's excellent storytelling and add-ons of new toys (characters)Thr film starts right where we left off, with Bonnie having all of Andy's old toys, and what might seem like a rendition of attempting to relieve the good times of its debut film, the film takes on new leaps with an even overpowering message of independence and self happiness.Bonnie's first day at kindergarden is scared for her and has no friend, she, with the help of Woody makes a new toy called 'Forky' which is essentially a sprk with buttons for eyes, and string for arms and legs.The Spork is having an existential as he id unsure of what he is doing being a toy and just wants to be in his safe home of the trash can.As Forky makes his escape from the family vacation car, Woody is left trying to get him back, since it is Bonnie's new favourite toy, and the the duo go on a wilde adventure together between finding the Antique store, where the majority of the adventure happens.In it's 100 minute play through, the film takes us on a wild ride of many meanings that can installed into our own lives. It deals with loyalty, friendship, sacrifices and liberation.It really was a well put together film with tons of laughs and new characters that you can fall in love with all over again.It is one of the only films in the franchise in my opinion that connected all the dots to the first installment of the film , and everything was pieced together really nicely,If this is the last instalment of the franchise, as we have seen Tim Allen and Tom Hanks mention numerous times, then i am completely happy with its final adventure.It just made me smile, laugh , cry and get that feel of when I was a little boy watching the first film in all it's glory and brought us back to great story telling of a boy who got joy out of his toys.The boy has grown up, and so have the toys, and with our day and age with toys not being what they use to be - this film really brings it back to square one of hope, happiness and love, for the innocence of every boy and girl.As stated, earlier, this might be just as good as the first installment of the series, if not better, but it definitely is an absolute gold mine of recapturing the kid sin all of us.9/10 - Worth the buy, Watch and an encore",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Okay, but not worth paying to see.","I wasn't expecting Toy Story 4 to be as good as 2 or 3, but it wasn't even at the level of the first Toy Story movie. It's not bad, per se, but it's far from what the money behind Pixar's premiere franchise should have been able to produce. If all they did was follow the same formula from the previous movies, Toy Story 4 would have turned out several notches better.Actions lack consequences, there's never any sense of real peril, and there wasn't a single memorable joke or sight gag. On the other hand, the pace is constant and there's never any dull moments.Overall, I'm glad I waited to see Toy Story 4 for free on TV because it wasn't worth a theatre ticket nor the price of buying it to add to my movie collection.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"When I first heard they were making a Toy Story 4, I didn't think it was necessary at all.","Toy Story 3 ended the story perfectly, what more could be done with it? Not to mention that it's a Pixar sequel made in the 2010s, which don't exactly have a great reputation. Toy Story 3 was great, Cars 2 was bad, Monsters University was okay, Finding Dory was good but forgettable (no pun intended), Cars 3 was okay and Incredibles 2 was a lot of fun but not as memorable as the first movie. It didn't help that none of the Toy Story 4 trailers impressed me. I walked into this movie cautiously optimistic. I hoped it would be at least as good as Incredibles 2 but I was ready for the possibility of a disappointment. However, after seeing the movie, I can confidently say that they did it again. They made another great Toy Story movie. It has an engaging and emotional story, a lovable and memorable cast of characters, interesting themes and ideas, the most beautiful animation that Pixar has put to screen yet, pitch-perfect voice acting, and really great action and comedy! While Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending, I think Toy Story 4 is a great epilogue. This is probably where the story would go next, whether you like it or not. I do have some criticisms though. Some of the writing and comedic timing felt surprisingly clunky and off a couple of times and the ending does feel a little rushed. The ending of Toy Story 3 was definitely a better finale to the series as a whole, it was more epic and larger in scale, but this is more of a finale to the arcs of the main characters. I can't think of a more fitting way to end both this story and the 2010s decade of Pixar movies. It came in with a Toy Story movie and it went out with a Toy Story movie, and it looks like this is the last Pixar sequel we're going to see for a long time. It's been confirmed that there are no sequels coming out for the foreseeable future and they will be putting their focus on original films only. That sounds good to me! Overall, this is a must-see for any fan of the Toy Story movies. It just might be another instant classic. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
An unnecessary solid sequel.,"I don't know if I have already made a review of this movie, but here it goes: I think this movie was unnecessary to begin with. As a kid, I did wanted a 4th Toy Story movie to be made but times has changed and I was focusing other things until the trailer dropped. The plot was...alright. I see what they're going for, but there were some flaws in the writing that made me scratch my head. This movie is now mostly focus on Woody, which is upsetting because I know Woody is the main character of this franchise but I would like to see the movie give Buzz Lightyear and Woody enough screen time like in the previous movies rather seeing Buzz less in the movie. They made the villain pretty obvious, seeing Bo Peep was nice, and the ending was pretty emotional. Overall, it's a solid film that shouldn't have be made in the first place. I know Pixar said they'll make another Toy Story if there was a story idea to be made, but Toy Story 3 had a perfect clear ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar does it again,"Judging by the various reviews, this one seems to have split people right down the middle. Either you loved it or you really, really didn't.For me it was an absolute joy.

The last one felt like a definite end and so anything that followed had a lot on its shoulders.Should it have been made? Absolutely. This the perfect ending to Woody's story. And in many ways it could also be a new beginning.For me it packed the biggest emotional wallop of all the movies and I for one would love to see the series go on and on.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's very impressive if it is rated G because it's still really witty and funny. It's also so heart warming. I loved Keanu Reeves as Kaboom. Forky was a great addition and I loved how he always wanted to jump into garbage cans. It has a great message just like the other three.

A Perfect Trilogy Taken a Step Too Far,"The ""Toy Story"" trilogy is a touchstone in every way. Starting with the first ever computer animated film, moving to the best Rotten Tomatoes score ever, and ""ending"" with an Oscar nomination, it's a nearly flawless story about loyalty, identity, aging and friendship that concludes in a perfectly satisfying manner.And now, for some reason, there's a fourth. Woody and the gang are getting acclimated to living with their new child, Bonnie, when a ""toy"" named Forky (a creation made from a spork, googly eyes, glue and other craft box trinkets) enters the fold. From there, the toys go on yet another adventure, where their personal purpose in the world turns into a full-blown existential crisis, and ends with a heartfelt goodbye. Sound familiar?It's not a bad movie; in fact, as a singular story, it's decent. The plot moves fairly briskly, the ethics are complex, the sweetness sidesteps being saccharine, and the humor is solid. It's also drop-dead gorgeous. The entire series, when watched in a row, really represents the incredible technological advances Pixar has forefronted for two decades.Still, the movie never quite proves its necessity. Even some of its highest points miss the mark. Forky is a wonderfully and hilariously strange character, but he's sidelined for weaker, more familiar stories. Woody, one of the great cinematic characters, is given little new to do. The psychological-philosophical questions are noble, but never fully developed. Even most of the b-level toys are essentially replaced by cute but unremarkable new ones, a seeming effort to simply sell more toys.Again, it's not a disaster. Plenty of people will be happy to just spend some more time in this universe. I just think if you're gonna reopen a perfect film franchise, you should have something more to say.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I'm not a film critic by any means, but what I can say is that by the end of this movie my eyes were dripping with tears. This doesn't happen with many movies, in fact very very few! Maybe it is because the Toy Story movies have been with me most of my life, or that each movie is a masterpiece in its own right, either way I don't care, all I know is I could not have asked for a better journey.

Lots of fun but doesn't compare to the emotional trauma the third instalment put me through,"I enjoyed it no doubt, the movie had loads of laughs and there's so much character development to Woody along with some others. By the end of the movie you'll come to really like Forky, as his character just connects so well to things like self discovery and a sense of purpose.I LOVED how they brought back Bo Peep and made her into a real badass compared to what we previously saw her as and they even included an explanation of her disappearance in the last film which was very necessary indeed.I'm trying my best not to spoil it but I felt like the things that Woody experienced and his dedication to bringing Forky back to Bonnie was so much more emotionally captivating than the ending. Compared to the final scenes in toy story 3 (literal tears out of my eyes), I didn't feel that same connection but was still so heartwarming to watch.*Potential spoiler ....
Honestly, I did not like the new character Gabby Gabby (and her 'evil henchmen' that were something out of an R rated movie that was just so creepy) despite her motivations. I didn't like the outcome between her and Woody but I suppose that just reflects Woody's good nature and sole purpose (much like how he taught Forky) and that's what really got to me, how selfless Woody is and has been throughout the entire franchise and it was sad to see it all end.This 4th instalment of toy story was so unique and touching in its core message, and no it didn't need to be made but thats the whole point of it.But...toy story 3 still stands

Expect Something New,"Toy Story 4 was so much fun! I hate to compare it to its predecessors because I feel as if each Toy Story film is very unique from the last. The fourth film in this franchise is no different. Don't go in expecting a continuation of Toy Story 3. Go in expecting Toy Story 4. It's something unique and brand new. While the storyline still had its heart wrenching moments, I feel as if Pixar had more fun creating this summer blockbuster. There wasn't as much pressure on Pixar to get it right as there may have been ahead of the third film, but they still managed to get it right nonetheless. The character development for these new characters was flawless. Each new character was given a solid backstory and the questions that we might have had about certain returning characters were all answered in entertaining and innovative new ways. In addition, this film was absolutely hilarious and by far the funniest in the series. Pixar did a great job of knocking down the fourth wall and addressing things that us audience members have probably asked at some point during the franchise's long history. If you are a Pixar fan, good news. This film is riddled with Easter eggs, but don't worry, I'm not going to spoil them for you. Lastly, I just want to say that I was very touched that Pixar not only dedicated the film to the late Don Rickles (aka Mr. Potato Head), but also to the late great Pixar animator, Adam Burke, who passed away in October 2018 from cancer. All in all, this film was a great tribute to Pixar through its exciting new ways of storytelling, historic Easter eggs, heart wrenching and comedic moments, beautiful score, and of course the characters we all know and love. I am truly going to miss this franchise. Thank you Pixar, for all the memories.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Thank You Pixar.,"Toy Story 4.... a sequel that nobody asked for after how perfect the ending was to Toy Story 3, now I love The Toy Story series, it's always been the most perfect movie trilogy ever, clever, funny, meaningful, the animation is revolutionary, wonderful characters and so much more, this is what made Pixar who they are today, so I was quite scared for a fourth movie, I mean what else can you do with these characters?, instead of John Lassiter and Lee Unkrich, it's now Josh Cooley as the director of this new adventure with Woody and the gang, Pixar was nice enough to release it in the UK the same day as the US, I saw it on the 22nd of June, successfully avoiding spoilers and...... wow, this series of films just get better and better, so let's talk about it.While at Kindergarten, Bonnie who is now the new owner of Andy's toys, with Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jesse (Joan Cusack) and many more, she creates this character named Forky (Tony Hale) using arts and crafts materials, Forky may seem like a innocent toy, but he thinks he's not a toy, he thinks he is considered trash, so Woody has to stop him from going into the garbage, it makes it worse since Bonnie and his family are taking a vacation, Woody and Forky get lost, they end up in a antic shop, where Forky has been help captive by Gabby Gabby who is a creepy doll that has been in the shop for a long time, so Woody has to find him and get him back to Bonnie, now... where do I begin?, first off this is a really well crafted story, it has messages and themes throughout the entire movie just like the other movies, but the themes here are more meaningful and it can connect and relate to those who find the themes in the movie amazing, it is also funny, lots of clever humour and funny moments sprinkled throughout, it still has the same amount of heart that it always had, it's touching and especially emotional towards the end (don't worry, I won't give anything away), it's entertaining throughout and it put a big grin on my face, it had a lot of amazing ideas put into it as well and... the ending, It's such a heartbreaking and super sad ending that yes.... I cried, I cried with tears coming down my face, a popular example of a sad ending was Avengers: Endgame, I didn't cry at Endgame personally, but this movie.... this movie still had me thinking and I was still emotional after seeing it, the Pixar team did the best they could with the material that they got, they created a fantastically well put together plot, with strong writing, great humour, entertainment, wonderful heart and a really tear jerking ending that is a wonderful way to end the saga.The animation is just unbelievable, Pixar has come along way with their animation, the first movie's animation was groundbreaking and new, they improved film by film, but here they really outdone themselves, this attention to detail in the animation is just incredible, each character has a wonderful design to them, the new characters look especially interesting, with Forky being the best looking character with what he can do, the backgrounds are photo realistic and beautiful, it's got great character animation and movement to it, when it comes to the fair ground, there's colour and beauty to it, the antic shop is old and grey but also somewhat scary, it has amazing lighting and cinematography to it, not much else to say but a visual achievement by a incredible animation studio, they went from groundbreaking animation, to mind blowing and jaw dropping animation, this is why Pixar is amazing at that they do.The characters are truly wonderful, old and new, Woody is a even more fleshed out character then before, there's
More purpose to him, he has a goal and hard choices to choose in the course of this movie, but still charming and loveable as ever, Buzz is still the loyal friend to Woody who would always help him whenever he needs it, Jessie is still a entertaining and likeable character, in fact the rest of the supporting characters from the other movies like Hamm, Rex, Slinky, Bullseye, Mr. And Mrs. Potato head are still funny and entertaining, the toys that Bonnie have are also the same, Bo Beep returns and is even better then she was before, her chemistry with Woody is wonderful and funny, now for the new characters, there's Forky who's charming, funny and plays a somewhat big part in the movie, Gabby Gabby was one character I didn't expect to love, but she was great, there's more to her then you would expect, Bunny and Ducky are really funny supporting characters, Duke Ca-Boom is a lot of fun, not only are the characters just amazing, same can apply to the voice acting, Tom Hanks is just incredible as Woody, Tim Allen is amazing as Buzz, Joan Cusack is wonderful as Jesse, everyone from the previous movies are amazing, the new characters have great voice actors too, Tony Hale is charming as Forky, Christina Hendricks is quite intense as Gabby Gabby, Key and Peele are funny as Bunny and Ducky, Keanu Reeves is surprisingly great as Duke Ca-Boom, the characters fully represent what it's like to be a toy, they have humour, heart, entertainment, whit, charm and great voice actors behind them, it's what make them truly a wonderful group of toys.Wow......, this series feels completed now, after Toy Story 3 I didn't know how the fourth movie was going to top it, but it found a way and it did it in a amazing way, Toy Story 4 is a strong Pixar movie with incredible writing, animation that is mind boggling, characters with humour, heart and purpose along with terrific voice acting, Josh Cooley did a amazing job directing this movie, now... there is NO and I repeat NO need for a fifth movie because there is nothing else you can do with these characters, so I just want to say.... Pixar, thank you, thank you for all the good times with these characters, they made me laugh, they made me cry, they are always fun and entertaining, the movies have been incredible and moving, not one bad bit of filmmaking, but like all good things, it might come to an end and this ended off with something truly powerful and perfect, Toy Story 3 started the decade off in 2010 and now the fourth movie is ending the decade off, so it has been fun being with these characters and their adventures, we don't need anymore adventures, we have what we need for a saga... or should I say the best saga ever!..... so for that I want a big heartfelt and honest thank you to Pixar, I will continue to watch and support what you make and I do hope... that you continue to do more amazing stuff, hopefully Onward and Soul will be amazing also, so it's been fun but we made it to Infinity and Beyond...Toy Story 4 most certainly gets a 10/10!.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
now I want to see a Toy Story-Shining mashup,"It was inevitable that the series was going to have a fourth - and probably final - installment. It's fun, if not a masterpiece. New cast members include Christina Hendricks, Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele, Keanu Reeves and Patricia Arquette.But here's what caught my attention: the references to ""The Shining"". The original reference in the franchise was the carpet in Sid's house, which matched the Overlook's carpet (which Stanley Kubrick intended as a representation of the hotel's repetition of events). The obvious reference here is the phonograph playing ""Midnight, the Stars and You"", which got played at the 1920s ball attended by Jack Nicholson's character. Then there's the typewriter, 237, and some others. I'd like to see the ""Toy Story"" franchise crossed with ""The Shining"" (presumably Woody is married to Bo, and Jessie is their daughter; Woody gets a job as caretaker of a hotel, but Buzz's ghost tells him to ""correct"" them). Yeah, I have too much time on my hands.Anyway, fun for its runtime. It was high time that Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner provided voices in an animated feature together.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disappointing in the end,"It showed promise but in the end with its message that families are disposable, I found this really disappointing. I also thought they spent too much time on new characters and not enough with the old gang, some of whom still have plenty of room for development.

"As always, Pixar's animation excels.","It's that time again, the time for updates, since enough time has passed. First of all, people asked me to give my opinion on the summer films of this year, and I'm not against doing this. How good are the films that have been released this summer? I'm now ready to give my take. I must admit that I've seen only several films this summer, and most of them were made by the The Walt Disney Company. But the ones that I did see didn't really disappoint me. Toy Story 4 is the best film that I saw. This film had a long development period because of the departure of John Lasseter from Pixar Animation Studios. I read about this in Animation Magazine. Because of this, and because of the fact that the film is yet another sequel to Toy Story (1995), I had the feeling that Toy Story 4 might be somewhat disappointing. But this film surprised me when I saw it because it's not only the best Pixar film since Incredibles 2 (2018). It's also one of the best Pixar films of this decade. In my opinion, the director, Josh Cooley, delivered the goods. The characters have never looked better. The voice work is excellent. The humor is frequent. And we get to find out new things about Woody and the gang. It's true that the film is formulaic, and it's yet another sequel from Pixar, but, when the film is this good, I don't feel like complaining. Still, I didn't enjoy seeing Toy Story 4 as much as I enjoyed seeing Incredibles 2. Incredibles 2 is, in my opinion, the best Pixar film of this decade, even surpassing Inside Out (2015) and Finding Dory (2016) in terms of craftsmanship. I went to see it more than once in a cinema. Can you believe that Incredibles 2 could have been even better if Brad Bird and Pixar had been given more time to make it? The film is almost perfect as it is, but it could have been even better. The only thing that weighs it down is the lack of a truly memorable villain. But, otherwise, the film is perfect, in my opinion. Thank goodness that films like this can still be made from time to time in Hollywood. Bird deserved to win a second Oscar for his work, but, because of political reasons and because he already has one Oscar, the Oscar for Best Animated Feature was instead awarded to the filmmakers of Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018). By the way, I finally figured out why Into The Spider-Verse isn't an entirely satisfying film. Miles Morales, the new Spider-Man, is supposed to be the main character. But he spends almost the entire film either being a sidekick to Peter B. Parker or acting as comic relief. Only at the end of the film does he get to do something on his own, but, by that time, it's too late for any character development for him. Therefore, Into The Spider-Verse lacks a fully developed protagonist. The animation style is also something that I find to be not entirely to my liking. It makes the film seem like a gimmick at times. Anyway, I've already posted my review of Into The Spider-Verse on my blog, and I don't have to go into it in more detail. By the way, if you like the animation style of the film, I can recommend getting the art book 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - The Art of the Movie'. The only other film that I fully enjoyed seeing this summer in a cinema is Spider-Man: Far From Home. It's yet another example of Marvel's domination of the superhero genre in film form. Marvel continues to put the other Hollywood studios to shame. Even the recently released Shazam!, which is thought of by some people as the best DC film of recent years, doesn't come close to the best Marvel films. I mean, really, is it that hard to make a good action film these days? I guess that it is, especially one with plenty of special-effects. Instead of lively, enjoyable flicks, we often get dour, distasteful flicks like Venom (2018), The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), or Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice (2016) from the other studios. How depressing. It seems that the only film form in Hollywood that has consistently delivered good films in the last decade is computer animation. In my opinion, Far From Home doesn't rank among Marvel's best, but it's still a good flick. Tom Holland is definitely the best on-screen Peter Parker so far. So, there you go. I enjoyed seeing two films in a theater this summer, and both of them are films from Disney. I guess this means that this summer has been disappointing when it comes to new Hollywood films. But there are other new films that I found to be... passable, though not fully enjoyable. They are Annabelle Comes Home, Detective Pikachu, Missing Link, The Angry Birds Movie 2, Pet Sematary, The Secret Life Of Pets 2, Aladdin, Us, Hobbs & Shaw, How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, and Alita: Battle Angel. I saw almost all of these films long after they were released in theaters. I decided not to include The Lion King among these ""just fine"" flicks because seeing it felt strange to me. Firstly, this film was made entirely using computers. There are no human actors or real locations. But the film was still made to look as realistic as possible. Maybe this means that it can't really be called an animated film, or maybe it can. It's almost a scene for scene copy of the original 1994 film. This means that there's nothing original about it except for the way it was made. The animals, since they were made to look as real as possible, aren't as expressive as in the original animated film. In addition to all of this, I saw the original animated film only a few days before I went to see the remake in a theater. All of this added together made the film a strange and unenjoyable experience for me. Still, Pumbaa did fart once. But let's move away from this somewhat depressing picture and focus on something else. The people that follow my blog should know that most of the films that I see aren't new Hollywood films. If it's a Hollywood film, it's most likely one from the 1980s or it's a so-called classic Hollywood film. Many films from Hollywood's Golden Age really are a pleasure to watch for me. These films are well-acted and optimistic. By the way, if you've read the science fiction novel Titan by John Varley, you should know that Gaea, the old alien being that Cirocco meets at the end of the story, is obsessed with watching films from Hollywood's Golden Age. I'm currently reading the book 'Majestic Hollywood: The Greatest Films of 1939' by Mark A. Vieira.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"It's decent, but simply not good enough to warrant getting the toys back out of the box.","I'll start by saying that 'Toy Story 4' is definitely a good film. It has outstanding animation (with almost photo-realistic environments), tells a fairly thematically rich narrative that doesn't pander to children, and is a decently fun time overall. However, it's simply not good enough to warrant getting the toys back out of the box. 'Toy Story 3' was an absolutely perfect ending to the series, expertly wrapping up all of the themes and character arcs in a very satisfying way, and the heads at Pixar said they would only make a fourth movie if they could come up with a storyline that was as good or better than that of the original trilogy. Unfortunately, this one just doesn't make the cut. It lacks the humour and wit of the first two films and the pure heart of the third, meaning that it's only a middling Pixar effort (though that is to say better than the majority of animated films out there). It has a strong opening act that sets up some nice, thought-provoking themes, however these are never really expanded upon and somewhat thrown out in service of other, less-interesting ones. Take the character of 'Forky' for example. The (highly marketed) theme and arc surrounding his character are very interesting, yet they are only one of many that are pretty underdeveloped and quickly resolved. That seems to be the biggest problem with the film as a whole: there are too many cooks in the kitchen. It has eight credited story writers and this is extremely obvious. Unlike any of the previous entries in the franchise, it lacks a clear through-line in terms of theme and this is a great detriment to the piece. What's worse, however, is that the message that the film finally settles on is completely contradictory to that of the original trilogy, and some character arcs fully go back on what was established in those prior entries. I can see what they were trying to achieve, and in its own right the message isn't a bad one, yet it simply doesn't work here as this is a direct continuation of the first three films. It's easy to say that you shouldn't compare this fourth entry to the rest of them and that you should take it as its own thing, but at the end of the day that's impossible to do as it's not it's own thing. Had it been a sort of spinoff, focussing on different characters in the same world, that wouldn't have been such a big ask. As it stands though this is definitely 'Toy Story 4', a direct follow-on exploring the lives of the same characters, so direct comparisons to the first three are inevitable, and it should have taken them and their character arcs into consideration. Another issue is that the original supporting characters, including Jesse who can sort of be seen as one of the leads, are severely underused here. Classic characters such as Hamm, Rex, the Potato Heads and Slinky only have a couple of lines each and add nothing to the overall narrative. Even Buzz, who is in the film quite a bit, doesn't really have much to do and he sort of seems out of character. This is a huge shame as those characters and their individual personalities brought a lot of the charm to the first three films. There are new side characters introduced in this film that get a lot of the screen time, but unfortunately they just aren't all that interesting and it seems a shame to have all of the great classic characters do practically nothing so that these new additions can just be okay. Like I initially said though, this is far from a bad film. There's definite enjoyment to be had here and it's attempts at exploring big ideas are admirable. It's just simply not good enough, however, when 'Toy Story 3' ended the franchise so perfectly. Had it been funnier, more exciting and more than middling Pixar, it wouldn't have been such a problem that it reopened the 'Toy Story'. As it stands though, it's unfortunately quite a disappointing return. 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"One movie too many, doesn't live up to previous three","Toy Story 4 may've been one movie too many, as it didn't quite live up to the first three and left me with too high of expectations that wee not quite met. The climax and plot of this movie weren't as exciting and climatic, and this movie lacked a true antagonist like the other movies. The ending did have a sad moment, but could've been much more dramatic and was too abruptly cut short. After Woody, Buzz, and Bo Peep, the other main toys like Rex, Slinky, Potato Head, and Jesse all had such minimal roles and were cast aside, while the new Forky character was rather stupid and annoying. I did like the crisis that troubled Woody, and the new spunky version of Bo Peep.

"Not as good as it's predecessors, but still a great film.","What I originally thought would disappoint turned out to be surprisingly great! Toy Story 4 is an emotionally engaging, beautifully animated and incredibly entertaining film that, while not as good as Toy Story 3, is nearly on par with the first and second, which is still VERY good. This is easily the funniest Toy Story to date, nearly every joke worked very well and the timing was excellent. The emotional moments were on a scale of depressing to full on tear jerking, especially with the interactions between Woody and Bo and that gut punching ending. And the animation is STUNNING. It is mesmerizingly detailed and the lighting is gorgeous. Pixar is constantly topping itself in the animation department and it shows as every film they have released has progressively looked better and better. The ending also left me crying even after exiting the cinema, but TS3's ending still has it beat as that movie had me violently sobbing during it's last few minutes. It isn't the best Toy Story, but it's still a fantastic movie and definitely worth seeing. Even though Pixar sequels are generally unnecessary, this one included, I'm happy with Toy Story 4 serving as the franchises conclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

TS is one of few consistent saga with great stories, making me happy, laugh and cry at the same time (as long as its about family and friendship), great characters (and dubbers) and somehow it gets better in time (and sequel). I even laughed out loud at several scenes I couldnt remember when I did that the last timeWhile many viewers will consider TS4 is average in many ways, I can say it stands out as one of the best movies of the year, compared to other mediocre-stories-with-big-budget moviesThank you for this

What happened?,"When I saw Toy Story 3 it really felt like a leap forward after Toy Story 2, both in animation, humour and the complexity of its themes. In fact each new toy story movie has felt that way. This one though only really improves further on the animation. The look of the thing really dazzles with super realistic lighting, lovely looking textures and beautiful colours.When it comes to the story and characterization though this feels strangely like fan fiction or something. The new characters/toys here though are just not that interesting, there's barely an antagonist, the film doesn't really improve on the previous one's location. The old gang barely have anything to do, I'm not asking for fan service just a good story where they can be involved. Bonnie is a cute character and is probably the best part of the film. I can sort of believe Woody might be able to say goodbye to his owner, but all his friends, really? Reviewing this as a children's film they will love it, reviewing though as an adult though it's not 5 stars. The jokes aren't really that funny either this time though it is still full of sentimental bits.There are some deeper things going on in the film, when Woody talks about how as a toy it feels to watch their kid grow up, all their amazing moments then leave home and go off and live their adult life, and how after your purpose sort of feels fulfilled, it's pretty clearly a metaphor about parents feel about their children. The toys also interact far more with real people in this film compared with the first three. The makers of Toy Story 4 also seem to have progressive"" than any of it's predecessors ever felt they needed to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good but not great,"Look I love Toy Story films, always have and always will except this one. sorry Disney but you should have stopped at the 3rd one. Toy Story 3 was an perfect ending to the series. You didn't need a 4th one. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it. I did like it very much but usually when I see a Toy Story film I admittedly want to go back to the theater and see the film again but sorry not this film.
What this film is about without giving too much away because I don't do spoilers is Woody feels unwanted and unneeded by Bonnie is new owner because Andy is off to college and living his life. Bonnie is starting Kindergarten and Woody wants to protect her on journey to school and he sees these kids being mean to her so he grabs some materials for her so she can make a best friend named Forky who in all honestly is a bit mental but it's fine because Woody is like a big brother to him. Basically the film takes a weird turn when the family decides to go on a trip that Summer and a lot of weird stuff happens that I can't really talk about because I don't want to ruin it for you guys. But we do find out what happened to Bo-Peep and that was sort of nice to see what happened to her.
Should you see this film? Umm I guess so if you children they'll enjoy it but adults might find it okay but it's not like the other Toy Story films but hey that's just me. Normally the other films I saw in the theater I wanted to see the film again but not this film. I'll use my money for The Lion King and Spiderman Far From Home. Will I buy the film on Blu-ray when it's out? Probably to add to my collection because I have the other films. I did enjoy the new characters Ducky and Bunny but all the scenes you saw in the theater they saw in the clips on Twitter or in the commercials so you can just watch those on YouTube if you wanted to.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
4th time's not a charm.,"Shame on Pixar, as a loyal Toy Story fan since I was just a kid in the 90's, who enjoyed the second part and who closed a perfect cycle with Toy Story 3 as a young man, now as a young adult who's hitting the 30's and still love animated films (specially the ones from Pixar), I can tell you how unnecessary and boring Toy Story 4 is.They ruined a perfect trilogy for a huge bunch of dollars, instead of do it so with a brand new story.I must say the Keegan-Michael Key & Jordan Peele characters were the best of the film, and the lack of these would've made TS4 just unbearable and utterly annoying.Just a few laughs you can draw from this film and nothing more, those who belong to my generation (the 90's) knows perfectly that our love for this franchise ended in 2010 with the 3rd part, with a tear hanging in the eye, not in this forced 4th piece.

Not a terrible film. But not in league with the first 3.,"Although I think this film is overall about a 7/10. Which is ok. I'd give Cars a 7/10 and Brave probably a 6/10. Let alone cars 2 or 3.However, I really despise Pixar deciding to make Toy Story 4 given that the other 3 movies are 10/10 or maybe a 9/10 in the case of the first one. But the original Toy Story gets brownie points for being first feature length animated movie and first Pixar film. The decision to green-light this script is a 1 or 2 out of 10 decision if you ask me. Because it had the complete opposite effect of Toy Story 2 and 3. Real fans and legacies are built on quality rather than quantity.The Toy Story films as a duo and trilogy seemed special because they escaped the typical sequel problem of going downhill or being redundant. (Which is especially common for kid-friendly movies)Toy Story 2 and 3 were such good sequels because they didn't just seem to keep the original vision going, but also improve on, or build on the strengths of the previous films.Toy Story 2 has the Emily flashback sequence. Toy Story 3 has the Lotso backstory plus the poignant moment where Andy passes on his toys to Bonnie.Toy Story 4 has an emotional moment or two. But it doesn't have the strong central plot of the other films.It took me long time to figure out what #4 specifically was lacking after I watched it, but luckily I found someone with the answer. Which is that the film doesn't seem to clearly be about one big storyline in the action packed dramatic 3rd act, like what we see in the other films.What feels like the craziest most dramatic action sequence in the first 3 films is the middle of the 3rd act. (It's called the climax for a reason)In Toy Story 4 what feels like the most dramatic moment is in the middle. Which is when they try and and fail to rescue Forky.Meanwhile, the end of the middle act, where in the first 3 pictures, the main characters learn something important and make an important pivotal decision, is instead, in Toy Story 4, placed at the very end of the 3rd act. And it just didn't feel fresh in a good way. Instead it felt a inferior, unclear and insufficient because the viewer isn't sure what the characters are fighting for in what should be the climax. And if feels it can't work as a climax yet because you're not sure yet what they're all fighting to achieve. This issue alone easily drops the film at least 2 stars.I also objected a bit to some slow-paced moments in the beginning of the film.The film doesn't seem to have a villain. Obviously it's good to have red herrings for the audience trying to find a villains. But generally you want there to be someone or some characteristic which is a clear source of the conflict for the protagonists. I don't know what or who that was in this film.Buzz following his buttons when deciding what to do seemed contrived and like a step backward rather than forward for his character.The end credits were also noticeably awkward. Why all the pauses to show credits between the clip sequences? Did anyone honestly think this new style was an improvement over the style of the end credits for Toy Story 2 or 3?The strength of the film was the new and returning Bo had many funny and heartfelt moments. The score and voice acting were still top notch. Bo peep in particular was neat to see and hear once more. (Can you believe that it has been 20 years since we last heard Bo speak?) The look of the film was mostly very enjoyable too.Some people were annoyed that characters like Rex, Jessie and Mr Potatohead weren't featured much. But I feel that would have made the story seem even clunkier and even harder to follow than it already was. If you stretch the viewer's attention to too many characters in a movie then there's no interesting or cogent story to be had with any of them.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not Great but Certainly Not a 1 or 2,"As an older adult I thought the third offering in this series was so moving. It also had a finality to it that made me feel sad and satisfied. The fourth one must have been an effort to rake in some big bucks on reputation. I found it to be the usual masterful special effects of Pixar, but it lacked emotion and story development. While I'm sure a young audience would like it, I was just left a bit cold. One criticism that others have offered, and to which I agree, is the lack of use of the cast of toy characters. Even Buzz gets short shrift. Why pay these really cool actors to do voice-overs and then have so little for them to do. I know that little girl is cute, but that only goes so far.

Awesome sequel to an amazing franchise,"Let's start with the thing that the graphics of the animation were so much better than the last 3 movies. I am not saying the graphics of the previous movies were bad, just that this one had it so much improved. When Toy Story 4 was announced , I was worried that it was going to be a cash grab and ruin the perfect ending of the franchise which was (previously ) Toy Story 3. But Pixar has managed to create a film which makes you smile. Again. Woody and Buzz's friendship could have had a tad bit more screentime but overall I loved every minute of this film. And although the ending wasn't as tear jerking as Toy Story 3 , you will definitely leave misty eyed. Forky and the other new characters mingle perfectly with the existing ones but at times it feels like the old characters were neglected a bit. And Bo Peep's mysterious disappearance from the franchise is FINALLY solved. I found her new persona to be extremely cool. Toy Story 4 requires you to watch the other 3 films first as most of the plot is interwoven with them as it might become a bit confusing if you go there without any idea who Bo or Bonnie are.

Because i found this movie to have alot of filler and it felt like the plot went nowhere, i have to be honest there are some enjoyable moments and it is entertaining, but i think it's one of the weaker pixar films",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Great story but just wasn't necessarily needed!,"Toy story films always have great story's and they always hit so hard. I do like the new setting of this film as it's the first toy story film that spends most of the movie outside rather than in a small space. The animation is amazing as always and I think the script is great also. The main pet hate I have is that it's just an un needed film and it was 100% just a cash grab because the studio just knew this film would do well. The story is great but it does have its flaws, the new characters are good but I just hate how the original characters just get sidelined and are barely in the film at all, Buzz is only in the film for like 20 minutes and he's literally Woodys best friend. Some of the things Woody does are just so out of character for him. I really do enjoy this film and it is great I just think it wasn't necessary especially with how amazing the third film was as an ending to the franchise. Overall, not a bad film at all I just don't fully understand why they made it!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar delivers again,"The Toy Story series might be the most successful film series of all time. It is really hard to see the fourth film maintains the same high standard of the first trilogy.

The message is so heartwarming that I really want to see Toy Story 5.",,Anonymous,Animation

A Masterpiece of film making.,"THE STORY: Sheriff Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is trying his best to adjust to life with Bonnie (Madeleine McGraw) - the little girl who inherited Andy's beloved childhood toys at the end of Toy Story 3. Even though he's forgotten more often than not, Woody remains intensely focused on Bonnie and her happiness. This means going into full babysitter/bodyguard mode when Bonnie creates Forky (Tony Hale), a spork with twists of wire for hands and clumsy wooden popsicle sticks for feet. As Woody tries to keep the trash-oriented Forky safe, he's swept into an accidental adventure - one in which he meets old friends and learns new truths about who he is and who he has yet to be.THE GREAT: Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Toy Story 4 is the fact that it feels like the natural, necessary final chapter of a story told in four parts. There's no way that any of this could have been planned when Pixar first introduced us to Woody in 1995, but the progression in both narrative and character development feels utterly organic. Woody has spent the last three films grappling with his existential fear of being lost, forgotten or replaced, from his first meeting with the brash Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) to the day Andy outgrew him and went away to college. This film challenges Woody - and his audiences - to think hard about second chances, about changing how you look at yourself, about finding and embracing a new purpose in life. As such, Toy Story 4 might be the most philosophical movie you'll see this year, in the best possible way.THE NOT-SO-GREAT: There actually isn't all that much to complain about. The plot machinations can feel a little clunky at times, but Stephany Folsom and Andrew Stanton weave so much joy and humour into their screenplay that the film still zips along. As this is very much Woody's movie, fan-favourite legacy characters like Buzz and Jessie (Joan Cusack) inevitably end up taking a back-seat. Even then, however, they each still get moments to shine. You might find yourself both thoroughly amused and mildly annoyed by the antics of Ducky (Keagan Michael-Key) and Bunny (Jordan Peele), a symbiotic pair of new characters who were clearly inserted into proceedings for comic relief.FORKING FUNNY: Give it up for Forky, surely the best new animated character of the year. Voiced with a bewildered tenderness by Hale, Forky is a delight - a walking, talking identity crisis created out of one little girl's love and imagination. Even better? With his magnetic attraction to all nearby trash-cans, Forky is a fandom meme just waiting to happen. A close runner-up is daredevil stuntman Duke Caboom, who reportedly owes his ridiculously charming posing and personality to current internet darling Keanu Reeves' commitment to the role. Toy Story 4 even manages to make its main antagonist, Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), both terrifying and endearing - although there are fewer shades of grey when it comes to her ventriloquist-doll minions, led by the determinedly creepy Benson.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good ending for Woody,"It's a satisfying conclusion to the Toy Story franchise; however, it lacks the magic of the previous films; the plot is good, the animation is excellent, and the Randy Newman soundtrack is good and nostalgic; a decent animated movie, but not great.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I cried,"""Toy Story 4"" extends the themes of the previous movies without adding much, but still manages to be almost as fresh. As always technically amazing, well written, and perfectly balanced. Its bittersweet tone mostly appeals to all of us who grew up with the franchise, and that most probably felt as inadequate and left behind in an ever-changing world as these characters. It still manages to be much fun for both kids and grown-ups, without excessively leaning to either side. It's great to see that despite other franchises ended up losing their soul through their forced sequels, Toy Story still manages to keep its warmth every time.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Underwhelming doesn't even begin to cover it,"It's probably cliche as hell to say this at this point but the point still stands, Toy Story 3 was one of the most perfectly conceived and executed endings to a trilogy in movie history. So when it was announced by Pixar that a fourth movie was in the works I was sceptical at best and terrified at worst. And boy was I right to be worried. Sitting through this movie was an incredibly dull experience for me and my friends, we were willing to give it a chance yet it still disappointed. The plot is paper thin and covers all the old ground of the other movies but significantly worse, the voice acting was passable with Tom Hanks probably giving the strongest performance, the animation and lighting was easily the most enjoyable part of the film, this is Pixar's best looking film and it's a marvel seeing how far they've evolved since the original Toy Story. This isn't enough to save the movie however as the amazing visuals are constantly overshadowed by the mediocre writing and story.
Overall this movie doesn't really try in regards to the story, the animation really showed how much effort was put in to make this the best looking Pixar film, but beyond that it's pretty shallow. Check this movie out if you just want to see Woody and Buzz again, but if your looking for a movie that is anything above mediocre you'll be severely disappointed.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

TOY STORY 4,"""Toy Story 4,"" directed by Josh Cooley, brings a fresh yet nostalgic installment to the beloved Pixar franchise. This film continues the adventures of Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and the rest of the toy gang, introducing new characters while exploring deep themes of identity, purpose, and the meaning of belonging. It's a heartfelt journey that proves the franchise still has plenty of stories to tell, more than two decades after the original film charmed audiences worldwide.**Plot and Storytelling**The story kicks off with a delightful new character, Forky, a spork-turned-toy created by Bonnie, the toys' new owner. Forky, voiced by Tony Hale, grapples with his newfound sentience, repeatedly insisting, ""I'm trash,"" which sets the stage for much of the film's humor and emotional depth. His existential crisis forces Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, into the role of a caretaker, desperately trying to help Forky understand his value as a toy.The central narrative unfolds during a family road trip, where Forky's escape attempts lead to a series of adventures. This journey brings the toys into contact with old friends and new faces, including the daring Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves), the charming Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), and the spirited duo Ducky and Bunny (voiced by Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele). The road trip serves as a backdrop for exploring the broader world outside Bonnie's home, revealing the vast and sometimes intimidating scope of a toy's life.**Character Development**Woody's character arc is the heart of ""Toy Story 4."" His journey from being Andy's favorite toy to grappling with feelings of obsolescence in Bonnie's room is poignantly depicted. Woody's steadfast dedication to Forky is both touching and indicative of his deep-seated need to be useful and loved. This installment pushes Woody to confront the possibility of a new kind of happiness, one that might not be centered around being a child's favorite toy.Forky's evolution from trash to toy is both humorous and profoundly metaphorical, touching on themes of self-worth and acceptance. His character provides a fresh perspective on what it means to be a toy and, by extension, what it means to find one's place in the world.Bo Peep (Annie Potts) returns with a significant role, reimagined as a fierce, independent ""lost toy"" who has embraced a life of adventure. Her dynamic with Woody adds a rich layer of complexity to the narrative, challenging his perceptions and encouraging him to consider a life beyond child-centric loyalty.**Themes and Symbolism**""Toy Story 4"" delves into existential themes with remarkable finesse. The film examines the idea of purpose and the search for identity, not just through Forky's eyes but also through Woody's evolving sense of self. The concept of being a ""lost toy,"" initially presented as a dire fate, is reframed through Bo Peep's experiences, suggesting that autonomy and self-discovery can be as fulfilling as being cherished by a child.Gabby Gabby's character introduces another layer of depth. Her desire for a voice box to be loved by a child speaks to the universal longing for acceptance and the lengths one might go to achieve it. Her storyline, which culminates in a moment of genuine redemption, underscores the film's message about finding belonging in unexpected places.**Cinematography and Animation**Visually, ""Toy Story 4"" is stunning. Pixar's advancements in animation technology are on full display, with intricate textures, vibrant colors, and lifelike movements that bring the toys and their environments to life. The carnival scenes, in particular, are a visual feast, brimming with detail and dynamic lighting that enhance the film's adventurous spirit.The direction by Josh Cooley ensures a seamless blend of humor, action, and emotion. The pacing is brisk, keeping viewers engaged, while allowing for moments of introspection and character development. The soundtrack, composed by Randy Newman, provides a nostalgic nod to the earlier films while introducing new melodies that capture the film's emotional nuances.**Conclusion**""Toy Story 4"" is a masterful continuation of a beloved series, balancing nostalgia with fresh storytelling. It explores profound themes with humor and heart, offering a satisfying conclusion to Woody's arc while opening the door for new adventures. Whether you're a longtime fan or new to the series, this film is a testament to Pixar's storytelling prowess, proving that even the smallest toys can inspire the biggest emotions.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not necessary but still good,I don't think anyone would argue if you said that this film was completely unnecessary but that doesn't mean that it's a bad one. It still got a lot of the same great writing and heart that the previous entries had.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
TOY STORY 4 plays fully up to our nostalgia and manages to squeeze something instructive out of the old gangs on a similar territory,"""Therefore, the film aptly paves the way for a more forward-thinking mythos, what if a toy doesn't need its human owner for self-actualization? Which comes patently obvious when Bo Peep re-enters Woody's life, now is a proud ""lost"" toy who has no kid to answer for, but a cohort of toy friends, living off on the amusement park where Bonnie's family tentatively visits. After the white-knuckle escapade aiming to rescue Forky from the nominal villain Gabby Gabby (Hendricks) - a soft-spoken doll with a broken voice box, who hankers for being cherished like a real toy, and her henchmen of sinister-looking ventriloquist dummies in an antique shop, a wild rollercoaster ride is exactly what audience bargains for, though, the subplot about Buzz Lightyear (Allen) suffers in significance, while the Key and Peele duo assumes the duty of tickling our ribs as the plush toys Ducky and Bunny, and a spirited Keanu Reeves has a ball as Duke Caboom, a Canadian stuntman action figure, the victim of advertisement aggrandizement.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not needed but still a good show,"Well, I'll be honest, I never thought I'd be reviewing a new toy story film. I'm sure a few people are with me with saying that they believed number three was the end... I guess that wasn't the case. I went into this with no real expectations as it baffled me why they made a new one after ending the third one so well, I'm glad I did this though as I love when a film surprises me. Oh, and before I go into points of interest, it should go without saying if you haven't seen the other three, what's wrong? Go and find them, watch them then come back.Toy Story 4 does an amazing job of letting the new characters take centre stage, we get to see a wide range of new and fascinating toys that each have their own separate personalities. The older toys do return as they should but most only play supporting roles pushing emphasis on the newer characters for the newer generation, this is a good thing! The older generation can enjoy the returning characters but their kids are going to love the new toys. Returning characters are voiced by the same actors/actresses so do not fear, everything is the same.Very few films can hold the trophy of keeping me grinning ear to ear through at least 75% of their duration. Toy Story 4 excels at doing this. The balance of humorous scenes between adult humour and child humour is outstanding. Not sure how Toy Story does it every time but they really know how to keep adults entertained just as well as children. You will laugh, do not worry, you will laugh and smile.Can we just talk about how far animation and detailing has come? I mean jeez, it can actually be scary how good this film looks. Shadows, lighting and water effects are insane in Toy Story 4. The bench has now been set, I'm sure this will be broken in years to come but well done to everyone that worked on Toy Story 4. Fantastic job.The only downside I had with Toy Story 4 and not much of one anyway, I just don't understand why this got made. I did thoroughly enjoy it and am recommending you catch this while it's in cinemas or at least buy the Blu-Ray. However, Toy Story 3 ended immensely well, wrapping everything up perfectly. I just feel like they used this to pull in some serious cash and that's it. The ending is good in this but I don't think anything will beat Toy Story 3. Good thing for us it turned out to be a great watch or that would have been painful to witness.Here's another point to throw at you, please don't bring a newborn baby into the cinema. Obviously, this is a kids movie and kids are fully expected to be there but a newborn?! they have no clue what's going on?! Even some of the kids were getting cranky over this.Forgot to mention... you know Keanu Reeves is in this? Cause he damn well is and it's brilliant. Keep an eye out for his character!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good but slightly disappointing,"An enjoyable movie but it doesn't live up to the others. Unfortunately, The main plot gets lost to the various sub plots. The regular cast is barely used, even Buzz has kind of a bit role. Buzz's side plot doesn't even make sense nor is it resolved (Hopefully, it's not set up for a 5th installment). We learned in the beginning of Toy Story 2 that Bo Peep was sold at a garage sale. But at the beginning of Toy Story 4 it shows Bo being given away after interacting with Jesse, who doesn't join the gang until the end of Toy Story 2. Ultimately, this retcon doesn't change anything but it does reflects the lazy incoherence of the EIGHT writers. Various moments throughout the film feel disjointed from the rest of the movie. Still, it has plenty of funny moments and action sequences to make it worth seeing. However, it fails to live up to the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Master peace of all movies and movies creates are amezing work for this story,"As with every Pixar film you have your small, genius details and beautiful animation that brings there films to life. But here I found that there was no substance behind the beauty. Lots of our beloved characters were given minimal attention and seemed somewhat useless to the story. The story seemed impulsive with little direction, our characters jumping at anything that moved. The films villain seemed like subplot and didn't seem like a real threat. The first 20 minutes were my highlight. It seemed reminiscent of earlier Toy Story films and explored experiences that we can all relate to. Despite an uninspired villain, chaotic plot and underdeveloped characters I still enjoyed myself. Within the film there was so much creativity, humour and some genuinely moving moments.

I like the new characters of the movie on their backstory and the humor done by Ducky and Bunny who are really funny by the performance by two of the actors.

Review for Toy Story 4,"This was the last entry into the Toy Story series that Jaime, my wife, me and our daughter, Mackenzie, hadn't seen. It is difficult to say she watched it, but I won't split hairs. She would sit there with a snack and be entertained for stretches. This was the first time we watched it for both Jaime and me.What I'll say is that this is a strong entry. It is impressive since the original trilogy is a masterpiece with heart and how good the animation is. This coming from someone who prefers the old school way. What we're getting here is down the line from when Andy left his toys with Bonnie (voiced by Madeleine McGraw). Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is struggling since he is no longer in charge. Dolly (voiced by Bonnie Hunt) is the toy here at Bonnie's. Woody is struggling as he isn't selected to be played with.Bonnie starts kindergarten and is told by her parents not to bring toys. Woody sneaks into her bag though. He goes to class with her and sees her make a new friend, Forky (Tony Hale). She gives him life, but Forky doesn't understand. He thinks he's trash so he tries to continually throw himself away. Woody doesn't want Bonnie to be upset so he does everything he can to prevent that. The other toys help as well.The family then goes on a road trip where Bonnie brings all her toys. This leads them to an RV park where they stay overnight. Woody has to grab Forky, who jumped out the window. They end up at an antique store. It is there they meet Gabby Gabby (voiced by Christina Hendricks). She is an old doll that has a broken voice box. Seeing Woody, she thinks she's found a way to get another child to love her. She isn't as nice as she seems, ruling with an iron fist along with a group of dummies. Woody also meets up with Bo Peep (voiced by Annie Potts). Our group of toys learns about themselves and figures out their place in the larger world around them.Let me then bring back up what I said about how this is a good follow up. We are continuing to allow these characters to grow. Woody is struggling now that he's no longer Andy's favorite. He thought living with Bonnie would help, but it's not. Running into Bo Peep makes him question his place. She is now a toy that lives at a playground and gets played with regularly by different children. This makes her happy. Woody does have knowledge to impart on Forky, who wasn't made to be a toy, but Bonnie loves him like one and needs to learn.What I also like about this story is that it makes sense why toys don't seem to be in the place we left them. In reality, it is because children do things without thinking so they get lost. This could be for something beloved. It makes you wonder when you accuse someone of moving something for sure. That's a good touch for sure.Something that I said to Jaime as well was that this feels like people who are famous wanting to make cameos. We have the mainstays of Hanks, Tim Allen, Potts, Joan Cusack, John Ratzenberger, Wallace Shawn, Estelle Harris And Don Rickles back. This brings back Bonnie Hunt as well. We also get Hale, Keegan-Michael Key, Madeleine McGraw, Hendricks, Jordan Peele, Keanu Reeves, Carl Weathers and June Squibb as new characters. I love this as they continue to expand on this world. It is great just starting in a bedroom and the neighbor's house to everything that we got to come to this installment.I'll end by saying this is well-made. The animation isn't my favorite style, but it looks great. How realistic they can make things look is impressive. This has a good story to tell and there is heart with it. Not as emotional, but I'm not as invested with Bonnie. There are other characters taking the stage here which is to be expected. Still another good film in this franchise.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Let's be honest,"This movie was fair let's be honest. The main thing we all loved was the 7-8 characters including Rex, Ham, Slinky Dog and the potato heads, along with Jessie, Woody and Buzz.

By having the main characters on screen it will help with better reviews and more people liking it.

Toy Story 4 is... Fun and Resonant!,"With all the newer projects Disney seems to be starting, it's nice when they take a break to follow up with characters from the past. The 'Toy Story' films started in 1995, and they're still thriving. For some franchises, this would be redundant, but 'Toy Story''s characters and plot are lovable enough to make it more than just work!It's ample to say that the movie is a lot of fun, with both old and new characters who are very entertaining. The voice work is amazing, and doesn't feel cheesy and forced like in some animated features (really, voice talent is just as important as acting!). It's also nice to see people like Tom Hanks (Woody), Tim Allen (Buzz), and Annie Potts (Bo Peep) be the stars of the show; so many cartoons now want to cast stars that are faddish, like Justin Timberlake and Miley Cyrus.And like most Pixar films, especially this franchise, be ready for plenty of emotion.

An Unnecessary Epilogue to a Beloved Trilogy,"Toy Story 4 was just shy of a monumental let down. Being of the generation who grew up watching the Toy Story films as they were being created, the first Toy Story movie was as much of a monument to my childhood as it was to Pixar itself, being their first animated feature film. The sequel was a good exploration of Woody's character background (and a nod to all the avid collectors out there) and the third was a beautiful tear jerker that saw our beloved toys both nearly destroyed and wonderfully saved by a new future with a new owner to love and treasure them just like we all do.Toy Story 4 did NOT fit this beloved story arc much at all. To begin, the marketing for the film was clearly doing their best to scrounge up whatever bits they could from what was believed to be these new and hilarious characters that were now the focus of this final chapter (especially Sporky). Wrong! Sporky, Bunny, and Ducky were hilarious absolutely hilarious, but their shortcomings simply fall to poor writing (and no fault of the actors themselves, I am a big Key and Peele fan). Their minute roles made them out to simply be humorous extras who appear every now and then for a quick one-liner then promptly exit the scene until the next appointed moment of comic relief. What a waste of some great characters that could've potentially brought some fresh new perspectives to the table of what life is like for toys.The separation of Bo Peep and Woody gave so much heartbreaking life to their simple romance from the previous films that her return was expected to be nothing less of a glorious and romantic reunion. Wrong! Instead Woody's feelings for her slowly fizzle as she chooses a life of strong independence over love. Strong women who can fend for themselves are certainly honorable and deserve great respect, but being in love with someone doesn't make them weak. In fact, love actually strengthens people more often than not. It was simply a shame to see a great love relationship be friend-zoned simply because Bo Peep jumped on the ""I don't need no man!"" train.Take those things, throw in some of Buzz listening to his own pre-recorded toy playtime sayings as if they were his conscience, a lot more direct involvement between the living toys and the humans, the fact that 90% of the film takes place in literally two settings (a carnival and an antique store that they return to at least 4 times), and then add a unicorn infatuated with the idea of sending Molly's dad to jail just to top it all off.Truly, the one good story in this movie is that of the new character Gabby Gabby. Gabby's character arc was indeed one to be enjoyed, from the outwardly evil appearance stemming from her genuinely selfish intent that leads you to believe she is the antagonist, to how her story suddenly takes not one but two unexpected turns and ends up reminding us once again how toys can make such an immense impact on the imagination, emotion, and comfort of children. It's a shame that such a moving chain of events was embodied within one minor character instead of the whole film.Bottom line, if you're a big fan of the previous three movies and are expecting this to give you that same fun-loving and heartwarming feel, dont, this movie is not for you. The film is certainly entertaining, funny, and interesting, but it by no means feels like a Toy Story movie, and especially not the conclusion of it all. By the end of it, we see our once beloved characters choosing paths that just don't seem to fit who we know and love them to be. It would've been wise for Pixar to leave it at a beautiful trilogy that starts well, ends well, and leaves us feeling like we all miss the days of when our daytime hours were spent with toys and imagination. It's just very sad that such a feature film would come from the team that managed to make a hilarious Toy Story short film about a support group of rejected kids meal toys (It's on Disney Plus, called ""Small Fry"", check it out). Where was that clever creative genius? Unfortunately, Pixar's current creative team clearly ran out of ideas and decided to try and further milk a story that had already been finished, thus leaving the audience with the taste of old, sour milk in its mouth.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Mixed bag of awesomeness and disappointment,"Firstly, let's just say, TS4 is a must-see for fans. Because no-one can summarise it in a review. And for all it's let-downs, it is on par with the earlier trilogy for its laughs, fantastic (new) characters and it's charm.But.It's letdowns are many. It was a tough sell to bring back our beloved characters for a fourth instalment, and Disney pulled out all the stops to create some of the best new toys than any previous movie. I just wish that they'd spent as much time on the plot and overarching Toy Story themes that the first three films created and supported so well.Without spoiling the film, suffice to say, the morals don't quite fit the 'You've got a friend in me' vibes. It also blurs the line a bit between good and bad, which could be confusing to a young child - or maybe even an adult like me.While each of the previous Toy Story movies had their own 'scary toys', I'd say this one trumps them all. And they play a heavy part in the films' plot, so young kids beware. This film better suits the returning Toy Story fan than a young kids' movie.For big fans of some of the smaller sidekick toys, this film could be a little bit of a downer, with a lot of the main characters sidelined for most of the movie. But a good outing for Woody, Buzz, Bo and a host of other new (brilliant) characters.At the end of the day, a decent watch, and will be better remembered if they follow it up with a sequel (fifthquel?) to explain some of the unanswered questions the movie raises.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

The adventures of the toys have gotten even more elaborate and in this film they hardly seem to care that they're running around in the open. They still conceal themselves from people but they take a lot more risks than you would think. The whole premise of living toys is ludicrous, of course, but even so it feels unlikely that they could pull off all these capers without being noticed by humans.All in all, the movie is more than watchable, although it is the weakest of the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's another Toy Story,"Beautiful work from Pixar.. but on strictly the Toy Story Scale, this was #3 of the 4 they made. The order story and originality is Toy Story 1, 2, 4, and then 3. Pixar does a great job with the story, tears, action and everything you'd expect. It starts with a great story (still waiting for Pixar to bring an Amish storyline to life.. something truly original), and this was very good, but with four Toy Stories, if you weigh it against the others, I'd call is a close (by not quite) 2nd place.
It's fun to look for the TONS of other Pixar reference in this movie as well (lots!) I can add it's interesting to see the multiple versions of Andy based on the quality of digital animation. LOVE Pixar... LOVE their work.. but this wasn't Up or Monsters Inc. quality. I'd MUCH rather see Pixar NOT trying to give us a 4th edition of a movie, but create more of their high quality original NEW story lines. With that said, well worth seeing... may produce tears.. good story... and time will tell if they bring back a Toy Story 5 (keep in mind that Woody is a toy from the 1950's.. and he belonged to SOMEONE before Andy (who we've never heard about). I think I actually COULD go for a cool ""A New Toy Story"".. based on Woody being brand new and in the 1950's (surrounded by 1950's... ala Back to the Future 50's fun!)",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The end of Woody's story is, as you'd expect from the series, dressed in an abundance of hilarity, age-appropriate scares and dazzling animation.","For the cynical amongst us (myself included), Toy Story 4's very existence seemed all but too bold a gamble; how could another instalment in what is arguably a perfect series not only match the outstanding quality of its predecessors, but also respectfully undo the thoroughly satisfying conclusion of a beloved trilogy? Pixar, however, have successfully negotiated both aspects of that conundrum, crafting an absolutely worthy story that answers both of those questions in the best way one could possibly imagine.Debate the necessity of this chapter all you must, but despite the story feeling slightly detached from that which came before before it - Andy's ownership of the toys being the connective tissue driving the previous adventures, while still lingering to the right degree - the narrative truly feels organic. The screenplay asks all the right questions, and answers them with the same pathos that characterised the history of the franchise. In a masterful stroke, Pixar bravely humanise these characters further than ever before, developing the series' already mature philosophy on purpose and pondering what a toy is to do when their tenure of servitude to a child is all but over. In exploring such a theme, Toy Story 4 does the seemingly impossible and not only transcends the ending of Toy Story 3, but also invites you to reconsider whether it was indeed the perfect ending for Woody and company.Toy Story 4 is absolutely the cowboy doll's story, bringing the series full circle and further rendering it a fitting conclusion. This, in addition to reintroducing Bo Peep following her absence from Toy Story 3, has the adverse effect of sidelining many of our favourite characters, including the main cast. While this is certainly notable, the likes of Buzz and Jessie had their arcs completed long ago, and it seems wise not to present them with redundant conflict for the sake of it. That's not to say that characters are underserved; even with a huge ensemble including many new toys, each of them offers a memorable comic moment all of their own. Woody, who is rightfully upheld as the heart of the franchise, remains prominent throughout, with a plot that tackles his ever fierce loyalty and provides him the opportunity to find the solace he so very deserves. Make no mistake about it; these toys have as much humanity about them as any of the greatest characters in cinematic history.The end of Woody's story is, as you'd expect from the series, dressed in an abundance of hilarity, age-appropriate scares and dazzling animation, accompanied by original music from franchise staple Randy Newman. The pessimistic viewer will undoubtedly perceive the merchandising opportunities Disney will inevitably reap from this effort, but its heart, soul and creative motive supersede those doubts for one-hundred beautiful minutes.

Pixar rising back up to the top,"When i first heard they were making a 4th installment to the Toy Story franchise, my first reaction was, ""What? Why? Why another Toy Story?""

Toy Story 4 is actually a really great movie, this is yet another great Toy Story movie which shocked the living hell out of me. As a matter of fact, this movie is up there with Toy Story 3 which to me is my favorite Pixar movie. The story is entertaining, funny, and incredibly touching, the animation is excellent as usual, and even the old and new characters in this are fantastic. Out of the previous movies Pixar has released from Cars 2 to this, this is by far the best Pixar movie that has been released, and its even one of the best sequels that Pixar has pit out.

"""... and beyond.""","First off, I'll say that 'Toy Story 4 (2019)' is, in and of itself, rather good. I suppose it was bound to be; it's Pixar, after all. It looks incredibly impressive, its near photo-real environments meshing with its stylistic characters, and it has several interesting ideas under the hood. The problem comes when you consider its place within the franchise. Even if it was perfect, it would still be like painting a Picasso on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel: that is to say, stepping on the toes of its predecessor. Its ending, while somewhat resonant, leaves things in a far less satisfying place than 'Toy Story 3 (2010)' did. Unless you totally ignore it, it - essentially - stains your memory of these characters. This wouldn't be a bad thing if the piece felt as though it had a crystal clear and absolutely vital story to tell. It just doesn't though, struggling to conflate its previously mentioned interesting ideas into a strong theme able to consistently drive its characters (and vice versa) - something all three of the prior titles did amazingly well. Here, this struggle leads to some oddly dissonant moments and a sense of, perhaps, too many cooks (or concepts) in the kitchen. As an example, Forky's much-advertised existential crisis essentially only acts as an inciting incident, despite being the most intriguing addition to the canon. Also, the side characters - such as Rex, Ham, Potato-Head and, even, Jessie - are strangely side-lined despite having no real reason not to go on the adventure (they tend to just wait around - though, they do get some action, as an ensemble, later on). In general, the writing isn't as strong as you'd like and the humour is a little lacking, too. Of course, the flick never totally fumbles and still tells a mostly enjoyable tale. It seems to have its heart in the right place, it moves at a decent pace and, in the moment, it's pretty much as likeable as ever. As a stand-alone, it's a decent experience that's actually better than the majority of movies already released in 2019. As a sequel, it's a bit of a retread that doesn't really match the quality of the series' previous entries. If you're a fan of the franchise, you may actually get less out of it than if you're not. It's a lot better than 'Incredibles 2 (2018)', though. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Fourth Installment Absolutely Worth Watching,"Despite pervasive threatening forces present throughout the Toy Story series, Toy Story 4 stands out by humanizing the seemingly negative qualities in antagonists. Characters that seem to bring harm are revealed to all suffer from internal trauma-a message that does well to speak to the internal resolve we can all find within ourselves and with the assistance of others.
But the depth isn't only contained within the darker characters. Woody showcases his maturity as a seasoned character brilliantly, making heartfelt sacrifices for those he loves while staying true to himself...no matter the cost. These sacrifices are yet another critical life lesson that go beyond any animated expectations.
All in all the plot line is 7 stars, nothing special there, but the screenplay is a perfect 10. Not to mention, you're in for a real treat with the three new hilarious characters of Ducky, Bunny, and Duke Caboom. A fourth installment absolutely worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

There are a number of clever jokes to add to the entertainment.I just want to comment on one of the voice actors, Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom, an Evel Knievel type of motorcyclist daredevil. During his movie career some have criticized Reeves for his lack of dynamic personality, but his voicing of this character should erase all that doubt.

Pixar's Love Story for Disney,"The ""Toy Story"" series has always had a clever double meaning that references itself. The first initiated the revolution in computer animation, but its narrative was fundamentally reassuring of a continuation with hand-drawn cartoons. Traditionally, at least, animation involves a series of still images, invented as opposed to recorded (as with live action), projected as motion pictures--thus, alternately inanimate and animate and created from nothing. Likewise, the ""Toy Story"" series features inanimate toys coming to life in the shadows. Like Forky in this fourth installment, from raw materials--in fact, trash--life, movement is created. Moreover, the sequels may be read as partially reflecting the sometimes-tumultuous history between Pixar and Disney.""Toy Story 2"" (1999) was a mess: originally planned for the small screen, like Woody's ""Howdy Doody"" type TV puppet show, and subject to the merchandising strategies of Disney, and so we get a store full of Buzz Lightyears... and Barbies. Presciently, there's even a memorable reference to ""Star Wars,"" another future Disney property. In the last installment, ""Toy Story 3"" (2010), the first after Disney's acquisition, took a dark turn and, inevitably, the message becomes one of growing up and giving your toys away--in this case, Pixar being the toy and Disney the recipient. ""Toy Story 4,"" by contrast, is a love story. Superficially, it's between Woody and Bo Peep, as well as the usual one for children and their toys and adults and their nostalgia, but there's a hidden romance here involving Pixar and Disney.This is an extensive adoption of Disney's business practices. It mostly takes place in a carnival, or amusement park--alluding to one of the company's most profitable and well-known divisions, theme parks. Additionally, people keep talking about the conclusion to the ""Toy Story"" series, but this franchise could conceivably continue indefinitely. Even if it were only on, say, the recently-started Disney+ streaming service. Disney is the champion of the franchise era of movies: Marvel and its cinematic universe, Star Wars, live-action and CGI remakes of its classic cartoons, Pirates of the Caribbean, Indiana Jones, the Muppets, Pixar and Disney's own animated pictures, the Alien and Avatar juggernauts and everything else 20th Century Fox... plus Mickey Mouse. The Disney name itself is the strongest brand in the industry. Good properties aren't left to die. Toys may change hands, be lost and found. Like Forky, trash is recycled. As with Bo Peep, broken parts are mended, and with Woody and Gabby, taken from elsewhere and otherwise stuffed and stitched back together. Antiques are rebooted and remade. Disney doesn't like to leave good toys on the shelf or in the closet for long.You may choose to see only what you're intended to, like the human characters within the picture, oblivious of the toys' movements. Feel free to enjoy the manufactured cloning of human emotionalism, appeals to childhood nostalgia, or even the funny quips and Pixar Easter eggs, as CGI emotes and Randy Newman sings sentimental in the background, or look in the spaces where they suppose you unmindful to their machinations--where toys breath life and a conglomerate conspires for your affections. ""Toy Story 4"" is about us loving Disney. Disney wants you to love them, to hold them close, to take their merchandise home, play their games and enjoy their amusements... at a price, of course.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good movie, still disappointed...","I have LOVED the Toy Story franchise and I could hardly wait when the fourth movie was announced.

However, these movies have all wowed me so I expected the same from Toy Story 4.You can expect many laughs, some plot twists, and certainly creativity. However, I was let down with this one... The movie did not feel like a Toy Story movie for me, it felt as if I was watching a film that featured a few Toy Story characters. For instance, you don't see much of the full traditional cast (Rex, Mr. & Mrs. Potato Head, Slinky, Mr. Porkchop, etc.) These characters are what make these movies so the fact that these roles were heavily overdrawn with new characters was upsetting.Finally, the ending was sweet and a bit heart wrenching.

Really enjoyable Toy Story movie - but felt like it lacked slightly.,"It's hard for any sequel to beat the original, and Toy Story 4 didn't live up to the original 3.When I heard a 4th movie was coming out, I was a little worried as I thought it could have just been a cash-grab. A few minutes into the movie I wasn't overly expressed, but it got better as it went on.I was stunned by the visuals, I thought they were beautiful and I loved how well it was animated! I wasn't overly keen on the Bo Peep idea at first, but her change fits in to the story quite well. Forky is an enjoyable character who surprisingly isn't annoying and gets better as the story goes on. The other characters introduced were amazing too and all of them were likeable!One thing I didn't like was how Buzz seemed to be more of a 'comedic' act. Sure, in the 2nd and 3rd movies, he was someone who took the lead when Woody wasn't around, but at least in the 3rd the Spanish act actually fit with the story.

Movie review,Very interesting movie for kids as well as adults to enjoy a lot...,,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but underwhelming compared to the other Toy Story movies","The Toy Story movies have always had a special place in my heart. I grew up with them from the very beginning as a kid and they've always been movies I re-watched plenty of times. Being very satisfied with how Toy Story 3 concluded everything, I was a little reluctant on wondering how they could pull off another Toy Story movie without it feeling pointless. Needless to say, Toy Story 4 sort of works I guess? It's not boring and still entertaining, but I don't know by the end of it I just sort of felt a little underwhelmed I guess? It's nice for Toy Story 4 to bring back old characters like Bo Peep and change things up a little following the new toy owner Bonnie instead of Andy, but I don't know I just didn't find the final result as satisfying to watch as the first three movies for some reason.That's not to say Toy Story 4 is a complete waste of time or is bad. Definitely not at all. It focuses almost entirely on Woody and the other characters, including Buzz Lightyear himself, are mostly placed in the back-burner in favour of Bo Peep and the other new characters such as Forky, Ducky, Gabby Gabby, Bunny, and Duke Caboom. One thing that I seemed to notice in Toy Story 4 was that it definitely wasn't nearly as funny as the first three movies. Forky gets a few good moments, as well as Ducky and Bunny mostly being there for Comic Relief more than anything else, but surprisingly from Woody and the main gang? It definitely felt more lacking to me personally. The theme of toys deciding what to do with their own lives and not sticking to normality is certainly one of the more interesting elements of the movie, but the execution of how these events play out to me felt a bit messy in places and there were some contrivances and out of character moments throughout the movie that bugged me.Nevertheless, whether the movie decides to focus on Forky or Bo Peep, things start to get a bit chaotic with how the plot is structured and there didn't feel like there was really any stakes to the story at all. The ""Toy Rules"" are really loose here and it takes alot of suspension of disbelief to see toys running around a carnival with no people caring about it at all. The antagonists themselves have good character moments and Duke Kaboom is probably the best new character in Toy Story 4. Bonnie herself is a bit of a bland toy owner compared to Andy, but thankfully she doesn't get too much time just spent on her alone. There are decent emotional parts throughout the movie that worked and I mostly like how it all concludes, but it makes me question if Pixar are going to be milking more Toy Story movies by this point. The animation is top notch as usual, as well as the voice acting from the main cast and all the new characters too.Overall, Toy Story 4 is fine and not the worst outcome by a long shot, but it's also nothing amazing either. Honestly, I don't think there's anywhere else for these movies to go by this point.

Real Story 4,"From the simple life of a kids toys to the complex life as an adult, Toy Story has become a Real Story.
I have grown up with Toy Story and feel like it's story has followed me thru my life experiences. The fourth installment is the end that no one needed, but an end that leads to new beginnings. The movie starts off narratively slow and takes a long time to build. It's not a funny movie and certainly isn't just a kids movie, this movie is for we adults who were kids when Toy Story began. Little kids may find it complex and hard to understand an enjoy, but as an adult it's message of scary and unexpected new beginnings hits home all to real. I find the characters were at times distant from their traditional roles and in a way the screenplay is not well crafted, but it's message of moving on is really real and it's hidden message of understanding your enemy and not ultimately seeking their destruction is refreshing and one I hope kids watching understand.
I hope this is the last Toy Story movie, not because I want the story to end or because the series has gotten bad, but because I want new stories to begin. I want to keep Toy Story as a simple Toy Story, I don't want the characters or message to grow up. Toy Story is a timeless, pioneering and brilliant story that lives in everyone, but the simple brilliance of the story is that it is akin to a time when your life is simple and going any further risks fans loosing that simple recognition that it's characters were to us. This movie was good, this movie inspires deep emotions, but this move was not great entertainment and could have been much better if it was more simple, more of a Toy Story, than a Real Story.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just as good as the previous. Every Toy Story is amazing.,"Watching the Toy Story Series is such a fun and joyful experience, especially when watching with people you love being around. This movie brings so much happiness, excitement and amazement I can't get enough. The animation graphic is done so perfectly, so smooth and has consistently stayed incredible since the first ever Toy Story. The story is always good, the toys are so cool to watch, the dialogue is brilliant and its just an overall 10/10 movie, the best family animation movie you could watch that has held its top tier status since release now.I really loved this movie and there were many funny parts and I have watched it about 6 times now because of how good it is.

Unnecessary and undoes Toy Story 3 - otherwise enjoyable.,"As always, fantastic execution from Pixar, but this does feel like a cash grab a bit. Part 3 was the perfect ending. So why this one?The idea is that toys are in service of children. They are ""God"". Their imagination is what brings them life.Woody went from a character who knew the value of working in service of something greater than himself (Toy Story 1-3) to being completely self-centered (Toy Story 4). Not a bad film, but totally unnecessary. It undoes everything Toy Story 3 did.TS3 was the gang saying goodbye. It was about leaving childhood and moving on from one stage of life to another. This one was about needing a romantic relationship to feel fulfilled. It didn't make sense for Woody as a character.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Does NOT compare to the first 3 films,"Toy Story has become an integral part of our lives. It reels us all back into childhood and keeps our innocence alive. Toy Story has had the privilege of taking us all on that journey. Sadly, Toy Story 4 has brought our childlike innocence to a screeching halt.Although, it really goes without saying, the toys should have never been given away to Bonnie. To keep the nostalgia alive, in Toy Story 3, Andy could have kept his toys in the attic. The ending could have shown glimpses of Andy getting married and having children. The ending of part 3 could have very easily been bittersweet to see Andy's toys given to his own children and Woody and Buzz's legacy of faithfulness to Andy's children continue.Toy Story 4 felt like a slap in the face to not only all the fans of Toy Story, but the hope that this film brought with it. The main charachter really focuses on solely Woody, which becomes apparent by the end of the film. In no way is this taking away from the laughs the film brought, because it is quite amusing. The plot felt scattered and pointless. As an adult whom had favorite toys saved in the attic for the my children,Toy Story 4 was a huge disappointment. ""Gabby Gabby's"" character felt quite selfish. In leaving Woody in the condition that they left him in didn't feel selfless; it felt robbed of his loyalty. Although the stuffed bunny and chick were funny, their characters felt like Pixar was looking for ways to find laughs. Finding ""Bo Peep"" as a conclusion to the story was not a good enough reason to create Toy Story 4.A sad misstep in Toy Story's legacy. Having mixed reviews from the audience in Toy Story 4 after a long love from the inception is just saddening.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Movie of the year so far!,"Toy Story 4 is directed by Josh Cooley, you may recognize him from Inside Out, he was one of the writers, and it's his first full length feature movie. Writing Credits: John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Josh Cooley, Valerie LaPointe, Rashida Jones, Will McCormack, Martin Hynes, Stephany Folsom.. (original story), Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom.. (screenplay).
And starring: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts and Joan Cusack, besides some new members like Tony Hale as Forky, Keegan-Michael Key as Ducky, Jordan Peele as Bunny, Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom and Christina Hendricks as Gabby Gabby.Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) has always been confident about his place in the world, and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that's Andy or Bonnie. So when Bonnie's beloved new craft-project-turned-toy, Forky (voice of Tony Hale), declares himself as ""trash"" and not a toy, Woody takes it upon himself to show Forky why he should embrace being a toy. But when Bonnie takes the whole gang on her family's road trip excursion, Woody ends up on an unexpected detour that includes a reunion with his long-lost friend Bo Peep (voice of Annie Potts). After years of being on her own, Bo's adventurous spirit and life on the road belie her delicate porcelain exterior. As Woody and Bo realize they're worlds apart when it comes to life as a toy, they soon come to find that's the least of their worries.I'm a huge fan of the Toy Story saga, I loved all the predecessors, I think Toy Story 3 is one of the best movies of all time, and the first Toy Story movie is one of the best comedies of all time.. also Toy Story 2 -as lots of people agreed, myself included- is one of the best sequels of all time!
I thought TS3 has the best conclusion to this amazing saga, and I didn't expect a TS4 at all, and when they announced it, I had no clue how this movie will go after the amazing emotional conclusion we had in TS3... Untill the trailer that I really loved, but I also THOUGHT that it showed too much, why did I say it like that? 'Cause I was wrong, and everyone who thinks that the trailer showed too much, I respect your opinion, but it didn't.. at all!
I don't wanna spoil anything until everyone gets to see this masterpiece in theaters, but I'd say that the trailer misguided us, in a perfect way, don't get me wrong.Okay, where do I start?... Let's start with how people was truly trashing this movie, before even the trailer! I mean I understand that people were afraid, but at least give it a chance.. I guess now they would, because the movie got some pretty serious amazing reviews everywhere.. and I'm so happy, cause this movie is a blast, I was totally blown away of how well-made this movie is! From the cinematography to the funny scenes, to the score, the animation, the new crew, characters -old and new-, the emotional beats to the conclusion, maybe.. we still don't know if it's the last or not, but they gonna make it as wonderful as the saga is, go on, I'm in!!Let's talk about the cinematography, it's Josh Cooley's very first full feature movie, and I was concerned a little bit, because John Lasseter did an amazing job with the first two, and Lee Unkrich was magnificent also, he did a fascinating job with the third one. So did Josh Cooley with TS4, every scene was just beautifully directed, with a great animation... Actually, TS4 has the best animation of ALL TIME, Pixar really did an amazing job with this saga, from the very first CGI animated movie, to a very great improvement, to the best of the recent time, until TS4.. the best so far.... It never was that realistic before, even Incredibles 2 wasn't that amazing.. this is the animation of the decade, every shot felt SO REAL!!!!The score was amazing.. again! As a comedy, this movie made me cry from laughing like 3 or 4 times, and all the rest of the movie was really funny too!
People were actually asking if they have to bring some tissues with them, I'd say.. yeah, bring a lot, cause my theater was wiping, I lost it even more than I did in TS3.. it has a very good emotional conclusion and I loved it!
The plot, is really cool, no spoilers, it's just.. surprising.. go with no mentality and have fun with it, cause whenever you feel like it's another episodic Toy Story movie -as the trailer showed us- the movie won't stop surprising you!The new members were really great.. Bunny and Ducky are really funny, Forky, the one that I was really thinking that he's going to annoy me, he was great, really sweet and cute, and of course adds a lot to the movie. Duke Caboom is amazing, it's a great role for Keanu Reeves, there's a story behind him, I felt it was unnecessary, but it helps the movie somehow.As flaws, finally.. in this year, I found none.. this is a perfect flawless movie, the one and only so far that really deserves the highest grade, best movie of the year so far, but I don't think that something is gonna surpass it actually, to be honest.Toy Story 4 is NOT just another Toy Story movie, it has a great message to EVERYONE, so emotional, funny and beautifully animated and directed, Toy Story 4 of course gets an A+!Alright, guys.. thank you for reading my review, look forward to more reviews really soon, especially the Toy Story saga reviews which is really soon...

Review - Toy Story 4,"Pixar doesn't seem to lack ideas when giving a moral to their stories, but with Toy Story 4, they have a problem with the plot.

I promised myself I wouldn't cry at this one I failed,I first watched Toy Story as a kid growing up in the 90s and loved it along with its sequel Toy Story 2 I then grew up and when I saw Toy Story 3 as a grown adult I was in tears at the ending and honestly didn't expect to be age 32 taking my 5 year old daughter to see Toy Story 4 and enjoy the movie as much as she did if not more it really made me feel nostalgic and I really bonded with my daughter over a movie franchise from my childhood and is now a huge part of hers.The story takes place after Toy Story 3 with Woody Buzz and the gang now Bonies toys and are all being played with except for Woody who always gets left in the closet soon enough Bonie starts school and is shy quiet and not very confident but Woody follows her to school and watches over her while at school Bonie makes herself a new toy out of trash and names him forky her new best friend and favourite toy but Forky doesn't want to be a toy he's made out of trash and is convinced is purpose is to be trash inside a garbage bin not as a toy Woody sees how attached Bonie is to Forky and how important he is to her during her big school transition and tries his best to keep Forky from throwing himself away and keep him close to Bonie but it becomes harder than he thinks especially when the family decide to take a road trip in an rv and forky is kidnapped by a broken toy in a second hand store but its there Woody finds and old friend to help him rescue Forky and get him back to Bonie before they are both left behind forever.Toy Story 4 is smart funny teaches kids important values and too love and appreciate there toys and people most movies that are made for kids parent's just have to suffer through but Toy Story is now part of most grown ups childhoods and being able to go back to your childhood a bit and enjoy a fantastic movie that you and your children can enjoy is priceless.The quality of the Toy Story movies has not declined at all and is perfect for any age group so if you haven't already seen this movie give it a watch you will love it alone or as a family.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good family film but an obvious cash grab,"First of all, as I was leaving the theatre and was thinking about how great the movie was and I realized one thing that at certain points in the film it seemed rushed. At the beginning of the film, it felt fine and then more towards the middle of the film it started to feel rushed a bit. Like in one scene they would be doing something and then would just transition to something for a bit and then to something new. The movie is one-hour and forty-minutes and I think a longer run time could have helped out a lot. I really liked some of the new characters. They all were really funny but at the same time just seemed like ways so they could get more money with the new characters and could make more movies with them. With the old characters, I actually liked what they did with Woody and how he helped show the message of this film. From what I could tell the message is that sometimes you have to change in order to be happy or everybody doesn't just have one purpose but multiple or something like that? The animation in this film is amazing but I do wish that they kept it close to the original animation style but like I said the animation is still spectacular. I love the score composed by Randy Newman. In the end, Toy Story 4 is a good film but also feels like a cash grab film at the same time. Check it out if you grew up with the original three or just want to see a fun animated family film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The childhood memories we had built up with the plot culminated into a fantastic point of moving on and letting go to the franchise.I'd recommend not watching it if you loved the Toy Story 3 ending.

Never was never will. Toys story - unbelievable saga.,"I was very disappointed when have knew that 3rd part of Toys story will not the last one. It's impossibly to make a new part of adventure, new story of sensitive love between kids and toys. But, oh my gosh, they can do impossible possible! New characters so cute and funny, old characters are so known and loving, new babies are so unprotected without toys. This story is a story of Pixar. Old boys step back, new boys have received all the best from old boys and make new level of art. After this 4-th part, I believe, we will see a 5-th or series. Series about gold time after Woodie, Buzz and new friends returns from airport to have unbelievably times with Andy.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I'm so glad they made this movie,"Like so many other kids, I grew up with the Toy Story movies. The first Toy Story is probably one of the films I've seen the most, simply because I used to play it endlessly on repeat on VHS when I was a kid. For me, the first three Toy Story movies are pretty much perfect, or at least as perfect as I would ever want those movies to be. So naturally, I was pretty nervous when I heard that they had decided to make another one. But I'm really glad they did because Toy Story 4 is a blast. Where Toy Story 3 was a very satisfying conclusion to the story since Andy grows up and goes to college, I was surprised to see the direction they went with in this one. Toy Story 4 is Woody's movie and it's a satisfying conclusion to his character, since this movie is pretty much about him growing up and finding his new place in the world.First of all, the animation is just brilliant. The opening scene involves nighttime and rain and it just looks amazing, very much real. The animation is easily the best part about the film and the animators definitely deserve a very big shutout. I actually found the opening scene to be surprisingly emotional. And during the opening theme, I liked how it's a little recap of the evolution in going from Andy in the first movie, to Andy going to college and leaving the toys with Bonnie. It really emphasizes how, in Woody's perspective, a toy's purpose is to make a kid happy and the beautiful memories that come with the experiences with them.In good Toy Story fashion, in this movie we get a bunch of new characters, all of which are great, but let's talk about Forky first. Forky is one of those characters that could potentially be super annoying if overused. Luckily, he is used very well in the movie and I liked his role in the film very much. The duck and the bunny played by Key and Peele are funny, but I do think they overstay their welcome a bit. The ventriloquist dolls are creepy and Gabby Gabby was a pretty good sympathetic villain as well. In my opinion, the best new addition was the Canadian stunt toy Duke Caboom, I thought he was awesome, by far my favorite new character in the film.I thought Bo Peep was awesome here, as well. They made her this strong, independent woman who can handle herself quite well in troubled situations, and I really liked how they handled that, it didn't feel forced at all and it didn't feel like the creators were trying to push feminism for the sake of feminism (looking at you Captain Marvel).In my opinion there are some minor flaws with the film, namely pacing during the second act, I thought it got a little slow and I think the movie could have benefited from being a little bit shorter (maybe 5-10 min reduction). And while the Toy Story movies have always been about toys solving problems in a really clever manner, in this one I do think it gets to the point of being a little bit absurd. I mean, instead of solving one big problem, it's like they jump between many different little problems and I think it hurt the focus of the film a little bit.That being said, the ending was so good, my eyes got watery and although I didn't cry, my inner child definitely did. It was beautiful, and while this is definitely my least favorite Toy Story movie, that really doesn't say much, since all of the movies in this franchise are excellent. I am really glad they made this movie and if they decide to make this the final movie in the franchise I would be perfectly fine with that, since I think this is a really good conclusion. I said that at the end of Toy Story 3 as well, but here's a bonus. If they do decide to make another one, I will happily pay to watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wow.,This movie has so much heart and it really does a good job of making the viewer be invested in every character. It is so damn funny and tear jerking at the same time. All the characters have an ark that is really well written. The animation is the best I've literally ever seen in a movie.

"Unnecessary sequel, but quite good!","Let me be honest from the start. This was an excellent movie, just not quite as good as its predecessors.My main issue is not with some particular aspect of the movie itself. It is more that I feel this sequel was not needed. Toy Story 3 had the most perfect ending they could have given the franchise. For those of us who grew up with the original movie in 1995, watching Andy grow up alongside ourselves and then passing Woody and the gang to another child, hit a deep emotional chord.This sequel's ending was rather emotional too, it simply didn't reach the height of the previous movie. Everything was in place, the humor, the characters, the animation, they were all on point. I just couldn't help feeling that what I was seeing had no real reason to happen..To make a long story short, this was a very good movie and a decent addition to the franchise. I simply felt that producing a sequel, somewhat diminishes the emotional impact of the 3rd movie's perfect ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not a bad movie...,I think the animation was the best yet... but the story could have been better... definitely the weakest of the four Toy Story movies...,,Anonymous,Animation
Weakest of the lot.,"Unfortunately the quality of the script is nowhere near the quality and tightness of the first 3 Toy Stories. Not counting the look and animation, the ideas weren't as creative and the execution only average.For example, the way the toys got the RV to turn back was completely unrealistic. Really takes you out of the movie when implausible things happen. Toys pretending to be GPS navigation, and the humans actually falling for it? Sorry but that's ridiculous.The writers were lazy or just not the good writers this time. They forced a series of unlikely events towards the end. The timing of those events needing to chain together to form a massive coincidental outcome.Obviously some scenes are enjoyable, but there's an X-factor missing that was present in the previous movies.Not sure if the direction was the issue, or screenplay or what. But from the very opening scene, things just seemed muddled, not as poetic. Perhaps it suffered from design-by-committee.The background music with emotional strings were pushed too hard. Very formula-driven, no creative rule-breaking. Just a ""safe"" movie in stark contrast to the engaging and original narratives of the previous movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney trashed Toy Story's legacy with this,"There are so many things wrong with Toy Story 4.Primarily it ruins character consistency with the rest of the Toy Story movies, and then stomps on the themes and messaging of the first three, and not for the better. In addition to that, there are some scary and creepy bits that might upset kids.They have a new character which seems to be suffering severe depression and behaves in a way that's extremely concerning. It just feels completely wrong for this kids film to take such a dark turn.However by far the worst part is it's emasculation of Woody by the female characters. It's almost as if they set out to do this - as it's so blatant - and in doing so, ruin the messaging of the first three movies. It feels deeply unsatisfying as you feel that the evil characters end up winning.Toy Story 4 is a perfect case of an unnecessary sequel done for money, less interested in telling a story, and more concerned with pushing an agenda.That said, it is really well animated.You might want to get your kids the DVDs of the first three movies, but you'll deliberately want to skip this one as if it doesn't exist.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Ts4 - belonging, purpose, loyalty & moving on","Pixar animated family friendly adventure, you'll notice the quality of Pixar animation has really stepped up a gear in recent years.This instalment is all about the toys with familiar much loved characters such as Woody and Buzz, and some excellent new characters such as Duke Caboom and Forky.As normal, there are plenty of wholesome moral messages about belonging, purpose, loyalty and moving on, all written with humour to be digestible for both the kids and adults in the audience. Some scary scenes involving stylised butler puppets and emotional scenes toward the end.Stay in your seats for some equally hilarious post credit scenes. Very highly recommended (an easy maximum score).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not needed but still a great movie.,"I am among the people who were very skeptical about Pixar making a fourth Toy Story movie after the powerful ending of the third movie, but I went to the theater to see it for myself.And may I say, for a sequel we may not have needed, I still enjoyed it to the fullest because of how they made another aspect of toys come to life. I'm talking about the emotionally and physically damaged doll, Gabby Gabby whose wants and needs are fully understandable.Her story is the most touching here and even though her sidekicks can be scary as hell it's worth paying attention every time she is on screen. But not her alone, because we get closure with Bo Peep very early on who wasn't in the third movie at all. She is awesome and entertaining and tough and all that stuff. In my opinion, ther is still room for more in this franchise, not a movie, but a TV-series about Bo Peep could be awesome.So many memorable characters and yet another emotionally charged story only Toy Story is capable of making. TS4 may seem like an odd choice after the seemingly definite ending from the third movie, but this ending is another one of that kind.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A+ Pixar keeps maintaining the momentum for their most successful franchise,"I laughed. I cried. I was so surprised about how necessary this installment was. I love all these films equally. They have been an essential part of my childhood and continue to resonate with me even as an adult. So many people contributed to the screen story of this installment, but mainly Andrew Stanton served as a co-writer and Josh Cooley gave us his directorial debut by amplifying the dignity of these characters, who for a long time, despite their inanimate entity, had something definitely human to say.
The last 5 minutes of this film is just pure poignancy and a poetic love letter to the 24 year old saga.

Terrible ending,"As much as I love the Toy Story universe, this one is that bad, that I would wish to not remember watching it at all.The film did make incorporate a lot of nostalgic elements and over-the-top jokes that you would be sure to have a laugh and smile a bit.But the plot itself is incoherent and not a bit faithful to the trilogy. It forcefully introduces a scene that has never been mentioned at all in the previous Toy Story films, and it drives the entire plot onwards. The ending was also abrupt, and the friendship and romantic buildup in the past 3 films seems completely ruined just within a few minutes at the end.The ending was abrupt also because I felt like the story was supposed to continue while it suddenly came to an end. There were so, so many questions left unanswered that even should Pixar make another sequel, it will never be able to address all of them.The message of spreading individualism and feminist-esque hints throughout the film seems to be screaming out too much at points in the film.The individualist aspect also defeats the values of the ""Toys"", precisely every admirable act by Woody in the past seems to be meaningless and ""wrong"", simply he was not thinking for himself.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Final Goodbye We Didn't Know We Needed,"Toy Story 3 wrapped up Pixar's signature saga on such a pitch-perfect note that the decision to follow it up with another instalment made no sense at all. Nobody asked for this sequel. Nobody wanted it. And nobody was looking forward to it. However, if there is one thing that this animation studio has done too many times over the years and more consistently than any other studio on the planet, it is to defy the odds, exceed every expectation & set all-new industry benchmarks in the process. And with their latest feature, Pixar has done it yet again.Proving us wrong & putting our fears to rest by delivering an impeccable blend of high-quality storytelling & jaw-dropping animation, Toy Story 4 doesn't dent an already perfect saga. Instead, this latest entry enriches it by embracing everything that made its predecessors so great. The story is immaculate, characters are vibrant & compelling, themes are addressed with care & compassion, animation is breathtaking, and the film as a whole brims with a genuine sense of heart, warmth, tenderness & finality.

Current views,"Despite what you might think about my rating, I was pleasantly surprised by toy story 4's quality; it was fun, emotional and a nice look in to woody's character. Problem is I still think this film doesn't need to exist.
I don't know I feel like the idea of an owner growing out of a toy was already done in 3, maybe even 2. We already know that bonnie's gonna get old of the toys eventually so why show it?
Another thing that annoyed me was forky, the trailers and the former half of this film lead me to believe that the character is unique and a pessimist, but that is abandoned 5 seconds after the group are separated and he just becomes a plot device after that.

Surprisingly great,"When Toy Story 4 was announced, I became quite skeptical. I thought Toy Story 3 had a perfect ending and sendoff to the characters we've grown to love over the years. So initially I was scared. However, I'm happy to say that Pixar have proved once again why they are one of the best animation studios working today.From beginning to end, this movie was a blast. I had so much fun throughout its entirety. Let's start off with the animation. The animation in this film is downright gorgeous. The colours and textures of everything make the film look very photorealistic. It's safe to say Pixar has excelled in that department. This movie is directed by debutant Josh Cooley. What a debut! His style of direction is impressive especially for a debut. There are so many clever shots utilised especially during scenes that involve a lot of action.The new characters in the movie are great. Ducky and Bunny, voiced by Key & Peele, are hilarious and a lot of their jokes land. Keanu Reeves voices a character named Duke Caboom who is also entertaining. The main story revolves around the new character Forky who could have been annoying but Pixar made the character more likeable which worked out. It felt so nostalgic seeing Bo Peep once again. I was a bit worried Pixar might change the character to act in a certain way but thankfully that wasn't the case.The only issue I have with the film is that other supporting characters from the previous films don't have much of a role in this film since the story mainly focuses on Woody, Forky and Bo Peep.Despite that one negative, this film is awesome. It felt really nice seeing these beloved characters on the big screen once again. The story, animation, screenplay and direction were all superb. There are some great lessons about friendship, change and importance that can be learnt by both children and adults alike. Even though Toy Story 4 is unnecessary, it still is a fantastic installment in the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic,"Let me just begin by saying that, yes, this movie is ""not needed"" in a way, toy story 3 ended perfectly and this continuation sometimes does not feel granted. But it does not take the fact that it is fantastic, and different from 3 that does sometimes copy 2, it presents a newer structure and a new theme for this franchise, ending in a great way that could have been given a little bit more time so than it could reach those emotional heights from the 3rd movie, but it is great",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"For me, it's an 'Alternate Conclusion'","Toy Story 4 may probably the most unnecessary sequel ever made but it's far from the worst. If anything, it could easily be the strongest fourth instalment of any film series out there. We all saw Toy Story 3 in 2010: we all agreed it was the perfect conclusion to Disney-PIXAR's super-series of films, and they made a fourth film anyway. Why did they do it? Money, of course: but it doesn't feel like it's the ONLY driving force for the movie. Toy Story 4 decided to 're-conclude' the story by focusing on Woody and how he's grown as the watchful protector of Andy's toys. And for me I think this sequel doesn't have to be seen as canon to all Toy Story fans: it's an extension of Toy Story 3's ending that can be interpreted as an alternate timeline.Toy Story 4 was kind of predicted by jokes after Toy Story 3's release: and considering Toy Story 4 got 'Robot Chicken'-ed before the actual movie even came out, it's funny that the sequel wasn't as shallow as everyone predicted it would be. With that said, I still stand firmly by my interpretation of Toy Story 4 as an 'alternate epilogue' to the series.If you want Toy Story 3 to still be the conclusion of the series, that's more than fine. If you wanted more, well, Toy Story 4 serves that purpose just fine.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I hope this franchise never ends. Brilliant!,"""I was made to help a child, I don't remember it being this hard."" Woody (Tom Hanks voice)Joy, sorrow, laughter, tears, love, and loyalty-those words may describe Casablanca, but right now I'm thinking Toy Story 4. Who would have thought an animation could compete with that classic romance? Who would have thought one animated frame could show more humanity than those in all the summer blockbusters? Who would have thought after the triumph of 3 that 4 would be just as good?Pixar and director John Cooley (a Pixar operative with his directorial debut), together with writers Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom, have crafted yet another brilliant story of little people overcoming the crush of cretinous big people to save their pleasant roles as support for kids and strengthen their bonds as buddies. No better example than cowboy Woody and astronaut Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), whose initial Toy Story 1 dislike for each other has grown to a lively mature friendship three iterations later.Woody's growth is the heart of an uproarious adventure with the lovely Bo Peep (Annie Potts), who is the best strong female to occupy the screen in a long time. The two are sweet on each other but subsume that affection to the tasks of saving kids and toys from disconnection.Moreover, they have to deal with a new character, Forky (Tony Hale), a beautiful piece of trash with pipe-stem arms and disproportionate eyes, who forces friendship decisions and affections that help determine the maturity of lead characters. In addition, the carnival setting with a carousel and second-hand antique shop among other props helps to mix the joy of toydom and the danger of a rambunctious world without rules.And so it goes, turning not so much this time on finding home as finding love. Every family member should fully appreciate the humanity of that arc and listen to its abundant life lessons..You know Avenger's: Endgame is a change agent for a successful franchise. Don't miss the summer's even better revolution: Toy Story 4. I hope Pixar itself doesn't change this monumental animation by ending it.""Some kids play rougher than others.""

A Great End To Woody And His Pals Journey! 8/10,"Review:
What a great movie! The animation was on point, along with the storyline and the various characters, who all brought an emotional and amusing tone to the film. The plot goes from strength to strength, as we follow Woody and his pals on an epic journey to get Forky to his true owner, and with the additional characters like Gabby Gabby and Duke Caboom, who cracked me up, I was glued to the screen from the start. There is enough material to keep adults and kids entertained, and the simple but detailed storyline has proved that Pixar is the kings of animation. We all fell in love with the Toy Story characters after the first movie, but the 2nd and 3rd films in the franchise, didn't do as well, and when it was announced that this was the last rodeo for Woody, I didn't know what to expect. Now that I've seen the film, I'm extremely happy with the direction that they took characters, and I highly recommend it to all movie-goers. The film is set nine years earlier, following the events of Toy Story 2, were Bo Peep and Woody attempt to rescue RC, Andy's remote-controlled car, from a rainstorm. Just as they finish the rescue, Woody watches as Bo is donated to a new owner, and considers going with her, but ultimately decides to remain with Andy. Years later, a teenage Andy donates them to Bonnie, a younger child, before he goes off to college. While the toys are grateful to have a new child, Woody struggles to adapt to a new environment, where he is not the favourite as he was with Andy. On the day of Bonnie's kindergarten orientation, Woody worries over her and sneaks into her backpack. After a classmate takes away Bonnie's arts and crafts supplies, Woody covertly recovers the materials and various pieces of garbage from the trash, including a plastic fork. Bonnies uses these to create a bipedal fork with googly eyes, whom she calls Forky. Forky comes to life in Bonnie's backpack and begins to experience an existential crisis, thinking he is garbage rather than a toy and wishing to remain in a trash can, which is absolutely hilarious. As Forky becomes Bonnie's favourite toy, Woody takes it upon himself to prevent Forky from throwing himself away. When Bonnie's family goes on a road trip, Forky jumps out of the RV window and Woody pursues him. After Woody explains how important he is to Bonnie, Forky decides to accompany Woody and return to her. Near the RV park where Bonnie's family is staying, Woody spots Bo Peep's lamp in an antique store window and goes in, hoping to find her. Inside, he and Forky encounter a talking doll called Gabby Gabby, who desires Woody's voice box to replace her broken one. While Woody is able to escape, Gabby captures Forky. At a playground, Woody is reunited with Bo Peep and her sheep, who now live as ""lost toys"" that aren't dedicated to one child. Bo agrees to help Woody save Forky and get back to Bonnie. I won't go into the outcome because I don't want to spoil it for those people who haven't seen it. With the introduction of some new characters to help Woody to save Forky (Tony Hale), who include Ducky (Keegan-Michael Key), Bunny (Jordan Peele), Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves) and Giggle McDimples (Ally Maki), the writers covered every aspect, right to the very end. Like most Pixar movies, the animation is supreme quality, and I really couldn't find a fault. In my eyes, it is a must-see for all ages, especially if you're a fan of any of the previous Toy Story films. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Josh Cooley, who also brought you George and A.J. and Riley's First Date, which were unheard of. For his first project, he had a massive task on his hands to put this franchise to bed. Luckily, he did a better job than the previous directors of the 2nd and 3rd movies, which were made by Pixar creator John Lasseter and Lee Unkrich. In terms of money, Toy Story made $407million, Toy Story 2 made $509million and Toy Story 3 made $1.06billion, which makes this film the highest-grossing in the franchise to date, and that's before it is released to buy. I just hope the next movie's from Pixar, Onward & Soul, live up to there expectations.Budget: $200million

Another great Toy Story movie,Like a lot of people I was a little apprehensive about Toy Story 4. The first three movies were fantastic and managed to build on the previous stories whilst being breathtaking in their own right. The third movie seemed to be the perfect end to the story. Another movie smacked a little of an easy cash cow. Whilst it's hard to get way from this there's no doubt that this is a fine movie.The movie starts with a flashback to the days when Andy was still young and we find out the fate of Beau Peep which I can't recall being included in the original movies. We then get into the story of how the toys are fairing with Bonnie who received the toys from Andy at the end of Toy Story 3.Whilst the movie never quite scales the heights of the original 3 movies it's still a great ride.

Surprising and Beautiful,"Once again, Toy Story has succeeded at making me cry. Man, oh, man, is this another good one.

There aren't many movies like it, these days. What a blessing of nostalgia and beauty. There was so much heart and care put into this movie.And the ending tore my heart out, again.

There's A Snake In My Boots,"I think like everyone who loved the first three Toy Story movies, I was nervous about this one. I really don't want these movies to ever suck.

I remember making characters like this and losing them all the time. I wouldn't be surprised if they ran away like Forky.Then Forky gets kidnapped and Woody and Bo Beep has to go save him from Gabby Gabby and those scary dolls.The problem is so many characters get sidelined in this one. I get it, it's about Woody and Bo Peep, but not even Buzz Lightyear gets much screen time.However, I did like the development of these movies. This movie is essentially about growing up. It uses a dark tone because growing up is a dark world. I like that, but all and all, I think Toy Story should be done now. Something tells me it isn't, and the series will start to go downhill.

It's The Best Weak Squash...,"As a child, Toy Story was something I would love and savour. Woody was a hero, one of the protagonists of my childhood; not to mention Buzz.Toy Story 4 is a visual marvel, no doubt. The lighting and textures are GORGEOUS, and the sound design is similarly spectacular. The story is what knocks this down a few tiers.The thing is, this movie is pointless. The story is easily the weakest, far weaker than the rest of the three masterpieces, and the themes of the film, namely what it means to be a toy, aren't explored creatively enough or thoroughly enough to merit anything else than a brief sense of sorrow.It's lost potential. You don't see much of the characters from the prequels , and the ones that appear the most (Woody and Buzz) seem like they were written by people who don't really know the characters, diluted into much less soulful characters than they once were.That being said, there are moments of comedy and moments of sadness. Toy Story 4 is certainly not bad, as I found the comedy to be some of the best of the four films in the series.Undoubtedly, Toy Story 4 is a film worth watching, but the diluted nature of both the plot and characters warrants only a 7 to the prequels scores of 9, 9 and 10 respectively.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Im 32 now but when the first one came out in 1995 I was 6 years old and went with my mum to see it and it was breathtaking as I remember just the idea of my toys coming to life was amazing and I then used to think that's what they did when I wasn't there. Then the 2nd one came out when I was 9 and I still loved toys and loved the idea of getting new ones to join my old ones. Then the third one came out when I was 21 when I was in university and I could relate to Andy as I had done before. I had went away and left all my old toys at home.Now the 4th one I have seen at age 32 and I have just become a dad myself now. I see my son playing with toys and me playing with him reminds me of Bonnie with her toys. He, like Bonnie, makes toys out of everyday objects but he still loves them all the same.

I'm glad they made this.,"I thought that the third one was an impeccable swansong that wrapped up the saga in a nice little bow.This latest entry makes the story a cool trilogy plus one more rather than a solid tetralogy but that doesn't mean it didn't justify its own existence.Furthering the series' main them of lost purpose and obsolescence, they hit the ground running with yet ANOTHER scene that had me tearing up. The main plot shows a very believable new problem for Woody as he (rather admirably) adjusts to a new home and a new pecking order.There's something rather heart rending in watching Woody do what he clearly thinks is the right thing but also obliquely expose his own fears and insecurities. Despite having undergone three movies' worth of character development already, they really brought it with both the physical and internal conflict propelling the movie in an intelligent way as two estranged friends reunite and respond to the opposite life choices the other has made.The antagonist is fresh and distinctive and also provides complex motivations and grey morality in a way which completely enriches the movie. There are also strangely erotic undertones between them and another new character (not that I'm complaining).This truly is a story about Woody. They do try to give all the old favourites the screen time they deserve but the truth is their character arc is over. Jessie provides some logistical support and Buzz some comic relief with a running gag.All the humour and perfectly executed set pieces are there. I can't think of more to say about them.There is a moment...I don't want to spoil it but the sense of restrained dread it creates is powerful. In this one sentence the writers of this showed more talent than so many horror movie writers do in their careers. I do love a good horror but they totally get that balance between heavy handed and too subtle. You'll know the moment when you see it.I felt this was a convincing and heartfelt effort to further the series in a way that enriched it. It is not a cash in sequel, although it is not the masterpiece that the third movie was, it is still a sincere depiction of the conflict between enduring love and our desire to be loved that, if you commit to watching on its own terms, will provide you with the finale to the series that will leave you more than satisfied.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Same Pixar Fun, Now With Heavy-Handed Disney Life Lessons","So, now we see how the Disney of its early days became the boring, heavy-handed Disney of my childhood. No matter how many people lauded Disney's movies for being wonderful children's movies when I was a kid, all I saw was boring. And, I actually loved the earliest (1940's and earlier) Disney cartoons.In Toy Story 4, you see glints of the fun, interesting Pixar of old, but you're constantly bombarded with boring storyline that doesn't seem to go anywhere. Only in the end do you see the overall plot and Disney's life lesson that took an entire movie storyline to communicate: in this case, it's that everyone learns to let go.In Toy Story 3, we saw the sad end of the path everyone travels from childhood into adulthood. I cried and my heart ached at the inevitable separation we experience as we all become adults, as seen through the eyes of the child's toys we had all grown to love since Toy Story 1. Inevitably, we all leave our childhood playthings behind.Toy Story 4, if you watch it through to the end, extends that story to the toys like Woody and Bo Peep, showing them also grow in that way, leaving behind what they always clung to, what they always used to justify their existence. And, interestingly, Bo's character has grown into a strong, modern female character because of that, implying nobody, especially women, needs to cling to another person (man or woman) to justify their existence and give them purpose. It's a great message.But, what you end up with is, overall, BORING. Never, ever, in the past have I ever started to fall asleep during a pure Pixar movie. I did during Toy Story 4, several times. My daughter just wasn't captivated by this movie, not enough to watch it more than once, and I doubt she seriously put together all the pieces to get that message as I stated above. There were a half dozen good parts of the movie, but it was mostly just DULL -- like the Disney movies I grew up with that I generally didn't care to watch.So, if you deliver a good message that requires you to watch the entire movie, not missing parts of it, putting all the pieces together in the end, have you accomplished anything worthwhile when nobody will stick around to the end? The Pixar of old entertained kids and adults together, in different, refreshing ways, and delivered good messages at the same time.Toy Story 4 just shows that the Pixar revolution has, in fact, been fully absorbed into Disney's fun-destroying movie distortion field. I would not be a bit surprised if the next Pixar project is a Care Bears reboot movie...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Worthy Addition to the Franchise,"Like many movie lovers who grew up in the 1990s, Toy Story was one of the staples of childhood when it came to watching films. After the release of Toy Story 2 in 1999, many believed the franchise had ended, until a third film came along over ten years later. Really putting a capper on the Toy Story story as fans knew it from the beginning, Toy Story 3 was a definitive conclusion. So why was a third instalment even in the works? Until the release of the movie, that was the question on many viewers' minds. Personally, upon the initial announcement a few years back, I was against this movie, but I've loved these films since the beginning, so of course, I was going to check this one out, and I'm glad that I did. Toy Story 4 has earned a worthy place in the franchise in my eyes.Picking up pretty soon after the events of the third film, we now see how our favourite, loveable toys have moved on from their previous owner (Andy) and how they've settled in with their new one in Bonnie. Without getting into the specifics of how or why a new toy (Forky) is introduced, I'll just simply state that Bonnie builds him at school and he miraculously comes to life, giving Woody a new job, so to speak. The plot really kicks into gear, However, when Forky is thrust onto the street during a family vacation, and the Woody/Forky excursion begins. Each toy has a moment to shine, but this truly is a film about Woody.I could immediately dive into negatives and say that Buzz Lightyear doesn't have enough screen time or that reference and lines of dialogue from previous movies are slightly repeated too much throughout the duration of the movie, but that would just be me complaining about an otherwise near-perfect animated film. I had nitpicks here and there while watching the movie, but I just have to be honest and say the overall movie surrounding those inner quarrels were just scratches on a canvas that was painted beautifully as a whole.As always, the animation is astounding and life-like at times, which feels a little funny when comparing it to how simple the animation was in the original film, so the movie was beautiful to look at. On top of that, this is a film filled with heart, that cares about its characters, and even takes the time to introduce many new, memorable faces along the way. From Ducky and Bunny to Duke Caboom, these new characters will actually remain in my mind as memorable side characters, which is what many sequels fail to do these days.In the end, fans of the first three movies are more than likely going to love watching this instalment, newcomers will get a fresh story now that a previous chapter has been closed, and fans of comedy will also get many clever laughs here as well. I'm not ready to call Toy Story 4 my favourite film of the franchise by any means, but in terms of character progression, emotion, and an overall extremely enjoyable film, I would be lying if I didn't say that I loved it. Yes, I have minor issues, but they are so small that I just feel like giving this one a perfect grade, which I haven't given to many films in 2019. Toy Story 4 is a wonderful time at the movies and I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The sequel we didn't know we needed,"Toy Story 4 is the sequel that little expected, in a franchise that ended with a brilliant period mark, from a studio that promised no sequels. Coming into the fourth Toy Story there are bound to be skepticisms, yet the movie definitely pulls through, going above and beyond. Toy Story 4 was a story about friendship, the relationships between the core cast of toys, and what it means to protect, look over someone and to let go.While the story of the toys may seem all but concluded, this installment has proved that there is yet more stories to tell and more lessons to give. Toy Story 4, was an emotional, exciting and hilarious film, that I had a great time watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's emotional, fast paced and very funny throughout with incredible animation. Tom Hanks, Annie Potts and Tim Allen give incredible performances once again.

Didn't know I wanted this movie until I saw it,"I have to admit I groaned when I saw the announcement for this movie. The ending to Toy Story 3 had been perfect. Well okay, it had the capability to induce diabetes two state lines away, but it was a good ending to the trilogy. No additional hijinks needed. But, it made a lot of money, so perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised that Disney/Pixar wanted to return to this golden egg goose.But, credit where credit is due, they did a good job with this one. This is an excellent continuation to the Toy Story franchise. Love and care have obviously been spent in plentiful abundance and the people behind the story obviously wanted to make this as good as they could.And I liked it. Sure, it's once again the toys trying to get home to their owner. Like in every single other Toy Story film. But once again they do something different with it. For some reason this repetitiveness doesn't bother me in this franchise unlike everywhere else.The characters once again feel intriguing, familiar and achingly flawed. None of them are perfect, especially not Woody, who's once again single-mindedly bulldozing his way through emotional issues. Like in every other film, but in a different manner. Once again. How does this franchise do this? It shouldn't work.I also really like Bo Peep as a returning character. Easily the MVP of the character roster.So there you have it. Toy Story 4 is not only a good movie, it's actually easily on par with all the rest of the films in its franchise. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this became the favourite Toy Story film for some people.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not sure this was necessary...but I was charmed nonetheless,"Toy Story somehow kept getting better across parts 2 and 3. They introduced characters you immediately cared about. They found new layers of emotion. They evolved from being movies about toys to a being movies about life. There were some diminishing returns this time around: this chapter of the story was not really needed, and we did not get much time with some of the characters we grew to know/love. Buuuuuuuut...it was still a solid story. The antique shop worked. The carnival worked. The last chapter for Woody worked. As a result, I found myself caring and laughing and getting more emotional than I expected. It was not Toy Story 3, but that's a high bar. This was a great sequel, even if it had a hard act to follow.PS - That first scene in the antique shop? Scariest scene in a movie this year.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Should've ending with 3, But...","To put it simply this movie did not need to exist, but I was glad that I saw it because like so many people I was thinking ""how can they top this?""But they didn't top it they added a story that works. The movie definitely has noticeable flaws and the ending might have been depressing but for a movie that had nothing to go on and actually telling a good story, I was impressed with the results. It was a good flowing story and the new characters are very funny! It introduced us to a new concept for a toy's purpose and told it well

If this is the end that it was my pleasure and thank you Pixar,Just when you thought that Toy Story had perfect ending they make the new Toy Story with even more perfect ending. Another adventure but this time with new characters leading the way and some old ones coming back. Villain was scary and great but it had lighter future than the Bear in Toy Story 3. Maybe not my favorite Toy Story movie but still really great one and I'm glad it wasn't made only to earn money. My biggest problem was that I watched it dubbed in Croatian and most of the jokes had no sense and just fell flat.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation

After 25 years....,"The first toy story came out in 95, and I thought it was ahead of its time in storytelling, and technical prowess. 25 years later, the makers of the 4th carry that torch well. Such a beautiful story of friendship, sacrifice, selflessness, and perseverance. Pixar continues to be ahead of the curve in telling stories in a profound way that ultimately matter to humanity. I am so glad they made this movie. It was funny, charming, and by the end you couldn't help but have a smile on your face while being incredibly moved. The new characters didn't steal any of the recurring characters' thunder, they rather added to it in a whole new way. Well worth the watch, and buy in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It puts a nice end on the series,"The themes have become repetitive, but they still work. If this is indeed the last chapter in this series, then it ended very well. It works because the plot lines are not about toys, but about childhood.

They did it again!,"This is the best fourth installment I've ever seen in any series! I remember back when this very website said that there was a ""Toy Story 4"", but then in the FAQ it was just said to be a hoax. I guess it was real after all! Many people were skeptic because ""Toy Story 3"" was the perfect finale to the series. I knew they had to make a major change if they would make it as good as the other ones. I remember when the ending was coming and I said that I went the way, I would put this on the same pedestal as the previous ones.And guess what happened? The previous movie mentioned that Bo Peep had left, but they never showed how. They do in the first six minutes of this film! So the plot is that Bonnie literally makes a new toy out of a spork and googly eyes which turns out be a real toy! ""Sporky"" can't understand his status as a toy and tries to leave the family when they're on a road trip. Turns out he more or less accepts that he's a toy in the first thirty minutes of the movie!Unfortunately, Woody and Sporky have to deal with a villain named Gabby, who wants to steal Woody's voicebox. Duke Kaboom (voiced by Keanu Reeves) doesn't appear until halfway through the movie. He ends up still being a great character! This movie has great joke after great joke and everything else great! It's great how they worked so hard to flesh out Bo Peep's characters. It's too bad that some of the voice cast had died, which is why they don't have that much of a role here (especially Mr. Potato Head with Don Rickles). ****",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The gang is back in another top quality Pixar adventure,"We're only half way through the year but I think it's safe to say we may have already discovered our favourite cinematic character of the year, in the form of an animated fork, named Forky.But I digress, more about Forky later, as the colourful new addition to the beloved Toy Story universe is but one of the reasons why this at early times surprising fourth film in the billion dollar franchise is yet another big win for Disney and Pixar studios, in what's likely to be a crowd pleasing box office smash.Filled with the ever expanding workmanship and eye-popping craft of Pixar's evolving and stunning CGI work (from rainy nights, to the glistening porcelain of the returning Bo Peep), Toy Story 4 sees debut feature filmmaker Josh Cooley bring back the whole gang for a whip smart adventure that touches on a number of themes and conversations that centre around finding ones place in the world and ones meaning when life around it is constantly changing.As usual however, these themes are wrapped around a big old barrel of fun, something that's always been a prevailing factor in the Toy Story films and what made them quickly become such a worldwide favourite and with some great new additions and a fairly wild ride for our characters to partake in, Toy Story 4 is arguably the outright funniest film yet in the franchise's history.As Woody, Buzz and the gang (who it must be said get a relatively brief screen time in this yarn in one of the films mild disappointments) set out on a mission to rescue new addition Forky from an at times downright creepy antique shop run by the devious Gabby Gabby, Toy Story 4 throws in a number of genuinely laugh out loud moments that are mostly instigated by the films newest additions that include Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele's Bunny and Ducky, Gabby Gabby's ventriloquist doll henchman and Keanu Reeves scene stealing stuntman extraordinaire and proud Canadian Duke Caboom.It's a joy to watch these colourful rag-tag bunch of characters interact with their even more vibrant worlds and from carnivals, playgrounds, kindergarten rooms and the core antique shop, Toy Story 4 is an imaginative treasure trove of sight gags, witty dialogue and personality beats that culminate to make a highly entertaining all-ages affair that will have adults and children laughing (and more than likely shedding a tear or two) in equal measure, especially when Forky is first finding his feet in the great big world his been bought into.When weighed up against its predecessors, the ground-breaking first film, the thoroughly entertaining second adventure and the perfectly judged ""finale"" in the form of the third film it's hard to say exactly where Toy Story 4 fits in the overall scheme of things, as while it is a comedic gem there is a sense it's not as emotionally powerful as previous entries (despite its strong finale) and you can't help but wish there was more group activities with the original gang, with the film more than ever focused on Woody (which isn't a bad thing thanks to Hanks voice work), with even Buzz feeling more like a side player within the films narrative.Final Say -A visual and comedic delight, Toy Story 4 is another impressive feat of film-making by Pixar and one that's sure to charm fans of old and newcomers alike. While its slightly disappointing more of the original crew don't prominently feature, Toy Story 4 ensures the new additions to the universe keep things ticking along all the way until a fittingly emotional finale.4 trash cans out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Sequels can work when there's Great Talent and Creativity,"My Review Toy Story 4.

Release in 1995 the creators at Pixar have maintained the high standards of the first film and continued the theme of inclusiveness and community in the 3 sequels.Nowadays voice overs in animated features get full cast credits attract top names and are paid accordingly unlike the pioneer Disney features animated films like Snow White , Pinocchio and Sleeping Beauty and Tom Hanks who has finally handed in Woody's Tin Star said that he was in tears while doing his final lines as his Toy Story character, Woody.

Woody in this film has actually grown himself. He is not naivee anymore and he understands that Andy is no longer a child and that he has grown so there is no point chasing him.

"Don't worry, it's good","I was rather skeptical going in. After the 3rd movie, I felt it ended the series perfectly, and that continuing would only be a money-grabbing mistake that would ruin the series.

They did a good job, and in a way, seemed to close the book on Woody's story in an appropriate way. If I had to put it certain way, I'd say that this movie felt kind of like epilogue to the series. True, it wasn't as good as its predecessors, but they still did a good job that left me satisfied. If I had one real complaint, it's that we didn't see enough of the whole toy gang, as the story focused almost entirely on Woody and Bo. Even Buzz seemed to get pushed into the background a bit.

Toy Story A Hollywood Endgame,"The fourth and we are told concluding segment of the Toy Story franchise, looks amazing but in truth never comes close to equalling let alone bettering any of its predecessors. Somehow the dazzling brilliance of real excitement and dazzling action with rib bending humour simply is not present. The movie simply limps along, never quite boring you but just never quite meeting your heightened expectations. As 2019 follows 2018 big Hollywood is failing it's audiences as one so so remake - sequel - prequel - franchise instalment - reboot - spin off after the other dulls the senses with dearie barely adequate increasingly boring story telling. Hollywood must learn and quickly that making the same film over and over is not the option to keep cinema relevant in the age streaming. We the audience are crying out for some originality, simply blasting the screen with more and more computer generated effects is simply lazy.
