"An elegant thriller, with several unpredictable twists","This century has seen Liam Neeson in real leading roles, when his character ""permeates"" the whole movie and is strong and quick-witted. Taken 1 and 2 are best known, Unknown has - for some reason or another - remained in their shadow. In my opinion, the script of the latter is much stronger, has more twists-turns and unpredictable moments - me being a fan and active viewer of crime thrillers could not guess what kind of background could Neeson's character Dr. Martin Harris really have. Sequence of the events is logical and chases are visually enjoyable. The ending in general is predictable, apart from the very last scene.Well, all the cast is excellent, not only Liam Neeson; Diane Kruger and Bruno Ganz are the supporting actors more time on screen and they are really good. In short, Unknown is really worth watching - especially if you have not read spoilers :)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bourne Identity meets The Commuter in The Twilight Zone,"Über talented ensemble of actors and the trademark style of the director delivers on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense, despite a preposterously convoluted story.Director Jaume Collet-Serra ('The Commuter') surrounds the mature action star Liam Neeson with an ensemble of actors who deliver superb performances.It all sets up to be a first-rate suspense film, except the story itself is like one of the more fantastical types Rod Serling might have used in his 'Twilight Zone' TV series that presses the boundary of believability.Unknown delivers on ""entertainment"", and I recommend seeing the film, but leave your storyline expectations with the cloakroom before viewing.Collet-Serra uses a similar style of suspense-film story telling seven years later in 2018's 'The Commuter', once again teaming with Neeson in the lead role - if you liked that movie, you will like this one as well, which is a notch or two better overall.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Despite his age, Neeson still has it in him","Multiple people have compared this to Neeson's 2008 release of ""Taken."" Both have a similar concept; Liam goes on a fast-paced journey to retrieve something special that has been taken from him. This time it is not his daughter; it is his mind. Unlike ""Taken,"" ""Unknown"" is more of a suspense mystery than an action flick. There are some chases and fight scenes, but that is not the main focus. The movie's plot is focus and it is unique for it is unpredictable. We are confused like Neeson's character and there are times we don't know if he will succeed. There are multiple twists and unlike most mystery thrillers, it took me more than half through the film to figure it all out.In short, ""Unknown"" is a fairly decent mystery thriller. Good performances. Good story for a mystery. Good music. Good cinematography—I particularly like the whole gray, dreary atmosphere that reflects the film's location's bleak weather. Good twists. Good suspense— the sound mixers must've had a kick in adding emphasis on sound effects to startle the audience. The one thing I will note is that Liam Neeson is really showing his age. This is not necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary, it helps his character out. It gets tiresome that Hollywood always uses the generic 30-something year old actor with smashing abs who is tossed into a terrible situation. It is nice to see an aging actor play an upper middle-aged man who has perhaps lost his mind while running away from people trying to kill him.My rating: ***/****",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fast, suspenseful, slick thriller. Yes, we have it seen it all before, but it is executed with THAT MUCH finesse, that it is still a joy to watch from beginning to end.","Beforehand I didnt expect anything from this movie, I just wanted to watch a B-movie, with lots of action and thrills, to keep me awake. But I got more than I expected, and although I was sleepy when I started watching it, I was wide awake midway through. This is just another one of those unmistakable well made Liam Neeson thrillers.If you liked the Liam Neeson Taken series then you will surely love this movie as well. It' s fast, suspenseful and with lots of slick and cool looking photography and editing. I mention these technical details, because lots of action movies just dont get it right when it comes to fastpaced action photography. This one does.Liam Neeson travels abroad with his wife for business. He gets into a car accident by himself and when he wakes up in a hospital, someone else has taken his identity.This story might sound ridiculous, and for sure, it is a bit of a ridiculous story, but it is executed in such a way that is still quite suspenseful and captivating.There are many resemblances with the Bourne movies. Memory loss, being chased by assasins in foreign countries (Germany), fast action sequences and lots of suspense. It is a really decent action thriller, which the fans of this genre will surely have a good time with. It is a bit better than the average action movie, although dont expect originality either...",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Keeps your attention,"Anyone who has watched Liam Neeson's movies have grown accustom to a character that is always thrown into absurd situations but can still somehow use wit, power and skills to get himself out. Unknown offers the same formula but it still works. This movie caught my attention from the get go. I enjoy how Liam is believable in these roles and you forget that he's getting up there in age, if anything, he makes it seem like this is what any man his age is capable of. He is awaken from a coma to discover that his identity has been taken by someone else. Worst yet, his wife doesn't seem to recognize him. With the help of the woman that saved his life, in a country that is not his home, Liam seeks about to prove himself. This movie is action packed and keeps you on the edge while you try to figure out what is going on. And I feel the ending does not disappoint. Enjoyable, entertaining, action packed and thrilling!",,Anonymous,Mystery
Involving and well interpreted action-thriller,"The movie sounds intriguing since from the beginning and keeps its sense of mystery and intrigue till the end: this is a good quality, once reminding Hitchcock's thrillers, with the difference that in ""Unknown"" the thrilling aspect cannot be separated from the frenzy typical of action movies. The result is an entertaining, involving pic, never losing its strong and quick rhythm and letting the viewer staying attached to the screen till the end. Set in a depressing Berlin covered by snow, always marked by the sad signs of a more or less distant past, a good photography gets to capture the overall gloomy atmosphere of the story and the mystery of a character whose vicissitudes seem as much incomprehensible as much needing some resolution, and an effective final twist as well. Liam Neeson plays skillfully, although not always sufficiently expressive, he gets to convey the sense of void of someone looking for some identity. A stand-out performance is offered by Bruno Ganz and also Diane Kruger supports Neeson quite well. Certainly not a masterpiece, but worth the ticket.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Crafty Thriller!,"Liam Neeson is turning into quite an action star these days despite his advancing age. After starring in the surprise action hit Taken, Liam tries his hand at another similar movie except with a much fewer body count. Unknown is a crafty little thriller set in international lands and is much better than I expected it to be. I thought this would be almost like a sequel to Taken but what I got was a tense, smartly-written thriller.This film is about a husband, Dr. Martin Harris and a wife, Liz who travels to Germany because of a press conference. After suffering in an accident, Martin wakes up to find out his whole world is turned upside down when he finds out his wife does not recognize him and an impostor has taken his place. Now, he has to face many challenges if he is to get things back to normal.Liam Neeson is making a name for himself as an action star. He was pretty good to watch in this movie. The supporting cast led by January Jones, Diane Kruger, and Frank Langella is really good as well.Overall, this is a tense thriller which is way better than the release date it had would suggest. This movie was slow at times and it reminded me greatly of Harrison Ford's Frantic, but despite some clichés, the cast and some tense moments rose this film above mediocrity. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty good,"I wanted to love this film, as I'm a big fan of Liam Neeson.This was a pretty good movie. It was overall enjoyable to watch, and it had good twists to the story. It was action packed, and as such Neeson delivers. January Jones is, unfortunately, a terribly cold actress and is the same character as all of her other films. I do like Diane Kruger though, and she was fairly charming in this.I enjoyed watching it. It's a good weekend, sit-down-and-enjoy thrill movie, as one would expect from its description. It is by no means a movie I'd recommend for its artistic merit, but it definitely delivers in the traditional thrill-seeker movie. The plot is pretty good as well, and well executed.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worth staying known,"'Unknown' won't be everybody's cup of tea, something that is clear from reading the reviews and the mixed critical reception for it. It did have good potential, with an idea that although very familiar seemed interesting and the always watchable (and more often than not very good) Liam Neeson is enough to peak anyone's interest.Potential that wasn't quite lived up to fully. Enough of 'Unknown' does work, or at least to me it did (not everybody will agree and that's fine by me), but also from personal opinion what could have been a pretty good film turned out to be an above average but uneven one that could have done much more with what it had. It entertains and intrigues, but doesn't wow.Mostly 'Unknown' is a good looking film. the cinematography is slick and stylish, that and the suitably bleak setting often adding to the atmosphere created, and the lighting is moody and neither garish or drab. Editing is mostly tight. It's nicely scored, not intrusive but having presence, and the direction is solid.There is enough taut suspense and fun to keep one gripped and a few interesting twists. The action excites and the more dramatic scenes don't fall into the trap of losing momentum. Liam Neeson is likeable and commanding, while charming Diane Kruger and an immensely engaging Bruno Ganz as the most interesting character fare best of the rest of the cast. Frank Langhella similarly makes his mark, although his role is small.Sadly, there are exceptions to the acting, with Aidan Quinn blandly uncharismatic in his role. Worse is January Jones, playing her character as too much of the frostiest ice queen which to me seemed a wildly inappropriate approach to her character. The characters generally are pretty sketchy and too much of the dialogue is hammy and vague.While enough of the film grips, it does get preposterous, credibility-straining and less clear in story in the later stages up until the final twist and ending that is neither clever, original or satisfying. In the busier moments, the photography/editing tended to go wayward and look rushed rather than the controlled and slick film most of the film has.In summary, decent if unexceptional film that's worth staying known. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Going Out of His Head,"Invited to Berlin for an important biotechnology conference, doctor Liam Neeson (as Martin Harris) is in a freakish taxi accident. He is rescued from a watery crash by eye-catching cab-driver Diane Kruger (as Gina). She disappears after Mr. Neeson is given life support, because Ms. Kruger is an illegal alien from Bosnia and doesn't want to be exported. Neeson awakens in a hospital after a four-day coma. His memory is foggy. Going back to his hotel, Neeson finds beautiful blonde wife January Jones (as Elizabeth ""Liz"" Harris) married to Aidan Quinn (also as Martin Harris). Either Neeson isn't ""Harris"" or someone has stolen his identity...Making it more mysterious is the fact that Ms. Jones doesn't recognize her husband is Neeson, although we've seen them together before the accident. Neeson has no identification and only a little money. He decides to find rescuer Kruger and see if she remembers anything. Neeson also asks former (East) German secret agent Bruno Ganz (as Ernst Jurgen) for help. He looks for sneaky old acquaintance Frank Langella (as Rodney Cole). The plot thickens to the point where you lose interest, but ""Unknown"" director Jaume Collet-Serra does keep you going through the running time.

Time-Pass!,"Based on the 2003 French novel published in English as Out of My Head, by Didier Van Cauwelaert, 'Unknown' is a Time-Pass Fare, that offers some terrific thrills, along-with a fantastic performance by it's lead star Liam Neeson.'Unknown' Synopsis: A man awakens from a coma, only to discover that someone has taken on his identity and that no one, (not even his wife), believes him. With the help of a young woman, he sets out to prove who he is.'Unknown' offers some terrific thrills. The twists & turns genuinely work. However, the culmination could've been more effective. Oliver Butcher & Stephen Cornwell's Screenplay is interesting, but as mentioned, the culmination to this action-thriller needed to be better. Jaume Collet-Serra's Direction is Razor-Sharp! Cinematography is stunning. Editing & Art Design, are mediocre.Performance-Wise: Liam Neeson is fantastic. The ever-stylish actor delivers a very fine performance & holds the film.

Intriguing thriller but too many plot holes,"'Unknown' is a decent enough thriller that keeps you interested and guessing until the end. The story has potential but is ultimately let down by some far-fetched scenarios and plot holes.In the opening few scenes alone there's one coincidence too many - Dr. Harris forgets his suitcase, crashes into a river on his way to retrieve it (after a container falls off the vehicle in front), and is then saved by a taxi driver who goes on to risk her own life (again) to help him find out who he is.I can't say that I didn't enjoy 'Unknown', it was a good 2 hours of entertainment, but it would have been a lot more enjoyable if it was believable too.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Enjoyable Yet Unremarkable Thriller,"Unknown is a stylish, atmospheric film, yet it is not particularly memorable. It has a pretty effective opening, setting up an intriguing mystery on which the plot of this movie is based around.The film boasts a fantastic cast, including supporting roles for veterans Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz. Both actors are the best aspects of the movie, and it would have been nice to have seen more from them. Liam Neeson is a very entertaining screen presence, as usual. He is a reliable lead and is enjoyable to watch. January Jones has the look of a classic Hitchcockian blonde, but unfortunately, she has very little to do.While the movie is filled with these great actors, the characters they play are pretty familiar. They lacked any real depth, as did the film itself. While Neeson and co-star Diane Kruger are always likeable, there is an emotional distance between their characters and the audience.The tone of this movie is sombre, yet the plot is quite silly. It also features some over-the-top action, which didn't fit with this tone, including scenes in which Kruger's taxi driver fights against professionally trained bodyguards.Overall, this is a solid thriller. It is well-made and features a compelling central mystery. Unfortunately, it is unremarkable and does not warrant a second viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good twist to an old plot,"A man (Liam Neeson) is in a horrible accident, and when he recovers, no one knows who he is, including his wife, in ""Unknown,"" a 2011 film starring Liam Neeson, January Jones, Diane Kruger, Aiden Quinn, and Frank Langella.We've seen this plot, or a derivation thereof, many times: the man who disappears and everyone denies his existence to the person who accompanied him (So Long at the Fair, Dangerous Crossing), or the man who suddenly isn't who he says he is (The Net). The plot of ""Unknown"" is the latter, and Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) attempts to investigate why someone (Aiden Quinn) is now Dr. Martin Harris and with his wife (January Jones). To do this, Harris must first find the taxi driver who saved his life (Kruger). Meanwhile, he desperately tries to reach a professor (Frank Langella) back at his college who can verify his identity.This type of film, when done well, as this one was, moves quickly and has lots of actions in order to cover up the plot holes. There usually are some, but if the film is good, one doesn't mind. I have to say I really enjoyed this film, filmed mostly in and around Berlin. Good performances, very exciting, a couple of dandy car chases, and a neat twist. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great paranoid premise just needs to ramp up the pace sooner,"Dr Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his wife Elizabeth Harris (January Jones) get into a car accident. Martin survives but when he wakes up, his wife no longer recognizes him and someone else (Aidan Quinn) has taken his place. The world becomes a place of paranoia, and the only person who helps him is the waitress Gina (Diane Kruger).It's an unusual head scratching premise. It's a mystery as to what the true story is. Is it all in his head? Or is it reality? The pace could be faster in the first half. I wish they didn't push the color spectrum so far to the the blueish green. It's obvious and distracting. Also they need to pair up Kruger and Neeson a lot sooner. As it stands, the movie is split in two. The first is a slow meditating paranoid interior film. The second half becomes a Bourne Identity film. It'd probably improve to concentrate the first half more.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Escapist entertainment that relies mostly on its leading man, Neeson","Liam Neeson is Dr. Martin Harris, a scientist who travels to Germany with his wife, Liz (January Jones, Mad Men), for a bio-tech conference. Before checking into the hotel, he realizes he's left his briefcase and passport behind so he flags down a taxi driven by Gina (Diane Kruger, Inglorious Basterds). Her expert driving skills sends them careening off of a bridge and into the drink. She manages to save herself and Martin, then flees the scene, not wanting to risk deportment because she's an illegal immigrant from Bosnia.After waking up from a coma, Martin can only remember who he is and why he's in Berlin. He finds his way back to the hotel where he finds Liz, only she denies that she's his wife or that she even knows him. Worse yet, she's with a man (Aidan Quinn) claiming to be her husband and the real Dr. Martin Harris. Lacking any identification to prove that he is who he claims to be, he's removed from the premises. And the mystery surrounding the dual Dr. Harrises begins.He tracks down Gina and, together, they try to understand what is happening to Martin and why Liz denies that she's his wife. They're lousy detectives. If it weren't for the mystery men constantly in their faces (I don't want to give too much away), they'd be wandering aimlessly around Berlin.Yes, there are plot holes and more than enough ""reeeeally?"" moments, but Neeson makes it all worthwhile. At 58, he's still got it. The action is intense, the suspense and thrills are the perfect tone, and the mystery is well done. It's up to you to decide whether the twist at the end is satisfactory. This isn't a flawless film. It's escapist entertainment that relies mostly on its leading man. Unknown is The Bourne Supremacy with less action.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Neeson Thrill Ride with a Few Too Many Bumps,"Let me get straight to it: I dove into ""Unknown"" expecting the classic Liam Neeson thriller kick, and well, it was a bit of a mixed bag. Picture this: Neeson, playing Dr. Martin Harris, wakes up to find his life hijacked by an impostor. Sounds like the perfect setup for a mind-bending ride, right?But here's the thing the plot twists more than a pretzel. At first, it's exciting, like trying to solve a mystery where every clue leads to more questions. But after the fifth or sixth ""big reveal,"" I started to feel like maybe they were trying too hard. It's like the movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a deep psychological thriller or just another action-packed Neeson saga.Speaking of Neeson, the man doesn't disappoint. He's the glue holding this wild story together, delivering confusion, determination, and that signature toughness with ease. It's just that sometimes, it felt like even he couldn't believe the twists his character had to navigate through.The supporting cast, including January Jones and Diane Kruger, were alright, but honestly, they were overshadowed by Neeson's presence. It's not their fault; the story just didn't give them much to work with beyond being pieces in the ever-complicated plot puzzle.Director Jaume Collet-Serra sure knows how to create an atmosphere, setting up Berlin as this eerie, almost otherworldly backdrop to the chaos. And yeah, the movie looks good slick action scenes, neat visuals. But all that style felt a bit hollow without the substance to back it up. It's like ""Unknown"" wanted to replicate the ""Taken"" formula without capturing the same heart.So, what's my verdict? ""Unknown"" is a ride entertaining but frustrating. Neeson fans will get their fix, but if you're looking for a coherent plot to match the action, you might end up feeling a tad lost. I'm giving it a 7/10 because, despite its flaws, I was entertained. Just maybe keep your expectations in check and enjoy the Neeson-powered rollercoaster for what it is a thrill ride with a few too many unexpected turns.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Then every subsequent action scene is pretty ridiculous as a standalone component. Some of the mystery is tied up satisfactorily towards the end yet the unraveled mystery proves to be a mystery as to why it was a mystery to begin with. Got it?

Probably not, but it's devilishly entertaining. The action scenes here are matched by the quiet drama scenes and that's unusual. I don't really think either sex can really claim it entirely.The director's done a very good job of creating the right mood and telling the story in such a way that the actors can do their work, unimpeded by unrealistic run ups to their scenes.

We get the gist...of the twist,"There's lots to love about this film....brisk tempo, exotic intrigue, fleet-footed action sequences...the best of which were displayed in many of my favorite films of this genre: the Bourne trilogy, The Fugitive, etc.The Unknown is propelled forward quite effortlessly by these elements...until, surprisingly, then end. Has anyone experienced that moment in a commercial flight when the smooth, intense acceleration of lift-off and ascent subtly disengages to settle in for level flight? That's usually the point when people (those not jaded by excessive air travel, that is!) break out their books, iPads, Air Malls...the moment when the thrill is gone. I felt something of that shift watching Unknown draw to a close. The coveted ""unpredictable plot twist"" just didn't deliver me through that sling-shot feeling which so gripped me in movies that expertly employed the device in the past (I'll never forget my gaping jaw in The Sixth Sense...totally, blissfully blind-sided). I remember looking at my wife, after the big revelation (no, I won't spoil) with a look that said...""I'm not feeling it"" Could we be at that unhappy moment, ladies and gentlemen? The tipping point when unpredictable plot twists have gone through their permutations...to the point that they have simply become predictable?

Forget the Smug Comparisons,"The Films detractors inevitably imply that because it resembles other, perhaps better Movies, that this is worthless and should be disregarded. That is ridiculous, all Movies are in some way derivative to varying degrees, so the smug comparisons to Hitchcock, The Bourne Series, Total Recall, Frantic, Taken, and others are Red Herrings and can be ignored.Even Hitchcock ripped-off Hitchcock because that is the nature of Human Endeavors and this Thriller, while not Great, is a worthy entry in the Genre and is worth a look for some engagement and Entertainment.It has a cold and icy look that has a dream-like patina of unfriendly surroundings and a landscape of a forbidden zone. The Action is crisp and cuts finely whether it be hand-to-hand, vehicle driven, or the less subdued suspense of quiet desperation.There are attempts at maybe too many Political and Sociolgical statements and things can get a bit confusing toward the end (amnesia is nothing less), but it is all wrapped with a bow, that may not be so neat, but things in this type of Universe very rarely are.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another kick-ass Liam Neeson action film with Liam once again in a foreign country single-handedly taking on dozens of inept bad guys!,"'UNKNOWN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another kick-ass Liam Neeson action film with Liam once again in a foreign country single-handedly taking on dozens of inept bad guys. In this one Liam plays a man who awakens from a four day coma, after a freak automobile accident, and finds another man has taken his place. No one believes who he really is, including his wife. The film was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (who also directed the popular well made horror films 'ORPHAN' and the 2005 remake of 'HOUSE OF WAX') and written by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell. It's adapted from a French novel titled 'Out of My Head'. The film is an interesting and suspenseful thriller and Liam once again makes an engaging action hero lead.Neeson plays Dr. Martin Harris, who's visiting Berlin with his wife Liz (January Jones) for a biotechnology summit. As the movie opens the two arrive at their hotel when Martin realizes he forgot his briefcase at the airport. He takes a cab back to get it when the delivery truck they're following loses a refrigerator and the cab driver (Diane Kruger) drives off a bridge in order to avoid crashing into it. He survives the crash thanks to the cab driver, Gina, but falls into a coma for four days as a result of it. Upon awaking he returns to the hotel and finds another man (Aidan Quinn) is claiming to be him and even Liz goes along with the charade. Alone with no ID, money or help Martin sets out to prove his true identity and unmask the culprits as well as their motives. He finds help from a reluctant Gina and a private investigator (Bruno Ganz) but soon realizes he, as well as they, are in grave danger.The film was marketed as another no holds barred 'TAKEN' type action film but this is more of a suspense thriller and doesn't have quite as much action. The action it does have is pretty spectacular though, including some amazing car chases. Neeson doesn't do as much hand to hand combat as his other popular action role but he's still quite good and a decent action presence. The supporting cast is all more than adequate and Kruger and Jones (two of my favorites) are both stunningly beautiful like always. The story is involving and very fast paced, it's pretty unbelievable at times (including a pretty far fetched twist) but for the most part it works. The directing is nicely fitting and efficiently stylized. It might not be quite as good as some fans might have been expecting as Neeson's action followup to 'TAKEN' but it's a decent action thriller all the same.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrH0mjY9QTY",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pretty damn subpar for a 30 million dollar movie,"First off, what a brutal title. I mean c'mon. There's at least 5 other films prior to this that have already used it... what happened to at least trying to be original? I went in to this movie kinda stoked because I really dug Neeson's last film Taken. But within the first 5 mins I knew this film was already in trouble. First off, both Neeson's character and the cab driver forget to take Neeson's briefcase off the luggage dolly. Really????!!! So beyond obvious but whatever, I'll go with it. Then as Neeson races back to retrieve it, he can't get a cell phone signal while trying to call his wife??????!!!!!! He's in the middle of Berlin for Christ sake!!!! He's not on some backwoods road or out in the middle of nowhere. C'MON!!!! Throughout the movie, things like this continue to happen. The acting is so rigid. Neeson ain't that great and the chick playing his wife is horrible. The action is few and far between and the actual story is frustrating to watch. Everything was so subpar. The only decent part of the film was the young girl who helps out Neeson. She actually kicks way more ass than he does. He's actually pretty useless. There is also an unintentionally hilarious scene where Neeson and the guy who has assumed his identity rattle off identical sentences simultaneously. The theater was laughing while poor Liam was trying to be serious. I just paid $11 for this crap. Was it the worst movie I've ever seen?

Turn your brain off and you should enjoy it,"UNKNOWN, another one of recent action star Liam Neeson's winter season offerings, is fairly entertaining, but also very implausible. Liam Neeson plays Martin Harris, a scientist who is attending a biotech conference in Berlin with his wife. Or is he? After an accident, he is left with no identification and no proof of who he is, and everyone is claiming they don't know him. He then proceeds to find out who he is. This type of mystery/thriller has been done before, although perhaps not as slickly as this one. The movie ERASED, starring Aaron Eckhart comes to mind, although that pales in comparison to this in terms of just about everything. Liam Neeson once again shows that he makes a capable, if unexpected, action star and he also has the acting chops to give it some weight. January Jones as his wife, however, is practically a non-entity. She practically sleepwalks through her limited role and doesn't really give off anything resembling human emotion, although that might have been on purpose. To accurately describe my reasoning would delve into spoiler territory, so I'll just leave it at that. Diane Kruger also gave a good performance as an immigrant taxi driver who helps out Liam Neeson's character. Aside from him, she's given the most screen time and is given a nice back story, to boot. Rounding out the cast are Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella. Although neither one of them had a lot of screen time (one might say they were underutilized), they did own the few scenes they were in. In terms of technical quality, the film was decent. There was a fair amount of hand-held camera-work, but none of it was too ""shaky"" and the fight scenes were comprehensible. There was even a couple good car chases. There was also some nice on-location shooting in Berlin, although the visual palette of the film didn't really bring out anything spectacular. Narrative-wise, the film is preposterous but still fun. There was a couple of moments where I laughed out loud due to how ridiculous things were, but overall I just accepted that the whole premise was far-fetched and went with it. Now, being mostly a dumb action movie, you wouldn't expect it to have much in the way of pertinent themes or sociopolitical commentary, but they did manage to shoehorn some in via Bruno Ganz's character, a former Stasi agent and a Saudi prince who is bankrolling a GMO project. Nothing too deep is said, but it was nice that they acknowledged that these things exist. As a whole, the movie is OK. It moves along at a good pace and is never boring. Still, discerning moviegoers would be justified in skipping it if they don't like this brand of action movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Liam Neeson kicks ass and is too cool to chew bubblegum,"Unknown is a pretty captivating action thriller staring Liam Neeson. The premise is quite fantastic, but until the end, when we realize what has happened, it is quite interesting. Follow Dr. Martin Harris as he runs against the clock to find out who stole his identity.The movie is not as action packed as Taken, for instance, leaving time to develop the characters and the plot. I can imagine this would have been a film for Harrison Ford, if done a decade or more ago.In all, I found the movie involving, but not very memorable.

Highly functional thriller with a 'Frantic' feel.,"While i'd hardly leap out of my seat to see much of Jaume Collet-Serra's back catalogue (Goal II, House Of Wax remake), i have to say he has turned in a highly functional, and always engaging modern day thriller with 'Unknown'. Liam Neeson seems to now find himself at home as the '50 something' action hero, and his performance is suitably 'Frantic' which is another film that springs immediately to mind in the early stages. Neeson is supported well by an impressive cast featuring Diane Kruger,January Jones and two heavyweight actors in the shape of Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella. While you never quite feel the goosebumps brought on by 'Taken', there's still enough thrills,spills and twists to fill up the running time, and things never at any point drag.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worth your money,"An ingenious script that echoes concepts, plotting, pace and intrigue from mysteries such as Nowhere Man, Frantic and The Bourne Identity. Once again, Liam Neeson shows his prowess in choosing projects of high interest and executes a performance that connects well with his audience.To put this in context, mystery thrillers are very hard to pull off anymore. Filmmakers must create layers of mysteries that the audience cannot easily second guess, peel them back one by one to reveal answers that themselves sometimes turn into mysteries later, and resolve all of them in 2 hours without seeming contrived or obvious. To make it more challenging, the characters must be empathetic, the action sequences satisfying, the pace agreeable, the dialog convincing, and the setting compelling.Director Jaume Collet-Serra has pulled it off again, following on the heels of another successful thriller, Orphan. This director is a rising star.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Where's Liam?,"'Unknown' is a solid espionage thriller with a very good cast and excellent locations in Berlin, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, and preceded by the Spaniard's third film 'Orphan'. Liam is a rock (not The Rock) in the lead, now thoroughly established as a main man in the action movie business, and he has excellent support from Frank Langella, Diane Kruger and January Jones, but it is Bruno Ganz who steals the show in terms of acting chops as a former Stasi officer, indeed the short scene that he shares with Langella is the film's most tense and poignant, superb acting. There's something of the feel of Roman Polanski's 'Frantic' in the perilous pursuit through a European capital, although this is a grittier affair and probably the better for it. Not to be confused with 'Taken' which is a completely different animal.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

You could poke thousand holes per minute if you were so inclined. But, to what purpose? The filmmakers didn't lie nor misrepresent themselves. It is what it is.

There is plenty of terrific action in this movie that is exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Liam Neeson (Dr. Martin Harris, the guy who looses his memory) is terrific and certainly not ""wooden"" as one review says. Diane Kruger (Inglourious Basterds) also puts in a great performance as Liam's unwilling cohort and is very believable as she is a native German.

A Man with No Memory Targeted for Assassination,"This film begins with a man named ""Dr. Martin Harris"" (Liam Neeson) and his wife ""Elizabeth Harris"" (January Jones) arriving in Berlin to attend a biotechnology conference. Once they arrive at their hotel, Martin notices that his briefcase containing his passport and other important papers is missing and as a result he immediately heads back to the airport to look for it. Unfortunately, on the way there the taxi he is riding in has a terrible accident which renders him unconscious and leaves him in a coma for four days. When he finally regains consciousness, he tells the doctor his identify and--against the doctor's advice--discharges himself to meet up with his wife who he believes must be terribly worried. However, upon meeting her, he is not only alarmed when she claims not to know him but finds she is also with another man--claiming to be him! So, with no identification and very little money, he immediately decides to find the taxi driver--known only as ""Gina"" (Diane Kruger)--who was also involved in the accident to try to make some sense of it all. What he doesn't realize, however, is that he has been targeted for assassination and everybody he comes into contact with is equally in danger as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting film which benefited from some decent mystery as well as several twists and turns along the way. Likewise, it didn't hurt to have a couple of beautiful actresses like the aforementioned January Jones and Diane Kruger either. In any case, I enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly.

I just watched Liam Neeson's Unknown it was again a treat to watch Liam kick butts just like it was in Taken . This movie starts normally but the end is very different . Movie has got some good action sequences and car chases. B.G.M is also good with a mysterious sound . Movie keeps you hooked up till end and you just keep staring at the screen . This movie is definitely a must watch movie for a Liam Neeson fan .
My rating for different genres :-
1.Action:- 3/5 , Action was good but not great as Taken but still Liam's action performance is watchable
2.Comedy:- 0.5/5 There was no as such comedy in it as it was not a comedy movie but still got a few funny scenes
3. Drama:- 3.5/5 Movie didn't provide us with a brand new story but the end was different. So yeah drama was also good . On the other hand acting was good also good
4. Thriller:- 4/5 The movie was filled with thriller no doubt and B.G.M did a good job by increasing the thriller tone for the movie.
5.Horror:-0/5 This movie was not a horror movieOverall movie rating:-7/10
This is a movie that's gonna keep you hooked up till the end, the end is very unpredictable and will leave you with a little bit of shock.

Unknown number of rip-offs,"An American couple arrive at Berlin for a summit on biochemistry; there is peculiar atmosphere, a suitcase left behind. Is it going to unfold a Frantic-type (the Polanski film) fish-out-of-water scenario about the increasingly bewildered American losing himself in a strange place? Is it going to be some cheap Face/Off clone except without the actual face change? Is it going to rip off The Game, some other film about the hero a hapless pawn in shady conspiracies?It gets worse as you keep watching. More exasperatingly implausible, downright stupid. Bruno Ganz shows up and, of course, he rattles off about the shame of Nazi heritage to a stranger he met just two minutes ago. He is completely wasted, as is Frank Langella. Liam Neeson - who, for some reason, I keep thinking as the Randolph Scott of our times, with the benign face and rugged demeanor - mostly coasts through this. With Taken, he at least seemed to be mildly interested in the role of the avenging father.So, it's basically bottom-of-the-barrel patchwork stuff with some sheen of professionalism (read safe, pedestrian, unimaginative), a slot-filler for the multiplex while catchier stuff awaits release. It's a b-movie with a cast of recognizable faces to save it from the straight-to-video bin. Avoid.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Following a car accident that left him in a coma, a man awakens to find that his identity has been stolen, and no one believes that he is who he says he is","An American couple arrives in Berlin, and they take a taxi to their hotel. The man is Martin Harris, a biologist in town to attend a summit that intends to unveil a revolutionary type of crop to end world hunger. As his wife goes to check in, Martin realizes that they have left a briefcase at the airport and decides to go back. On the cab ride to the airport, the car in front of them loses control, and the taxi swerves into the bridge wall, crashes through, and shoots out into the river. Four days later, Martin wakes up in a hospital room, and he has lost part of his memory, only aware of his name and his wife's. With no form of identification on him, and no idea where his wife is, he has no way to confirm his existence. After seeing the summit on the news, Martin remembers and goes to the hotel. He sees his wife, and as he goes to approach her, he is stopped by security. He tells the guards his name, and they say he has already come in. Martin presses past the desk and he sees a man with his wife. Furiously questioning the stranger, Martin is shown that this man has a driver's license stating the name Martin Harris, his picture with other scientists, and the wife denies any recognition of Martin. Confused and bewildered, Martin desperately searches for a way to prove his identity, and to find out why his wife denies that he is her husband.The ""lost memory/who am I?"" idea is very common in the movie world, and it has become somewhat tiresome to see how much it is used. The most notable success of this concept can be found in the Bourne trilogy, and it was vastly successful in both the box office and pop culture. While this film is not nearly as good as The Bourne Identity (2001) or its sequels, it is not quite as bad as others that have appeared on the big screen. This film was made in 2011, and lead actor Liam Neeson had recently come off of a major success in 2008's Taken, a film about an ex-CIA agent who goes to save his daughter who has been kidnapped while on a trip in Europe. After the success of the film, Neeson showed that he could be an action star, and this film wanted to use that new identity (no joke intended). In comparison to Taken, this film lacks the patriarchal emotion and desire for the daughter's safety, and so it lacks the universal element that was the driving force in Taken. In addition, the acting around Neeson is not quite as good. Though January Jones and Diane Kruger do their best, Jones lacks the emotion, and Kruger lacks the likability needed for her character. Though this film is not meant to be completely realistic, there were a few times where the plot was given a little boost in order for the end result to occur. In this day and age, who doesn't have their driver's license, phone, or (when traveling abroad) passport in his or her nearest reach? Though this film didn't quite live up to my expectations, I did like it some aspects. The editing was great, the cinematography has an intriguing tint to it, and the action sequences are very good. Though his performance surely wasn't worthy of any serious critical acclaim, Neeson does a good job with his character. Lastly, this film has a twist ending. I personally love a twist when it is executed well, and though it is not nearly as good as the Usual Suspects, Fight Club, or The Sixth Sense, this film's unforeseen conclusion is pulled off reasonably well. Without the critical eye, this film is a good thriller, and it is worthy of some attention.www.sportsandcelluloid,blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Almost really good and it reminds me of Frantic,"Lots of twists and turns and some decent action scenes in what has come to be a familiar type of movie for Liam Neeson these days.Dr Martin Harris is in Berlin Germany when he is involved in a car accident, suffers a bump to the head and then awakens days later to find that nobody knows who he is including his wife. In fact another man is claiming to be the real Dr Harris. Ignored by disbelieving authorities and hunted by mysterious assassins, Harris finds himself on the run.This was almost really good, it just fell off the mark a bit somehow and I also have to mention how much it reminded me of Harrison Ford's ""Frantic"", its almost the same movie, right down to the roof top scramble out the window. Neeson does a decent job with his version though. I did find that almost all of his interactions with his ""wife"" January Jones felt forced and awkward but I think that's down to her, she was kinda terrible. Diane Kruger on the other hand was fantastic as the funky girl he finds himself on the run with.I really liked the twist at the end where suddenly everything that I had thought was far fetched or dumb made sense and even had the thought that it was actually a far smarter movie than I had realized.

Unpredictable-foremost reason for my entertainment.,"A person who has watched too many movies especially movies belonging to similar genre is capable to predict the plot which is supposed to be mysterious.

despite what critics say,"I usually rely on the opinions of exquisite movie critics like Robert Ebert or James Berardinelli and it seldom or almost never happens to be in disagreement with one, not to speak both of them. Luckily I usually read critics opinions after seeing the film and so I did in this case as well, because I may have chosen to skip one of the most intelligent and well written action films I have seen lately. The story is not only well written and the pace of the action kept me on my edge for the whole duration of the film, but it also has logic and is credible, so I dare say that the two great critics got it wrong when they gave the two stars out of four treatment to the film.The first sequences of the film introduce the viewers in the American-Has-Trouble-In-European-Big-City genre, with Berlin playing the role usually assumed by Paris. The hero is a biotechnology expert which in the first few minutes of the film loses his suitcase, his wife, and his identity. The losing of the identity is soon to be turned into the kind of situation where not only the hero starts to doubt his own self, but also the viewers start doubting what they have seen, or searching for the hidden signification. Another man has taken his identity, his wife seems to have become part of the plot or maybe she is forced to be one, a lot of people try to kill him, and whoever helps him is in mortal danger and does not survive much time on the screen. All this happens in a frozen Berlin in winter, and is filmed with a blueish filter that creates a metallic light atmosphere that just increases the anxiety. Acting is exact, Liam Neeson will not get another Oscar nomination for this role but he succeeds to make us care for him and so does Diane Kruger in the role of the woman who helps him, to find her life blown-up together with her flat in the action.This is the fourth film of director Jaume Collet-Serra, whose first film, a piece of horror name House of Wax I also enjoyed. He proves here that he understands the rules of the genre and can make well-paced and efficient movies. The quality of the film comes however first of all from the quality of the script - Unknown is simply brilliantly written, the terrorism and Cold War sequels intrigue reminding Le Carre's novels provides a logical explanation which put for me every event in place in a story of lost memory and identity that could belong to the Bourne series. My preferred critics were wrong this time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nice Thriller But the Ending Doesn't Quite Work,"Unknown (2011)*** (out of 4)Fairly entertaining thriller has Liam Neeson playing Dr. Martin Harris who travels to Germany with his wife (January Jones) as he's about to give a speech on biotechnology. Martin forgets a piece of luggage so he heads back to the airport but along the way his cab wrecks and he's knocked out. When he wakes up he has no memory of who he is but bits and pieces slowly start to come back. When he's able to reach his wife she says she has no idea who he is so Martin must try and figure out who he is and why his wife says she doesn't know him. UNKNOWN isn't a masterpiece and it's not going to be confused with a Hitchcock film but if you don't mind a nice little ""B"" picture then it offers up enough entertainment. I think what makes the film work so well is that you've got an actor of the caliber of Neeson who can make you believe things even when the screenplay starts to become a tad bit silly. Neeson is really getting good at playing in these types of movies and while this one here doesn't reach the levels of TAKEN he still makes it good enough for a viewing. I thought Neeson did a very good job during the scenes where he's struggling to remember who he is. This part of the screenplay allows for the acting to tell the story and Neeson does very well with it. The first hour or so is mostly story driven as we don't get any lousy action scenes and for the most part you're zipping along with Neeson trying to figure everything out. Many will remember Diane Kruger from Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS BASERDS but she delivers a very good performance here as the taxi driver who helps Martin try to figure out his past. Neeson and Kruger have some nice chemistry together and they make for a fun team. It was nice seeing Aidan Quinn again as he adds nice support as the man claiming to be Martin. Bruno Ganz nearly steals the film as a German investigator who believes Martin is telling the truth and sets out to help him. Frank Langella appears late in the film so you should know what that means. For the first hour the film is pretty much a roller coaster ride with a story that works very well because it keeps you guessing and there are enough good twists and turns to keep you interested. With about a half hour left we start getting into some rather silly action sequences and before long the brain turns itself off. I will admit that I was guessing up to the very end and I didn't see the final twist coming but at the same time I found the explanation of everything to be rather weak. It's a nice twist but in this type of film it's best not to feel cheated but I did to a point. With that said, the first hour is so good and the cast in such fine form that it makes the film worth seeing.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Script holds up well despite numerous uninspired and dragged-out action sequences,"Memento meets The Fugitive as Liam Neeson finds himself in all sorts of trouble after arriving in Berlin with his wife to attend a conference. First, his taxi crashes, leaving him with a conventional plot convenient amnesia, and then his wife disowns him when he tries to prove that he is who he claims to be. For the next hour and a half, we must roam the streets of Berlin with him trying to solve the puzzle. Although there is undeniable familiarity in the setup, not to mention the paranoid atmosphere director Collet-Serra tries to conjure, the script is quite ingenious within the set premises, and it holds up well even if the filmmakers try their best to distract us from it through numerous uninspired and dragged-out action sequences and car chases which curb rather than intensify the useful level of suspense the film is able to build up. As such, Collet-Serra's work here is more mechanic and less elegant then in his previous film, the chiller Orphan (2009), but through a committed lead performance by Neeson and industrious storytelling, Unknown still makes for an entertaining watch with a couple of interesting segments, notably one between the two veterans Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Enjoyable near-remake of Mirage,"The three archetypal amnesia thrillers are Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945), Dmytryk's Mirage (1965), and Limon's The Bourne Identity (2002). Of these, Spellbound is of course the best (because Hitchcock), but Mirage is my favorite. This move is fairly obviously a reimagining of Mirage, so much so that I was surprised not to see it credited.The movie works well and is very watchable, though just a hair worse in every way than the earlier movie. For example, Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger are great as the two main characters, but Gregory Peck and Diane Baker were better. Bruno Ganz is wonderful Ernst Jürgen, but the private detective role was played by the inimitable Walter Matthau in the original. And baddie Olivier Schneider in this movie is practically forgettable, while Jack Weston, usually a comic actor, was full of screen-grabbing menace whenever he appeared in Mirage.If you haven't seen Mirage, see that one first or instead, unless modern effects are more important to you than first-rate directing, screenwriting, and acting. If you *have* seen Mirage, and enjoyed it, then you'll like this one too. The plot is just enough different that it won't be *completely* predictable.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

That said, the overall production is not as well paced as Taken (2008) to which is being consistently compared to.As the mystery unfolds it keeps you wanting more with the help of a cast of familiar faces including Diane Kruger as Gina (simuliar to Michelle in Frantic) and the excellent Adian Quinn, who's screen time like veteran actor Frank Langella is limited. Bruno Ganz is notable as Ernst Jürgen a former Agent now turned Private detective.The ending is overblown but the few action set ups are well presented and edited this coupled with the European locations add an air of realism to the proceedings.Although Liam Neeson performance is not as good as Harrison Ford's Dr. Walker or Matt Damon's Bourne, Neeson delivers with emotion and punches building successfully on his leading man status.Overall, an entertaining thriller sprinkled with a dusting of mystery and action.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Intriguingly Plotted Thriller That Sadly Loses its Way,"UNKNOWN starts with an intriguing premise: Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson), a noted American botanist, arrives in Berlin and is involved in a car crash. He wakes up from a coma without remembering anything about what happened, and discovers to his horror that his identity has been stolen by another person. His wife Elizabeth (January Jones) does not appear to recognize him, while everyone around thinks he is stark staring mad. Jaume Collet-Serra's thriller begins with an interesting premise: the film has a good sense of place, making intelligent use of the Berlin locations, with a fine feel for languages. Liam Neeson turns in a good performance as the central character, supported by Diane Kruger as his Bosnian sidekick, who has an unfortunate tendency to be involved in serious car-crashes. However UNKNOWN loses its way as the action unfolds. What started off as an interesting character-study soon becomes a conventional slap-bang-wallop actioner, with numerous car chases, fast cutting and implausible plotting.

Neeson just doesn't have the extra gear this demands,"This Bournesque - Hitchcockian affair is a well written story, slightly flawed by the trauma from accident which drives the whole plot. But its biggest flaw is the miscasting of Neeson as Dr Martin Harris. Neeson just doesn't have the range required to make this role as effective as the film's plot demands to achieve credibility. And that is a pity because otherwise it may have been challenging Bourne and even some of Hitchcock's best like Saboteur.Dr Harris and wife (Jones) arrive in Berlin for a conference but the doctor mislays an important briefcase and sets in chain a series of events that shock, surprise and confuse. There is a lot of twisting and turning and some excellent cameos from Bruno Ganz as Jurgen a man who finds things out, and Eve Lobau as a nurse who is concerned for Dr Harris's health. It is in these characters we begin to find the Hitchcockian elements.I'd have liked a different ending since the chosen outcome left too many loose ends and perhaps I would have rewritten the entire last twenty minutes in the interests of credibility. But the film is at least competently enough out together to entertain. It could have been a lot better with a little more attention to detail.Six out of ten - Neeson four out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Unknown is a Classy Mystery Thriller that's filmed in a grim & sickly green that makes everything feel off & looks very grimy & urban gritty, also the dead of winter & snowy setting of Berlin add a cold icey atmosphere to this Clever Mystery that is expertly Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, who also directed Liam Neeson in other excellent Thrillers Non-Stop, Run All Night & The Commuter, so he's a top suspenseful Director who brings out the best Thriller performance from the ageing rugged Neeson, abit of a dream team.
Apart from the good cinematography & tone of this movie it's also got a nice suspense-driven music score & a good little supporting cast with January Jones, Diane Kruger, Aidan Quinn & Frank Langella.
If you enjoy a good solid & exciting Mystery Thriller & like a good Neeson film than Unknown is definitely gonna satisfy.
I love Thriller's & love Neeson flicks so i totally enjoyed this entertaining Thriller that could've easily of been made in the 1990's as a slick Thriller with someone like Michael Douglas for example & that's kinda comforting that this type of straight forward action Thriller is still getting made in these over-blown mega-budget & c.g.i obsessed days of movies.
Unknown is a fun, Mystery popcorn Thriller that's perfect for a Saturday night.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's an action thriller,"We went in apprehensive because the first review gave it 1 star. First let me say that this was a good action thriller in the same way Die-hard was made. Instead of American car crashes the Germans were behind these this time and they were quite good too. The main character lands with his wife in Berlin to attend a conference and when a attaché case is forgotten, he quickly runs back to get to the airport to retrieve it. Unfortunately this is were things go wrong because a crash in his taxi makes him end up in a nearby river unconscious. When he wakes up in a hospital without identification or memory; things go array. Diane Kruger portraits a role similar to Franka Potente in the 'Bourne Identity'. She's an asset to the hero and helps him along the way of finding his identity. There are bad guys in this too and the meshing of their evil deeds with our hero trying to stay alive keeps one on the edge of the seat. We weren't bored during the film that's for sure. Several people here commented on other movies that contained similar plots yet believe me this movie can stand on its own. Like the Fugitive the main character goes through different episodes and just gets out of a dilemma in time. The film was made in Berlin and it shows nothing but a dreary city during the winter months and that certainly set the mood. If anyone believes that graffiti is an American product, they will quickly realize that Berlin is saturated with such horrible art too. I suppose all big cities suffer from this. The characters all play their roles well and that's what counts too. It's difficult writing about such a subject without giving too much away. The bottom line is that this film has not failed on sheer entertainment and that is... what it is all about. Yes, it's unrealistic yet what isn't these days when characters must navigate through ordeals and come out of them unscathed. Hey, it's not Eat, Pray..Love, okay... So I say take your popcorn (skip the butter) and enjoy a wild ride through Berlin.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Movie is good, do not listen to the IMDb ""critics"".","I saw first time this movie a long time ago, and a few days ago by mistake I found it again and I said that I need to re-watch it.

This movie managed to keep me in tension and curious about what would happen next, or what he will do to prove that he is who he say he is ... very good movie!Its nice to see Liam Neeson in a movie where he isnt some unstoppable killing machine.
I'm very impressed with doctor Martin's driving skills, he acted like a nascar driver, pretty mad skillz!

Suspenseful and Mysterious,"This would rate as a pretty typical suspense/thriller - which means that there's a lot in it which you just can't take very seriously, but that's OK. It's not meant to be taken seriously. It's to be judged on the basis of how wild the ride is that gets you to the finish, and by that standard this movie works pretty well. There's a lot of mystery, pretty much right off the top, there are people getting killed all over the place and there are two pretty wild car chases through the streets of Berlin. When you add to that a pretty solid cast led by Liam Neeson, you end up with a pretty good and exciting story - a fantasy, certainly, but suspenseful and mysterious, which is what the movie was intended to be.Neeson heads the cast as Dr. Martin Harris, a botanist in Berlin to attend a Conference at which a new strain of corn is to be revealed - one that's resistant to drought and other natural blights and that will help end the world food shortage. But things go wrong from the beginning. He gets into a car accident, ends up in a coma, and when he wakes up no one - not even his wife (played by an actress named January Jones) - remembers who he is, or believes he's Dr. Martin Harris - and in fact there's another Dr. Martin Harris who's taken his place who everyone accepts as THE Dr. Martin Harris. The mystery around his identity takes a lot of twists and turns and keeps the viewer guessing until the mystery is revealed, ultimately leading up to the climax of the movie: a foiled assassination attempt.It's a decent movie; a fun movie to watch. It's not to be taken too seriously. It's to be looked at for its entertainment value in the action/suspense genre. From that perspective, it holds up pretty well. (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
it had me guessing all the way,"I'm not good at guessing plot twists, and I certainly never guessed this one. That's why I thought it was good and entertaining.Liam Neesom(Martin), whom seems to be the new older action hero, has come to Germany with his wife, Liz, for a science conference. He leaves his wife to check into the hotel while he goes back for a suitcase left at the airport. His taxi crashes into the river and he is saved by the driver, Gina. He awakens from a 4 day coma and wonders why his wife is not there. He finds her at the hotel, but she says she doesn't know him. Plus, there is another man that has taken his place. He has no identification to prove he is Dr. Martin Harris.Martin thinks he may be loosing it so goes back to the hospital for tests. A nurse there gives him a name of an investigator. A strange man interrupts his MRI and kills the nurse. Now Martin knows he's being hunted. He tracks down Gina but so do the assassins. We get some cool car chases and action scenes as Martin tries to find out what's going on.He gets his suitcase back and meets an old friend and finally understands. Now he has a chance to right a wrong.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was exciting. I recommend it, it kept me guessing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat!,"Unknown is one of those movies that takes you in one direction for a long time only to completely throw you off track near the end. I was worried at first because I thought this movie was a ripoff of ""Lady Vanishing"". But this film takes the mystery of the main character to another level.While this movie has an interesting plot and keeps you on the edge of your seat, it isn't flawless. What keeps this movie from getting a 9 or 10 for a score is that it does have some moments that are quite unrealistic. This isn't always a big deal in thrillers like Unknown, but this movie actually has a sense of realism that is spoiled now and then.What helps to carry this movie is the strong acting and resulting strong character of Ernst Jurgen (played by the great Bruno Ganz). His performance stands out and helps carry this film.Unknown is a thriller with enough turns to keep you intrigued while helping you forget any of the movie's deficiencies.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nothing new except the Germany factor,"This intriguing psycho thriller really offers nothing quite interesting or new to any one that has seen ""XIII"", ""The Bourne Trilogy"", ""Wrong identity"" and similar movies. A man suffers from amnesia and is looking for his identity and it is quite quickly obvious what his secrets are if you happen to know the mentioned movies.This being said, the movie is still very entertaining and well acted even though there are many clichés. The rich professor must be helped by a poor illegal immigrant girl and the bad boys seem always to be perfectly organized and chase the haunted without pity. The usual car chases and execution scenes underline the lack of originality of the movie. The only thing that distinguishes this movie from many others is the fact that it takes place in Berlin and that many well known and promising German actors got a few roles in this movie and take their chances to convince a larger public. As I happen to be from Germany, I found it interesting to see such a polished psycho thriller take place at famous and infamous locations of the German capital and the movie gives a very little glimpse at the culture of this city by showing its beautiful and ugly sides. This movie creates a certain wanders lust to go and discover the city and makes a good publicity for the country.After all, once you accepted the weak and ripped off story, you really get well entertained and see a solid acting and nice shooting places. I wouldn't suggest to go to the cinema for this movie as it is quite overrated and I wouldn't buy a copy of it in a couple of months, but I would really suggest to rent this movie for a night if you feel for it and in that way, you won't be disappointed if you slow your expectations down as I did. If you found the main idea interesting but you didn't like the movie, go for the ones I have mentioned in the beginning that are fairly better.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Surprising story, a true thriller with depth","If one reads the story line you might think, oh, just an other story of mistaken identity. But the story develops in so much more as just that. Although it does not go very deep into the actual why, the root cause is a partial mystery and actually not that important, it does keep you interested in the movie the whole time. You simply just don't know, you might think you know, but, you won't. The characters are well played, even the extra's. With a Liam Neeson you can expect a quality character, a solid performance, a worthy main character. The car chase scenes and the violence in the movie is for the most part very believable. Accidents, and the cars are very maimed, not much in the way of Hollywood style nonsense explosions, jumping cars and stuff like that. No, believable action. The setting, Berlin, lends itself well for interesting background, we should see more of such movies set in proper European cities with style, history, substance. The actual outcome is rather surprising although the very end of the movie is not very strong. During the movie there are some moments from which you think ""they could have made more out of it, more thrillery"". However, see my score, a 9, it is still so very worth watching and I am sure that in the future I will watch it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Implausible at a few parts but it kept me engaged throughout,"The lessons I learned after watching this movie - one: never leave your briefcase at the airport. Two: Mercedes-Benz makes damn sturdy taxis. Three: Liam Neeson continues to be a badass even when he's nearly 60.""Unknown"" is mostly a mystery thriller - Liam Neeson's character awakens from his coma after an accident to find out that someone else has taken his identity - and nobody believes him. The plot weaves through the streets of Berlin and some shady characters - with the all too typical thriller lesson of not trusting anyone.The film is briskly paced, there are slow moments but every 10 minutes there's an action sequence liven up the film, and it's especially during the last half of the film that the action sequences pile up after another. The action is fast and brutal for a PG-13 movie, and is shot quite clearly without annoying shaky camera for the most part, especially during the car chase scenes, while the fluid editing completes the job by adequately pacing the film to be fast or slow if necessary.And then there's Neeson. Here he is surrounded by both old and new familiar faces. There's Aidan Quinn and Frank Langella as the people with mysterious vibes, and then there's Diane Kruger and January Jones as the lovely-looking ladies but yet there's something not quite right about both of them. German actors Bruno Ganz (""Downfall"") and Sebastian Koch (""The Lives of Others"") round out the impressive supporting cast, with Ganz commanding the screen every time he appears. But it is Neeson, his age becoming more visible as the years pass, still giving a high- energy and determined performance that becomes the heart of the film and thus cements him as an (late-blooming) action hero/star of this generation. He is believable in the fight scenes, and his humble charisma gets the audience firmly on his side.And yet this film has its ups and downs. On the positive note, Jaume Collet-Serra's direction keeps the actors focused and the action intense, with the cinematography of Berlin showing both its glamorous and gritty side, what with its blueish hue and whatnot. John Ottman and Alexander Rudd provide a tense music score to the action. On the negative side, some parts had me suspending my disbelief in certain scenes. There is a twist at the end of the movie which I admit did not really see coming, but it wasn't exactly original as I've seen this plot device done in another movie before.But overall, it's a very solid thriller. It gripped my attention from start to finish, and it kept me guessing on many occasions. It too, made me think a bit about the bad guys - how smart and terrifying their methods are to get what they want at the expense of other innocents. Will this win any Oscars, no. Will Liam Neeson fans love it, I guess so. Will this entertain, definitely. I wouldn't mind watching this again if I had the time and company.P.S. This would make a great advert for Mercedes Benz cabs in Germany.Overall value: 66/100",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fun surprise plot twist otherwise ...,"Neeson as always, gives us a good performance - supporting characters are average to good with some thugs being B film quality. The photography is pretty bad, dark places designed to give you a feeling of suffocation or claustrophobia, blurred action designed to give you a feel of movement but all combines for just poor cinematography (imo) Gets draggy and boring in the earlier stages of the film but the action picks up midway with some scenes being longer than needed to make a point. Chases and fights too long but good action otherwise.Good mystery line that I thought could have been played on much much better with better screen writing but overall, a good way to kill a few hours if you have absolutely nothing better to do - certainly not a waste of time if you've already watched everything else on your ""need to see"" list. I love the plot twist -",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining!,"I don't understand why so many people are complaining and giving it so less rating. I mean, this is true that the movie had so many flaws and many concepts were implausible. Still, it had many plus points.The best thing about the movie is that it is fast paced, and it keeps your interest intact. While watching it, you are always attached with the mystery the movie is creating. Even the climax is good.Now, the problem happens is when you finish the movie. After the climax is revealed, many viewers start asking lots of questions to themselves, joining the puzzles (many of which don't make much sense). They start having negative impressions. Come on! I don't get why people get so negatively. I'm sure that you might have enjoyed it while watching it. Doesn't it matter? I will highly recommend this movie to anyone who like fast-paced Action-Thriller. The movie handles it very well, and will provide you lot of entertaining stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bourne again,"There's not a lot one can say about this without giving away the plot surprises. It started out reminding me of other Hitchcock 'hommages' like FRANTIC or Liam Neeson's own TAKEN. The fact that Neeson's character here loses his memory in a near-drowning inevitably recalls THE BOURNE IDENTITY, and the parallels with the Bourne movies were soon coming thick and fast: urban car chases (good stunt work or CGI?), the girl (Diane Kruger) who saves our hero more than once, the treacherous people supposedly on Neeson's side. And Neeson's character develops along similar lines to Jason B.This is one of those films that you find yourself picking holes in as soon as you're out of the cinema. ""Why didn't he/she do/say that?"" The answer tends to be: ""Because the movie would have only lasted 10/20/30 minutes."" So: pacey and twisting, yes. But also, contrived and derivative. Entertaining enough while you're watching it, but really no more ""meat content"" than a Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle. Not in the same class as the Bourne Trilogy: Matt Damon retains his title.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Running in Europe is Neeson's full time job now?,"Judging by the poster and the plot synopsis this movie seemed like a cash-in on the success of ""Taken"" (even more so than ""Taken 2""), but I was surprised by the different style and the fact that Neeson is slightly less implausibly bad-ass. He's just an average guy that tries to prove everybody is framing him, he doesn't do much fighting but it isn't required to keep the compelling plot interesting. The story is genuinely well-crafted and gives you a conclusion that you don't see coming from miles away (unless you're amazing at that type of thing). Oh, and Bruno ""hey, isn't that Hitler from Der Untergang?"" Ganz is in this, a highly underrated actor that effortlessly adds a bit of class to any movie he's in. In the end things may get a bit unbelievable, but the movie's twist is such a great find that I doubt you'll mind the lack of realism.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fun for what it is,"At the time that I am writing this, this movie has 72.7% 10/10 out of 687 votes. Together with a trailer that looked to me like it could be more than just a joyride, I expected that this would be a more meaningful movie starring Liam Neeson and not another ""Taken"". Unfortunately for me, that expectation was wrong.If you go in expecting a nice ride with a couple of twists somewhat similar to ""Taken"", you'll get what you want. But if you expect more... no such luck. How the story is wrapped up is pure cliché and the movie even includes that seemingly never-ending car chase that had at least me yawning. It would have been great if ""Unknown"" would have actually dealt more in-depth with the terror of memory loss and identity theft and other possible developments I will not go into because I don't want to spoil anything. There are some interesting twists in the movie but they're of the mainstream kind, not the thoughtful one.Being a native German speaker, what was very impressive to me about this movie was how the creators did not shy away from plastering ""Unknown"" with German details. A decent amount of subtitles, a huge amount of papers/signs/etc. in German on screen throughout the movie - this definitely does not feel like it could have been filmed anywhere else. Although thanks to CG it may well have been. Still, basically every scene reminds you that you're not in that average-city that so many movies seem to play in.Overall, an impressively done film that is simply lacking substance and there were one or two visual effects that looked inadequate for a production of this category. As I argued in the beginning - it is all about what you expect/want from ""Unknown"".",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Unknown Where The Movie Was Going,"Liam Neeson strikes again in a movie that I swear was going to be Taken 2 in the trailers, only to be a completely different movie. However, by the end of the movie, they might as well call it Taken 2.The movie follows Dr. John Martin (Liam Neeson) and his wife Liz (January Jones, who's just phoning it in for a paycheck this time around)on a plane to Berlin. Once they arrive to their hotel, Liz has a problem with the hotel reservations and Neeson forgot his luggage. So instead of telling his wife, ""Hey honey, I forgot my luggage. I'll be right back."" He just leaves. What a jerk.But on his way back to the airport, a mishap happens on the road and they spin off course, over a bridge and into a river. The taxi driver, Gina (Diane Kruger)rescues the unconscious Neeson and he wakes up in a hospital after being in a coma for four days. During those four days, his wife never visited him once. Maybe if he told her that he was leaving, ah never mind.So Neeson ignores doctor's orders and goes back to the hotel only to find that his wife doesn't remember him and she's with some guy who claims to be him. Soon Neeson goes nuts and is escorted out of the hotel and back to the hospital. Neeson thinks he might just be going crazy from the coma, but then the bad guys spoil that thought by trying to kill him.Why are the bad guys trying to kill him? I was wondering that too. Why did the wife not remember him or, maybe, PRETENDING to not remember him? I didn't know and I waited for the movie's explanation. When it is revealed (and yes it is revealed), it was so contrived that I sat livid in my seat. The third act to this movie was such a mess and the explanations given to what was really going on made this almost a completely different movie. Why did they go this route? Were the writers stuck on where to go with this concept? It sure seemed like it. Writer's Block can sometimes be a hindrance to the overall writing process that it would effect the total outcome to your film. I'm surprised the actors went with it as there are some good performances to be had in this.I'd rather see Taken again before seeing this one. It wasn't a horrible film as the action scenes were top notch. I didn't care for some of the jump cuts in the fighting scenes as I couldn't tell what was going on. But with some truly nasty villains and heart pumping chase scenes, it was at least entertaining. Now Liam, go make Taken 2!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This type of film has to be one of two things,"Either the action in a film like this makes you forgiving of the plot holes, or the plot has to be solid, and clever. Sadly, this film succeeds on neither front.The action is bland in most places, and apart from a car chase or two that work to a point, it's not worth watching the movie for. Don't expect Jason Bourne or Ronin, or anything even close. Most of the action feels like it belongs in a B-movie.The plot however is worse. There's an endless series of decisions by characters and chains of cause and effect that only make sense if you don't stop to think about them for a second. Discussing them would be a major spoiler, but at least three major characters could have easily avoided their own deaths on separate occasions, if they had just avoided doing the one thing they didn't have to, which was almost certainly going to get them killed.The basic premise of the plot is sort of believable, but the main character becomes less believable as his story unravels. This movie is somewhat entertaining for as long as you believe it can still be salvaged - but in the end it's a waste of time.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Solid thriller with solid mystery but lacks desperation and claustrophobia in the delivery,"It is a familiar scenario in films to find an ordinary man pulled into a crime bigger than him and unable to turn to the authorities. Hitchcock did it several times (39 Steps, Lady Vanishes, North by Northwest), Johnny Depp did it in Nick of Time and now Liam Neeson gets a run at it. The plot here sees him in Berlin when a car accident puts him in a coma for a few days. When he comes to (without ID) his wife seems to not know him and indeed already has a husband of his name, and who also has full knowledge of everything he claims to know as well. Starting to believe maybe he is crazy, he rapidly learns he is not whenever someone tries to kill him.Having already punched and kicked his way across most of Paris in Taken, here we get a less action-orientated film in Berlin and the outcome is not quite as fun as Taken although it is a bit more engaging in terms of plot and ideas. The viewer is held pretty well by events on the screen and most of us will have hoped for at least a semi-decent solution to the mystery. Personally I didn't see the solution coming and, although a bit so-so, it was still good enough to do the job and kinda make sense within the internal logic of the film. However since the solution is reasonable simple (comparatively) and comes quickly, the film does spend a lot of time hanging around in the mystery, doing not too much till the solution comes. There are chases and fights but where the film fails is a sense of the world collapsing around Harris. He doesn't quite have the desperation that Harrison Ford had in Frantic (for example) and it is less engaging and exciting as a result.It still goes through the motions though and some of it is enjoyable as a basic thriller but the sense of losing everything and being desperate to get to the bottom of it all is only ever spoken – not really ever felt. The direction from Collet-Serra is part of it; everything looks professional and money has been spent but he doesn't find the claustrophobia that he needed to find in his scenes and, when it comes down to what the film needed him to do, he is by the numbers, letting the plot do the telling, not his camera. Neeson is a solid oak again – he doesn't have a lot of flair but considering he is 60 next year he convinces in the action roles he has had recently; he cannot find his character's panic though, which is a shame. Kruger is solid in support, as is Jones and Quinn. I liked Quinn here as he had a good character and played it well (but will he ever get away from the YouTube thing?). Langella is a nice bit of casting as he does have a presence naturally.Overall Unknown is a solid thriller that goes by the numbers, provides the solid solution it had to find and gets out with car chases and guns in its wake. It lacks a real delivery that would have made it great though; it is delivered without any great sense of what it is doing and the director never gets the desperation and claustrophobia that the mystery really could have done with to engage the viewer. It is OK to watch, but watching was all I was doing.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not as good as Taken, but mildly entertaining","The first half hour of this film is excellent. Somewhat Hitchcockian in theme and atmosphere, the film focuses on Dr. Martin Smith, in Berlin with his wife for a biotechnology conference where he's a presenter. But his briefcase is left at the airport; he goes back for it...and there the fun begins.In many ways this movie reminded me of the Harrison Ford film ""Frantic,"" in which Ford played a doctor visiting Paris to attend a conference. After checking in to his hotel, he loses his wife. Did he even have a wife? With everyone so skeptical of him, he has to investigate her all by himself, at some point picking up a young hottie who gets drawn into helping him.Unknown is the same thing, only different. The problem in in the second act where the story should be developed...convincingly. There are a number of twists, but they pop up too late and too abruptly so you end up guffawing at them. Despite those flaws, I did find it entertaining in spots and wouldn't mind watching it again...on DVD.Considerable acting talent was employed in this film. Liam Neeson, Bruno Ganz, and Frank Langella are la creme de la creme. I'm sure both Langella & Ganz knew the script was entirely working, but, hey, a payday is a payday.Taken, by comparison, is a superior movie. This film is like Frantic, the Bourne Identity, and the Long Kiss Goodnight all rolled together but not blended very well.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Its scary that people can actually play with your mind like this!,"I am now thinking that you cannot lose when putting your hard earned cash down on a movie starring Liam Neeson! When he first started doing leads in flicks i was only used to his character work and so i unfairly labelled him. He seems to bring it every time much like Harrison Ford used to ( I often compare the two, not looks wise but just their choices are very similar when it comes to their choices in dramatic thriller scripts. Jaume Collet-Serra has the directing duties here (known for Orphan, House Of Wax) and he brings us the story of one man's plight to restore his identity amongst many obstacles. Apon arriving in Berlin Germany, Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) and his wife Liz (January Jones) go to check into a hotel, just as they are entering the hotel, Martin acknowledges the fact that his briefcase with all his passports and various items of importance has been left behind at the airport without notifying Liz of the fact he jumps into a cab in a rush effort to return to the airport to collect it. Along the way there the cab he is in becomes involved in a accident. Dr. Harris is rushed to the hospital where he awakes 4 days later with a splitting headache but all the same he rushes out of the hospital in a bid to get back to his (who by now should be dealing in 3 degrees of hysteria) He arrives back at the hotel only to have his wife not know who he is and she is accompanied by another man Dr. Martin Harris!

Decent Neeson action flick.,"Pacing was pretty good. It had a few nice twists and who can resist a movie with Bruno Ganz? Only thing that didn't make sense(besides the goofs listed) were the police motorcycles driving in snow and ice outside of the hotel.

Solid thriller,"Dr. Martin Harris(Liam Neeson)and his beautiful wife Elizabeth(Mad Mens, January Jones) are flying to Berlin for a conference.

Martin wakes up in the hospital, and discovers he's been in coma for four days, and remembers very little about himself. When he gets out of the hospital, and gets back to the hotel, to see his wife, she doesn't seem to know who he is, and another man(Aiden Quinn) takes his place. So is Martin going nuts, or is there a conspiracy going on here?A very solid thriller, that is intense has it goes on, keeps building to an awesome climax.

Getting Past the Premise . . .,"is one of Hollywood's greatest difficulties. The idea, the pitch, the hook, whatever you want to call it is not enough to carry a movie. I got wrapped up in Liam Neeson's character's story very quickly, and I stayed there for a a little while, but I knew the movie was in trouble when I saw January Jones, a woman so cold and calculating, so damaged in Mad Men, that it mars her beauty. If Mrs. Neeson was a baddie, then the mystery would be tainted.I saw at least two other movies retold in Unknown, something with Sean Connery as an Arab peacemaker and Mirage, with Gregory Peck. The Connery flick was junk, but Mirage was great.Unknown will never be confused with greatness. It's just too pat, too slick. I never accepted Liam (I'm going to growl a lot like Nick Nolte) Neeson as a botanist with a trophy wife. The co-inky-dinks were just too much. By the time the back story of Neeson is told, I had intellectually closed my locker. By the third reel, I was thinking/thanking this was free (TNT).I've got Taken on deck. I think I'm maxed out on Liam--I've liked him in so many things that seeing him morph into an action hero is just too much.But, when we get Netflix back someday soon, I'll be ready for more Mad Men, an opportunity to see January Jones again, the luminescent beauty with the Gorgon on the inside.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""What is known can become un-known"" Friedrich Nietzsche","(I made up the above quote by the way)This is a preposterous movie and I have never seen one more-so. It is that way by design, with the sole purpose to exasperate the viewer for much of its run-time, then wipe the confusion and anger away with late reveal. And upon learning the ""twist"", the viewer is supposed to feel the relief of understanding.All well and good, but if you view the film a second time, in full knowledge of the twist, you will still be shocked at the series of outrageous events and strange coincidences that drive the premise.I just can't abide a movie, based nominally in the ""real world"", that requires so much suspension of disbelief. I will close this mini-review with the most minor example: Liam Neeson explains to a scientist (paraphrasing from memory), ""When I was 10 years, I told my father I wanted to be a botanist."" That is not an example of a plot hole, because it inconsequential to the plot. But it is the least plausible sentence ever uttered on film.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Does what it says on the tin...,"Very well made with some very slick editing keeping the pace pretty high all the way through. It did feel a little like a travelogue in parts, giving us all the iconic views of Berlin whenever the plot brings the action outside. To be fair though, there are a few seedier parts of the city shown as well. All the main cast played their parts well with Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger standing out. I also enjoyed the performance of Bruno Ganz as the ageing former Stazi agent and it was nice to see Frank Langella as Martin's old colleague, Rodney Cole. Over all, a decent watch that doesn't really break any new ground but does what it says on the tin (and I can't knock it for that).SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.0/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Formula, but with some innovation - quite enjoyable","Not a bad flick.It's an old formula, along the lines of The Bourne Identity-type amnesia and spy stories, but this has an extra little twist on it that I thought was quite clever.The performances are fine, and it's always nice to see Bruno Ganz in anything. I now know from 3 different films that the guy speaks German, French and English - but then most Europeans (in fact most people in the world), speak at least 2 languages.I enjoyed too seeing the major landmarks of Berlin, in the snow, including the shopping centre where I bought my fave pair of jeans!I've taken a couple of stars off:1 star - it was formula, and even though it was good I'm just sick of the old-world Hollywood, they need to grow or die.2 stars - there is some absolutely ridiculous hollywoodism later in the film, some real far-fetchedness (can't go into details without ticking the Spoiler box).

This! This is not Happening!,"***SPOILERS*** In what looks like a combination of two Harrison Ford thrillers ""The Fugitive, and "" Frantic"" Liam Neeson plays Biotech, who specializes in plant life, professor Martin Harris who in a matter of days loose not only his identify but but his pretty blond wife Elizabeth, January Jones, as well.Attending a biotechnology summit at the Adlon Hotel in downtown Berlin Harris notices that he left his briefcase and all his papers and document at the Berlin airport and takes a taxi there to retrieve it. With the taxi involved in a smash up on the Berlin Bidge Harris is rescued by the cab driver Gina, Diane Kruger, who takes off before the police arrives! As we soon learn Gina is an illegal immigrant from Bosnia and fears that she may be deported back there if the police find out about her status in the country.It's at the hospital that Harris coming out of a coma senses that something isn't right in finding out from the Berlin Police Department that his wife Elizabeth never filed a missing person report on him with him being hospitalized for four days! All that with him as well as the hospital staff, in that Harris didn't have any identification on him, not being able to contact her! It's later when Harris taking off against his doctors orders arrives at the Adlon Hotel to see his wife that he finds her with another man , Aidan Quinn, who claims to be her husband Martin Harris!In an effort to find out who he is Harris, or whoever he is, tries to track down the cab driver Gina who by getting involved with him ends up putting her life on the line! In that Harris is now targeted for elimination by these two hit-men Smith & Jones, Oliver Schneider & Stipe Erceg, since despite his amnesia he knows too much about what's really going to happen at the biotechnology summit that he and Elizeabth are to attend. It was at the hospital that nurse Gretchen Erfurt, Eva Lobau, tipped Harris off to where to get help in finding himself by getting in touch with her good friend former East German intelligence agent Ernst Jurgen, Bruno Ganz. As it later turned out both Nurse Erfurt and Mr. Jurgen ended up losing their lives in trying to help Harris find out just who he is which in fact was by far the biggest mystery in the entire movie!***SPOILERS*** Liam Neeson looked very uncomfortable playing a brainy botanically professor Martin Harris but really got into stride when he took off the gloves and started kicking butt all over Berlin in him finally finding out that he was in fact a plant, figuratively not literally, together with his old lady Elizabeth put into the biotechnology summit to assassinate Prof. Leo Bessler, Sebastian Koch. It's Prof. Bessler who had invented this new crop,that can grown in any kind of weather or environment, that will put the world's food conglomerates out of business! What's even more shocking to Harris is that he together with Elizabeth was the one who planted the bomb at the hotel some three months earlier to go off just when Prof. Bressler was to give his speech in making his new wonder crop available to the world's nations at no charge! This was to eliminate hunger as well as eliminating the profits of the major food conglomerates who are behind the plot to murder him and everyone else at the summit!Getting down to the business at hand Martin with his memory now completely recovered goes after those who are out to spoil the party, the biotechnology summit, by exposing both Harris, the impostor, and his phony wife Elizabeth who together with their boss master spy and assassin Rodney Coal, Frank Langella, are out to turn it into a German version of 9/11. We have two exciting car chases as well as a confrontation between Harris and Harris at the Adlon Hotel with the bomb that Harris planted there that's set to go off at any moment. In the end Harris after taking care of business, Rodney Coal & his hoods, takes off for Canada with Gina who saved his life more then once in the movie where they can get away from all the dangerous spy and assassination business that they found themselves involved in Berlin.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Worth watching, and watching again","Fortunately, much better than what looked like a copy-cat Inception film from the marketing. The marketing of films lately has been horrible, with the exception of that for horrible films. Sanctum, for example, is one of the best new films in theaters and it's already been pulled from half or more of the theaters it played.Back to Unknown, it has an interesting and exceptionally used setting in Germany, along with very authentic filming, at least when car chases and explosions aren't involved. It rarely feels like your watching something filmed in a studio with a green-screen. The story also does a good job of leaving you hanging. Just when you think you know what's going on, there's another twist. Even when a character tells you what's going on, you're not sure if the character is lying. Something like a Philip K. Dick story without the sci-fi (OK, there's a little sci-fi).About the only real thing wrong with it are the car chases and bombs (actually labeled plastic explosive - if you're going to oversimplify that much, you should at least add some humor/insight to it by putting a logo/brand name on it of an actual military contractor). Token, cliché action that would have been better cut. None of this kills the story, just annoying.Overall, worth watching and watching again.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
More Suspense Element than Taken,"Okay, we all know we can compare this to Taken. Same actor: Liam Neeson. Near the same location: Eastern Europe. Similar plot as far as rescuing/redeeming a person/persona. Yet, there are enough differences in this movie to make the experience stand out from Taken.First off, Taken is more of a ""go-get-em action/thriller"", and during that experience you were confident in Liam's ability to pummel through every obstacle that got in his way. Unknown is more of a dark suspense. It has good action, but it is scattered and mostly contains mystery, questionable phenomena, and thought-provoking circumstances as your entertainment.Here I (and probably other viewers) felt less certain about Liam's capabilities mainly because he is playing DEFENSE instead of OFFENSE, plus with the aid of the identity context itself. Liam certainly doesn't feel invincible here. There are many tense, close-call type situations that don't necessarily involve fighting and jumping onto a boat.Also, the plot of Taken is almost as straightforward as it could get, finding his daughter through one witness, one trafficker one locale at a time. Don't get me wrong, Taken was fun, but as soon as Unknown really settles in, it feels as if there are three or so antagonists/enemies at the same time and therefore provokes many more questions that you want answered. I have to give credit to the use of multiple characters who were quite unpredictable, by the end when you look back to the beginning and see all that's transpired you feel like NONE of the characters were who they used to be. Last note, the photography was satisfying. Throughout the film it has a dreary/overcast/stormy type of feel that emphasizes the tension and downward motion of Liam Neeson's feelings towards his sanity.With respect to Taken, overall it's a chilling, twisty, and enjoyable experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

And now he must find some connection to his real self and to prove himself. It's not so easy at it seems as even he is confused over the reality and what could be unreal due to his accident injuries. But soon he realizes that there is a daring mystery behind his lost ID.Unknown is nothing equal to reality. But for the mere fact of thrill and mystery it is entertaining. Vaguely resembles Born Identity with a somewhat similar plot and action taking place in Europe. High speed car chases which stops at nothing and brutal hand to hand combat are big pluses in this thriller.The plot is indeed interesting. However looses the grip a bit after the first half becoming more unrealistic. It's mysterious and makes the viewer to come to conclusions over small details yet prove them all wrong at the end. There are few good twists and some mundane moments as well.Good performance by Liam Neeson portraying a confused intelligent man who is desperately trying to get back to his wife and his life. But this is not his best.

One of my favorites,"I've watched this movie over and over again. It has everything in an action/suspense/thriller that I like. To boot, Liam is one of my top favorite actors.

waste of talent,"Jason Bourne meets Harrison Ford in ""Frantic"". Maybe that was the pitch though I doubt Polanski's '88 thriller would ring many bells with today's Hollywood green lighters. ""Unknown"" Liam Neeson is quoted as saying (IMDB) ""Acting is invigorating. But I don't analyse it too much. It's like a dog smelling where it's going to do its toilet in the morning."" Judging by this and other recent performances Mr Neeson will produce ordure at will. Diane Kruger has a brave stab at the beautiful-but-complex European babe so excellently portrayed by Emmanuelle Seigner and Franka Potente in the films mentioned earlier, but is let down badly by the stale material, laughable plot and the appallingly wooden acting of her main man, not to mention the sub-Sweeney awfulness of the baddies. But perhaps the most shocking waste here is the talent of Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella. Having to watch Bruno go through some truly terrible exposition when explaining to dimwitted Neeson what the Stasi was - ""you mean the East German secret police??"" - I had to shed a tear for this star of Wings of Desire. As for Langella, a man who gave a masterclass performance in Polanski's much underrated Ninth Gate, the best thing that can be said about him is how he wore his raincoat.I can understand why older actors are keen to keep going and even getting caught up in nonsense like this for a hip young Spanish director of music videos might seem flattering and rejuvenating but it is a poor day for movie lovers when they are required to turn in work like this.As for the subject of amnesia, it has boundless possibilities, even within the confines of a commercial thriller.

It could have been more concise,"If you're expecting ""Taken 2"" then you may be disappointed. But even if we're not comparing it to ""Taken"" and judging it by its own right, i didn't feel that it had enough action in then what the trailer promised. I thought the plot was something different, unique and unpredictable. I had no idea what was going to happen which was really good as it kept you guessing and wondering how it will all work out. It had its moments of action and suspense, where you really paid attention and found it exciting, but i felt that there were many long, still moments which could have been shortened and the film could have been more concise. The characters were OK, nothing deep or Oscar worthy but good enough to keep you watching. Also, strangely enough, i felt that Liam Neeson didn't act to the best of his abilities, at times it was all shouting and no emotion, but it's Liam Neeson so you can't criticise him. Plus, they always say that an actor is as only as good as his script.

An interesting and compelling idea for a film that is extremely well acted yet doesn't deliver on the narrative side,"An interesting and compelling idea for a film that is extremely well acted yet doesn't deliver on the narrative side. Unknown follows a couple in Berlin, Dr. Martin Harris, played by Liam Neeson, and Elizabeth Harris, played by the jaw-dropping January Jones. Martin is a scientist and is in Berlin to speak at a Bio Tech Summit and his wife is just tagging along. When they arrive at the hotel, Martin realizes that he left his briefcase at the airport with his passport in it. He hails a cab with Diane Kruger driving and on the way there gets in an accident and is in a coma for four days. When Martin awakes and finally finds his wife, she doesn't know who he is, another Martin Harris is with her that she says is her husband and he can not provide any real ID that says he's Martin Harris. What's nice here is that this all happens within 15 minutes after the opening credits. There's no time wasted on developing the problem and thus creating suspense and fear from the start. From here he tries to figure out what's going on, is he crazy? is there something more going on?, while also believing he is being followed. I don't want to say much more than that at this point because I don't want to give anything away.The cast is great here. Liam Neeson is good no matter what role he's doing (well maybe not Zeus), and he's in familiar territory here playing a much tamer version of his role from Taken. I haven't seen much of January Jones, well I haven't seen much of her acting I guess is more appropriate, but after this I am very excited to check out Mad Men as well as being that much more pumped to see the new X-Men. Diane Kruger plays the cab driver that crashes and causes Martin's coma, however she becomes an integral character further in the storyline. As for Langella, he plays one of Martin's friends that could potentially help him provide proof of his identity, but he only really shows up for about 15 minutes towards the end of the film. It's a very strong cast but it loses itself in the pacing and narrative of the story itself.The director, Jaume Collet-Serra, is a little over his head on this one, with some of his past credits including the remake of House of Wax and Orphan. He does do a very nice job in the first half of the film showing the anxiety and fear of Martin not knowing if he really is Martin while being in an unfamiliar location. Where he fails is through his pacing. The film feels very boring and somewhat predictable (which could accredited more to the trailer, I pretty much had it figured it out from the previews and that should never happen). The action scenes are few and far between and don't really deliver. There is one decent car chase scene and the final fight scene is very well done and a lot of fun to watch, but others are just forgettable. Then in between the action scenes Collet-Serra slows it down too much with the mystery part of the story instead of trying to make the it more suspenseful with the answer slowing coming to be. Instead he hits you with the solution all in one scene and to be honest I was a little let down by it. I feel like it was pretty anti-climatic but that's all I can really say without giving anything away.The idea behind the story is very interesting and could be extremely compelling but it just wasn't delivered very well here. The first act is exciting and full of what the hell is going on moments but after that it's pretty weak until the finale. Also, some of the scenes are very reminiscent of Taken and makes me think that they are just trying to get in on the Taken money. I mean its Liam Neeson, in a foreign country, looking for answers and fighting a bunch of people in between. It not quite worth the theater admission but worth the wait for Blu-ray/DVD, right around the time when you'll forget the trailers that showed way too much information. But if you're a fan of a good mystery and a Neeson fan I recommend it. You might be slightly bored in the middle part of the film, but just remember that January Jones will be back on screen momentarily.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Nothing about Unknown is exceptional, most of it isn't bad - it only purports to show a moral which it actually doesn't have.

Liam Neesen is excellent as usual. He does a great job portraying a man who no one seems to recognize. Diane Kruger also gives a strong performance. The action scenes are very good.The last part of the movie just does not match up to the thrilling first parts. I thought the final revelations of why Neesen's character went through what he did this were very weak.The PG 13 rating is appropriate.

He was helped along the way by Diane Kruger, playing Gina. And the supporting cast did a good job as well. I especially enjoyed Bruno Ganz, playing Ernst Jürgen.

A Nutshell Review: Unknown,"One good turn deserves another. Liam Neeson is like fine wine and gets better with age. He's pushing 60, but that doesn't mean he cannot kick ass, which he did to perfection as an ex black ops hunting down his daughter and her abductors through the streets of Paris. In Unknown, he plays Dr Martin Harris, a researcher invited to a bio-technology congress in Berlin, only to find his identification papers missing, getting involved in a near fatal accident, and if his week has not been great, culminates in having his wife no longer recognizing him, and acknowledging another as the husband/himself instead. Talk about a major identity crisis and theft!Based on the novel Out of My Head by Didier Van Cauwelaert, this Euro-thriller directed by Jaume Collet-Serra uses plenty of familiar plot elements of such mystery thrillers, but turn them completely on their heads that they are still able to provide the necessary thrills and spills complete with twists and turns that makes this one heck of an intelligent film, albeit with some minor loopholes. But don't let that detract you from what seemed like an update of The Fugitive, with the protagonist on a constant run from those who want him dead, while at the same time assembling bits and pieces of information that can be used to prove his innocence, or in this case, identity.Identity theft has always fascinated, and I suppose one should be of some value, be it social stature or credit, for someone to try and impersonate you, more easily online than in person, given our connectivity these days, where photographs, websites and social media networks probably serving as that double edged sword in having our identities proved, or stolen. Neeson's Martin Harris finds to his amazement that his closest kin in a foreign land would want to pretend not to know him, and the set up for the mystery here is of course the presence of someone (Aidan Quinn) who purports to be the same person, leading one to wonder how far does the conspiracy go, and to what value and involvement is Martin Harris up against.I believe Liam Neeson can probably now sleepwalk through roles like this one, with his size giving him that physical edge in fisticuffs, those deep facial lines adding that sense of intellect and gravitas, and that iconic, booming voice that just screams authority. Aiding his character is Diane Kruger as Gina the illegal immigrant part time taxi driver who had picked up Dr. Martin Harris early in the film, and found herself, her passenger and her cab plunge into a river no thanks to an accident, and being on the wrong side of things, stuck in the same conspiracy that Harris is trying to unravel.For fans of the German film Downfall, or that of the well-spoofed clip of Hitler ranting in his bunker, will find Bruno Ganz no stranger. As Ernst Jurgen the one time East German military intelligence who hears of Harris' far fetched story and had piqued his interest, perhaps amongst all the scenes in the film, the one involving Ganz opposite Frank Langella is my favourite from the film, that goes to show that the elderly have enough between them to hold the film through a critical scene, hinting of danger throughout yet never necessitating big action sequences to steal everyone's thunder.And credit of course goes to the director who kept the pace quick, the story tight, and containing enough action - the car chase sequence was impressively designed so kudos to the stunt team for pulling it off - to keep it engaging for an audience. Collet-Serra's filmography is very mixed at best, responsible for the horror film House of Wax, the footballing drama Goal II, and another psychological thriller Orphan, that will put this effort of his as probably the best one yet. Granted there is a huge parallel with one of the more contemporary spy thrillers in the last decade, but to mention that by name will blunt one's enjoyment at not knowing just what may pop up.For fans of Taken, this is a worthy follow up, perhaps not as much action as the former, but definitely as engaging from a story perspective. Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Familiar mish-mash,"UNKNOWN is one of those silly films which rehashes the same themes and plots of other, better movies in an attempt to make some money, instead of thinking up new, original concepts. At first glance, this seems to be a slightly supernatural thriller about a man being haunted by his own doppelganger, bringing to mind the Roger Moore flick THE MAN WHO HAUNTED HIMSELF. Having just watched the movie, it failed to fulfil any of my expectations and turned out to be a rather unappetising mix of three rather more recent films.The film it most obviously recalls is TAKEN, the top-notch action flick which reinvented Neeson as an action star. Neeson's trapped in Europe again, fending off various bad guys, although this is far from being an action movie; the fight scenes, unlike those in TAKEN, aren't up to much. Then there are the plot twists and turns, and the whole amnesic storyline which brings THE BOURNE IDENTITY to mind. Thematically, though, I was most reminded of the excellent Roman Polanski thriller FRANTIC, which saw Harrison Ford searching for his missing wife in Paris.UNKNOWN has a familiar look and feel to its storyline and few things that take place during the running time will come as a real surprise. Neeson is sleepwalking through his role, and Diane Kruger has very little to do, but both of their performances look masterful in comparison to January Jones' excruciating turn as Neeson's wife – seriously, who told this woman she could act? Aidan Quinn pops up in a minor role which makes you wonder what happened to him, and Frank Langella is in the movie even less. The excellent Bruno Ganz has pretty much the same type of mentor/support role as he did in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE remake.Despite being superficially entertaining during its running time, in the end UNKNOWN fails because of the sheer ludicrous nature of its plot. It holds the attention while you watch, but soon afterwards you sit back and realise that most of the the story is based on contrivance and coincidence. As such, it's certainly not a film you'll be in any hurry to watch a second time around.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Completely different to Taken,"Since 'Unknown' was announced, the internet has been abuzz with talk of it being another 'Taken', a film responsible for re-branding Liam Neeson as an action-man of sorts. And why not? 'Taken' received a lot of positivity for its high-octane, no-bullshit action and gained Neeson a whole new following, begging for more.Comparisons are inevitable, considering the way that 'Unknown' has been marketed. Trailers show Neeson once again in a predicament, rampaging his way through another European city. The marketing team might as well have made posters for Taken 2 given the (intentional) lack of originality. The problem is, 'Unknown' is not that film. With the exception of a few surface similarities, the two films are entirely different.During a visit to Berlin, Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) has a traffic accident that puts him in a coma. When he returns to normal life, nobody believes he is who he is. His wife (January Jones) doesn't recognise him, and to make things worse, another man has taken his place, doing his work and living his life. With the help of an illegal immigrant (Diane Kruger), he sets out to reclaim his identity.'Unknown' has much more in common with the mystery thrillers of the '60s than it does with the action-heavy 'Taken'. Characters stumble from one incident to another and the emphasis is on the mood rather than on the adrenaline. The occasional bit of violence and the one car chase do not drive the story, but add to it. While Neeson played a lethal predator in 'Taken', as Martin Harris he is a normal man, disturbed and puzzled by his predicament as anyone would be. As a result, his character feels much more vulnerable, which allows a much more realistic sense of threat.The first half of the film capitalises on this. As Harris' world is turned upside-down, it is uncertain whether he is brain-damaged from his accident, or if there really is a conspiracy against him. Does hearing footsteps behind you mean that you're being followed? When those footsteps quicken, does it mean that you're being chased, or is it just somebody trying to catch a train? Director Jaume Collet-Serra creates a real sense of persecution and does a great job of blurring the line between paranoia and reality.The rest of the film is less remarkable. The writing gets a little too imaginative for the serious tone established, and stretches plausibility almost to breaking point. The questions asked in the first half of the film are answered with too much exposition, and loose ends are tied up too hastily. What started off with a huge amount of potential ends up as a by-the-numbers mix of thriller clichés. These things don't derail the movie, but it certainly is a pity.Liam Neeson is as watchable as always, and despite playing tough guys in 'Taken' and 'The A- Team' he plays the victim here without any problems. Diane Kruger, forever playing supporting characters, gets more to do here, which is a good thing. January Jones and Frank Langella, however, are wasted in limited roles with little screen time.'Unknown' certainly has problems, but they don't make the film any less enjoyable. Its interesting premise and its mostly-capable execution keep it just above the average popcorn fodder. There are plot-holes you need to ignore, and you probably won't remember much of it afterwards, but it will entertain you while it lasts.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"""I didn't forget everything.""","A very interesting twist on the character Liam has made for himself with those special sets of skills.

"Technically perfect,  but situations only good for popcorn munchers.","I was enjoying this film so much... until the car accident on that Berlin bridge. Practically from then on, from being a realistic kind of script, it becomes another car chasing routine, the kind where everyone is a phenomenal driver zigzagging through a heavy city traffic, damaging anything on sight, but without killing anybody..., so we enter that fantasy land so particular to Hollywood movies, and from then on I lost a lot of interest in it.All those fist fights with explosive sounds every time they hit each other, grown up men like Neeson that obviously cannot have that kind of agility and yet, they hit each other in a way you think they'll end up with a raw hamburger for a face and shredded knuckles, but no, they appeared in the next scene with a tiny band-aid on the forehead... Maybe this kind of film is geared to a very young audience, happy to watch anything that moves and makes plenty of noise, amplified to a hearing loss degree, but for a thinking adult they are just a perfect waste of time.Pity because the making of this film is absolute perfection. I wonder if Hollywood could make this very same movie, getting to the bridge accident scene, and continue the story in a natural, every day life kind of process without magic fights, magic car chases, magic explosions and magic plots... am I asking for the impossible?",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But all participants of the coctail party where just staring at the whole scene like goats. Right after this, they are watching the observing cameras with the check-in of his wife at the lobby.

Mediocre thriller,"Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his wife Liz (January Jones) arrive in Berlin for a biotechnology summit. Upon arriving at their hotel, Martin realizes he forgot his briefcase at the airport. He takes a taxicab driven by Gina (Diane Kruger), but on the way to the airport, the cab crashes off a bridge into the river after narrowly avoiding a refrigerator that falls off a delivery truck. Martin is knocked unconscious upon impact, but Gina saves him from drowning before fleeing from the scene. On Thanksgiving day, he comes to at the hospital after being in a coma for four days.Martin returns to his hotel, only to discover that his wife who proclaims to not know him, is with another man who says he's Dr.Martin Harris.Unknown has a tremendous premise and a great actor in the lead role, Liam Neeson. However, this film did not succeed and the main reason is because of its execution. The plot is, in fact, quite interesting, there's quite a bit of action and the acting is pretty good. And I must say that the twist was not at all what I expected and it will be extremely difficult for anyone to predict it.Having said that, the way all these bits were put together did not make a very good film. It has a lot of potential but it never really reaches and ends up being a very mediocre thriller. Much inferior to Liam Neeson's last action thriller, Taken, for instance.6/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
If you are a lover of the thriller genres and loves being teased by the storyline,"Liam Neeson was the very reason ""Unknown"" appealed to me. Since ""The A Team"" he has marked his ground very clearly in my movie watch lists. With a more than captivating beginning the movie just jump-starts with the mere presence of Liam Neeson being in a tragic accident. Dr.Martin Harris and his wife enter into Berlin for the very first time to attend a Bio Tech conference. Dr.Martin quite by mistake leaves one of his suitcases outside the airport and only realizes this once they reach the hotel. Immediately he calls another taxi and makes his way back to the airport while his wife checks into the hotel. Dr.Martin meets with an accident and wakes in hospital after 4days only to realize that someone has stolen his identity.A brilliantly written screenplay by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell captivates the essence very cleverly. No lose ends at all during this thrilling movie keeps the suspense building effectively and wraps the viewer very closely and keeps me guessing for answers for Dr.Martins doubts. Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger do wonders on screen with Neeson obviously smacking his performance to all corners of the set. Outstanding supporting performances by Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella, although their screen time was minimal, it is felt quite strongly that they play 2 very powerful roles in the conviction of the reality and the gravity of the circumstances. Whilst there is no extraordinary approach used in the making of the movie, Jaume Collet – Serra toys with colors quite a bit to bring in the gloomy story line to a gloomier light. Frames in hues of green and grey I felt is a nice touch. Also the thought driven into the detailed costuming to match with the colors played was very pleasing to the eye. One may say that there is nothing much to do in terms of costuming and shot angles and frame colors since the set is a very basic one. However I feel it is vital in terms of relating the mood to the situation discussed through the movie. Maybe you as a reader would see it in a different paradigm. However all this being said, I felt that the ending could have been much better, since everyone does a brilliant job right from the point of GO, the ending needed to go off with a bang, at times it felt a bit of an anticlimax ; once again could be only me, but I strongly felt the anticlimax. I am certain that was not what Jaume is going for here.If you are a lover of the thriller genres and loves being teased by the storyline, this is a must watch. I personally enjoyed the tease and was darn well entertained and its value for money.Title: Unknown Directed by: Jaume Collet – Serra Starring: Liam Neeson, Diane Kruger, January Jones, Frank Langella & Bruno Gansz Rated: PG 13 for some intense sequences of violence and action and some brief sexual content.

Been-There-Done-That but still entertaining.,"Admittedly Liam Neeson is tailor made for the character he plays in this film, something very similar to Taken, although here he's in far less control. Aside from that, these films are a dime a dozen and easily forgettable. Just like Taken, the plot of Unknown places Neeson in a foreign country, this time Germany, where he's on a mission to find 'something'. After so many films in the same vein, the ""something"" ceases to be important. It's simply an opening to introduce a variety of sinister characters and high speed car chases. Granted the plot of Unknown is a little more interesting than your average man-on-a-mission movie, it definitely has it's moments. But it never rises too far above predictable and borders on ridiculous at times.Neeson plays a man who is introduced as Dr. Martin Harris. He and his wife Elizabeth (January Jones) arrive in Berlin to attend some type of biotechnology summit. Not long after his arrival, Harris' taxi plunges into an icy river and he narrowly escapes death thanks to the quick thinking of his driver Gina (Diane Kruger). Luckily Elizabeth wasn't in the taxi with Martin or else this would have been a totally different movie. Martin wakes up in the hospital four days later only to find that his life as he knew it has ceased to exist. When he finds his wife, she informs him that she has no idea who he is. In fact there's another Dr. Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn) who claims to be her husband. Neeson doesn't believe it, but the man has documentation proving he's the real(?) Dr. Harris. He's even got a honeymoon photo with Elizabeth to prove it. Neeson's character shares the same thought process with the audience. Is he crazy? And if he is, how does he have memories of his wife? Is it one big conspiracy? If it is a conspiracy who's behind it?As I've already said, the ways in which Neeson begins to unravel this mystery are predictable. He'll encounter characters who are not entirely trustworthy, but luckily he'll have an ally (preferably female) who always happens to be in the right place at the right time. He'll be followed by someone wearing all black who probably knows some form of martial arts, or carries a knife, .... or maybe both. He'll have another character who he thinks he can trust, but who will inevitably turn out to be a double agent. And so on and so on....It's even got what Roger Ebert terms Underlying Reality Speeches. This is where some character, usually at the end of the film, has a monologue explaining the entire plot to the main character, essentially providing the answer to the audience because there was simply no other way to do so in the natural course of the film. I always find those a bit disappointing, like cheating somehow.Unknown is by no means a bad film. It kept me interested from beginning to end, even while I recognized that it was following a course I've seen many times before. The problem is that just when it starts to get really good, it slides back into autopilot and basically stays there. . My rating: 6.5/10 Too predictable to be great, but still good nonetheless. It's worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Quality watch! Enjoyed myself,"For it's genre and theme, it's beyond adequate.Not only is it well cast (we all know Liam will deliver in such a role), but the story is the main driving force, for a change. It was, in fact, very complex and entertaining. I can usually predict how things will go, but the structure is refreshingly fresh (for such an old movie)! It keeps you along for the ride while you uncover the ""mystery"", but has decent action with great camera work. In fact, there's a car chase scene with impeccable editing and great angles/shots. One of the best I've seen in a movie of this type.Would easily recommend it. Will probably watch again once I completely forget about it in a couple of years (hopefully).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"You might have fun, but I'm not making any promises","Well, it's February, and what does that mean? For some of us, that means it's the worst time of year for movies. Oscar flicks are milked December through January, leading us into February, where everyone has already seen the major front-runners and nothing new even comes close to appealing in comparison to those masterpieces. So, out of boredom this past weekend, I caught Jaume Collet-Serra's newest film Unknown (2011). I guess the best word to describe my experience would be ""meh."" We've got Liam Neeson as our big star—who doesn't love Liam?! That is, when we're not getting him confused with Ralph Fiennes (or is this just my bad?). Anyway, Neeson does what he does best, playing a bad ass, and for a quick second you want to accept this movie as an okay flick. But, after a few awesome car chases, you sink back into the story and say to yourself, ""Um—What the hell? There's no way that's even possible."" No spoilers here, but the conclusion is completely implausible. Unknown is filled with major plot holes, and perhaps too much plot to begin with. The enjoyment of Unknown truly lies with Liam Neeson's performance. Let's get real; he's actually a talented guy. On the other end of the spectrum, we get Diane Kruger's performance, which blows major chunks. Okay, great, she's got a German accent. Well done. But her performance as a pseudo-punk, illegal immigrant, taxi driver was a huge miscast. She and Neeson are a horrible duo with no on-screen chemistry. So, basically what I'm saying here is, it's got some good, some bad, and some even worse, but it's not the crappiest movie I've ever seen. You might have fun, but I'm not making any promises.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Side characters are fine but whom I felt little to no connection with. The action was also fine but context made me desire for more and not in a good way.

An Unknown Liam Neeson,"¨Do you know what it feels like to become insane? It's a war between being told who you are and knowing who you are. Which do you think wins?¨ I really wanted to like this movie after watching Liam Neeson single handedly conquer Europe in Taken, and I had my hopes up for another one of his one-titled-European-action-thriller films. Unknown however is no Taken. Neeson plays kind of an opposite character this time because he spends most of the time confused and helpless while in Taken he was always smooth and in control of the situation. He was sort of a James Bond, while in Unknown he is more of a Jason Bourne, although way less gifted. This film was directed by Spanish filmmaker, Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan and House of Wax) and at some points during so many twists and turns I think he loses the direction. I really didn't see the twists coming and thought the movie would take a completely different turn, but each time I thought the movie was going to go a certain way the film caught me by surprise again. For this I have to give the film credit, but the problem for me is that I didn't really like the path Collet decided to take. Liam Neeson is a great actor, but I enjoy him much more when he is in control of the situation. There is something about him that just exhales confidence. Unknown is based on Didier Van Cauwelaert's novel: Out of My Head, and it was adapted by relatively unknown screenwriters Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell. I don't know how the story played out in the novel, but in the screenplay some of the dialogue felt a bit forced, and some situations felt unbelievable.The movie opens as Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) arrives at Berlin along with his wife, Elizabeth (January Jones). He's travelled for a very important scientific conference, and plans out his schedule in Berlin while taking a taxi to the hotel. Once there he realizes that he has left a briefcase in the airport so takes a taxi back before getting a chance to tell his wife where he's heading. On the way to the airport he has an accident and the taxi ends up running off a bridge and landing in the water. Martin bumps his head and is saved by the taxi driver, Gina (Diane Kruger). He awakens from a coma after four days and is surprised his wife isn't by his side. Doctors say that he wasn't carrying any identification so that they couldn't contact any family members. The first thing he does is go back to the hotel and look for Liz, but once there he finds her with another man claiming to be Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn). Liz says she doesn't know who this man is and security officials escort him out of the hotel. Martin is still dizzy and confused, but he is sure of his identity and will stop at nothing to prove he is the real Martin Harris. He searches for Gina to see if she can help him and together they begin to work with a former East German spy named Ernst Jurgen (Bruno Ganz) who is willing to help Martin by looking at every particular detail of his situation. The movie then takes several unexpected twists.Frank Langella also has a secondary role as Rodney Cole, a long time friend of Martin who could point out he is the real Martin, but who can't be located. It's always a plus to have someone like Langella in a secondary role because they can bring so much to a movie, but in this particular case he goes by unnoticed. He only serves the purpose of revealing to the audience an important twist the film will take. I thought that entire scene was totally unbelievable. I really enjoy suspenseful thrillers, but I just wasn't pleased with this one because the pace of the film was to slow and the ending just didn't pay off for me. I don't have a problem with slow films as long as the wait pays off at the ending, but in this case it didn't. I was disappointed because I really like Liam Neeson and consider him to be among the best actors in the industry, but this just wasn't the right movie for him. He was meant to play cool characters in control of their own destiny. I really missed the Neeson from Taken who destroyed entire cities in search of his daughter. In Unknown he is just lost, confused, and less scary. Unknown isn't a terrible movie, it has its moments and had me hooked for a while. It's better than Jaume's debut film House of Wax, but it's still far from being a great film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not very logical,"I watched the movie last night and I can tell it is not a very bad movie. However the ending is not shocking! It is absolutely out of logic! I can not explain more about the storyline because it can smash the movie and I think that this movie has this value to be seen. So I just put simply these questions: 1. How a man who was in coma lost all of his abilities and his power? 2. Usually people who can not remember their past very well, can find something about it by visiting the last places they were or even by passing the time, they remember more about themselves! How the main character remember passwords, numbers,, details but can not remember anything else about his past like his address in America for proving who really he is? 3. We live in society! We have many ways to prove who really we are! Why the main character does not visit the embassy? Usually this is the first place we go in troubles on board! Free from these questions, I can tell if you Liam's movies (like me), it is not as good as ""Taken"" but it worths to be watched.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Entertaining paranoid action thriller, though not among the greats of the genre","The build-up is exciting: Someone has stolen the identity and life of the protagonist ... or is he, himself, going insane? Martin Harris (the ever reliable Liam Neeson) explains the struggle in his mind as: ""a war between being told who you are and knowing who you are."" The premise is followed by great action scenes and twists and turns to keep you guessing most of the way. A movie like this, however, ends well by keeping suspension of disbelief on a tight leash, for the viewer to really invest emotionally. The third act, unfortunately, looses the grip. Where genre classics like The Fugitive (1993) and The Game (1997) held the viewer fast to the heart-pounding end, Unknown Identity ends up increasingly far-fetched, and it eventually couldn't keep me truly caring about the story.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This Taken imposter is no Taken...,"You're married, have been for a long time. You love your missus.She loves you.You go on a working holiday to another country, to attend a conference where you are a key note speaker. It should be a gold star day for you. The wife is by your side beaming But there's a hitch. The taxi ride from the airport to the hotel. Luggage missing. Important luggage. Your notes for the trip and your ID.Upon realisation you immediately hail another taxi and head back And so begins Unknown, Liam Neeson's second attempt at a action in recent years. Without Taken a few years back, Unknown wouldn't exist, in fact this is the sort of script that Jean-Claude Van Damme would've been all over in the 90s, hardly wide release stuff.But Taken hit big. So here we – and Mr Neeson – are.Neeson is Dr Martin Harris, when he realises that he has left essential information at the airport taxi rank he doesn't even bother to inform wife Liz (January Jones) that he is heading back for it. He hails the first cab which happens to be driven by Gina (Diane Kruger) and heads back to the airport. But a major traffic accident that ends with Harris nearly dying and him being dragged from icy waters by Gina is the real spanner in the works.Harris wakes from his coma four days later. No-one is there to welcome him beside hospital staff. Harris also has no ID, so he checks himself out and heads to the hotel and the gala welcome summit to re-introduce himself and assure everyone that he is OK.At least that's the plan. No-one – not even Liz – recognises him as Dr Martin Harris, and why would they when another Dr Martin Harris is already there!?! After some obvious confusion on ex-coma Harris' behalf and a brief plea the hotel staff look into the situation, using the internet and Harris ""2's"" ID documents and side with the new guy.Neeson-Harris is sent back to the hospital to 'get his head right'. He has no ID, minimal cash, no-one in his corner and no idea what the hell is going on. So he decides to get to the bottom of the situation,and with the aid of an elderly German private investigator he tries to piece together his life, starting with taxi driver Gina (Diane Kruger: Who looks a lot like January Jones to me) who ends up accompanying Neeson-Harris for much of his search.We've seen this film before, and often it is better than Unknown turns out to be. The Long Kiss Goodnight was more trashy fun, and of course the Bourne films were some of the better action films of the last decade.We can see from the poster where Neeson is holding a pistol that this won't end up a Finding Nemo or Sweet Home Alabama clone, so we know a certain element of violence is inevitable. And there is some action, violence and fatalities, some at the hands of Neeson-Harris himself. But the character lacks the skills of the lead in Taken (aside from being able to drive at top speed through and against heavy traffic on icy roads in a German city!). In Unknown Dr Harris is actually surprised when people die in front of him! Unknown ends up to be mildly intriguing for a while; 'Is he nuts?' 'Is it a complicated conspiracy?' 'Identity theft?' 'An inexplicable mistake?' You guess and second guess for a few minutes but once the answer finally is lazily delivered to you during what Syndrome from The Incredibles would term a 'monologue' you immediately start counting down to the credits.Once the film concludes and you run through the events with the benefit of hindsight even though the plot hangs together alright it still isn't that satisfying a film, but Neeson as always gives his all and lends a little class to what should by rights be a straight to DVD affair. He obviously likes this action stuff, and strangely enough he's very good at it.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. A couple of good moments but Neeson fails to replicate the success of Taken. (I know I mentioned Taken too much: I just love me some Taken.) One last thought: Why do 'top secret' bugs, tracking devices and the like all need blinking lights to draw attention to themselves? Standing out and drawing attention would seem to be non-ideal choice for cladestine, low key equipment.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great fun!,"This my first review on IMDb.""Unknown"" movie is great entertaining, full of action and dramatic scenes all the way to the end. Basic plot is written and directed really well, with interesting turnovers through movie and unexpected twist at the end. Consecutive change of exciting and thrilling, and slow but tense moments gives us time to follow the story, rest from shootings and chasings and enjoy in development of different characters. Chemistry between actors work well, story is dynamic.Liam Neeson is excellent, he is very balanced, trying not to step so hard, but also not to turn his acting into stereotype action heroes. Beautiful, but still so naturally looking, Diane Kruger surprised me, she was solid, but the usage of her German accent made her appearance a bit wooden to me. Other actor were also on a professional level, so I can say that I pretty liked the crew. Frank Langella was fantastic in his 15 min appearance, and once again proved that those types of roles really suits him.All in all, it is probably not the best thriller I have seen, but it surely a exciting story that keeps your attention all the time.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Trust me, I make popcorn at the movies...","When we last saw Liam Neeson, he had just judo-chopped half of Europe in saving his bratty daughter in Taken. It was a perfectly direct premise that promised lots of justified bad-ass action scenes.Now we get Unknown, a bit more of a complicated version of the action thriller. From the trailer, you're like, ""Whaaa! His hot wife forgot him? Who is he? Is he about to judo-chop that guy?"" Perhaps that was just me. But you're basically left with plenty of questions and intrigue.So what happens? Well, that's the fun part of the movie. Unknown takes you on a troublesome, frightening journey of someone losing their identity in a foreign country, and into discovering, albeit slowly, who they actually are. Oh and, as always, the consequences are dire.Without spoiling too much, Unknown isn't the movie you think it is. The twists are spread out fairly well and they certainly keep your curiosity piqued. It is an enjoyable and thought-provoking ride where Neeson, unsurprisingly, does a solid job in the role of looking capable but confused. Diane Kruger (who's German and who I've become a fan of) plays the perfect subtle love interest to match Neeson and help him find his wife/life. And the German character actors do an excellent job of authenticity and local color. I'm looking at you, P.I. Ernst Jurgen (Bruno Ganz).BUT. But, at this point you should realize what famous action thriller trilogy Unknown is so eerily similar to. Remember Jason Bourne. Couldn't remember who he was, was a trained assassin, etc. Ring a bell? I'm not saying this is a ripoff. In fact, I think it could stand on its own with its unique angle. BUT. But, what The Bourne Trilogy did so well, Unknown fails at: plot. I can only verify a couple of flaws in this film (Liam has to remember that he can fight, his memory is very partial), but there seemed to be more I can't recall.So in the end, several questions are answered, but new ones arise in their place.Favorite scene: Bruno Ganz vs. Frank Langella Grade: As a result of not being able to verify other flaws, I give it a range of B-C. It's more fun if you don't think about it.http://samsonite22.tumblr.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Action Action Action....very watchable!,"Like they say...If you enjoyed Taken, then you will enjoy this movie. The trailer left me highly intrigued to see this movie as I thought the storyline would have to include a rather good twist in order to make this movie successful. I thought it was great from start to finish and of course, Liam Neeson makes this movie. From the beginning, it gets the audience involved and then leaves them blank with so many unanswered questions in a highly interesting way, just leaving you glued to the screen to see how it all uncovers. When the movie get's started, it kind of almost leaves you confused just as much as the character which was brilliant as it really puts you in Liam Neesons' shoes. The film does indeed get the audience to ask 'What the possible twist could be?' as there is no hint or suggestion that it would be a typical solution. We follow Neeson, uncovering the answers to all the audience's questions and I must say that I was impressed with the storyline behind 'Unknown'. I thought it was very unique and was definitely directed in the best way. The script was very well written, capturing the atmosphere in the scenes perfectly. All characters were cast well and definitely had the right 'look' for their roles. Highly action packed from start to finish, Many twists and character roles leave you with an unexpected surprise which really adds the element of excitement to the film. The audience in some parts may think that they know how this story is going to play out...but more twists pop up leaving the audience highly engaged. I did think that the ending to this movie would be far fetched and typical. But no, really well done and definitely gets audience appreciation. Thumbs up, highly watchable and highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Liam Neeson rocks!,"Not all actors need muscles to prove how tough they really are. Sometimes, all it takes is focused energy and sincerity in becoming the character. Something that Liam Neeson has done exceedingly well in recent years while being Ra's Al Ghul in 'Batman Begins' and the unstoppable father in 'Taken'. Neeson can be the calm scholarly husband at one point of time and then transition into this clueless, passive-aggressive maniac at another. 'Unknown' is familiar territory for him after his role in 'Taken' while a different familiarity is felt by the audience as they correlate the happenings to those in the Jason Bourne series.As Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) lands at Berlin airport with his stunning wife Elizabeth (January Jones... mmmmm....), a creepy chill sets upon the already icy streets of the city and as soon as they arrive at their hotel, Dr. Harris realizes that his suitcase is left behind at the airport. The frantic taxi ride to retrieve the baggage ends in the river after a freak accident and upon his return to the hotel after 4 days in coma, Elizabeth not only refuses to recognize him but acknowledges her marriage to an imposter. Is the other Dr. Martin Harris, the real one or is he subject to identity theft that could be a part of a larger scheme? Aided by the skills and knowledge of an old Stasi agent and the taxi driver who saved his life, Martin unravels the bigger plot and for a while, turns into the unstoppable maniac that we came to watch the movie for.The characters are beautifully sketched. We easily sympathize with Gina (Diane Kruger) the taxi driver, for the trauma she endures while Martin seeks to unravel the truth behind his identity. Such is her absorption into the character. January Jones as Elizabeth Harris, does enough to woo audiences by simply standing in her long winter coat while Aidan Quinn is excellent in his cold persona of the other Martin Harris. The most significant, though undermined in screen presence, are the characters of Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella. While playing the former Stasi agent, Swiss actor Bruno Ganz seems so credible, that he is a sub- plot by himself! His confrontation with Rodney Cole (Frank Langella), an associate/friend of Martin's is certainly the most chilling, overpowering scene in the movie. The duo take coldness to another level. Liam Neeson does not look at ease in his role as the amnesic Martin Harris and that is the very beauty of his performance. He seems so weary and lost that we want to empathize with him and perhaps give him clues to get out of his mess and in the end, just get out of his way as he finds himself. Liam Neeson does not need guns, knives or even martial arts. Without even screaming, he sends shivers down the opponent's spine with a bare fist. Portraying such a transition from a well composed, stoic character is Liam Neeson's true strength and 'Unknown' gives him enough room to stretch his kicks... errrr... legs.Director Jaume Collet-Serra did not begin with an outstanding plot. You get much of it from the previews itself. Nor does he capitalize on the surprise elements within the plot to deliver the punch that we were expecting but rather, he chooses to do so with simplicity, often times combined with coldness (Ganz-Langella scenes) and lets our minds relax. Perhaps the resemblance to 'Bourne Identity' weighs down too heavily on regular audiences to engage into the director's craftsmanship and therefore, they simply sit back and fill up mouthfulls of popcorn with each punch that Liam Neeson delivers. Afterall, that's what 'Unknown' invited them to.....7.341 on a scale of 1-10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Film starts well, but soon progresses down a path of implausible twists, meaningless characters and a predictable plot, which fails for its obviousness and lack of coherence","Liam Neeson has tried everything. But, apparently, it's as an action star that he wants to establish himself, and this ""Unknown"" is yet another attempt in that direction. Now, for every ""A-Squad"" (fun and dynamic), there's a ""Ruthless Pursuit"" (genre movie that just recycles old clichés). And this latest work of the actor is in the second category. After all, the feature by director Jaume Collet-Serra (from the good ""The Orphan"") even starts well, but soon progresses down a path of implausible twists, meaningless characters and a predictable plot, which fails not only for its obviousness, but also for its lack of coherence.Written by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell based on the book by Didier Van Cauwelaert, the screenplay shares important characteristics of its main plot with the young classic Frenetic Quest (and that's it): arriving in a city with which he is unfamiliar and whose language he does not understands well, Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) is joined by his wife Liz (January Jones) as he prepares to speak at a convention. After a mix-up involving his briefcase forces him to return to the airport, he has an accident and remains in a coma for four days, discovering, upon regaining consciousness, that an imposter (Quinn) seems to have taken his place. Aided by a beautiful young woman he just met (Diane Kruger), he is pursued while realizing he is in the middle of a dangerous conspiracy.The themes of ""mistaken identity"", the ""wrong man"" and the ""mysterious conspiracy"" have, of course, yielded several quality works in Cinema - and Hitchcock, for example, built his career playing with elements of the genre. However, if the British director would invest in a careful suspense capable of leaving the spectator clinging to the armchair, the Spanish filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra opts to bet on continuous action, believing that the sequences of fights and shootings, as well as the car chases full of of close-ups of speedometers and gear changes will be enough to keep your audience's attention - and in a way they are, while also ensuring that the film establishes itself as a forgettable pastime.""Unknown"" is the type of film that will calmly satisfy the average viewer, who doesn't require much more than an hour and a half of distraction while enjoying a bucket of popcorn and half a liter of soda. The setting is plastically attractive - the city of Berlin appears as a character in the story - with cold and elegant photography, the soundtrack is efficient in creating atmospheres of suspense and tension, and the cast is cohesive and quite balanced. In addition to the plot, boring and full of debatable points, perhaps the biggest problem is precisely Neeson, who leaves aside the interpreter capable of nuances and more inspired performances to place himself between a Bruce Willis or a breathless Harrison Ford, trying to solve everything in the arm, but at the end of the day relying more on luck - or on the absurdities designed by the writers - to get away with it.Responsible for the mediocre ""House of Wax"" and ""The Orphan"", this time Collet-Serra cannot be blamed for the problems of the feature, since, from a technical point of view, ""Unknown"" demonstrates relative competence: the inclined planes and the camera punctual subjective evoke the atmosphere of uncertainty and paranoia of the protagonist; the handheld camera and the quick cuts give some tension to the action; the grainy and blurry flashbacks illustrate the confused memory of the hero; and the muffled sounds here and there establish the subject's exhaustion There are no great narrative efforts on the part of the director, it's true, but he does the basic rice and beans that turns the feature into a relatively painless experience, even if, from time to time, he ends up making gross mistakes - like the villain who, after watching the heroes driving away from a building window, he suddenly appears in front of them a few blocks later, in a feat that would make The Flash envy.The plot could use more of the psychological aspect of the American scientist's lack of memory and possible daydreams, putting his sanity in check, but it prefers to show itself as an action film. So, hold on to your chair because there's no shortage of chases, shootings and even spy parades that survived the Cold War. Among the various inconsistencies in the text is Gina's (Diane Kruger) inexplicable interest in helping him. As an immigrant living in the country illegally, logic would tell her that she should stay away from all this mess, but here she is facing it all alongside the guy she's never seen before. At least the character turns out to be more interesting than the wife played by January Jones, who is as monochromatic as her white skin. Betty Draper deserves better.The absurd script full of facilitations by Butcher and Cornwell is really what compromises the film the most: how to justify, for example, that Martin is easily released from the hospital after four days in a coma even without having any documents - not even a passport that allows your stay in the country? And why are the police never seen even as the hero and villains seemingly try to destroy Berlin? Furthermore, isn't it excessively convenient that, at the end of a chase, the main couple finds themselves in front of a nightclub whose doorman happens to be a friend of the taxi driver played by Kruger? And most importantly: what kind of amnesia is this that affects Martin, since he seems to remember enough to get himself into trouble, but never important details that clarify the situation? (Answer: The technical term is ""selective screenwriter memory"").Of course, these are not the only questions raised by the script, as during the screening we are led to question why no one tries to carefully verify Martin's identity over the Internet instead of limiting himself to a single, easily manipulated page (and saying that there are ""400,000 Martin Harris"" is not an excuse, as it is enough to add the term ""biotechnology"" to reduce the results considerably)? And how can the two ""Martin Harris"" (Neeson and Quinn) say the exact same sentences while trying to convince the scientist played by Koch about their identities? And isn't it (again) all too convenient that one of Harris's only memories - the photo taken with his wife on his lap - is exactly the one confronted by a portrait? Yes, some of these last questions end up being answered at the end of the third act, but several others end up appearing in their place - and, besides, the answers only make sense if we accept that they are idiotic and absurd, even if they are fun.Liam Neeson, after being highly praised for his performance in good films like ""Neil"" and ""Schindler's List"", which earned him an Oscar nomination, also gained fame for always stealing attention in secondary roles. Now older, Neeson decided to invest his career in action films, in recent years he made the average ""Ruthless Pursuit"", ""The A Team"" and also with ""Unknown"". The actor, who lacks the physical stature for this genre, seems out of place in the role of Dr. Harris, does not convince at any time and his performance at the time of the great revelation of the story is shameful.January Jones is one of the most beautiful women today, in this film her character is important in the plot, but she appears a few times and even so the actress exaggerates with an excessively dramatic performance. Unlucky is Diane Kruger (""Troy""), who was cast in a more illogical role in the story. She plays an illegal immigrant who inexplicably decides to help Dr. Harris to find out what's going on. The character's story has no logic at any time and only serves to make Dr. Harris didn't appear alone all the time on screen. Highlight for two special appearances, the great German actor Bruno Ganz (the Hitler of ""Fall"") as a former secret police agent of the former East Germany. The character steals the show with some of the only good lines in the feature, like when he criticizes the German people's lack of memory. Ganz also participates in the only really interesting scene in history, when he acts with Frank Langella (""Frost vs Nixon"") who is once again placed in a secondary role and, as has become customary, steals the scene whenever he appears.Partially saved by the (I repeat: absurd but amusing) revelations of the third act, In the end, this is a neat production, where the pace flows and the film goes by in the blink of an eye. Despite its lack of daring and reasonable share of slips, which was already expected, ""Unknown"" is a competent, fun thriller, capable of entertaining for its duration. And, let's face it, watching Liam Neeson act, even in a production without any artistic ambition like this, is always a pleasure. Comparing the film with other action thrillers would be easy, but also loaded with spoilers about the outcome, which does hold some surprises. However, when ""Unknown"" decides to show its turnaround, it is no longer convincing. By this point, the audience has already been mistreated by the excess of minor explanations and the reason that really matters (why is there that conflict between them?) arrives unconvincingly.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's not Taken but very close. Little long but the suspense was indeed Something no-one has expected!,"UNKNOWN – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Unknown is pretty good attempt in reviving the success and method of Taken. Liam Neeson has somehow strongly emerged as an action hero thanks to immensely successful surprise blockbuster ""Taken"". Unknown is also as thrilling as Taken was and filmed in beautiful foreign locations but the only thing I didn't like personally was the length of the movie. The story which could have been easily told in 1/2hr movie was told in almost 2hrs. Anyway the suspense was worth it though I think some of the action chase sequences were force just to cash on Taken. Liam Neeson was a perfect choice and trust me he has our sympathy. It's very rare to see an action hero a brilliant actor as well. So, in this case Hollywood as well as the audience is lucky to find him. Dianne Kruger is fantastic. Here I really want to talk about January Jones, she was Ice-Cold (though this is not the movie, she is playing Emma Frost). My memory of January Jones's acting is very forgettable. First time I saw her in 2003 in ""American (Pie 3) Wedding"". And after almost 4 years she became household name in USA with her performance in critically acclaimed ""Mad Med"" (Which I yet have to see, so can't comment how great she is in Mad Men). Considerably her critical acclaim she must be brilliant on Mad Men but here she was Gorgeous yet Ice-Cold or maybe she was supposed to be like that as he role required? I'm confused.

"""Take back your life""","A man awakens from a coma, only to discover that someone has taken on his identity and that no one, (not even his wife), believes him. With the help of a young woman, he sets out to prove who he is.Liam Neeson. Aka, the man. Despite his older age, he can still kick butt in movies, especially giving us a great performance. We've seen him show his vengeance in Taken, while showing a different side in the Grey, so I thought he would give us another great performance in Unknown... The movie's premise HAS been used before, yes, fact. It sounds a little like Bourne, but something about it makes you know there's going to be a twist to set it all together. The movie's acting was good. Liam Neeson, although a great actor, doesn't seem to use body language much. He tends to talk but never shows much emotion while he does it. That is, in fact, the only complaint I can give the movie, except for the cliché plot. Everybody else did a pretty good job, and no one should be labeled a bad actor in this. I liked the director's filming style. He uses lush cinematography and good sound editing to bring it all together. Obviously the film wouldn't mean anything if there wasn't a twist. The thing about the twist is, I've heard it before. I didn't expect it BUT other movies have used this same technique on how to wrap the film up. The twist was good though, so I'm not exactly complaining. If I were to give the movie another complaint it would've been the CGI. They seemed a bit too highly editing to make it realistic BUT I give kudos to the director for at least trying. All in all, I would recommend this film. It's entertaining, fast-paced, and keeps you guessing until the end. The performances from every actor gives into the experience, and there is some badass action sequences. Although the premise has been used before, and even the twist, it's a great addition to the genre. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Derivative movie that pushes suspension of disbelief,"Unknown is not a bad movie. However, the good parts are generally stolen from other movies, and it can be somewhat distracting to constantly be thinking to yourself, ""They stole this from Frantic"" or ""They stole this from Total Recall"". Ostensibly a thriller, it veers from action to thriller to psychological thriller and back to action. With a skilled director, I think this could have been handled a bit better -- or entirely avoided. Thriller fans, who are expecting more realism than action fans, have less tolerance for over-the-top, unrealistic plot lines and stunts that characterize action movies. Also, with the classic 80s and 90s action stars starting to push 60, it's getting a bit more difficult to believe that they're fighting off assassins and seducing 30 year old women. Liam Neeson does a credible job, but I think a younger actor would have been better.If you're looking for an over-the-top action/thriller hybrid, you could do much worse. It's well-made and has a pretty good cast. I found this movie to push my suspension of disbelief to the breaking point, while being derivative of several classic action and thriller movies.

A lushly mounted Euro-thriller,"Even the most preposterous thrillers (Hitchcock inspired or not) can succeed if those involved believe in the material and go for it with gusto. Though it is clear that Unknown is more constructed as a vehicle for Liam Neeson to continue his Taken-oriented action streak than to evoke the most cerebral of mistaken identity entries, he adds the gravitas needed to cement a lushly mounted Euro-thriller; something Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie failed to do miserably in last year's The Tourist.Style is something that Unknown possesses in spades and considering the director at the helm, we should expect no less. Spaniard Jaume Collet- Serra has had mixed success with his previous efforts which include the dopey House of Wax and the dark and twisted Orphan when it comes to overall execution, but both of these horror entries are deeply drenched with atmosphere and lush production values. Amidst the grand shots of Berlin and the frequent car chases is of course the plot itself and though it has it moments of outright stupidity and dopey one-liners, the conspiracy-centric storyline never cheats the audience and instead brings us along as Neeson's Dr. Martin Harris' attempts to uncover his true identity amidst a mounting conspiracy. Awakening from a comma following a watery car crash, Harris finds a wife who will not acknowledge him and a man in his place with the same name, all the necessary credentials and nothing useful to use to prove his true identity.The cast is universally strong here, especially the great Bruno Ganz as a former German intelligence operative who has since retired to the post of private detective. Ganz is funny and charming in his side role and bolsters Neeson in the lead. He is one of Harris' few allies as he is replaced by an imposter while attending a biomedical conference in Berlin. Also at his disposal is a feisty cab driver (Dianne Kruger in a nice tough little role) who finds herself caught up in the growing fracas following the accident and is compelled to accompany Harris for reasons ranging from the promise of money which will help her escape her past and simply the fact people seem to want her dead.The requisite final twist is certainly one you will not see coming, but thankfully is also not one that will send you hurtling towards the exit. The revelation is intelligent and plausible in the context of the film and actually creates an interesting dynamic amongst some of the supporting players. Disappointingly, a low point was the third act appearance of Frank Langella as a colleague of Harris' who serves only as a tool for plot exposition (as revelatory as it may be) and a menacing, shadowy presence that more than echoes his role in The Box. Go back to prestige work, Frank.Sacrificing explosions for dialogue and mystery (well, for the most part at least) Unknown is better than your average early-year fare and is a nice antidote for those trying to catch up on their Oscar films. Neeson has already had his time to prove his acting chops, so I don't mind one bit to see him starring in ­action fare for a stint. As long as he keeps me entertained as he did here, he can slay his way across all of Europe for all I mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This movie doesn't do that. It's genuinely unpredictable- you're left making guesses on what's happening, and chances are you're wrong. Maybe there's a couple of plot-holes, but it's a movie- just enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Loose storyline, you never really get the sense of someone fighting to get his life back","I guess anyone deprived of his identity would feel shocked and be willing to do anything to get his life back. In Unknown there is a lot of passivity all around from Martin Harris (Liam Neeson). I do not know if the book was better at this but on the big screen you spend more time waiting with the protagonist than watching him actually fighting to solve the issue.You get a sense of despair but it is a mainstream movie so this development is minimal and entirely left to Liam Neeson's acting skills - which have been stretched to the point where you may have grown tired of with all the Taken-like flimsy thrillers that do rely on him to flesh up dumb archetypes.There is a bunch of fine actors here but the movie is totally uninteresting. The storyline only gets us from a first part where we have no clue about the solution to the final part where everything is gradually exposed - without Martin Harris ever fighting for any part, everything is just thrown at him 'ex machina', in due time.And worst of all the solution is boring, it feels like a plot written by a 12 year old, and doesn't look any better in moving pictures. Non-stop by the same star/director team is equally unimpressive, with the same loose script approach that quickly undermine the potential for suspense and tense action.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Relentless, nerve-wracking, gripping","Liam Neeson does not understand why his wife (January Jones, on vacation from MAD MEN) pretends she does not know him, or why everyone is being so nasty to him, but he is mostly peeved that someone else has stolen his identity and is posing as him with his own wife! That is enough to annoy anyone. January Jones is as icy as in the latter episodes of MAD MEN, and one would not want to mess with her. Neeson has lost much of his memory as a result of bumping his head when the taxi he was in went off a bridge and into a river. He keeps trying to tell people that he is Dr. Martin Harris, a scientist. We already know this because that's who he was at the beginning of the film. However, he has lost his passport and all his personal papers, and cannot prove his identity. Then people want to kill him, so he is on the run. He finds the young woman who had been driving the taxi when it went off the bridge, an illegal immigrant (they are in Berlin, capital of the Fourth Reich, of which Greece, Ireland and Portugal have now become colonies, as you may have noticed), but she is wary of being exposed and he has to chase her. She is excellently played by Diane Kruger, with nervous intensity. A German nurse who tries to help Neeson is murdered by some vicious hit-men. But before she died she gave Neeson the name and address of a man who might help him, saying that 'he is an expert at finding people'. This man, played by a somewhat aged Bruno Ganz ('ganz' means 'entire', and Ganz has always been entirely a star), turns out to be a former Stasi officer. He helps Neeson but ends up having to take a cyanide pill when about to be tortured by an emissary from America's 'Section 15', an assassination bureau. Is a Saudi prince about to be blown up by a bomb? Is a new breed of corn resistant to disease about to be announced at the conference which is going to ruin the future of Monsanto? (Monsanto is not named, or there would be more than Section 15 on the rampage.) And then there is 'the other Dr. Martin Harris', menacingly played by Aidan Quinn, who is now living with Neeson's wife in the very suite, the Eisenhower Suite, in the Hotel Adlon where Neeson was supposed to be. How dare he pretend to be Neeson, as he simply does not have the profile for it (and who else does have that profile?). One of the most menacing of all the performances is by Frank Langella as Rodney Cole. There is plenty of intrigue here for everyone. The action is fast but not so fast you can't keep up. That is, if you have the stamina and can take it, as this film is extraordinarily harrowing. It is a first-rate bone-shaking thriller, and not to be seen when you are on your own or suffering from any form of identity crisis. The film was directed by the Spaniard, Jaume Collet-Serra, who directed ORPHAN (2009).",,Anonymous,Mystery
Good old Liam Neeson with an interesting-but-ultimately-missed-opportunity plot.,"REVIEW CONTAINS minor SPOILERSThe movie is about an American professor called Dr Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) who goes to Germany with his wife for some important conference talk about agriculture and corn. While he is checking into the hotel, he suddenly realises he forgot his brief case and passport at the airport. He quickly rushes out the door and flags down a taxi. While on the way to the airport, the taxi crashes into a river. He is knocked out but the (I think the character's French) female taxi driver called Gina (Diane Kruger) saves him. When Martin Harris wakes up in a German hospital, he finds that another man has taken his identity. Even his wife doesn't recognise him. With the help of Gina and one of her old Nazi contacts, they slowly uncover the truth. To tell you more would be to spoil the movie, but let's just say you rethink what small part of the movie you saw before the car crash, and - minor spoilers incoming - unnecessarily. This bothered me after I saw the movie, I really would have liked to see lies or very specific things that are only noticeable on a second viewing in the first scene. But you don't need to watch the movie twice to realise that there was nothing hidden in the first scene, because the plot simply didn't allow it. For me that was the biggest let-down with this movie. All the trickery took place after you knew there was trickery going on. This made the movie have less replay value than a movie like Inception or especially Memento. For me at least, I went into this movie thinking it was going to be one thing but it delivered only half that, and the other half fell into another category. What I'm saying there is not that Unknown was a half hearted movie, but it was only half in the category of what I expected it would be fully in.Liam Neeson performed about as well as in Non-Stop, which is typical Liam Neeson. The real stand out performance was by Diane Kruger who played Gina. I hadn't really noticed Diane in any other movies but in Unknown she really did a good job.In conclusion, this is basically your typical Liam Neeson movie with really good supporting cast. I personally liked Non-Stop (awesome movie) better but this movie did have it's own charms too.Would recommend if you're a Liam Neeson fan or someone who has watched too many Christopher Nolan movies and wants to be disappointed with the plot.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A very nice, Jason Bourne-like crime/mystery film. with plot twists and a great Liam. Recommended to everyone","Crime/mystery film. Liam Neeson in another good appearance, as Dr. Martin Harris, who travels with his wife to Berlin for a conference. However, a car accident occurs and when he wakes up 4 days later he gets partial amnesia. When he goes to the conference, he finds another one in his place while his wife does not recognize him and things are even more difficult as he has neither an ID nor a passport on him since his briefcase stayed at the airport. Eventually a group of agents - assassins are watching him trying to get him out of the way. Hunted, in a foreign country, without credentials, and with partial amnesia, he tries alone to survive but also to discover the truth. A pretty interesting idea quite reminiscent of Jason Bourne and with great twists, and Liam Neeson in yet another good performance.

Neeson Keeps Making Hits,"All of a sudden I'm seeing Liam Neeson everywhere so I decided to look up his filmography. Well, apparently I'd been seeing him for a while and never noticed. Along with being Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars Ep 1 he was Darkman in 1990, yet if you had asked me who played either role I would not have been able to tell you. After seeing Taken and now Unknown, I don't think I'll ever forget Neeson.Unknown was a fantastic thriller. Neeson plays Martin Harris who is in Germany for a conference with his wife. He gets into an accident, bumps his head and loses his memory. All the drama and action begins when his wife no longer recognizes him and another Martin Harris is in his place.It is an edge of your seat roller coaster as you follow Martin Harris around finding clues to prove his existence. The movie has a lot of twists and turns right down to the end. A very good movie helping to solidify Neeson as a top billed actor.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It entertains and even surprises, but it has some difficult flaws.","Personally, I liked this movie. It starts well, with an American academic who arrives in Berlin with his wife, and everything seems fine until an accident happens. When he wakes up in the hospital, he finds that no one knows who he is and he has no documents. Worse: someone is using his identity and living his life out there.The script has good premises and I felt that it fulfils what it promises. The film is full of suspense and good action scenes and will certainly satisfy those who came in search of an intense thriller with few dead moments. In between, there are several twists and turns that help to keep our interest and to maintain the film rolling. The most complicated will be to consider the story credible enough, but if the audience is willing to give the film a chance by forgetting this difficult point, the film can make up for it.The cast does a good job. Liam Neeson is good and does an excellent job, but the fact is that he is making a kind of character in which he feels comfortable, so he does not surprise us. Diane Kruger is the most striking female character with a particularly good performance. Bruno Ganz, in his first work that I saw after ""Downfall"", is very good at and adds a lot of quality to the film. On the other hand, Frank Langhella is good but has little screen time, January Jones does nothing special and Aidan Quinn is uninteresting. The interaction between actors is uneven and some dialogues sound theatrical.Technically, the film is quite solid. It has a good cinematography and was very well filmed, using the light and shadow to intensify the suspense and create atmosphere. Expertly directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, it has well-done action scenes, very decent special, visual and sound effects and a post-production work that was generally well done. Not being free of flaws or minor problems, I think its a film that delivers what it promises and can really entertain the audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

ACTION THRILLERMore like a thriller for the first hour, action on the last thirty or forty minutes which starts off with an accidental crash into the river while the Liam Neeson character tries to go back for his briefcase left behind at the airport, only that his accident did more than just lose his memory as the film moves on revealing his real purpose of his Berlin trip! Like the movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" when viewers think that the Tom Hanks character is narrating the story when at the end of the film it wasn't that it was Private Ryan played by Matt Damon all along- this is another one of those movies when it's not what it looks like until near the very end and everything is starting to make sense!

It's quite disorienting and you, the watcher, start to really believe that Liam really did lose his marbles this time.Then the movie starts to run out of steam in the second act, and, as if to recover, the filmmakers introduce a plot twist so ridiculously ludicrous and so far out of left field you can only gape in surprise.

I find it ironic,That in the movie they say progressives are trying to help the poor and end hunger and they go to say how GMO corn is going to help do that and this why a group wants it stopped. Yet in the real world it is progressives that oppose GMOs trying to get them banned all over the world citing bogus studies and false claims that they are linked to cancer. Claims that have been completely debunked. It is progressives that contribute to world hunger and suffering calling for bans of GMOs.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Smart and lean,"Comparisons with Taken, Liam Neeson's action tour de force, are both apt and improper. This is much more of a thriller, where a doctor wakes from a coma to find that only he believes who he is. Thanks to how the film start, so does the audience and the script smartly makes you doubt the main character after a while.But this is not a mystery film and it soon cranks up the dials, converting into a pseudo-action movie that is just on the border of believable. A lot of this goes to Neeson, whose worst talent as an actor is to fake an American accent. His best, though, is his screen presence and ability to take the audience along. Give him a well-paced script and he does brilliantly. And here he does brilliantly. Even if you see the twist coming, you'll enjoy the ride.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Enjoyable thriller,"Dr. Martin Harris is in Berlin with his wife attending a biochemistry conference. Unfortunately Dr. Martin gets into a little car accident and goes over a bridge. Four days later he wakes up from a coma, and when he attempts to get back to his life, he discovers two things; a) someone has stolen his identity, along with his wife and b) someone in town wants him dead.Even with a plot that feels progressively routine as the film plays out, Unknown deserves credit as a thriller that thrills. It's not a deep film, but it's not necessarily a shallow one either. It never feels too quick or too slow, and while it does a few very silly things, it maintains coherency and focus.Liam Neeson, though very much a coming of age actor, feels quite at home in Unknown. This is the kind of lead role that is usually better suited to younger actors, But Neeson hits all the right notes and shows no lack of energy, (although I suppose he is a little slow to get started).Director Jaume Collet Serra is young in his career, but he handles Unknown with a sense of experience. This is demonstrated in the way something like a car chase through the streets of Berlin at night can maintain visual coherency and avoid an unnecessary sense of spectacle.As a thriller, it should not be surprising for anyone going into Unknown that the story comes with a big climactic twist. And while it is quite absurd to be sure, it does (in an ironic way) make a couple other bits of the film seem a little less absurd. If I were to elaborate I might spoil something.Unknown may have been a Winter release, but that doesn't make it unworthy of investment. Flawed though it can be, I'd say it's recommendable to those who indulge in the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An ambitious effort paired with uneven execution.,"""You really don't remember anything, do you?""An American professor in Germany (Liam Neeson) for an important conference is separated from his wife, gets in an accident, and wakes up with amnesia to a world where his identity has seemingly been taken by another man. Along with a taxi driver (Diane Kruger) who is his only link to his life before his accident, he tries to unravel what's going on and avoid mysterious men who seem to be hunting him for unknown reasons.Unknown certainly aspires to be a top-notch thriller. And it has the cast to accomplish that, including Neeson, Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella, as well as enough twists to satisfy any audience.But just because a story is initially unpredictable, doesn't make it great. Only a few scenes in Unknown actually held my full interest, while most stayed safely in the mode of generic action and car chases that we see in countless movies a year. You'll be able to sympathize with the amnesia-stricken main character quite well, because so little of Unknown is memorable.The mystery of what's going on was enough to keep me watching until the end, but curiosity by itself is not exactly entertainment. The answers, when they come, are a little too implausible to be satisfying. This is a plot that's easy to poke holes into, if you're into that kind of thing.Unknown isn't horrible, it's simply inconsistent. It starts off as a thriller, hits several rough patches between the occasional compelling moments, and finishes up as if it was trying to be Taken 2: Take Harder.Definitely a rental, in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Somewhat known or at least familiar,"Let me start out by saying that this wasn't necessarily a bad movie. Although it was definitely not one of Liam Neeson's best movies. It was not the hyped up, race against time, adrenaline rushed movie that I had expected it to be after watching him in Taken (LOVE THAT MOVIE!!!). Still it has some pretty decent action scenes. The dialog was rather repetitive and some of the acting wasn't that great. All in all I would say that what this movie amounted to was a splice of two different movies that I had seen in the past. It gave off a vibe of The Saint/Bourne Identity feel.

Way Too Much Suspension of Disbelief,"I have to admit that I'm not as critical as some when it comes to willing suspension of disbelief. I know by their natures that movies are borderline fantasy anyway. You are asked into a plot that if not contrived by the writer/director, there would be no sustainable plot. That is, we are asked to leave everyday life to engage in the exploits of a group of fictional characters. Putting that aside, the circumstances we are asked to buy into are so fragile that even the slightest mistake will bring this house of cards tumbling onto the table. I admit I was manipulated and prodded here and there, but it reached a point where I felt if they said Liam Neeson's character had disguised himself as a duck, I would have to say, ""That makes sense."" So much is based on so many tenuous circumstances that we are left stunned by the arrogance of the script. I'm sure some will buy into this if they don't think too much. That's fine, but I suspect that for most this doesn't pass muster. I like the actors in this movie. I'm sure they did the best they can, but it's the story that doesn't stand up.

But this movie does a few thing really well: it makes you think that you must be carefull who you trust, and that not everything is what it seems.This movie is a real mind bender because you don't know whats real or not. But this movie is unrealistic in some aspectic because the possibility that your family not knowing who you are is not possible. But the fear that turns into anger is what drives this movie forward.

""" A  Spy  is  a  spy   with  his  realities  in  a  black  briefcase ""","' Cognito Ergo Sum ' . . . . 'I think, . . Therefore I am. ' This has been a catch phrase which spells out the proof of a man. In this film, Liam Neeson, plays Dr. Martin Harris a bio-scientist who has an important conference to attend to in Berlin, Germany. However, a series of small accidents conspire to rob him of his name, his wife and his life as he knew it. Following an automobile accident in a frozen river, our hero discovers, he is missing four days and that who he thought he was is no longer true. Instead, his wife states she has never seen him before and that she is really married to another Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn). With that revelation, Neeson is challenged to learn who he is, why is someone impersonating and why are they trying to kill him. With similarities to 'The Man who knew too much' and the Bourne Identity, This film is set on a fast paced Roller-Coaster ride, with harrowing car chase scenes, serious drama and explosive excitement. This movie is a superior addition to our growing collection. Diane Kruger, January Jones and Frank Langella as Rodney Cole make for a fine cast and a worthwhile endeavor.

Amazing! Truly amazing.,"This movie was excellent! I can't even begin to explain how terrific this movie was. The direction, the acting, the music, the action, the story, was all top notch. In fact, it was no doubt one of the best plots in recent cinema, if not throughout all cinema! The twist itself I didn't see coming AT ALL. There were hints in there, but you only realized these hints AFTER realizing the twist of the story, which was absolutely fantastic and provoked discussion afterward. All the doubts and questions throughout the movie were answered, which is quite a difficult thing to do with a thriller so dependent on the plot.Overall, this movie is breathtaking and ultimately unforgettable. Definitely one of the best films of 2011, and for me, all time. 10/10 from me, two thumbs up and five big, fat stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unknown?,"Neeson plays Martin Harris who is visiting Berlin for a convention. After waking up from a coma resulting from a car crash, someone else seems to have taken his identity. 'Unknown' suffers terribly from a most clumsily written screenplay and appallingly wooden acting from just about everyone in the film. The story itself is utterly ridiculous and presents itself through the use of computer generated turns of plot with a car chase here and a fist fight there exactly on queue. The fact that Harris finds an attractive young female to aid his quest to find out what is happening to him, redefines this particular movie cliché. I hope someone finds the time to reprogram the software responsible for this nonsense or to decompile it altogether.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A very good action mystery,"Whilst originally my friends and I were going to watch ""The Resident,"" the theatre workers wouldn't allow us in because we didn't have ID, even though it was a 15. So we settled for ""Unknown"" just for the fact that Liam Neeson voices Aslan in Narnia and the synopsis in the movie sounded interesting.The film started off very well with well executed camera shots and little details that tie in to the movie and Liam Neeson does a very convincing job acting as Michael Harris. There wasn't a point in the movie where the movie felt slow and sluggish; everything flowed nicely.Whilst the plot is linear, there are quite a lot of flashbacks in the movie which gives it an Inception-esque like feel, where at the end of it all you go ""ahh, I get it now."" The movie does a good job confusing the viewers but then making them understand the story right at the end.The storyline itself is excellent, however, some people might be able to predict it before the ending. Even if you did guess the ending, the satisfaction is still there at the end for actually understanding it.Try not to take any bathroom breaks though because almost all of the movie is important and to miss any of it will hinder how much you understand the story.The camera angles and special effects are very good. The fire is convincing and the car chase scenes are well executed. I was quite tense throughout the film, sat up in my seat in anticipation.Don't be put off by it's 12A (UK) rating. This movie should have been a 15. It has quite a lot of sexual humour in it.

I found the story intriguing and engaging for about half-way through, but then the plot holes just got bigger and bigger until by the end I almost didn't care what happened anymore. The weakest point: after it was explained to us what was really going on, I thought Neeson's character's motivation to do what he did was pretty far-fetched.As for the action, is anyone else getting sick of the way fight scenes are shot nowadays? It's just one fraction-of-a-second cut on top of another: a close-up shot of someone swinging, a close-up of someone ducking, someone crashing through something, jumping off something, blah blah blah. This disconnected, quick-cut, patch-it-together-in-the- editing style looks like a sloppy way to avoid actually choreographing a fight scene, and it seems to be in almost every action movie anymore.

They get in a taxi and speed off. At this moment the 2nd assassin is in her apartment 4 stories up watching them out a window speed away in the taxi. Mind you, they are in the car and gone and he is 4 stories up in the apartment... next scene they appear to only be a few blocks away and somehow the assassin comes out of nowhere and slams his car into theirs! Come on! He got all the way down 4 stories, into his car and was able to loop around in front of them to t-bone them from the right at an intersection?!

What a non-thriller !!!,"I have read most of the reviews and agree with all the ones that rate this to be a bad movie. The plot, which has been described numerous times by reviewers, is full of holes and too unbelievable to make a good thriller out of it. My biggest pet-peeve with this film, however, is that the director/writer (and whoever else) did not consider that there are people who actually know Berlin very well. To have the taxi driver (played by Diane Kruger) pick up Neeson's character from the Adlon Hotel, which is in the center of Berlin (near the Brandenburg Gate) and drive southeast to the Oberbaum-Bridge to get to Tegel Airport (which is in the NORTHWEST - totally opposite direction), is utterly ridiculous. I guess they needed a river for the accident scene, and there are no rivers near Tegel Airport. The Oberbaum-Bridge is spectacular and the Spree river is perfect for the scene. The other big blunder is the address of Bruno Ganz' character who lives on Liebenstrasse Allee. What a joke! Anyone who speaks German (like me) knows it's either Liebenstrasse or Lieben Allee (both of which are fictitious). It's like saying John Smith lives on Broadway Street Boulevard (duh!). This movie is full of cheap thrills, like car chases and fights where the bad guys must lose. All these actors are wasted in this movie.

Brilliant script,"A very satisfying thriller with a brilliant script full of misdirection taking us along for the ride noticing little inconsistencies and oddities and then at the end a total surprise ending makes all those questions fall neatly into place. For me it was the script that put it way above the normal fare and then all the elements were well executed. And it's always fun with a thriller for an audience to be taken to a foreign locale and in this case seeing much of the city of Berlin from the heights to the depths. Our total sympathies lie with the Liam Neeson character who is trying to establish his identity and the very people he knows so well refuse to acknowledge that they know him. And the ending managed to work out to everyone's satisfaction, most of all the audience. A good example of the thriller genre with the complexity modern audiences demand.

"Director Jaume Collet-Serra structures and times his picture much like a jigsaw puzzle, appropriate given the plot scenario","For a man who is almost in his sixties, Liam Neeson is sure keeping himself, and his career, in shape. He was immortalized for playing Oskar Schindler, the man who saved 1100 people during Nazi Germany, in Steven Spielberg's masterpiece ""Schindler's List"" but as of recently, has taken a nose-dive into the action/thriller genre. Since ""Batman Begins"" in 2005, he's been keeping our blood pumping with one terrific thriller after another. His latest pulse-raiser is ""Unknown"" which follows in the tradition of the Jason Bourne movies.In the picture, Mr. Neeson plays Dr. Martin Harris, a scientist visiting Germany with his wife (January Jones) for a medical convention. Mr. Neeson is severely injured in a car accident, wakes up from a coma, only to find that nobody, not even his wife, has a clue of who he is. Without giving too much away, I will say that the plot of ""Unknown"" becomes bewilderingly preposterous and if you think about it for more than thirty seconds, you will pass it off as nonsense, which it is. However, the movie keeps on going and it's not until it's over that you start thinking about how ridiculously twist-stricken it was. During its 106-minute running time, against your better judgment, you buy it. Willingly.""Unknown"" is the second Liam Neeson thriller in three years to place him in Europe. The former was ""Taken."" Both movies are similar in a lot of regards. And while ""Unknown"" does not have the heart of ""Taken"" it does have the same fast-cut pacing, earsplitting sound effects, and knowledge of how to stimulate the audience. Director Jaume Collet-Serra structures and times his picture much like a jigsaw puzzle, appropriate given the plot scenario. Mr. Neeson, almost always on-camera, delves into the mystery as do we. Had a lesser actor been placed in the lead role, ""Unknown"" might have spiraled away from conviction despite its other accolades. But because Mr. Neeson, one of our finest actors, is a master of staying in character and manufacturing characters that the audience goes for, he helps us really stay wrapped in what is happening.There is not much else I can say about ""Unknown"" without giving away too much plot detail. And I don't want to do that, because that will spoil the fun and might deter you from going to see the movie. But this is one terrific thrill ride with a tremendously charismatic cast and some truly riveting action sequences.In regards to the supporting cast -- Miss Jones as the leery wife, given her limited screen time, is believable regardless of what twists the plot throws her way. As the taxi driver who saves Mr. Neeson's life, Diane Kruger is her usual, in-character and charismatic self. (There is no love affair between them, I'm thankful to say -- tired old cliché). As the impostor, Aiden Quinn is sharp and venomous, Bruno Ganz is superb as the world-weary private eye, and Frank Langella shells out a marvelous performance as we near the third act.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Unravels Satisfactorily,"I had two concerns before seeing this film: Will it be as good as Taken? and Has the trailer completely spoilt the reveals? I assumed No and Yes and still largely have that opinion. However, those pre-conceptions along with less than generous critical reviews thankfully managed to down-play my expectations and all-in-all I'm glad because I really enjoyed this film.It harks back to post-Hitchcockian thrillers that I've enjoyed immensely in the past and which don't seem to get made these days, such as Polanski's Frantic.I had read that it was formulaic and predictable, well, formaulic is fine so long as it is delivered well which this certainly is and anyway this genre is largely unrepresented (in my opinion) today so any good representation is to be welcomed.As for predictable...? I didn't sit there trying to resolve the puzzle and even if I had, I'm not so sure I would have done so before the narrative revealed all. As such, I was entranced by the piecing together of it all.Genre & formula aside, Liam Neeson is in Taken territory in terms of passion, confussion & anger whilst the choreography of action & tension is slick and impressively paced throughout: gear-changing car-chases, street-running evasions and psychological check-mates.One final point, I liked the film's genuine tho subtle attempt to highlight social liberal issues such as free market ethnic labour exploitation and the hope that science can be motivated by ethics rather than profit.If you like the appeal of this film, I believe you will enjoy it plentifully.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Frantic"". Not ""Taken"".","I went to see Unknown after reading some baffling mixed reviews here. Some were saying the movie is horrid and just like ""Taken"", others were saying that it's wonderful and nothing like ""Taken"". To me the very analogy was disturbing, as I think ""Taken"" is a bad shoot-em-up video-game pretending to be a movie. Well, for my money, the only commonality between the two movies is their poster. (Neeson, side-facing, gun-toting, grave and menacing -- the resemblance is uncanny, and obviously not accidental. Were the producers trying to capitalize on the success(?) of that train-wreck??)The movie that one SHOULD make comparisons to, but that requires a tad better cinematic memory, is Roman Polanski's classic ""Frantic"". See if you can spot the differences: a doctor and his wife visit a foreign city they are unfamiliar with and where they do not speak the language. Soon after they land, something drastic happens, and the two get separated, after which most of the movie is spent with the doctor trying to figure out what happened to his wife. Police are turned to, but to no avail, as he cannot corroborate his own story. Help comes from an unlikely source: a kooky local girl with an obvious crush on the married, older man. She invites him to her small apartment and from there starts a chase on roof-tops, in cars, and through disorienting night-clubs, at the end of which our protagonist finds that the key to all events lies in something he had all along. Once that is cleared up, and reality once again makes sense, the third act is then dedicated to killing bad guys and getting away with a moderately happy ending. Any of that sounds familiar?With that comparison in mind, under Polanski's direction Paris is grittier than Collet-Serra's Berlin, and Liam Neeson, though widely-recognized as a fine actor, doesn't bring to the role the intensity that Harrison Ford does. Ford's character is jet-lagged, exhausted, flabbergasted, enraged, and frankly at the end of its wits. Neeson's doctor doesn't even come close. The entire movie Unknown is less a grab-you-by-the-throat thriller and more of a joy-ride. The doctor is only matinée-level enraged, the girl is only PG-kooky, and the moderately-happy ending is more of a crowd-pleaser. All these traits probably make Unknown into a more box-office-friendly movie than Frantic, but I don't think 23 years from now I'll have any recollection that I ever saw it. Frantic, on the other hand, is a cinema classic.The big stand-out here is Frank Langella, bringing to his performance every inch of the intensity Neeson is lacking. His one joint scene with ""Jurgen"" (Bruno Ganz) is unforgettable.Regarding the ending: don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. After having seen the trailer I wrote down to myself what I thought the big reveal is going to be, and I was right. The fact that this twist can literally be spotted a mile away, however, does not detract from its charm. The script provides ample and effective misdirection, and at no point did I feel cheated.So, bottom line: If you're looking for cinematic genius, you're barking up the wrong tree. But if you want a fun movie, go see it. Have fun. I know I did.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A man loses his memory!,"I have no idea why I even watched this film; I hate Liam Neeson's acting with a passion! I think I was bored or possibly high at the time. The film is very confusing. But on the whole it is about a man who loses his memory and employs a former Nazi, illegal immigrant and his own inane grumblings at random people to ascertain who he is.Neeson's acting of a man who has lost his memory is not very believable as he seems way too driven and angry and the chronological order in which he regain's his memory is very tedious! It ruins the mystery.When he meets who he is supposed to be it become glaringly obvious what the story is about, there is a final twist however and that I didn't expect but it wasn't enough to save this heap of refuse!Without giving too much away, the reason's for his memory loss and what happens at the end do not seem strong enough. The audience is not made to connect with the back story and the characters within.

A smart edge of your seat thriller that actually delivers the goods!,"Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) has just landed in Berlin with his beautiful wife (January Jones) to attend a biotechnology submit. While at the airport, Harris accidentally leaves his briefcase on the luggage cart. Unaware of his actions, him and his wife get into their taxi and head for the hotel. Once they arrive, Harris realizes that his briefcase is missing and informs his wife to check into the hotel, while he searches the cab for his briefcase. With no luck, he grabs the first taxi and heads back to the airport with the hope of retrieving his briefcase. This is when this happy story takes a turn for the worst because the taxi swerves to avoid an accident and lands in a river. As the taxi collides off of a bridge, Harris bangs his head on the window and slips into a coma. Three days later, he awakes in a hospital with a foggy memory of the events that lead him to the hospital. Harris ventures out into Berlin to find his wife, only to find out that his wife as well as everyone else has no recollection of who he is. This is when he sets out to prove to everyone that he is, in fact, Dr. Martin Harris. A smart and edgy thriller ensues...I felt the same way that everyone else did when I first saw the trailer for ""Unknown."" The movie looked a lot like ""Taken"" and when I went into the film, I really was expecting that. The great news is that, while the film takes place in another country just like in ""Taken,"" the rest of the film is nothing like it. The story that takes place in ""Unknown"" has nothing to do with the one that occurs in ""Taken"" so get that out of your head now. I have read several reviews trying to compare the two films but as I said they have next to nothing in common. ""Taken"" was an action film from start to finish with very little story. ""Unknown"" is more of a suspense thriller with a solid story that is loaded with twists.My question, however, is this, when did Liam Neeson become box office gold? I am not saying that in a negative way, because I always admired the man as an actor but after ""Taken"" his rise of stardom has grown ten-fold. Neeson, who has always had a wide array of talent, seems to be able to play every role from romantic comedies to a bad ass assassins. Neeson, has been acting since 1979 and has now found his market playing the lead role in such films as ""Taken"" and ""Unknown."" I guess to answer my own question is that Neeson became a huge star when he took on the genre of action thriller. What I like most about Neeson is that he has no problem going from nice guy to a complete bad ass in just a few scenes. The reason ""Unknown"" works as well as it does is because of Neeson in the lead role. He is believable throughout the entire film and his struggle to prove his identity feels real.There are many scenes in ""Unknown,"" where the audience may have to sustain some belief in order to follow the story. This sadly is the cliché of Hollywood to create unrealistic action scenes to keep the audience involved. The film, however, didn't need those scenes to work but seemed to be added to keep people who enjoy this genre happy. The thriller is a genre that leaves its audience at the edge of its seat. This film accomplishes this pretty early on and runs with it through the entire film. Once you get into the story, you are hooked or at least I was.The simple idea of someone's identity being stolen is a subject that has always intrigued audiences. The topic itself has been done before several times and most films that have tackled the subject don't leave us with a good taste in our mouths. We live in an era where identity theft is a regular occurrence, therefore, allowing the viewer to truly understand what Harris is feeling. The best part of the film is simply the fact that the story doesn't just stop at a stolen identity topic but adds an interesting twist that keeps the film's audience wanting more. The pace of ""Unknown"" as well as the better than average storyline is what makes it stand out from other films that feature the whole ""stolen identity"" plot. The introduction of new characters as the story advances also helps the storyline built more suspense. Each new character introduces unravels another piece of the puzzle that ""Unknown"" sets us up to put together.With films like ""Unknown"" doing well at the box office, I am happy to report that movie-goers may actually want films that actually try to make them think. While this movie has its normal action packed scenes, which feature unbelievable car chase sequences, the story is where it really stands out. ""Unknown"" may be a thriller that is made for a mainstream audience but it has enough there to keep a person who expects more from cinema to be happy. It's not a masterpiece by any definition but is definitely is one of the better thrillers with a solid story to come out of Hollywood in years. I think if Liam Neeson keeps it up, in a few more years he may actually make it to the big leagues to where people like Tom Cruise once sat. When watching ""Unknown"" please remember its not a sequel to ""Taken"" but rather a smart, edge of your seat thriller that will leave you feeling refreshed.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Unknown"" is a 8 out of 10. This is one of the better action/suspense thrillers to come out of Hollywood in years.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Uninteresting. Unoriginal. Unintelligent.,"Unknown plays like a mix of Hitchcock, Frantic and the Bourne movies, with none of the zest or intelligence of any of those it mimics. For a while it comes off as a decent action film, with pretty dull actors and a none-too-new story. However the further it goes along the further it falls apart. In it's final act it degrades into complete madness, with a twist that drags the entire film down into pure stupidity and an event that had me laughing harder than any ""serious"" ever should. One of the more unfortunate films I've seen in recent years, with no real logic or interest to it whatsoever. As someone who got a real kick out of Taken, this was quite the surprise for Neeson's next big action thriller. It felt like he was sleepwalking through it and the whole thing felt absolutely stupid, for lack of a better word.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Implausible but entertaining,"Dr Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and wife Elizabeth (January Jones) arrive in Berlin for an important biotechnology conference. When they get to their hotel Harris realises he has left a briefcase at the airport. He gets into another taxi back to airport but there is an accident and the taxi goes off a bridge into the river. The driver Gina (Diane Kruger) rescues the unconscious Harris and he wakes from a coma four days later in a hospital.He heads to the hotel where he and his wife were supposed to be staying, the same hotel where the biotechnology summit is taking place. He is wondering why his wife hasn't been looking for him. When he gets there he finds it difficult to get past security without ID until he see his wife. The security man takes him to see her and verify his story but she denies knowing him and she indicates a totally different man is her husband Dr Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn). He escapes being jailed by claiming he must still be confused after his coma and showing them a card from his doctor.Harris starts to doubt his sanity so starts searching for help figuring out what is going on. First he looks for Gina, the taxi driver, who saved him but when he finds her she is afraid to say anything to the authorities because she is an illegal immigrant from Bosnia. Next he heads to the University where Dr Bressler (Sebastian Koch) works. This is the scientist who is holding the biotechnology conference, funded by a controversial progressive Middle-Eastern Prince Shada. Everywhere that Bressler goes he brings his two creepy twin teenage daughters with him. It turns out that Harris 2.0 is already there with Bressler. Harris tries to prove he is the genuine one by recounting memories of his talks with Bressler but Harris 2.0 manages to recall the same memories word for word simultaneously. Harris now believes that he is mad and may not be the genuine Martin Harris.This all leads right to a big twisty revelation at the end that I had better keep quiet about but when I saw the twist it made me totally recall an older film. Even mentioning that other film would be such a spoiler. It all involves car chases, Bruno Ganz as an old Stasi agent working as a private investigator, assassins called Smith and Jones, Frank Langella, that briefcase he left at the airport and Gina the pretty taxi driver. Just to remind us we're in Germany we had big foaming barrels of beer all over one of the car chases. I thought it was all fairly implausible but it is still good entertainment. The action moves fast enough to avoid asking too many questions such as, did that passport really claim Harris was born in 1964?Rating 6/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
Waaaay better than a 7.4 (IMDB current rating)  This is a MUST SEE!!!,"Often you see a preview for a movie and get excited but unfortunately many times the trailer is better than the movie itself. When I saw the first glimpses of this movie I immediately said ""Oh, I gotta see this!"" I was excited when it finally hit theaters and noticed IMDb voters rated it in the ""sevens"" meaning it was worth watching--I only pay full price if a movie is at least a 7.0 voting rating.Well, my wife and I walked out of the theater saying this movie is a 9! It rocks! The acting and drama is very good.The premise of the plot is outstanding... how in the world did this happen to him?

Too many plot holes...make that pits.,"I rarely bother to post a review, but this movie was so terrible I felt obligated to try to help other people avoid wasting their money. Although there is one interesting plot development, overall this movie is one of the most preposterous I have ever seen. It is full of plot flaws and inconsistencies. Although I saw one professional reviewer who thought the car chases were great, my girlfriend and I thought there were too many, that they were too long, and that they were so unbelievable that it was hard to be excited by them. As a minor example of a plot flaw, how could there possibly be such long car chases in a busy major city with no police in sight. Regarding the acting, January Jones can't -- she's a wooden post. Liam Neeson does emote a lot, but it's one note that gets tiresome. Diane Kruger is the only reason I didn't give it an even lower score.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Liam Neeson kicks butt overseas once again.,"Like his character in ""Taken"", Neeson plays a loving man who is looking to seek those who've done him wrong. Unlike his character in that movie, he is not looking for kidnappers, but those who might have something to do with the fact that his wife no longer remembers him after he had a terrible taxi crash. That's one thing the movie never explains: why is his wife the one who is acting crazy when she wasn't involved in the crash? Or was I missing something? Anyway, the movie is very effective, at least with the material we expect from a movie like this. What's new, or apparently new, is the former Stasi agent and this Nazi stuff. I could have done without this part. Frank Langella plays a character, who, it turns out, is not on his brother's side after all. This I did not see coming. Why he underplays it, I have no clue. I also enjoyed the last sequence in the hotel, where an alarm goes off, and now Neeson has to destroy a bomb from going off, and also to stop the guy who stole his identity. The way this fight plays out, it looks nothing (or at least almost nothing) like I've seen before.*** out of ****",,Anonymous,Mystery
Neeson comes In From The Cold,"Neeson works well in these European Thrillers, it is hard to categorise these films, they are part mystery, part action, part car chases. And that's what makes these European films work, like 2008's ""Taken"". The Berlin backdrop along with veteran actors like Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz work with the mystery and action elements to give a fairly good romp through Germany. January Jones and Aiden Quinn, as well as Diane Kruger also do some good character work in this.I'll have to admit, I was not really expecting the turns this story took, and that is what makes a good film for me, if I can't predict it, it keeps my interest. Plenty to keep my interest in this, Actually the entire plot of this film from the beginning to almost the end is nothing but a huge 'Hitchcock-MacGuffin', the reveal of which is pretty drastic.Car Chases have interesting twists, and the choice of locations make this a great looking film.Like ""Taken"", this film incorporates veteran American actors in a European Setting, along with veteran German actors, Bruno Ganz is always great to watch, and several newer faces, among them Diane Kruger who has already proved her worth in ""Inglorious Basterds"" and ""National Treasure"" as well as a memorable cameo in one episode of Fringe, she earns her place in this film, she did her role well - Not being the Hapless, Helpless Female, her character takes the initiative, because she takes the initiative.There is nothing else really special about this film, it is a good film, written and directed well, and I will be watching out for Jaume Collet-Serra in the near future. Sometimes a film does not have to be spectacular to be great, but this film does have some great things to see in it, and I'm glad I watched it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A disappointment not so much for the acting as for the attempt at political manipulation,"I just returned from seeing Unknown and was disappointed enough that I am writing my first movie review ever (outside of an academic setting). I had great expectations going in as I have enjoyed Liam Neeson's movies in the past and his performance here was consistent with past work. I enjoyed the acting, the plot twists, and the action but by the end I felt cheated because this film was a blatant piece of anti-capitalist political propaganda where the good people are political progressives and the bad people are in the service of large corporations which, by extension, makes the corporations evil as well (it is never clear whether the bad folks work for American corporations or for international corporations). The plot would have worked just as well if the script-writers and producers had chosen to not make it political but we all make choices that are meaningful to us.There has been much discussion as to when various moviegoers have figured out the plot of this film and so I will weigh in with my experience. I figured out the plot (all except who the evil folks were behind it all because there was no basis for inferring culpability until it is stated at the end) about two-thirds or three-quarters through the movie; just before the former Stasi officer finishes fixing himself a special cup of coffee.Would I recommend that someone else go see the film? Not unless you believe in helping to finance anti-American, anti-capitalistic political propaganda. Perhaps it is a sign of the times that I have become more sensitive to this sort of manipulation.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Coach, give me a shooter.","That does it. This being basketball tournament season, I am calling a technical foul on the 'Unknown' bench for creating a confusing and convoluted screenplay designed to befuddle audiences and that is too clever by half. A scientist (but he's not) checks into a hotel with his wife (but she's not), gets into a car crash and becomes nobody. Got it so far? Didn't think so. From there on it gets confusing.Before we get even farther afield, let's just say that the picture is saved by the charismatic presence of Liam Neeson, who plays his part with two of his best assets, his sincerity and his earnestness. He is aided in his earnest sincerity by two excellent performers, Bruno Ganz as a dying psychiatrist and by Frank Langella as the 'heavy'.I guess it is worth seeing, and maybe you are quicker on the uptake than I am (I think it all started to come together on the way to the parking lot).There was just so much contrivance and improbability for a higher rating - but they at least had the right cast.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A solid action thriller...,"Unknown was a really solid action thriller. It seems like Liam Neeson has done a lot of these types of movies lately, but I enjoyed this much more than Taken (which though I loved it, was a bit clichéd). Unknown is much more than the story of a man who lost his memory and seems to have been replaced by someone taking his identity. In fact, the sheer amount of plot twists and complexities keep building up, but you never feel too lost (the exposition bordered on making things way too obvious, but always hid something from you). The action scenes are clear and well done, and there's tons of suspense and gasp-inducing moments that keep the film's momentum going.The story told in ""Unknown"" is one that is not easily figured out, because it keeps taking twists and turns along the way. And it works so well, because you are constantly kept in the dark, and fed small glimpses and pieces of the bigger picture. Yet when everything becomes revealed, you will be in awe, because it was just not what would have been the most obvious outcome.Part of what made this movie different from your usual thriller was the excellent cinematography. Unknown takes place in Berlin, and the gloomy, snow-filled streets and mix of modern and traditional architecture is a really cool environment. There's a bit of CGI that looked somewhat cheap, but for the most part, the visual effects nicely complemented the story.The film is fast paced with plenty of action and it will have you scratching you head, but it does slow down from time to time to give the viewer a chance to pause for thought. That said, it's not difficult to follow what is going on ( why it is going on is another matter), so you won't have to watch it again to understand it.The acting was better-than-average for a thriller on most parts. Neeson did his usual bad-ass job, and really pulled off having lost his memory. He, like with other films he's starred in, carried it on his shoulders till the end.Diane Kruger played a cab driver pulled into the mystery, and she did a great job portraying a sympathetic character and was a strong female lead (also, incredibly beautiful). Bruno Ganz is fantastic as a former secret police officer trying to make sense of what has happened to Liam Neeson's character, Martin Harris. Frank Langella brings his customary restrained dark menace to the screen. The only one actor to disappoint is January Jones who played his wife. Her expressionless and robotic face is a big let-down. Either she had a very straight bored look on her face while she delivered her dialogs or she had a broad smile in other scenes, just trying hard to look pretty on- screen and this was it(though I must say, she looks really gorgeous and sexy)*SPOILERS ALERT* Though the movie is very entertaining, its sometimes patently absurd. I'll give one example at the start–he forgets his briefcase at the airport and realizes this at the hotel and instead of just popping his head in the door to tell his wife he's going back to get it, he just hails a cab and is gone. Then, in the cab, there is no cell service. In downtown Berlin. Okay, it's a conspiracy, and they've tampered with his phone and his wife is really a double-agent plant and so it's all logical. Except not quite. You'll see.*SPOILERS END*A lot of people have criticized the movie being similar to Taken, but the only comparison that this film has with 'Taken' is the star and the way the makers of the film have wanted the poster to be designed. After this, there is nothing else, but two good movies.""Unknown"" is a quality thriller that hooks you in with intrigue and suspense and then keeps you waiting right till the end before it delivers its knockout twist. And I'll wager that you won't guess what that twist is. I rate it 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An excellent mystery action thriller all round that I'm glad came to be known.,"Unknown stars Liam Neeson as Dr. Martin Harris who arrives in Berlin Germany with his wife Elizabeth (January Jones) for a conference. At the hotel they are staying at he remembers he left one of his briefcases at the airport and catches a cab to go back and get it. But on the way he and the cab driver, a woman Gina (Diane Kruger) are in an accident and crash off a low bridge where during the plunge Martin hits his head on the window.He wakes up four days later from a coma in hospital and finds he has amnesia as his memory is fragmented. He remembers his wife at the hotel and goes to her but she claims she's not married to him and produces her husband Martin Harris (2). Martin claims number two stole his identity and despite trying to persuade people no one will believe him as he finds people he knows do not recognise him as the real Martin Harris, so he enlists the help of Gina and investigator Ernst Jurgen (Bruno Ganz) to help him find out the truth. Is ""Martin"" losing his mind? Is it the amnesia? Or is there something more sinister going on?Well watch and find out for yourself. The film keeps you cleverly guessing from the start to the end with a cracking twist I didn't see coming. The action sequences are exciting with a one in particular breathtaking car chase with some great stunts, the story is strong for a Hollywood thriller and interesting, unfolding at a brisk pace with plenty of suspense and tension. Liam Neeson gives a terrific performance and is establishing himself as the new ageing hero of Hollywood like Harrison Ford and others previously. He is really convincing of a man being lost with no identity and makes you care for his character. Bruno Ganz as Jurgen gives a solid supporting performance. It is also superbly shot and edited by director Jaume Collet-Serra.What stopped short for me of giving this a ten is the fact there are some plot holes (though they are not too bad) and the supporting actresses are not memorable. Diane Kruger and January Jones give poor plain performances and do not really convince in their roles. Also the script isn't really that good and feels very run of the mill and there is little characterisation of Neeson's character, which could have rounded off the plot better. But despite these gripes it didn't bother me too much and I was highly relieved this was a great film after watching the terrible I am Number Four at the cinema only two days previously.

'Take back your life',"UNKNOWN is. Many aspects of this cerebral suspense thriller are given to the audience in snippets - bits and pieces that involves the audience in keeping up with the ever-changing story line or simply throws everybody for a loop - especially the ending. Adapted from the novel 'Out of my Head' by Didier Van Cauwelaert and molded into a screenplay by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell this film needs a seasoned director to make it work: Jaume Collet-Serra isn't quite there yet.American Biotechnologist Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) arrives in Berlin with his wife Liz (January Jones) for an important world conference to unveil a newly developed failsafe corn developed by Professor Bressler (Sebastian Koch) and underwritten by Prince Shada (Mido Hamada). But once at the hotel Matin realizes he left his briefcase at the airport and while Liz checks in he grabs a taxi driven by Bosnian immigrant Gina (Diane Kruger): in an attempt to race against time the taxi is in an accident and plunges into the river - Gina escapes the underwater car and saves Martin's life. Martin is comatosed in a hospital for four days attended by Dr. Farge (Karl Markovics) and wise nurse Gretchen (Eva Löbau) and when he awakens he has memory loss: he remembers his name and begins to piece together the events that brought him to the hospital, remembering that his wife Liz may be worried about him. He leaves AMA and begins a journey that proves to be a long one - his identity has been stolen by another man who claims to be Martin (Aidan Quinn) and Liz claims she doesn't know her own husband. Without identification and desperate for answers martin finds Gina who pledges to help him, supplying Martin with the name of an ex-Stasi spy Ernst Jürgen (Bruno Ganz) who helps Martin paste together his identity. But the trouble has just begun as Martin finds himself being chased by a group of thugs (Olivier Schneider and Stipe Erceg), and Gina is helpful but in the middle of the situation with her dear colleague Biko (Clint Dyer) also in danger. Even the appearance of martins old friend Rodney Cole (Frank Langella ) doesn't aid Martin's quest for regaining his complete memory until a jarring turn of events introduces a whole new explanation for the strange plot that is so full of twists it almost sinks from its own weight.The cast is strong and Liam Neeson again proves that characters such as this fit perfectly into his charismatic macho appearance. The other reliable pros - Diane Kruger, Sebastian Koch and Bruno Ganz - add credibility to their roles and there are many relatively new faces that seem to show great promise in screen presence. Yes, there are some fine car chases and pyrotechnics, all well captured by Flavio Labiano's cinematography. The driving musical score is the work of John Ottman and Alexander Rudd. Though is a bit over long at 2 hours, it does deliver some fine entertainment. Just leave the sense of logic on the shelf for this one.Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Take Back Your Idenity,"I went to see Unknown at the theater on opening night in February of 2011. I would like to say first of all, I don't agree with those haters of this movie, I thought it was a great movie even though there were some factual errors, Hollywood is not perfect, far from it, LOL :D. I think what drew me to the movie was the plot; it was an exciting movie; and a HELL of a lot better than TAKEN, which was one of the worst Neeson films I saw. This movie had it all, excitement, suspense, and plot twists. I am surprised by the negative views of the movie, to me it was great, it kept you guessing until the end of the film; and I didn't find the plot confusing at all. The only surprise of the movie was Neeson's true identity, that was shocking. I thought the cast was excellent; and the ending wasn't a tragic one. In the end it worked out for Neeson; and it felt good for the viewer that Neeson changed his ways and was going to do a 360 with his life.. He would begin a new life, with his friend that helped him find his way out of his personal hell. This movie is a true winner of 2011 for the whole family, hardly any profanity; especially sex which can ruin a great film. This movie is worth watching more than once; and it's a great addition to your video library.THX, Kris L. CocKayne-abucki4ever71- GO BUCKIS :)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Boune-ish Affair,"Before watching this film you should take a look at Neesons previous film ""Taken"". Then have a look at the last two Bourne films. You'll see the same type of production with dark, moody filming, wobbly ""hand held shots"" with a documentary feeling. They even stole some Inception ideas with the slow motion car crashing off the bridge. Berlin looks good in these sort of films as the city has a backdrop of a bygone era that still exists within it's architecture.Neeson takes his role seriously and is very convincing post crash. He is not as sharp as his role in Taken but he is nether the less good with his gritty voice and dialogue. I suspect Neeson was held back some by dubious support acting and he makes the most of what he has to play with.There is something for everyone but I can gauge how good a film is if I decide to buy it on DVD or Blu-Ray. Taken I bought the Blu-Ray, this, i'll buy the DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Liam Neeson in another action movie,"Just to clarify, this is a psychological action thriller film. In my opinion, this movie should have had less ""action"" and more ""thriller"". Related to this is the fact that I know Liam Neeson plays a great positive character but I really don't buy him as an action guy. Maybe it's just me because when I told people I was going to watch a movie called ""Unknown"" starring Liam Neeson in the main role, they were like:""It's an action film right?"". And that is not because they had heard of the movie. I was happy to see that this movie isn't all about action.Moving on to more important stuff, the movie was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. He is an inexperienced Spanish director. Apart from this he has directed only 3 movies:""House of Wax""(the only one worth mentioning, but anyway), ""Goal 2: Living the Dream"" and ""Orphan"". And considering this, I thought he did a great job directing this. Also the script is actually good, except the lines from the action parts. Another positive thing is that for 3 quarters of this film, I knew how it was going to end. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by how the ending turned out.A thing that I really disliked was the fact that they put Frank Langella in the main cast. If you look it up on any site you see his name over there among the main actors. I was thrilled to see him in this movie but...HE PRACTICALLY HAS A CAMEO APPEARANCE. That really annoyed me.But at the end of the film I was like:""Waw, I really liked this movie."".",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Sure there were fight scenes and a car chase and lots of, ""Wait, what's going on?"" meant to elicit intrigue - but for far too long I was left with no idea as to what was happening and I found myself not really caring either. Diane Kruger's performance was flat and Liam Neeson was his usual squinty eyed man-on-a-mission. Before I was keyed in to what was actually going on, all I could think about was Sandra Bullock's 1995 movie, The Net. Since the moment I was finally clued in to what the real story was, I've been plagued by the idea that I've seen this exact story line before but I can't for the life of me remember if it was another movie, a TV show, or even a book I read once. All in all, I felt like I'd seen the whole thing before and the weak twist at the end wasn't enough.Bottom line: I'd watch it if I didn't have anything else to do and it was on TV.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good movie, very mind blowing","""Unknown"" is a 2011 thriller film directed by Jaume Collet-Serra and starring Liam Neeson as Dr. Martin Harris, a doctor who flies to Berlin with his wife Liz (January Jones) for a summit. Suddenly, he forgets a brief case at the airport when he arrives at the hotel. On the way back, he and the cab driver (Diane Kruger) get into an accident, and Harris is placed in a coma for four days and wakes up and is suddenly unknown by everyone, including Liz. He sets out to prove who he is.I enjoyed the film because I thought it was thrilling and it was mind-blowing too. It didn't move as quick as ""Taken"" did, but it still proved to be a good movie. Neeson's character has the same personality and he proves it both times. The film put out a lot of questions and made me think but I answered them all. I would definitely recommend this. I also liked the twist in the ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Unknown is what the movie is,"Unknown is not your usual Liam Neeson action movie. In many ways it is not an action movie at all. A man goes to Berlin with his wife, but ends up being involved in a serious car accident that leaves him with a memory problem. Much of the film is spent with the man trying to remember.Unlike the movie, Taken, where you have a simple plot with easy action, this movie tends to feel a lot longer than it is, mainly because the plot is elusive. This movie never felt like a Liam Neeson action movie, even with the action scenes. Liam Neeson plays Dr. Martin Harris. Dr. Harris gets help from a German cab driver named Gina, played by Diane Kruger. I think you know a German accent is bad when throughout the film you are constantly thinking the actress has a very bad German accent. This film tries too hard with the wrong actors playing the wrong roles. I think it is the first Liam Neeson film that I kept checking the time. Usually they fly by.The movies, Taken, The Commuter, Non-Stop, are all better Liam Neeson movies because the roles are more suited to his style. This film is more of a mystery thriller and while it does have some action scenes, there are not enough to carry the film and the actors in order to make it a good movie worth seeing. Like the bad German accent, this film tries too hard to be something it is not.This was the first Liam Neeson film I struggled to get through to the end. Not enough action and a convoluted plot line make this a hard film to recommend.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worth watching,Decent mystery movie .. plot is good ..nice acting .. ignore few loopholes .. it's very gripping,8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A film that gives more than what the trailer promised,"Without spoiling too much, I originally thought that any surprises to be found in Unknown were ruined having viewed the trailer and that I had figured the film out. Only to my surprise that I was wrong and that Unknown is a thrilling action film that never looses its pacing. The plot quickly develops over the 2 hour running time and will leave the viewer satisfied.It is easy to compare the film at first to Taken, another film staring Liam Neeson but once it starts, the film is very different. Whether Unknown is better or not is debatable but Liam Neeson succeeds in giving us another fine performance in a career of many.Other stars include January Jones from Mad Men who is good but felt underused. Diane Kruger is clearly immersed into her role as an illegal immigrant in Berlin caught up in the films story and Bruno Ganz is fantastic as a former secret police officer trying to make sense of what has happened to Liam Neeson's character, Martin Harris.What makes this film so good is that is wastes no time in setting the up the film and each scene gives something new to the film rather than taking away. There is never a dull moment because the story is always moving and we, the audience are put in the position of Liam Neeson, immersing the audience into the story. The film is not deep but it is neither dumb, the script is great and we feel for the character's frustration as he is not coming up with any useful answers.Despite what some may consider a relatively low budget when compared to other action films (The Bourne film, James Bond), Unknown manages to pull off some gripping action sequences and chases but it is through the director's ability to tell a story that makes scenes that just involve dialogue to be as exciting as the action sequences themselves.I strongly recommend anyone to see Unknown because you will enjoy it. With many films coming out receiving mixed reviews, this is a film to fall back on where the pacing is perfect and the tension is set to maximum. Hopefully Liam Neeson's next action film will be as good as this to wash away Wrath of the Titans after it has come out.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Like clever thrillers? Keep looking.,"I'll admit that I didn't expect this to be my favorite movie to begin with, but I did expect to be somewhat entertained throughout the movie. The first word that comes to mind is «pointless». The action sequences are predictable, the script is flat, and the acting is uninspiring, which is sad considering that I really like Diane Krueger and find Liam Neeson to be solid.I won't make you read a novel here, so I'll just sum it up real' quick:Man gets in an accident and is struggling to make sense of who he is. This goes on for such a long time that I just stopped caring and thought: just get to the ending already. And yes, you guessed it, a couple of «mysterious» men are chasing him for an unknown reason, which leads to the inevitable getaway chase and action scenes you've seen a million times. And the average female cab driver turns out to be a natural killing ninja, pro fighter and an expert on high speed car getaways. 'Cause you know, why wouldn't she be. And to top it off, the ending is random with no previous clues to go on.I'm sure a lot of people will like this movie, but if you like your thrillers to be clever and mysterious, I'd recommend another movie.

I vote it a 2/10 for lack of originality and plot; the 2 comes from 1-Liam and 2-Diane. Good actors. That's about it.

Massive plot elements are explained away with one facile line of dialogue after another -- it's as if the screenwriter was trying to pump this one out so fast he would forget what he had already written. In fact, the entire premise of this film is so loosely put together that it's hard to take seriously at all. If Neeson had just stuck to being avenger, and not detective, this might have been gone a bit better.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not bad, but disappointing","OK, before you get mad because I gave it a 1, let me explain. This movie is decent. It is exciting in parts, the story is almost intriguing, Liam Neeson is the man, and I at least had a good time, but for me there wasn't enough incentive to spend $8 and I honestly wish I had waited for the Netflix release.I heard this movie compared to Taken multiple times but let me assure anyone who is trying to decide... this is not nearly as good as Taken. Taken didn't try to be something it wasn't. It had a very clear and simple plot used very efficiently to make one intense and unrelenting action scene after the next.Unknown is not that movie. It tries to be suspenseful, dramatic, thrilling, and intriguing but leaves much to be desired. Its hard to explain without specifics but the main problem I had is that the story touched on so many character development possibilities but basically does nothing with them. A few very important character transitions happen without even a discussion as to why. When the twist finally showed up I thought it was interesting but it didn't change anything for Liam's character. It was like there were 3 or 4 scenes in the original movie where the character had to deal with a ""love interest"" problem, an ""identity"" problem, and a final ""declaration of purpose"" but they decided to cut them out to get to the end quicker. It just kind of rolls on while leaving out the character's real struggles in order to finish the story. And honestly, it may be because I wasn't very attached to the characters, but the twist was a little silly. You may have a different opinion but that's just how I felt about it. Liam Neeson did a great job as always, Diane Kruger was probably the most interesting character (but again with many possibilities left unexplored) but she did a fantastic job... and she's really hot.Now don't think I can't appreciate a simple movie. I love Micheal Bay films. He keeps his character development to an absolute minimum, just enough to keep the audience interested between explosions. What disappointed me about this movie is it seemed to really want to be intriguing, intelligent, and thought-provoking but falls short of the mark.Overall, the best assessment I can give is that the movie was extremely mediocre but could have been great. The reason I gave it a 1 is not because I'm mad at the movie but because when I looked up the reviews it had a 7.9 which is VERY misleading. This is a solid 6.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Bad Actors with Amnesia Go Rampaging in Berlin,"Woa. I'm worried about the people who think this was a well-scripted, -acted or -directed feature, or who found the action scenes in any way convincing. Wrong! This flick is a DUD! Just about passable for those brain-dead evenings when you can't converse yet aren't ready for sleep, killing time between long-haul flights in airport hotels, or creating mood lighting if all your lamps happen to be broken.You definitely don't need to think too hard or try to follow the plot or anything like that because there's precious little rhyme or reason to this ridiculous goose chase! So feel free to fall asleep whenever you get bored, rewind or fast forward and watch the film from random points... heck, you can even switch language settings and view it in Dutch. (Or if you are in fact Dutch then try to pick a language you don't know, like Mandarin.) It really doesn't matter and the movie won't make any more or less sense either way. This is a stoopid film that fails spectacularly at trying to build tension in the way of the Bourne Trilogy or about a million other movies that work the ""did I just hit my head or am I an elite trained assassin?"" genre. But unlike either the Bourne films or Memento, another film that successfully toys with the conundrum of memory and identity, this movie - the title of which I've already deliberately forgotten - never, ever, ever, makes the viewer curious or hungry to solve the riddle.It's just boring and dumb and despite the stellar-sounding cast, the performances are mostly atrociously stilted. A surprisingly convincing Diane Kruger wipes the floor with the rest of the cast. But before we start polishing statuettes: it's not hard to look like a great actress when you're acting opposite a Liam Neeson who displays all the emotional range of a Thunderbirds puppet in the role of a supposedly distraught hit-target in a foreign land. The scene in the art museum with his ""wife"" is jaw-droppingly devoid of any believable emotions, even once you take the double-crossing storyline into consideration. When you consider Neeson's recent personal tragedy in real life, regarding the untimely death of his wife, it seems perverse that he chose this role and even stranger that he gave it such a wooden delivery. The truly uninspired script is only partly to blame.There are so many holes in the lazy excuse for a plot that it's not even worth dignifying it by puzzling over them. But purely for amusement's sake, and just in case you do find yourself at some airport Hilton with 2 hours to murder, here are a couple of questions you might enjoy pondering while half-watching this tripe: who does anyone work for and what are their goals?; how does a guy with no ID or bank card, who's lost all his luggage in a foreign country have limitless and mysterious access to large wads of cash on demand and a mobile phone whenever he needs one?This film has no suspense, no sexual chemistry, unexciting and over-choreographed car chases, and unintentionally hilarious dialogue: would a high-ranking diplomat's wife really offer a Saudi prince a martini as soon as he entered the room?It also has weird casting in the supporting roles. I swear the Sheikh is one of the Wayans brothers in a Halloween costume while Frank Langella is more undead than when he played Dracula all those years ago. January Jones is as artificial and unbelievable as her tampon-brand sounding name: a wind-up Barbie doll. Even once you get that she's SUPPOSED to be a soulless automaton, it's still hard to forgive a performance that would have seemed amateurish in a high school play. Meanwhile Sebastian Koch, so excellent in ""The Lives of Others"", wanders around this set with an anxious look on his face that seems to say 'I hope the cheque clears.' The director is so bad I'm gonna do him a favour and not even mention his name, simultaneously sparing me the effort of going to look it up. Best forgotten.However, I gave the movie a 5 and not a 0 for this reason: should you be at all interested in a career in film and/or film criticism, this film (oh yeah, I just remembered the title, ""Unknown"" - how apt) makes an excellent study into that hard-to-define territory of when something just isn't working.So many times during this movie I found myself thinking stuff like: ""why..?.what is it about this chase scene that's so terrible and wrong...plenty of chase scenes are improbable so it's not just that....what is it about this bit of dialogue here that seems so cheezy and fake..?.lots of movie characters say things they wouldn't say in real life..why is it bothering me that we're supposed to buy Diane Kruger being hot for Liam Neeson..? .plenty of grey goats get down with fresh fillies in popular films...""And on that note, let me conclude thusly:if you find yourself a-hankerin' for a film about an almost-over-the-hill-but-still-kinda-handsome American guy being rescued from vague dangers and a boring medical conference in a European capital by a sexy girl with a cute accent roughly his daughter's age, with whom he then runs through various underworld and club settings whilst evading the baddies, then I suggest skipping ""Unknown"" and instead watching Roman Polanski's ""Frantic"" from 1988, starring Harrison Ford as the Liam Neeson character and Emanuelle Seigneur as Diane Kruger.To be honest, that's not a very good film either. But it's a whole helluva lot more substantial than this lint.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It is a wannabe Jason Bourne with nothing close to the Bourne trilogy even if the movie takes place in Berlin. It was so slow and I lost interest 20 minutes in, all I was enjoying was my popcorn. Bad script, terribly directed. Most people gave it a shot including me expecting a ""Taken"" however it is nothing like ""Taken"". UNKNOWN is literarily unknown because the movie has no identity, stupid plot, old school kinda hints which made the suspense so dull and amateur. Diane Kruger fake accent was so bad, and poor January Jones- What happened to her? Random cast with no cohesiveness whatsoever. The ending was horrendous. I wouldn't watch it even if it was for free. Actually, the opportunity cost of this movie is too high, because you would've been doing something way more interesting in those 2 hours, not to mention that you already spent 20 bucks on a terribly done movie.

Taken 2: My Taken Identity,"Well it's sort of like that and could have been a sequel although it would have been a bit too far fetched. When walking into the theater to watch this movie, I was at least hoping a movie that is in the level of Liam Neeson's past movie ""Taken"". Since the trailer to this movie looked sort of similar and all and even the main character seemed a bit similar. But it did not meet my expectation, and the friend I dragged to see the movie was constantly moving in his chair, checking his phone and taking a deep breath a few times. What I wanted was a simple action movie that has enough flare to be worth seeing in theaters. If it was paced a bit faster and had a bit more better action sequences and connected better and quicker, it might have not been as boring. But the thing is this movie is dull in a lot of parts, it wants to intrigue the audience with the mystery of what is really going on but it just doesn't really work all that well. The movie tries to focus more on the plot and mystery but it's all so darn dull most of the time and didn't really care what happened. The execution isn't even all that clever and relies way to much on amnesia in a very stupid manner, you will see when you watch the movie. Overall, it's a pretty disappointing movie.

Better Movies Exist In Nearly Every Aspect,"Well, Hollywood, you suckered me into another one. After the rousing success of ""Taken"", Liam Neeson returns to the same basic format in ""Unknown"". Unfortunately, the final product is far less thrilling and downright bad.For a basic plot summary, ""Unknown"" sees bio-scientist Martin Harris (Neeson) in Germany for a worldwide science convention. While oversees, Harris is involved in a traffic accident and gets banged around a bit. When he comes to, his memory is a bit scrambled and his entire identity is seemingly stolen.To put it bluntly, this film is bad in pretty much every aspect, but three really stand out:First off, Hollywood suckers us in by capitalizing on Neeson's ""Taken"" persona, only this time throwing in January Jones (of Mad Men fame) as eye candy. No new character ground is trod whatsoever.Second, the plot is almost a carbon-copy of the Jason Bourne series, only much less intriguing and reeking again of capitalizing on an already-done idea.Finally, and this is the truly sad part, this movie actually has a decent mystery revealed towards the end. However, the rest of the movie is so drab that you won't care about the ""big reveal"" when it does arrive.Basically, here is how I look at ""Unknown"": It tries to channel ""Taken"", instead rips off ""Bourne"", and ends up far too close to the dismal ""Edge of Darkness"". I'd maybe give it 1.5 stars, but I can't give it the benefit of the doubt for two stars.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lame from Liam,"So I went into this movie expecting to have a really good time, after all the movie was rated in the 8s when I entered and critics were generally raving about it. What I saw was a lame concoction of the bourne identity, the saint, and taken, put together in a blender, with a sprinkle of predictable, and a whole bunch of lame acting. Don't get me wrong, Liam played his role very well, but the whole plot around him was too recycled and the dialog was mundane. January Jones acted exactly the same as she does in Mad Men, in which I think she plays the cold, naive, clueless wife role very well. Well, it doesn't work in all shows or movies, Jan. And Diane Kruger, whom I actually like, was also disappointing, and her case was not helped with the weakness of the dialog she had. Then there is your typical cheap thriller movies plot holes, characters that add little to no value, and unnecessary long ""you're going to die"" scenes.If you have nothing to do on an evening, and you happen to be in the theater, and you're in the mood to NOT think, and there is nothing else to watch, then I guess this movie is watchable. Go in there with no expectations and you might actually enjoy yourself. But this movie is nowhere near Taken, the Bourne Identity, or even The Saint, for that matter.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

As she is checking into their hotel, he realizes a bag was left at the airport and he returns to get it ... only to be in an automobile accident which leaves him comatose for four days. When he awakens, he is not who he believed/remembers himself to be.Stranded in a foreign city with only his cab driver (Diane Kruger - Troy, Inglourious Basterds, National Treasure) ""remembering him"", he sets out to discover why his past is so secretive and how come he vividly remembers ONLY portions of it. As his wife no longer knows who he is, her husband (now played by Aidan Quinn -- Michael Collins, Jonah Hex, Legends of the Fall) has his name but isn't HIM! Neeson finds himself working against all odds to figure out the mystery behind himself.While there is nothing technically wrong with Unknown, there just isn't anything spectacular about it either. The plot grows and builds and bit-by-bit our ""hero"" puts all of the pieces back together again (think Memento ... only not in reverse and not as good). That the cast was so nice to look at and the film had such a frenzied pace in a foreign locale, Unknown reminded me of the 1988 Harrison Ford flick, Frantic.Without giving too much of it away, it is easy to say that Unknown is as generic as it's name. All pieced together it comes out as a new film; but taken apart piece-by-piece one can see what Unknown shares with every other known suspense/thriller of mistaken identity Hollywood has ever given us. It is fine (and better than many) ... just don't expect anything shockingly new or original with Unknown.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Why did I figured out the plot of the movie at the very beginning......,"You know, if you are a big fan of espionage thrillers, don't watch this movie. That's because you will get the entire story figured out about 5 minutes into it.I watched this film for the sake of Liam Nesson, who was ever impressive as tough guys with a tough voice. This is especially true in movies like Taken. When I first had my eyes on Unknown's poster, I had the feeling of Dejavu. But, since everything resembles Taken, that's not entirely a bad thing, right? Then I went into it expecting some bad-ass actions and a solid story. At the Berlin airport, when Liam Nesson's ""wife"" mockingly said the line ""giving the speech, seriously?"" I got the whole plot worked out. It's kinda sad to see how much your mindset is as clichéd as Hollywood wants you to be.Then the entire movie played out as I expected. It almost seemed like the writer jumped out near the end saying, ""aha! You must haven't figured out some minor twists even if you worked out the main twist."" And I said like, ""That's exactly the kind of little twists I was expecting, and do you have any more tricks up your sleeve?"" Man, Liam Nesson in Taken was so cool, but in this one he's just like a little girl imitating Jason Bourne. If they could only smooth up some ridiculous romance and unconvincing character development, the movie would be more watchable. It must be a luxury compared to the budget of the film......Although, Unknown was so devastatingly clichéd that it might inspire so many great parodies. Wait for those genius on the web to do so.5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Having said that Liam Nilsson does a nice job as the man whose memory had gone south.All in all, it was not bad, but apart from an excellent car chase there was little here that really jumped off the screen and made it memorable.If you like thrillers with some action then you're going to like this: it suffers from the fact that it takes its central idea of a man who is without identity and wears it thin without much more - when it gets into the action it does liven up.All in all, nothing special, but good competent thriller.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"6.8? Did 250,000 third graders vote on this film?","Unknown is about an ""American"" doctor in Germany that is in the country to attend a conference for medical research. He's there on business with his wife, checks into his hotel, loses a suitcase and then gets in a car wreck when the taxi driver (Diane Kruger) accidentally runs the car off of a bridge. This causes the protagonist to go comatose for four days and subsequently lose his memory. Unfortunately, the plot is Swiss cheese and the acting is almost as bad. It's a shame because this movie contains a few incredible actors, but they had no chance to pull this thing out of the mud. I'm just left wondering how 250,000 people could give this 6.8/10?

Tolstoy's Bourne,"""Unknown"" is based on the French book ""Out of My Head"" written by Didiar van Cauwelaert. The film brings a very diverse all-star cast to the table including January Jones (""Mad Men""), Diana Kruger (""Troy"", ""National Treasure""), Frank Langella (Best Actor Nomination, ""Frost/Nixon"") and most importantly Liam Neeson (""Schindler's List"", ""Taken""). Neeson appeared in seven films last year ranging from ""The A-Team"" to ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" exemplifying his popularity and acting ability in Hollywood. Therefore, because of his vast repertoire of flicks, Liam Neeson is in very familiar territory with his newest character Dr. Martin Harris. The viewer is greeted with Harris going to a medical conference in Berlin with his wife Elizabeth Harris (January Jones), but as he is about to enter the hotel he realizes that he left one of his bags at the airport. Without telling his wife, he jumps in a cab driven by a woman named Gina (Diana Kruger) and heads back to the airport. Chaos is set free when an unavoidable car accident throws the cab off of a bridge into water below. Gina gets away injury free after saving Martin's life. However, Martin was not so lucky. After being in a coma for a few days, Martin does not remember where he is or who he is. While investigating, his wife denies knowing him, bringing up questions of conspiracy in a movie that is impossible for a viewer to figure out until the end.Originality definitely isn't a problem for this film because of its vast ambiguity. Therefore, that aspect will not disappoint those looking for an original film. The problem is that the only other things good about the film are the performances of Diane Kruger, Frank Langella, the awkwardly enjoyable performance of Bruno Ganz (Founder of Schaubuehne Theater Company in Berlin), and Liam Neeson, who obviously led the show. The reason why Liam Neeson is an A-list actor is his ability to play very balanced roles. He always goes as far as he can with a role without overdoing it making him relevant and believable.""Unknown"" tries way too hard to be ambiguous and original therefore creating an ending that just isn't that spectacular. Too many twists and turns send the plot into completely opposite directions. The only things logical about the movie are the performances within it. Otherwise the film ends leaving numerous loose ends and meaningless plot tangents, causing a lot of things in the film to remain ""unknown."" Not to mention the fact that the action aspect of the film is completely forgotten, making the film boring and dull.The movie lacks the thrill factor because of endless twists failing to be followed by fast paced, heart pounding action. Therefore, ""Unknown"" is ""The Bourne Series"" meets the lengthy, longwinded Tolstoy novel ""War and Peace"".",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What a Great Movie But The Same Old Boring Villain,"This movie could have been an 8 or 9 but here again I have to tolerate the same old anti-corporate/anti-American/anti-military/etc theme. When will Hollywood lefties figure out that only about 10% of the folks buy into this crap. This all seemed to start some 20 yrs ago with the Fugitive. Great movie but watch out for those evil pharmaceutical companies (jeeze I had to pay $19/pill for an antibiotic! But 25 years ago I would have been hospitalized for the same...) This left-wing political junk seems to permeate most good films these days. What a shame. I am not asking for my politics, but rather just a touch of reality when it comes to the villains. I think that's what made '24' so effective in its first few seasons and such a flop in the later ones. 'Unknown' targets farmers and 'big-ag' as the villains.

Wasted time,This movie fails miserably in selling the pretended doubt upon which the whole plot is built. So there's no point in watching it. But the worst thing is that you could see the final twist coming 45 minutes away. It's sad to see Liam Neeson relegated to such movies.,2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unknown (2011),"Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. Starring Liam Neeson, Diane Kruger, Bruno Ganz, January Jones, Frank Langella, Aidan Quinn, Rainer Bock, Sebastian Koch, Karl Markovics. (PG-13)Neeson travels to Germany with his wife (a wooden Jones) and ends up in a coma after a car crash, but after waking up a few days later, no one--wife included--recognizes him or believes he is who he claims to be. Mystery thriller relies on its twists (and the suspension of disbelief required to get there) as well as Neeson's dependable presence--he even gets to ""plausibly"" play both an ordinary, exasperated innocent and a formidable action hero. The secret becomes far easier to guess once Langella shows up; he and ex-Stasi agent Ganz possess a weary wisdom that nicely contrasts the slick but formulaic filmmaking. The sort of gimmicky suspenser that demands interest just to figure out what's going on, even as it becomes clearer with every passing minute and complication that it's going to be a letdown. Reminiscent of Roman Polanski's underappreciated ""Frantic,"" which was also built out of contrivances and plot holes, but they were minuscule compared to the ones here.55/100",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not one of his better movie,"As I sat in the cinema, I was excited to be seeing another Liam Neeson movie. But as the movie went on that excitement turned to boredom. The story lacked strength, structure and excitement. And even now as I write this I struggle to remember the whole entirety of the movie. The basis of the story was brilliant, but how the movie came together lacked anything bordering on interesting. Maybe my expectations were too high or just maybe I am picky these days and find it hard to find anything that is not just average but to me this movie would be better watched on a rainy day on DVD. Liam Neeson's acting, as always, was brilliant, though any depth to his and the the other characters in the movie failed to shine through.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great plot, told in such a boring way",Watching trailer and first 20 minutes I was Intrigued what direction this could possibly go. All further advancements lacked anything to build suspense or excitement. Audio didn't build tension. Didn't care about any of the characters. Whilst I love Schindler's List Neeson. It's unfortunate all of Neesons more recent characters are practically the same person and his acting doesn't add any range or diversity.

"Not bad, not as good as i expected","The title says it all to be honest. It's not hard to tell the general outcome of the movie just by watching the trailers, and as other people have pointed out by watch the Bourne movies. I saw the trailer for this in January and have been looking forward to seeing it since. So after seeing it at the cinema last night, what can i say about it? As far as psychological thrillers go it's fairly tame. For the first half of the movie your given a fairly blank canvas to work with, and then it decides to turn in to an action movie. The car chase is good, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't change the fact it made me cringe and just say, 'what are you doing..?'. Films based on this kind seem to becoming more popular over recent years with the latest work of art being 'Shutter Island'. As i was watching i kind of wished it was more like the style of said movie, however it seemed a bit more generic and 'plastic-y' for my liking. So apart from the dull story that has already been given away by the trailers, the (in my opinion) over dramatic acting from Liam Neeson as always, what else can i say about this movie? Two specific things really bugged me, first, you don't defibrillate a person in standing water, it's just going to scar and burn their back if not kill them. Second, i thought we had got rid of 'exploding cars' when the Bond movies died out? It's 2011, we know that a van hitting the floor, no matter how hard, is not going to explode, so why bother? That being said, all mostly negative, the movie does have its moments and there wasn't any point where i felt bored of the film. It's worth a watch, although i don't think i'll be rushing out to buy it on DVD.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The movie raises the expectations of the audience but the payoff is crap. The mystery resolves itself in a manner which is a copy of/inspiration from the Bourne movies among many others.

Lliam is great,"Multiple people have compared this to Neeson's 2008 release of ""Taken."" Both have a similar concept; Liam goes on a fast-paced journey to retrieve something special that has been taken from him. This time it is not his daughter; it is his mind. Unlike ""Taken,"" ""Unknown"" is more of a suspense mystery than an action flick. There are some chases and fight scenes, but that is not the main focus. The movie's plot is focus and it is unique for it is unpredictable. We are confused like Neeson's character and there are times we don't know if he will succeed. There are multiple twists and unlike most mystery thrillers, it took me more than half through the film to figure it all out.In short, ""Unknown"" is a fairly decent mystery thriller. Good performances. Good story for a mystery. Good music. Good cinematography-I particularly like the whole gray, dreary atmosphere that reflects the film's location's bleak weather. Good twists. Good suspense- the sound mixers must've had a kick in adding emphasis on sound effects to startle the audience. The one thing I will note is that Liam Neeson is really showing his age. This is not necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary, it helps his character out. It gets tiresome that Hollywood always uses the generic 30-something year old actor with smashing abs who is tossed into a terrible situation. It is nice to see an aging actor play an upper middle-aged man who has perhaps lost his mind while running away from people trying to kill him.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

'Knows' how to deliver an exciting thriller.,"""Unknown"" is a quality thriller that hooks you in with intrigue and suspense and then keeps you waiting right till the end before it delivers its knockout twist. And I'll wager that you won't guess what that twist is.The film is fast paced with plenty of action and it will have you scratching you head, but it does slow down from time to time to give the viewer a chance to pause for thought. That said, it's not difficult to follow what is going on ( why it is going on is another matter), so you won't have to watch it again to understand it.Liam Neeson gives a very assured performance and is ably supported by Diane Kruger. Frank Langella brings his customary restrained dark menace to the screen, whilst the involvement of Bruno Ganz as a former Stasi agent brings a tangible element of the Cold War to the proceedings. January Jones and Aidan Quinn adequately perform their roles, although she looks a little to similar to Diane Kruger.Berlin, which is often a popular location for films, is an excellent setting for ""Unknown"", with the architecture of the city adding to that Cold War feel. I don't know when it was filmed but the gloomy weather and the fact that many scenes were filmed late evening adds to that 'shrouded in secrecy' effect.Most of the action scenes are excellent, particularly the car plunging into the river early on. However there are a few scenes where you may find yourself saying that this is all a bit too implausible. It spoils the realism of what is otherwise a very entertaining watch.At just under two hours, it is just the right length for an evening's entertainment.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing script !?,"Quite an amazing script this one... The movie starts intriguing, but while the movies moves on, the script becomes more and more unbelievable.

He keeps his formula only on his laptop, so this laptop needs to be destroyed... a world saving formula is stored only on a laptop, and not on a server or in the cloud, amazing, isn't it? But there are some nice special effects, and the cast is quite good, but in fact the acting is pretty bad (especially Neeson).

Hitchcock it ain't,"""Unknown"" is a somewhat Hitchcockian film about a man who suddenly finds himself caught up in a web of intrigue and pitted against a gang of shady characters in a locale unfamiliar to him – in this case, Berlin; the intrigue involves clever complications ensuing from the muddling of both his memory and identity after a traffic accident and subsequent coma. Too much time is wasted on loud and complicated car chases which cause vast destruction of property, not to mention injuries to humans, all of which surely would have dominated the local headlines for days had they ever actually taken place, but here serve only to inject momentary adrenaline into an unoriginal situation; also we are treated to tightly edited but still unconvincing bouts of hand-to-hand combat from which the contenders emerge without lingering wounds.""Unknown"" benefits greatly from the presence of those very good actors Liam Neeson, Aidan Quinn, Bruno Ganz, Sebastian Koch and Frank Langella, all of whom are given strong roles. The females (January Jones, Diane Kruger) are presented less interestingly. We are supposed to believe that the gorgeous Diane Kruger is a poverty stricken Bosnian refugee living illegally in Berlin tenement, but speaking perfect English and able to handle a vehicle like a seasoned NASCAR veteran.

"A few quibbles, but generally a fine attempt at a thriller","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his wife Elizabeth (January Jones) arrive in Berlin for a press conference. Suddenly realising he has left his briefcase at the airport, Harris dashes back off to get it...only to be involved in a traffic accident where he nearly drowns and is saved only by heroic female taxi driver Gina (Diane Kruger.) But when one nightmare ends, another one begins when he goes back to his hotel and finds his wife has no idea who he is, and another man (Aidan Quinn) has assumed his identity. As he goes about trying to make sense of his predicament, he finds he really may not be who he thinks he is and people want him dead.The thriller is a genre that tends to work best when it's pitted with something high concept, maybe something slightly far fetched but with a new angle on the genre formula. Although the stolen identity plot line has been done before (though in nothing that immediately springs to mind) Jaume Collet-Serra's European centred thriller still manages to be an intriguing effort, where you are genuinely, if not quite on the edge of your seat, certainly very interested in finding out how it will develop and what will happen next. Somehow it doesn't quite maintain standards to the end, where, as is the case sometimes, the concept disintegrates and it starts to verge into preposterousness, but the mysterious story at the heart of it all still keeps you hooked and unravels in a way you really don't expect.Performances wise, Neeson has a solid presence as ever in the lead role, his deep, powerful Irish brogue (in the guise of an American accent) carrying him with a natural authority and making him well cast to the role, while as the main female sidekick Kruger takes on an unusually unglamourous role and invests some energy in it (her noble illegal immigrant role perhaps having a leftie political subtext to it.) In other supporting roles, Jones and Quinn have less to do, possibly because of their more limited screen time, while more extended support including the likes of Bruno Ganz, Frank Langella and Sebastian Koch are even more wasted. Still, the solid leads the film has are all it really needs to give it edge.There is this and that you could nit pick about the film, but in this uninspired age, it's encouraging to see a thriller that at least seems to be trying to do something new and take the genre somewhere it hasn't gone before. ***",,Anonymous,Mystery
Exciting...but,"For a film of this genre, UNKNOWN is not bad. That is if you suspend disbelief!! If you take it for what it is, it's not a bad watch when one has nothing else to do.

I DO want to live in Berlin however, because there are not police anywhere to be seen anywhere, anytime, any place, so one can drive recklessly and kill people in a busy Hospital and cause havoc in an apartment house with nary a person paying no mind. No one comes out to see the ruckus or call the police in any of the episodes that happen.

Don't get me wrong, I quite like ""Taken."" I consider it to be one of the more enjoyable film experiences of 2009, a guilty pleasure if you will. But I have to be honest, it's an absurd movie. Actually, ""absurd"" might be putting it lightly. ""Taken"" is like ""24"" on steroids and that is saying something because as much as I love Jack Bauer (favorite TV character from an hour long drama/action ever), he is nothing if not absurd.""Unknown"", on the other hand, is a much more reasonable action-thriller, comparatively speaking. The film does an excellent job of keeping you guessing and refusing to allow you to get comfortable with one idea or another. You know Harris isn't insane because the film opens with him and his wife together but you start to wonder if perhaps he created all of that in his mind. When it becomes apparent that he really isn't nuts, you start working to piece together how anyone could pull a conspiracy of this magnitude off such a short period of time. And when the gears of the final twists and turns begin to whirl into motion, you're not sure exactly what's going to happen but you know it's going to be big. Throughout all of this, Harris serves as the voice of the audience. He wonders aloud throughout his searching and asks the questions that I myself was asking while sitting in my easy chair. As confused as we might be watching the mess unfold, it's no more confused than Harris is himself and it is this element that allows it to truly excel.The actors that surround Neeson all range from marginally mediocre to half way decent and that at times can create an issue or two. In particular, Jones comes off as hollow and one note, just like everything else she's ever been in. But ""Unknown"" starts and ends with Neeson which is a pretty darn good bedrock on which to build a film's foundation. He's always been an excellent actor but in the last few years it seems that he's figured out how to make himself more approachable and therefore more enjoyable to watch. He plays characters that you root for no matter what and that's an underrated talent in Hollywood. He makes bad films pretty good and pretty good films very good. ""Unknown"" is the latter; the concept and subsequent twists would make a solid film regardless but Neeson sells his part wonderfully and pushes the movie to new heights.Check out my site: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com",,Anonymous,Mystery
