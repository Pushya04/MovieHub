"A very good, tense, atmospheric, gothic horror.","To say I didn't get what I was expecting is a huge understatement, I was expecting a run of the mill horror, with all the usual cliches, obvious and blatant scares, etc, but instead I got to watch ninety minutes of rather subtle, intelligent and subtle horror. The film is hugely atmospheric, moody and tense, it is visually fantastic, with great scenery and costumes. The story unfolds cleverly, when I think of witches, this is what comes to mind, as opposed to the more conventional. As you watch you never quite know what's coming next, or who the malign force truly is. Some truly unsettling and disturbing scenes, it's not a horror in the conventional sense, the scares are not cheap, but very poignant. Very good performance from the cast, Ralph Inseson and Kate Dickie in particular. On occasion the dialogue sounded a little flat, but it was in keeping with the setting of the movie.Very watchable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Finally no Hollywood crap,"This is what I call a good movie. But it is not for everyone. After seeing the trailer, lots of people thought they get a horror spectacle. I'll never understand why, because the trailer itself is very slow, just like the whole movie.The movies has a slow pace but its still intense. And it will only feel intense if you give in and not wait for action and speed. This movie is no Hollywood spectacle.The movie feels like a depiction of real life. No stupid jokes and exaggerated action scenes. Slow and calm dialogues. I liked the way the witch was enacted too. I am happy to see that she is not shown as a crazy woman jumping around eating toads.On the other side, I wished there would have been a deeper insight into the witches thoughts.So... go and see if you want more than silly Hollywood witches.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not at all what was expected.,"This is more of a historical psychological thriller than a Hollywood blood and guts horror film.The film is a loving and accurate recreation of Puritan New England in the 1600s with everything from the language to the sets being authentic to the period. That in and of itself makes it fascinating to watch. Having lived in Virginia, where the Jamestown Settlement and the 1600s sometimes can seem like they happened the day before yesterday, I especially enjoyed the film. The location, in Ontario, reminded me of rural Virginia in winter, which made me quite homesick. So the film might have affected me more than some other audience members.The Witch is a fascinating glimpse into Christianity as practiced by 17th century Puritans. Satan and Evil are almost tangible presences in the woods and wilderness of the New World, while God is a distant, cold, and demanding being who must be constantly begged for forgiveness and mercy, since all human thoughts, words, and deeds seem to be gravely sinful and offensive to his eyes.A family of seven (parents, four children, and an infant) are exiled from their plantation community for not adhering to the accepted interpretation of scripture. They build a farm at a distance from the plantation near a frightening wood. The farm is failing (the family won't have food to last the winter). Meanwhile, the infant has been snatched from the oldest daughter while in her care at the edge of the wood. From this point on the family either descends into madness or is destroyed by Satan in the form of a witch who lives nearby in the woods. How the family's disintegration is interpreted will depend on which century's point of view you choose to use.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
If the 17th Century could make a movie,"If people from the 17th Century could make a film about their deepest darkest horrors - it would look a lot like this movie! The Witch engrosses you in the time and place of its setting, it's a family drama, a horror and a folk tale. All interwoven together into a macabre ode of the times when people were frightened of the primeval darkness of the forests and the inexplicable twists of their wretched fates. Intense and gripping from the very beginning. With some of the most amazing acting I've seen by the youngest cast members. Fantastic movie for horror fans and a masterful period piece. I would recommend it highly to horror fans and fans of history and good cinema in general.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Original but overrated,"I first heard about this film on youtube. It would often pop up in reviews and top lists. I recommend you not to believe the hype and watch the movie with an open mind. Otherwise you risk being disappointed like I was.The source material for this movie is amazing. Folktales are a horror goldmine and it's a shame you don't see it being used so often. The movie draws you in with it's original concept and stetting.The approach to horror itself is very unorthodox in the sense that most horror movies nowadays rely on obscurity or grotesque visuals. This movie shows horror in broad daylight, the camera is steady, there are no monsters, no gore. So what good is it? - Realism. Especially in the supernatural scenes. The rawness of theses scenes is the best part. You're always asking yourself 'is this superstition or is this real?' and 'who is the real villain?'. Of course that's until the charm is ruined by the bullshit ending where those questions are answered in the worst way possible. If they left room for speculation and stuck to the subtle approach I would've given this film a 6 or a 7.'The Witch' had some good ideas but it's far from perfect. I feel sorry for people who claim that this movie is some 'masterpiece'. Apparently they've been watching only shitty movies this whole time. The cinematography was dry and even felt effortless. I liked the composition in only one shot: the dinner prayer. The picture lacks tonal contrast to compensate the lack of color. It just fails at grasping your attention. Only parts where the dryness benefits the movie are the horror scenes, all the other shots are just tedious and repetitive. Sorry, but it needs to have style or at least some visual value before it can qualify as a 'masterpiece'.The actors did a great job. My favorite was Kate Dickie as Katherine who I think came off as more threatening then the actual witch.You can tell that 'The Witch' was heavily inspired by Stanley Kubrick's work (sadly Eggers doesn't take notes from his shot composition though). Not only has it similar motives to 'The Shining' but also a soundtrack that resembles Ligeti's 'Requiem' form '2001 Space Odyssey'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Missed opportunity,"The good: Visually speaking the movie is done really well. The cinematography is really good. There's a very dark creepy atmosphere. The acting is also good. The actors are doing a good job. Seems they worked really hard on this.Unfortunately that's where the good ends. Lately I've been seeing more and more movies like this one. Good atmosphere with zero plot. The storyline is just plain boring. The entire movie is built on religious babbling and paranoia. Old time superstitions and no real substance. You get the idea really fast and after that there's nothing. No story, no characters development, nothing. It took me two days to finish watching the movie because I was bored. I even considered stop watching it but I wanted to know if there was a point. Something I didn't see. Well, there wasn't.Now, just to be clear, I understand the premise of the movie. It basically shows the hardships of the period. The struggles, the faith, the superstitions etc. There's a lot of symbolism in the film. They are trying to show us what it was like and how people thought back then but that said, the bottom line is this: if a horror movie is boring then it's just not doing its job. Maybe as a creepy historical drama it could have worked somehow but I'm not even sure how. Truthfully, reading about the movie was more interesting than actually watching it. It's a real missed opportunity imho.So while it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's also not a great one. I actually think that with more work on the script this movie could have easily been a great one but because there's no real substance, real storyline it just misses the mark. Can't really recommend it. Sorry.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Summary:,"This is a story set in the early colonial period of New England. It has the authenticity of a well-researched historical drama, up to and including dialogue delivered in a period accent and vocabulary (softened a bit so that it's easy to understand). Instead of drawing on historical events, though, it draws on historical folklore -- it's the story of witchcraft afflicting a family, such as might have been told at the time.The characters are a very believable, ordinary family, with the sorts of tensions and problems you'd expect from people living a hard and substantially isolated life after being exiled from the local colonial town. They also have period Calvinist attitudes, and the storytelling doesn't present an outsider's view of this or offer a modern commentary, but instead it just displays these attitudes and tells a story from the characters' standpoint.Their reliance on period folklore means that it doesn't strictly follow modern horror movie tropes, either. It has the slow build of a modern psychological horror/thriller as well as the standard formula where tragedies start from tragic flaws, but the traditions it's drawing on depend on a Calvinist's conception of flaws, and treat witchcraft as a horrible, well-understood occurrence rather than a shocking supernatural surprise. This story applies these perspectives.It's very well done in terms of writing, acting, and other aspects of execution, so it might have cross-over appeal to fans of horror, folklore, or straight period drama from colonial America.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Dark, Twisted, and Haunting Imagery","When you leave the theater in stunned silence, I think the film did its job. The Witch is the next low budget horror film to reach the theaters this year, and it's easily the best. The film rarely ever relies on jump scares to get your head spinning as the core of this film's brilliance lies with its haunting imagery and eerie score.It's hard for an audience of this day and age to get into a period piece set in the 17th century without any big name actors or action elements. And I have to admit that I wasn't sure I wanted to see a film like this, especially with its horror elements. But my eyes were pealed from beginning to end. I wouldn't say anything about the story shocked me or had me confused, but the imagery, score, and uncompromising nature to Robert Egger's direction left me breathless. Within 10 minutes I was looking at the screen and whispering to myself ""why would you go there?"", ""Don't do that!"", or ""come on, really?"". Not because I thought it was poor story- telling, but because I was so invested as to what these characters were doing.With that said, I don't think this film is for everyone. It's brutal, harshly relentless, and utterly disturbing. The characters use all 17th century dialogue and the cinematography sets this grey and ominous tone. The imagery from beginning to end will stick in your head as it has done with me. But that's the way horror films should be. I wouldn't say it's more a psychological thriller because there are plenty of terrifying moments, but it is more for the 'Under the Skin' crowd than it is for people who love 'The Conjuring'. Even in its harsh moments, I was always invested and I can't deny the quality of the writing, directing, and acting all around. This is how you make a horror film.+Terrifying imagery+Egger's direction+Invested from beginning to end-Sometimes the dialogue is difficult to follow7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Wouldst thou like to fall asleep? I prithee, watch on.","New England, 1630: a puritanical family living in the wilderness are tormented by dark forces.Robert Eggers, director and scribe of The VVitch, thou displeaseth me with thy movie: I commend thee for thy dedication to realism, but authentic production design, gloomy cinematography and oft incomprehensible period dialogue maketh not for an enjoyable experience.I wished to take my leave soon after the start, though I continued perchance matters improved.

As good as psychological horror gets,"I feel like I can't come up with the right words to describe this incredible movie, but I'll try. The lingering atmosphere is done incredibly well from the beginning, helped along by a combination of a tense score and the use of extended periods of silence. The acting is bang-on and you don't know when or how it is going to end. The movie doesn't have 'twists' exactly, but the way it is written keeps you guessing constantly. And I personally loved the ending. Though the potential is there to use a more standard approach, The Witch however opts to go down a more subtle avenue, leading to the true nature of religious persecution that is on full display here. Additionally, elements of the story have been taken from historical documents, adding another layer of grimness. The supernatural elements are obviously up for discussion, but that these tales were written centuries ago somehow adds more to this disturbing film.The film is set in 1630, in New England, America. A Puritan family is banished from town for their beliefs (or it at least seems this way, perhaps based on real events). They are forced to move to a farm that feels like it is on the edge of the world, as from the opening the woods that line the farm are presented in ominous fashion, almost creating a character that could serve as the scariest element of the film. What exactly goes on in there? Why can't the children venture inside? Suddenly, without warning, tragedy strikes. The family clings to their faith to prevent them from starving as their crops die; with nothing they can do to prevent it.The period is an appropriate choice given how humans treated each other centuries ago, and an ideal setting for a horror tale. Some conversations require a little more attention, as the characters speak in 'ye olde English' which takes a little getting used to, but it adds another layer of mystery as the family is struck by more inexplicable hardships, causing them to become wary of each other, which in turn leaves them in a increasingly vulnerable state. I can't say I is scared, but I do know that I is gripping the armrests pretty hard for most of the film. Hell, they manage to make a scene where a man is hunting a rabbit seem tense and creepy! Additionally, this is not for inattentive viewers; I could see clock-watching all around me. The incredible camera-work almost reminds me of Paul Thomas Anderson in There Will Be Blood, with many long takes, often slowly panning or zooming in. There is also a focus on facial close-ups reminiscent of Bergman, all of which is a feast to watch on an IMAX screen. The score matches this camera-work almost to perfection, while there is often a lengthy silence between dialogue to contrast the tense music. It also must be mentioned that the child actors really shine, out-doing their older counterparts.This really is my sort of horror film. No jump-scares, convincing acting and a focus on a dark, foreboding atmosphere rather than the grotesque and bloody. This is another of those films I would label as a psychological thriller, as the supernatural horrors are kept almost completely out of view as we witness the downfall of a family who are all affected, turning on each other as their faith is truly tested.This film couldn't have catered to my interests more; I can't recommend it to everybody, but if you go in with no preconceived notions you'll be in for a tasty, if not nasty surprise. The suspense is almost unparalleled among recent films, and the 'horror' genre conventions are cleverly subverted to deliver a film that is better than 'It Follows' while being a completely different film. In addition to all this, there is much to take in thematically if you are so inclined Hell, I'd love to see this again to do just that.www.epilepticmoondancer.net",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Great Atmosphere, Great Sound, Different Kind of Movie","I found ""The Witch"" to be a generally unnerving film, and one which--though I would not place it in the pantheon of scariest flicks I've ever seen--had some moments that I'll not easily forget.The atmosphere Eggers creates alone is enough to wrench serious dread from scenes other directors would be otherwise unable to make even remarkable. The score, too, helps cull this dark tone and adds life to a film that can be borderline tedious.That being said, ""The Witch"" is not for everyone. It is strange, slow but steady, gruesome at points, and almost un-watchable at others. There are two sides to this film; one which I had hoped the director would stick to concerning the family and their struggle with religion and isolation; and another which plays as an undercurrent to most of the film and then takes charge in the end. Sadly, it is this second side which keeps me from giving the film a better score, and that ultimately hurts the film in the very final scene.Overall, I enjoyed ""The Witch"" and its originality. Eggers has achieved a film that, for all its low-budget and independent film background, feels richer and better made than many horror entries of late. Should you decide to see it, a word of caution: do not expect a fast-paced movie full of jump scares and creepy crawlies emerging left and right. As the opening credits remind the audience, this is a folktale. One that does not shy away from exploring the real dark places.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"great historical accuracy, but needs a better ending","Absolutely top notch on historical accuracy and high production value for a small team/low budget film.You really need to have closed caption available in order to watch this. Too many people talking too fast and too low while speaking an older form of English makes some scenes' dialogue difficult to understand.The end left everyone in the theater wanting, though.This film was wonderful at pulling you into the mindset of people from its time-period.

Effective Film with a Rich Atmosphere,"The Witch (2015)*** (out of 4)Extremely well-made horror film set in New England during the 1600s as a family moves away from a colony and starts a new life in a house on the edge of some woods. One day the oldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) is watching her baby brother when something from the woods takes the child. Soon the family is torn apart by witchcraft.Writer-director Robert Eggers' THE WITCH is the latest horror movie that is getting raves from critics and fans and it's also the newest movie to be called the ""scariest of all time."" I'm not going to sit here and say the movie scared me because it really didn't. With that said, THE WITCH really was a refreshing throwback to various European horror films from the late 60s and early 70s where atmosphere was the most important thing.I really respected that Eggers tried to deliver a religious horror film that didn't deal with cheap shock effects and needless over-the-top exorcisms. There's really not any graphic violence or gore either. Instead of going for these cheap jump scares the director instead builds up a terrific setting and slowly plays out the action. The film clocks in at just over 90 minutes and rest assure that every single second is well-made, effective and it slowly builds up to its conclusion. I'm sure mainstream teenage viewers won't enjoy such a slow build-up but adults should enjoy this.The atmosphere is certainly the selling point of the movie. I thought the director made you believe that you were watching something taking place in the 1600s and there's no question that the entire cast does a very good job in their parts. The atmosphere is certainly rich and thick and manages to set the film apart from most of the horror movies out there now. As I said, I wasn't scared by THE WITCH but it did a good job at slowly building up the drama and it plays out extremely well.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Masterpiece,"I saw this movie a couple of times already and it still lingers in my head everyday. The tone and imagery of this film crawled inside me and nestled itself in my mind like no other had in a long time.The aspects of the film (lighting, sound, dialog, pacing, composition) created an atmosphere so real I was no longer sitting on my couch watching, but rather living this inherited puritan nightmare. This was the result of a director who not only painstakingly researched every aspect of colonial life in the 1630s, but who also executed his ideas with striking confidence.Calling this movie scary doesn't due justice to how truly powerful and intense the horror scenes feel. He doesn't hold back, shy away with the camera or use bullshit jump-scares to frighten you. Rather he composes scenes like an artist would a painting. In fact, I would almost say this film could be seen as a Fransisco Goya painting brought to life. He focuses in on the evil at hand, while still maintaining a sense of unknown and wonder. He is brilliant at what he shows you, but more in what he doesn't show.Films like these don't come around very often. There is true passion seen here by a very hungry, driven and intelligent director. I am truly impressed and hope he has a long and successful career.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Witch is that horror film that reminds you that Horror can still be an award winning genre.,"The Witch is just a great horror film. I loved so much about it. It has a great creepy feel to it, a dark evil vibe mixed in, and a touch of urban legend sprinkled on top.The film takes place in such a secluded location that it instantly gives you a feeling of loneliness and dread before it even unfolds its beautifully constructed storyline. I loved the plot, the timing, the acting... basically everything about the film. It's also a brilliant display of female empowerment, which is common among horror films, but in a whole new way that's different from the standard last surviving girl motif.Whether you're a fan of horror, or just great films in general...

The Positive Reviews Are an Enigma,"This film has already been branded ""a horror film for cinephiles,"" which is a way for the so-called cinephiles to elevate themselves - in their own minds - to a status of mental superiority and diminishing those of us who, despite having an avid love for film, also have an aversion to the term.The Witch is nothing special. It's nothing enjoyable, nothing memorable, and nothing that's worth revisiting at any point in the future. What began as a promising movie missed the mark entirely. It's in the same vein as the 2020 film The Turning: it set up a concept that had potential, and completely blew it with the execution.This movie was so painfully boring that every passing minute felt like torture. This story could've been engaging and truly suspenseful but, by the time the movie decides to actually do something with itself, it's too late. An audience will lose investment in a film's plot and characters if nothing happens for an extended period of time, and this movie excelled at that, offering a story that, even in its non-horror-centric plot points, couldn't be even mildly entertaining enough to hold interest. This movie is best served as background noise, because ultimately it's not worth much else.To pick positives to point out about this film would be the beautiful cinematography, the decent acting and the costuming. It truly does look like a period piece, which would be extremely interesting were it not for the fact that the film is so bland and so unconcerned with keeping the attention of the audience that it's a chore to sit through. Catch this one if it's on TV, but it's not worth the price of admission to purchase or even rent.I can already feel the cinephiles preparing to descend upon this review and mark it ""not helpful"" for a conflicting opinion, which will only further showcase my point. This isn't some film for people of higher intelligence; it's a cure for insomnia and a lesson in the history of filmmaking failure.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"An unnerving, surreal descent into religious paranoia","THE WITCH is, in a word, unsettling. Horror films don't normally have an effect on me, much less scare me, but this one was unnerving in a very palpable way. It's about a Puritan family who are banished from their village for an unspecified religious offense, and subsequently move to a location bordering a forest. While there, repeated misfortune and isolation create the perfect storm of religious paranoia over whether one or more of them are possessed by the devil. What THE WITCH masterfully does is to create this tense atmosphere and maintain it over nearly the entire length of the film. Whether it be odd/surreal imagery, slow and deliberate camera-work, or an eerie score reminiscent of Ligeti's ""Atmospheres"" (used in Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), all of it is used to brilliant effect and should be capable of rattling even the most seasoned viewer, especially if they have a religious background/upbringing (as I did). In fact, I sensed a lot of Kubrick here; not just 2001, but also THE SHINING. Not surprisingly, they share some thematic elements. The performances were also pitch perfect and very believable for the characters the actors played and, although this might prove hard to get by for some, they speak in period-authentic language/accents. Ultimately, the film is rather ambiguous as to whether or not the events occur in the manner you see them, but that's the beauty of it: like religion itself, THE WITCH is open to interpretation. And as such, it establishes itself (in my opinion) as one of the best horror films of the last 10 years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Top Ten Horror Movie,"The best part about The Witch, besides the acting, is the dichotomy between drama and what is actually a surprisingly fast paced and accessible horror movie (with few genre clichés.) The film could be looked at as two separate stories heavily intertwined: the supernatural horror of the woods vs the very real terror of violence erupting within the family, and amazingly this is all done seamlessly, missing no beats and never seeming to give up one for the other. In that way, The Witch has the elegance of a clever children's story (A New England Folk Tale to be precise) with the intensity of a melodrama. This would never have worked if the cast didn't kill every role, but luckily for us they did; they murdered those roles.I don't think I've ever actually seen a movie during which people, in the middle of a crowd, screamed. The Witch did that. The Witch made people scream and gasp so loud the whole room heard and it did other things too: it told an engrossing, intelligent story. There are minor ""complaints"" I may have that keep it from being 10/10 (the shots don't carry the film as much as the writing,) but really this is a horror film that could easily make a top ten list. It's just good fun (and the ending is great... don't bash the ending... people are bashing the ending but I don't know why... it's really a perfect ending...)",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A disturbing underrated horror film,"I had pretty high expectations before watching this movie so I kind of thought I was going to be let down, but I have to say I was very pleased with it in the end. It had, for the most part, great acting, especially from the daughter, and the development of the characters was done very well. The movie genuinely disturbed me and that's why I think it excelled as a horror movie. It's also about how the family drastically changes after being kicked out of their ""religious town?"" and their lives affected because of witch craft. But I also like, of course, a good story to them as well, and this movie had just that. I loved this movie but it's definitely not for the faint-hearted.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
hire a linguist,"I'm not sure what the point of this movie was. You never really find out exactly what happened. You're sort of left wondering what the point of the last 92 minutes was.The main problem with this movie was that they tried (and failed) to write it in an older dialect of English and failed miserably, because, despite being filmed in Toronto which has at least 2 universities offering a linguistics program, they failed to ask a linguist how to speak the English properly.They used the word ""thou/thee/thy/thine"" as opposed to ""you/your/yours"" throughout the movie. The first problem with this is that this movie is happening after the Brits invading North America. The term ""thou"" died before this. The second problem with this is that they used the term incorrectly. The word ""thou"" is the singular second person pronoun, whereas ""you"" was the plural second person pronoun, or the singular polite second person. If you speak French, the word ""thou"" is the equivalent of the word ""tu"" and the word ""you"" is the equivalent of the word ""vous"". At one point, William says to his children, ""All of thee stop that!"" and even a week later I am still cringing. Other wrong parts, is that for some reason, we assume the first settlers must have spoken present-day British English (even though there is no ""one"" British English), when in reality, North American English, specifically Canadian English is, is more like Old English than any dialect of British English. One major part of this was the the characters took part in the deletion of h's and coda r's. Do you know how we know the first Brits to come to North America pronounced all the r's and h's? Because we in North America still pronounce all our r's and h's. What, did these people think Brits had stopped pronouncing r's and h's long before they came to North America and that somehow the sounds reappeared in North American English? The other problem is they went all Shakespearean style in their talking. Shakespeare not only happened 200 years before the time of this movie, but it was written in poetic prose meant to be like candy to the ears and did not reflect how people actually spoke. How would you feel if people 500 years from now looked at our poetry and assumed we all talked in ridiculous rhymes like that? The whole movie was an ear sore.

"Superbly executed, amazing production but not scary to me. But is to some.","Production and costume designer Robert Eggers directs his first feature length debut about a family settling down in New England in the 1630s who experience something of the supernatural.Eggers previous movie roles really shines through as the whole production is on point, especially the sets and the costumes. The film is often dark, even during the daylight hours giving an enormous sense of bleakness throughout.Ralph Ineson leads his devout Christian family with his wife and five children, who struggle to keep the farmstead going and there's possibly something working against them other than the elements.Anya Taylor-Joy plays the eldest of the children and is usually shackled with the responsibility of tending to her younger siblings while father and boy go off to hunt. But they soon fall prey to the Witch who lives in the nearby woods, but not how you might expect.Ineson is amazing and truly deserves much larger roles than the ones he's played previously. Taylor-Joy already appears to getting noticed as quite the star with Morgan and soon to be released Split. But the whole cast here perform amazingly well, and the script is quite astonishing with impressive diction.Mark Korven does quite the eerie score which probably makes up for a lot of the atmosphere, it resonates right through you immersing the viewer deeper in the film and I strongly suggest not listening to it in isolation alone.Unfortunately with all these key elements, the story, the script, the haunting score and the production as a whole, it's not at all scary and is more of a drama than horror. It certainly has that feel of the classic horrors like the original Wicker Man, but it just didn't get to me like it maybe should have.Having said that, this film is definitely split into two camps.

Brilliant,"I'll start by saying that most everyone giving this film a 1 star rating is probably into hollywood ""horror"" trash like the Annabelle films.This film is so much more than tension breaking jumpscares and basic, predictable plot. Genuinely this was the first original horror film I've seen in a long time. It was refreshing to watch actual horror that doesn't try to get cheap scares out of you. It was an immersive experience, and even though I knew I could press the pause button to go grab a snack, I never did.Highly recommend this to anyone who isn't into bad scary movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unsetteling,"The less you know about this film before you watch it, the better. The themes could find no better setting than the 17th century New England recluse scenery where this mythos has the precise place to exist and expand on its own.First time writer/director Robert Eggers is given (almost) full liberty to embrace and elaborate on the weird and the hypnotic, creating an ever-growing and unsettling atmosphere of fear and discomfort. The film hearkens back to those classical psychological frightening horror movies of old, such as Rosemary's Baby or The Haunting where more is made out of less: suggestion is key, actual display is minimal (but ever present and upcoming). When the time comes, the unsettlement is so severe that the Gothic-demented folkloric horror shown grabs hold of whatever composure is left. The Witch is a superior film, masterfully shot and executed, not designed for repeated viewings but intended for a lasting imprint of fear and homage to the mythology it is inspired by.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
WTF did I just watch?,"No spoilers here, because I don't think the film actually has an ending or any plot reveals. At least not any that could be explained. There's a moronic family that gets kicked out of their village in the opening scene. They speak in a sort of pseudo post-Elizabethan English, and they don't use electricity or lawnmowers. One thing we do know is they are ultra religious. Lots of talk about Jesus and Hell but that's pretty much the extent of what I could make of the dialogue. Apparently, as the title suggests, there's a witch somewhere in the wilderness. There's also lots of goats, which is nice, but not enough to save the film from itself. As the film faded to black I wondered, What's the significance of the staring rabbit? Who is Black Philip? I don't understand, but the film isn't interesting enough for me to search out answers.Here's another thing... this film is abstract in the extreme. Not Pablo Picasso abstract, mind you. In fact if I compared this movie to painting, it's like when you see those paintings made by elephants that are given a paintbrush. The result is pure rubbish. Loads of silence between moments when the characters speak, and when they do utter sound they're mostly unintelligible. Lots of wandering around in the woods doing nothing and they also do a lot of whining and crying about a baby that they've lost. Some of the discussions are about whether the baby is in Hell, whether a witch or a wolf stole the baby and whether the baby might have been eaten by wild beasts. Who knows... perhaps the baby got tired of these idiots and toddled off to find his own way. I didn't care about any of these people or what they were doing.

It's going to stand tall in history along with titles such as The Shining, Alien, Psycho, and Nosferatu. Eggers creates such a realistically haunting portrayal of Puritan New England that I'm sure if someone from the 1630s were to have seen it (aside from calling me a witch for capturing souls on moving pictures or what have you) they might assume it was a literal portrayal of events. Genuinely disturbing and provocative, the VVitch is an absolutely masterful historically accurate story of an outcast zealot puritan family forced to live off the land near a dense forest far outside the settlement from which they were banished.

A Defining Witch Film,"A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.There are not many films about witches (as opposed to other horror villains). There are even fewer that are actually rather good. And also very few set in the time when witches were still very much believed to exist in the real world. This film is not only very good, but crafts an entire world -- a Salem-ish environment where it is not hysteria but reality.While there is not much that could be said bad about this film, there is one thing I would like to single out above all else fr praise. The sound design. Wow. The colors, the costumes, the acting and more are all good, but this film is very rich in sound in ways hat we very rarely hear.

The director clearly knows how to make a period piece look stunning. Costumes, cinematography and all that is top notch. But who are these people and why should I care?

After 10 minutes I didn't know any more about the characters, setting or story than I lesrned feom the trailer. The movie crawls ahead with nothing happening besides an hours long commercial for itself and how ""authentic"" a film the director can make.Toss in some sudden ""shocking"" gross footage cribbed right out of a 1990s Tool music video and by that point I've been thoroughly put off this pompous sham of a series of moving images. Nothing in the film served much purpose besides showing off cinematography. Pretty good as a trailer and would have made a fine MTV music video.

Undoubtedly, this film is visually appealing, with great cinematography and acting, but the film meanders for the entirety of its runtime, constantly fooling the audience into thinking something scary will actually happen--but no.

"Great atmosphere - a slow, but scary film!","6,9 is a heavily unjust grade, making this film really underrated.Without giving anything away - this film is different. It focuses on little things, that have a big impact on storytelling. The film is slow, it shows little by little through its 90 minutes, and it is this what makes it so great. You are scared, it's intense, you want to know more, even if more means getting chills down your spine. And the filmmakers know how to reveal the 'more'.This isn't some 'BOO! HA, GOT YOU GOOD' scare jump crap Hollywood produces these days. It rather relies on the unknown.Acting is great, so is the music, which in some part of the film really creeps the f*ck out of the viewer, the setting and the plot are great.Definitely one of better horror movies in recent years, I would recommend it to everyone who is fed up with modern typical 'horror' films that are made by the same old scare jump recipe.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Disturbing in its simplicity,"I made a point of not watching any trailers of this so went in the cinema blind.Was I pleasantly surprised or let down...fact is I don't really know..Not what you might call a usual witch movie ..but I guess that is what I liked about it.The first few minutes contained some of the most disturbing scenes I can recall and hinted at religious hysteria...this carried on right through but kept it well hidden below the surface.A lot seemed to go on including sexual overtones and blind faith..each member was at some point hypocritical and seemed unable to take the strain of their own actions...instead they handed all of their fear and responsibility to God.Most of the movie used darkness to put the audience on edge and even though there was very few scares , the wait for them built up tension...sometimes they came and sometimes they never.Brilliantly filmed,written and directed this is in the same league as last years magnificent "" Babadook"" ..but not as good...the performances were remarkable ..especially by the eldest daughter...I expect to see a lot more of her in the future..Not a classic but a deeply disturbing history lesson in folklore...not so much of a plot driven movie but more of a celluloid bad dream.Only for movie lovers who like something more thought provoking than a Hangover movie...something here to make you think.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Talk About Old Schoo!,"Talk about old school!""The Witch"" is a painstaking recreation of Puritan life in New England. The lifestyle is mimicked. The clothes are period-accurate. The dialogue is actually based off of documents and speeches from that time. It's as if Mel Gibson decided to update ""The Passion of the Christ"" by 1600 years.As mentioned, the movie is set in Puritan New England as a family is banished from the larger community and has to make their own way out in the wilderness. As they build their home, strange things begin to happen, starting with the abduction of the infant Samuel. Things continue to get worse and worse, until... okay, no spoilers. See the movie.This is a dark and effective movie. I can't remember the last time I actually had a start from the all too often used jump scares, but the movie is absorbing enough that it did manage to ""get"" me a couple times. Robert Eggers seems to have kicked off a new wave in old-school, deep supernatural and existential horror. I won't lie that I drew some comparisons between this and Ari Aster's ""Hereditary,"" if nothing else than by simply the way the movie felt and left me feeling at the end.That being said, the film isn't perfect. In fact, oddly enough, it's perfection is what gives it imperfection. The period is so painstakingly recreated, in particular the dialogue, that sometimes hearing it can be jarring, making me stop for just a second to think about what was just said, which unfortunately interrupts the flow and managed to pull me out of the film. It's kind of a strange complaint that something could be so accurate that it fails to suspend disbelief, but here we are.""The Witch"" is quite an achievement and I'm glad that this film, which would otherwise be relegated to underground status, has managed to achieve a following, enough so that Robert Eggers got to do a follow-up with the Lovecraftian-looking ""The Lighthouse.""

A True Definition Of Psychological Terror!,"The Witch is one film that chills you to the bone and will warp your mind while you watch in fear, confusion, and anxiety. There hasn't been a horror film like this in a very long time. Any horror buff will agree that this film is a valuable gem in an underestimated genre. I had very high expectations on this film before seeing it, and it bargains much more than I expected, in which is highly rare nowadays.The film takes place many years before the Salem Witch trials and it starts off with a Puritan family leaving a plantation, due to disagreement beliefs. They find good size piece of land that is outside of a dark forest and built themselves a cabin and a farm. Once their newborn baby disappeared under the care of the post- adolescent daughter named Thomasin, things go downhill from there for the family. Crops of corn go bad, no luck on hunting food, and an ongoing grudge between Thomasin and her mother Katherine. Things get much worse when they sense evil is coming from the forest and the only thing that can save them are prayers and faith. But, for how long?The first thing that brought to my attention is the dialogue. It is an awesome idea that director and writer, Robert Eggers,had wrote it and execute it this way. It feels like we're seeing a prequel of the Crucible (I never saw the movie, but I've read the book. Unsure if the Winona Ryder film followed the original writing). Next, the atmosphere felt very authentic. You can sense absolute no civilization around the family and the cool, damp, New England weather, even though it was filmed in Canada. Third, the acting is tremendous! Nothing was campy, cheesy, or off. They felt like legit pilgrims on the screen. The father, played by Ralph Ineson, is my personal favorite character in the movie. It felt like I was watching a young Donald Sutherland. And last, but not least, the fear factor. It's intense. This film shows no mercy to the victims and to the viewers. There aren't that many casual jump-scares like in your everyday horror flicks, but just gives you a psychological fear that makes you highly uncomfortable. The fear just gradually builds up throughout the plot rather than spurts of scares here and there. It feels like a nightmare that you can't wake up from. After watching the movie, it makes you just speechless.If you a huge horror fan that wants something completely fresh without the cliché, The Witch is for you. After you watch it, you can't stop talking about it. It's that good. Robert Eggers did such a fantastic job and will be a household name of horror such as Stephen King, George A. Romero, Guillermo del Toro and Sam Raimi. this maybe too soon say this because we're in February, but I believe that this is the best horror movie of the year. I don't know if any upcoming horror films that'll be releasing this year can top The Witch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"This is a Movie about Faith, not a Witch (You've been warned!)","The Witch is one of those films where heading into the movie you sort of need to know what you are getting into. This IS NOT a movie about a witch, it's about a family's faith being tested and the fallout that follows...all the while a witch lurks in the woods nearby.The Witch is being touted as a movie with pure, unrelenting dread. While that is the case at times, the atmosphere dwindles during the many times the characters repent. And they repent an awful, awful lot. I understand that the movie is about a family's faith being torn apart from within, but the movie's 'entertainment value' dips during some of those scenes. The tension is killed the moment they start bickering and doubting one another. It's just as one might expect, however, the Devil (evil) is a whisper in your ear which creates doubt with one's faith. And that is just what The Witch is, it's a whisper of evil.There are swift, small build ups that tease there is evil afoot, but just when you expect something sinister to occur, nothing. The hare, the goat, the raven (all heavy symbolism of Satanism) are all present. But they are used ineffectively half the time that they feel like child's play (literally at times) rather than signs of their forthcoming damnation.I really wanted to like this movie more than I actually did and that's a pity. A case can be made that the hype got the best of me, but I was just as hyped (if not more) for It Follows and The Babadook and those two turned out to be some of the best horror movies of the decade. The Witch did have moments of tension and trepidation, but when the time came for the payoff it simply wasn't sufficient enough to justify the many teases of evil.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Best Horror Film In Years,"Let me start by stating that I am a huge fan of horror for many years. I have been very disappointed in the majority of new horror releases for a while now. I had really high hopes for this film and it did not disappoint. Now, this film is not for everyone. Either you will love it or hate it. I feel there is no in between. The complaint most had with the film was the dialect. This is a little jarring at first but you will get used to it. It's a period piece set during 1630 in New England and I can appreciate the authenticity. A lot of research was done in making this film including reviewing documents of this period in time. It really shows and you will transported to this place and time. Also, you get a real sense of the consequences of religious fanaticism. You understand how difficult it must have been for someone who had been labeled as evil and how easily it could have happened. Every difficulty and hardship was instantly blamed on an evil presence which in itself is scary. At first, I was unsure if what was happening was real or imagined by the film's characters and this was very effective. The acting was spot on and some of the best I've seen in a horror film since I don't know when. You can feel each characters struggle and in the end their utter hopelessness. The whole atmosphere of the film was of desperation and despair. It does build slowly increasing the tension and suspense which a good horror film should do. The score was excellent and added to the suspense. The film overall had a disturbing and unsettling vibe to it that I found hard to shake even after leaving the theater. I immediately was reminded of The Shining in the overall feel and look of the movie. It also felt somewhat like a dark fairy tale. If your easily bored this is not the film for you. It will require your full attention. There were people actually leaving in the middle of the showing when I saw it. But I was transfixed and memorized in a way I haven't been in a long time. It was as if I was watching something I shouldn't be but could not make myself look away. There are no jump scares, tons of gore, or typical horror clichés. And if your're not a fan of period pieces this might not be your thing either. I think if a person is open and willing to tolerate the dialect, you will see it for the masterpiece it is. This was storytelling at it's absolute best. It's dark and disturbing, just what I like my horror to be.BTW, if someone plans to write a negative review on this film or any other for that matter, please do not say ""I want this period of time in my life back"". That's not original nor clever and completely overused. It should be banned from anyone's review IMO. This is even put in the title at times so please just stop.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not a horror.,"This film has a lot going for it, excellent acting, some beautiful cinematography, this showed the vastness of the 17th century wilderness and the claustrophobic living conditions. I think films set in this time frame work better as it was a time when gods and devils seemed real to the uneducated people of the time. I did not find this a horror movie but did find it disturbing, some of claimed it is anti religious which it is to a degree showing the nonsense of inherited sin and the tosh of needing someone to redeem these sins. The film is based in 17th century America and the early Puritans, one family is forced out and sets up a house in the wilderness.

Old fashion darkness,"Perfect movie to watch in the darkness, alone past 3 AM.This movie is filmed in a disturbing pace, pretty closed to what it might have been, to be conquering a wild land in those days (1630)I think nothing is left to random. The scenery is powerful, it could portrait any HP Lovecraft tale. The characters are believable, actors well directed. They all look, talk and act in a far distant culture, that sets you really in other world of possibilities, knowing for true that the forces involved in the development of the movie were just undisputed.You know, science came after and a there's a thick layer of ignorance still now about a lot of matters. But in that solitude ? in the awakening of America ? I found myself watching my back, for my home's little cracks in the middle of the night.

Moreover, in the first 10 minutes it's shown that the witch is really there, and no twists like ""the main heroine is the witch"", ""everything is just religious psychosis"" or ""it's open to everyone's interpretation"" will follow.The witch is not portrayed as a monster that goes around forest, murdering teenagers on every corner, but mainly as a ubiquitous, untouchable evil.

Creepy and Vague,I really appreciate the idea of this movie. It wants to make a horror movie that is slow and creepy with vague illusions to things without having to hammer them home to the audience.On the flip side of that it can be too slow. Sometimes it feels like there is too much dead air in between the plot. It doesn't really work to build tension it just shows them preforming normal tasks.It's a marvel to look at and really has a amazing fee while watching it. It's creepy and weird.It does sort of get a little tangled up in its self by the end and becomes a little bit isolating because it is known back and forward by the writer but the audience doesn't have that privilege which is why I think it would benefit from more than one watch.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

That being said, supernatural forces are at play among the family at the core of the movie, and tensions are raised and the family members are against each other as possible demons.Some may find trouble keeping up with the Old English used in the film, but it seems easy enough to understand when you compare it to Shakespeare's works (even with modern adaptations such as Whedon's ""Much Ado About Nothing""). The person who uses this type of the language the most is the father, William, played by Ralph Ineson. Ineson steals the show even when the audience cannot fully comprehend what he is saying (it is easy to get the general idea though). His performance is probably one of the best aspects of this film, other than the lack of great color variety that truly sets the mood for this film.In terms of ""horror"" films, this movie does not produce many jump scares, and is instead just disturbing in content, making it comparable to films like The Shining or perhaps Rosemary's Baby. With the family accusing each other, elements of The Thing also come into play. A solid film when it comes to technicality and the horror genre in general, but it could have used a bit more story and more clarification about the demons at play in this film.3.0/4.0",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"There is slow, Thought out horror, then there is this","Honestly I went into this expecting a slow horror. However I must say the acting was really good and so was the camera work but as a movie it's not a a slow horror movie leading to an amazing pay off instead it's a very boring movie about a family getting upset and doing typical family things around that time. I know that sounds dumb but the moment I seen the first thing causing the family to start their drama I knew immediately where the film was going and since I knew it was boring the entire time. If you found this movie exciting at all I would wonder if you ever learned or studied the salem witch trials because this is a typical ""family reacts to witch activity"" Usually for slow movies you need something to keep you intrigued some mystery or just something compelling which this film does not have. No intrigue, no mystery, no horror, no suspense, typical characters. This is kind of how I would some it up if this were a history channel special film, it would be an amazing film it would get an 8 out of 10 from me, however it is a Hollywood title playing in theaters. I payed a lot of money for my siblings and I to watch a higher quality history channel salem witch trials movie. In my opinion there are much better slower horror movies, here are some examples-Kill List -I Saw The Devil -Gone Girl -Seven I know those last two aren't exactly horror or really ""slow"" but they are not fast either and much, much more worth your time then The Witch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Interesting but the build up is more bust tha boom,Anyone that rated this film 10 stars must be from the 17th century. I will give the director credit for great visuals and dialogue. Story takes too long to build for an ending thats just Ehhh! Some cool scenes but overall disappointing. For me this movie is just okay and might as well be skipped.,5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What went we out in this wilderness to find,"At first viewing I really didn't know what to make of this movie. I thought perhaps that it was an attempt at an art house horror film. Some of the scenes made me think of the art of John Atkinson Grimshaw and others of Fuseli. Almost at times too disturbing to look at, and too disturbing to look away. The story is of some mad fairy tale, as if puritan America had be somehow correct in their witch-madness and crones haunted the woods in search of babies in which they might steal for their unholy rituals.I had to watch it again.The second time I realized that it was not really an attempt at an art house horror film, but rather beautiful in itself as a piece of art. It lacks compassion however and views the harshness of life as the horror itself as this family comes apart in the situation they find themselves. They really are good people, for their time at least, and they try to love each other as their fantasy of life-- where good conquers evil-- erodes over the course of a few weeks.A Stylized fairy tale with no clear moral, though exceptional photography and acting. My biggest criticism would be the black-outs that the director uses to change certain scenes. They are quite long. That is a pretty petty complaint and really not worthy of this beautiful, yet disturbing film that has long lingered in my thoughts well after the final credits.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"An Expertly Crafted ""Folk Tale"".","It has been a considerable while since a film had elicited such a pure reaction of gut-wrenching horror from me. As a horror veteran, tired of the same generic haunted house garbage we get month after month, year after year, I am so happy to write that Robert Eggings brings us a film that transcends all expectations and clichés. The Witch is a palpable breath of fresh air for horror; or rather, a forced serving of black bile poured down your throat to churn inside your stomach and send shivers down to your soul.Even if, and I am certain of it, nothing here will be noticed by such a sanitized society like the Academy or an immature audience seeking cheap thrills, the fact remains that everything on display in The Witch is of master-class craftsmanship. The choice of 1.66 : 1 aspect ratio, a highly subtle effect, is most likely responsible for much of the film's highlights and weaves a strongly claustrophobic environment. Many of the shots are close-ups on characters' faces or characters' backs, a technique that seems to be gaining popularity as shown by last year's phenomenal Son of Saul. The camera rarely expands beyond the intimacy of our characters' personal spaces and this creates a sense of attachment and empathy wherein the viewer experiences a feeling of active participation rather than safe and casual outside observance.The gray and murky autumnal environment is succinctly rich in flavor which accentuates on the film's aesthetic of a ""folk tale"". The sky is ever overcast, and the trees in the woods are all stripped of leaves, remaining tall imposing husks that are easy to get lost in. The aesthetic and environment are almost like characters themselves in The Witch, hearkening back to Eastern European tales of the macabre, the Grimm Brothers, or Nikolai Gogol. And like a classical folk tale, subtlety is key here; you will find no obnoxious jump- scares or cheap gore here.The heavy immersion power of The Witch is pulled along by the small cast of characters who luckily, are mostly unknown. I personally recognized no one besides Kate Dickie from Game of Thrones but this was nothing distracting. It is easier to sympathize with people whose faces you aren't familiar with, rather than thinking to yourself, ""wow, Leo is doing great work here"". This holds immersion for the viewer, and because the cast was enormously talented, nothing broke that immersion or tension. The 17th century script the cast works with is written with great care and effort and remains understandable and relatable, creating no barriers between the film and the audience.There is a lot more I can comment on, but this is a spoiler-free review. For any comment in regards to story, I can say that the way the story is presented is an extremely tense family drama, punctuated by brain-searing sequences of horror. Robert Eggers, for a debut film, shows total command and mastery of the genre he presents, and plays all the cards right. The sensation of horror is crafted through just enough lingering on certain imagery, and just enough glimpses of the horrific and supernatural to make a world of difference between a competent period piece horror, and one of the most disturbing films of the 21st century.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A story of faith ,witch & tragedy ,feel of good old 70s eras of Horror","Its not just a horror for the sake of it .the story shows how blind religious faith can be as dangerous as any real threat .How selfish pride being parent can be dangerous for every one in the family .when adult seeking shelter for their misery in the religion then the youngs become the only reasonable in the family .Its like role has changed .though felt movie ended too early .The story ,scenery,acting was so good that felt they could have added another hour of material just about the interaction of the family member with each other without boring the audience .just one of those movie, you just don't want it to end .Hope they made another one like this with much larger scale .This movie is perfect example that CGI or too much graphic scene are not necessarily needed to make a great Horror .Fear of a Family living in the woods alone can have its own story to tell",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This movie is a research project,"This is one great movie, but it is not really a classical horror film with cheap thrills or jump scares. Rather, it is a much more serious exploration of all things related to the witches tale, from the folk stories to the very medieval mindset that gave rise to Salem witch hunts and the consequent atrocities. This is a work of love, and a product of years of very elaborate and tedious research into the historical context and origins of the concept, and the frame of mind of Puritans that made their primitive prejudices possible. The movie also skillfully touches on the related widespread folklore, that gave rise to the stories from brothers Grim to contemporary Disney rendering of the witches universe. But though there are many layers of interpretation of the movie, it is really in essence an exploration of the primitive Puritan imagination, that made supernatural interpretation out of even the most mundane occurrences, let alone the unexpected ones. This is the place filled with ominous witches, where sin is rampant, where Puritan oppression - sexual and otherwise - can find outlet in fantasy, leading to atrocities and abuse of all sorts. And this is the true horror, the truly scary thing about the whole thing. For, the medieval puritan mindset of New England and their folk tales of witches might be things of the past, but bigotry and close minded stupidity and prejudice are alive and well, especially in America. Salem witch trials and executions are long gone, but bigotry still gives rise to savage acts in the name of ""spreading democracy"", ""fighting terrorism"" or ""communism"", and to the unchecked USA atrocities all over the world. The origins of this horrifying, bigoted mindset are well explored in this movie. It is not supernatural elements that are appalling, but the palpable reality of human stupidity and wickedness of the nature of humans and their ""righteousness"", that is really the root of truly sublime horror.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Overrated,"Unfortunately this one had been really hyped up, like Midsommar which I was also disappointed in.

A VVell-Meant VVaste of Time,"VVhile this movie might have better production value than your average student film, it is in no vvay as intelligent nor as engaging as one vvould hope. The characters are largely stereotypical of the average modern person's understanding of the time period, and are also insufferable (especially one in particular who only ever vvhines and flies off the handle in every single scene). I get that it's trendy to exaggerate historical Christian paranoia nowadays, but A) This depiction of it vvas vvholly unbelievable and inaccurate to this type of scenario, and B) The paranoia in this movie clearly isn't baseless, so the message fails anyway (not that vve get to see much of the evidence of the paranoia being baseless mind you, because that vvould be too exciting).The movie is filled vvith long sequences of a character slowly vvalking from one side of the screen to the other, painfully melodramatic outbursts that drag on vvay past the point of credibility, and creepy music that dramatically builds up to accompany... nothing at all happening.

It vvants to scare you vvith actual vvitches because vvitches are scary, but at the same time it vvants to make a point about religious paranoia and misogyny because vvitches aren't real.

Review of the witch movie,"The Witch has a unique blend of historical drama and psychological horror. Haunting Imagery and Atmosphere are two of the standout elements, and am praising the film's use of eerie score, tense silences, and creepy cinematography to create a sense of unease.The film's Historical Accuracy has also been lauded, with many noting that the period specific dialogue, costumes, and production design add to the overall sense of immersion . It has strong Performances that bring depth and nuance to the characters. It has also Slow-Burning Tension which builds to a disturbing and unsettling climax. It's applauded its Originality and Uncompromising Vision.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Exceptional Horror; unsatisfying ending,"The Witch never failed to keep my attention and always seemed to work hard to keep the flow going. Every aspect and scene seemed to have a purpose towards the ending (except Caleb's sexually curious/ developing moments) and felt overall great. The film is horrific and works so well, being that there is practically no jump scares in this film (like 1 or 2) and its better that way.
The only problem I have is with the ending. The final scenes bring a huge build up only to drop down with a simple ending. That kind of ""what?"" or ""huh?"" kind of ending. It leaves you wishing that the filmmakers would have wrote it a different way. A more satisfying way.
Other than the ending the film does everything it intends to do and is very unique to other horror films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Chilling Descent into17th-Century Madness,"The Witch is a masterclass in atmospheric tension and slow-burning horror. Set in 17th-century New England, the film tells the story of a Puritan family's descent into madness and terror.The cast delivers outstanding performances, particularly Anya Taylor-Joy as Thomasin, the family's eldest daughter. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the eerie beauty of the New England wilderness.The film's pacing is deliberate and measured, building tension through subtle suggestions and eerie imagery. The score is equally effective, adding to the sense of unease and foreboding.What sets The Witch apart from other horror films is its thoughtful exploration of themes such as fear, superstition, and the dangers of unchecked paranoia. The film is as much a commentary on the human condition as it is a horror story.Overall, The Witch is a must-see for fans of horror and suspense. It's a chilling, thought-provoking film that will leave you on the edge of your seat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horror for Historians (in a good way),"This is not a horror movie by modern standards. There's no gore, jumpscares, or set formula of cast or events. It is, however, a work of art well-cared for by its creators. The setting, costumes, acting, writing, and directing make for a film firmly set in our very real history, with people's very real fears and anxieties manifest beautifully in a tense, dark atmosphere.
This film hit me a certain way that others may or may not experience. I'm an avid amature historian, with an upbringing with both devout Christianity and a mentally unstable (sometimes abusive) parent, so relating to the characters' plights, especially Thomasin's, came easily. The characters were well written and shaped, and all of them seemed to have an important place in the story. Except maybe Jonas. He didn't have much screentime or development, but whatever.
The writing is excellent, with perfect period dialogue and well-paced scenes, though the overall story did seem a little rushed, and the last scene was just a bit too out there to mesh well with the rest of the film. The costumes were perfect, and the monochrome motif of the film didn't feel forced or exaggerated. None of the film did, really. It just flowed it's own way, not worrying about being too action-heavy or scary. Certain scenes were disturbing, but didn't overstay their welcome, and things weren't spelled out for you at any point. It makes you think, it makes you wonder why, how, and what.
There's not a lot wrong with this film, except for it's misbranding as a horror movie. Yes, technically it is horror, but it's a calm type of horror that you often don't see anymore. I think that is what really threw people off and gave it a bad start with its audience. This kind of film isn't for everyone, but it certainly is a gem to the crowd that can appreciate the dedication that went into it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

However, my main issue with the film is the lack of depth. Nothing is explained, motives are unclear and there are many scenes that don't need to be in there. Rationalism is thrown out the window and replaced with religion. Many actions don't match their characters personality. And the ending left you wanting more.On the positive side, if you like slow and creepy movies without the need for depth - this is a great option.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Fantastic Historical Supernatural Horror,"The Witch is... something. It is not a traditional horror film, and really, the only apt comparison I can come up with is Eggers' other major film, The Lighthouse, mixed with a bit of Midsommar. Regardless, it is an awesome film. Eggers' writing and direction, combined with perfect acting and an immersive set design, create a chilling tale that stands out among modern horror.First off, the acting. Wow. Each actor in this film is incredible, despite half of the cast being child actors. And I don't mean good acting, when you are watching and think, ""that actor is doing great right now"". I was not even registering that they were actors at all, I was so immersed. And their colonial dialect was authentic yet understandable, and seemed to be spoken completely naturally, which is often difficult to pull off. Each character became paranoid or corrupted throughout the film, creating a suspenseful tone that lasted the whole movie. I would like to specifically recognize Ralph Ineson, as the tormented, prideful, authoritative, and increasingly uncontrolled father. His performance stood out among an impressive cast as one of the best I've seen in horror.Of course, this acting would be nothing without the writing that make this so convincing. Using writings from the period, Eggers makes the dialogue feel real, not like our interpretation of how they sounded. And the progression of the film makes it feel like a ""slow burn"" movie, yet so many events are put into the 92 minute film, that it is constantly entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat. The exploration of the themes of paranoia, corruption, and religion are obvious, but not thrown in your face. The viewer will ""get it"", but not feel like it's just been entirely handed to them.The set design and direction compliment the other factors in making a complete atmosphere for this film. The farm is shabby and poor, and in seemingly every shot, you can see the weak, unappealing crops, a subtle reminder of the coming desperation of the family. The woods loom over them ominously, never easing the feeling of dread and mystery. The movie is mostly lit by candlelight and features many close up shots of the characters, which outside of showcasing their acting chops, also keeps the viewer in the same position as the characters: wondering what will happen next.All in all, The Witch is a stunningly suspenseful film, immersive in all aspects. Much like other A24 horror films, it is not something you can shake off right after viewing. It is absolutely worth a watch, but maybe not right before going out with friends.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Seriously underwhelming and disappointing film...,"I am constantly confused by people who highly praise films which are simply poor. I think critics are particularly known for doing this but the general public are also guilty of it. It is almost like hipsters who try to like things that most people don't so they can look or sound different to everyone else and I'm getting sick of it. Rotten tomatoes has rated this film with a 90, a goddamn 90! Another good example to compare this with is Babadook which is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time but it was awarded 98! Am I going crazy or is it me who fails to realise how good or bad a movie is?I understand that people have differing tastes but there has to be a limit. The Witch has good ideas running through it but they are poorly executed. The majority of the time I felt like I was waiting for something to actually happen. People explain this as being tension, I explain it as being boring and underwhelming. Not once was I scared or felt tense. When something did actually happen it just wan't done very well. The acting wasn't as bad as in Babadook but it was certainly questionable. There were moments where I had to cringe at how bad the acting was.

A big fan of horror movies 💪🏽🔥,"The delivery is impressive through and through: the actors are faultless, which is quite a feat when considering the age of the youngest children, and even more so given the unaccustomed language that they speak. The emotional stakes are high and the characters' motivations are often far more complex than such a small story might allow for: the father's pride and religious fervor, the mother's love of her children and fear of Hell, the ways that the children snap at each other and use one another - all swirl around into the climactic unraveling of the family at each other's hands, and the writing and acting are phenomenal at every moment.The pacing is deliberate but never actually felt slow to me. This is partially due to the strength of the actors' performances, but is also a result of the level of detail throughout the film. I was consistently too busy trying to figure out the significance of what I was seeing to remember to be bored. The film telegraphs from an early moment that such care will be rewarded, and then keeps its promise to the viewer. The sound track helps, too: it is fantastic, and could stand easily on its own as a masterpiece of dark ambient music.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Horrifically Enchanting,"The Witch, following a family upon their move into the wilderness of 1630s New England, is the debut feature film from director Robert Eggers who embeds the project with an essence of horror not often seen. While many audiences are busy looking for, or even lazily just waiting for, big jumps and stingers for their scares like most modern movies of the genre, they are missing the creepy details that truly push a slow burn like this film into horror. It's so realistically done that you worry that it shouldn't be happening, and are likewise worried of the consequences for the family.The ensemble cast is first and foremost in bringing this story to life. The acting is just incredible. You can see heavy breath leaving the body. You can see the confusion in their eyes. You can see evil determination and quiet despair. Each actor has a moment of triumph where their talent alone is on display, and these scenes hit like a goat to the gut. What makes it even more impressive is that more than half of the main cast is made up of child actors that pull these feats from who knows where. They are eerily effective in a way that, at one point, I questioned whether one of the children was actually an adult acting through motion capture. It was not the case. The acting is just that intense and believable.Other points and aspects of the film also make you question everything you're seeing. Has any of this story been real? Is what is happening in this story being imagined? There's a sense of ambiguity that, instead of making things more comfortable because it's probably just an old-timey urban legend, actually makes you more hesitant to step further into darkness because it could very well be real. While those horrific voices help make up a vivid and powerful score by Mark Koven, could these chants actually be coming from nearby evil as well? The forest, already a naturally dangerous place, is left open to become a supernatural place of folklore where any animal you encounter could be something more and the tall trees creep in close to overcome you.It's a masterful choice to shoot this film in more of a full frame aspect ration, which makes its presentation alone feel old and classic, purposefully dated to a time long since experienced. At the same time, it subconsciously makes the film about a tight-knit family go completely claustrophobic and uncomfortable, even when outdoors. It's isolating. The camera is used like a lullaby, going back and forth between sweeps across plains and utter stillness until it trances you into the unknown. There is depth and uneasiness in every frame, and bewilderment after every turn. Takes that last longer than expected leave you to breathe during these down times, but there really is no downtime when you're numbed into a sense of wonder.All of this culminates into a film that floats into a state of euphoria, capturing an emotion that you may not have known was even there before. It's a witch film unlike any witch film you've seen, taken seriously and realistically, but with a climate of dread. It's a slice of life film, really, albeit a slice of an alternative life. As familiar in storybooks as it might be today, these were the absolute thoughts and stories passed around by those who lived during the time, the stories that many thought to be real. The Witch is the definition of the American witch mythology, portrayed in its purest state of horrific enchantment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It's professional and distinct enough to be worth your time.,"When talking about this movie always use the full title: ""The Witch: A New England Folk Tale"" because ""The Witch"" is already the title of a play by Thomas Middleton and ""The VVitch"" is really dumb.Above average period chiller with a vivid sense of place and time where a family is trapped on all sides by the elements.Not terribly accessible with its Jacobean dialogue (apparently its very authentic but I wouldn't know) and it almost gives the movie a comic tone but the substance shines through very disquietingly.On that note, the only language that really survives the test of time is recorded language so these characters are speaking in a way that people at the time mostly just wrote in so as admirable as the attempt at authentic speech is, it's probably a bad move both in theory and practice. If they had spoken more candidly and then I could have taken this a lot more seriously.Otherwise, there's none of the cheesiness or obnoxiousness that you might get in movies like The Conjuring, where sudden blasts of strings ruin what might have been a good reveal.We just gradually find in god's country forces that appear to be unholy (see what I did there?), captured in an unrushed, flavorsome, culturally rich fashion.Maybe it drags in parts but overall this was refreshing, especially its folksy yet chill music that uses a variety of neat instruments and is a long way away from the blandly generic scores we're used to.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Brillinat slow burn tension, powerful stuff","Let me start out by saying if you like modern horror films then step away now, you aren't going to like this as it is intelligent, finds its own pace and is dripping in originality and subtle fine performances, basically the exact opposite of most of the output passed off as horror these days. The subtle classic ""witch"" symbolism will probably pass the iphone brigade by, their loss. It is certainly a film that demands your attention but pays it back ten-fold and buy the end the tension is ratcheted so high you'll only notice you haven't taken a breath for the last 5 mins once the credits roll. Certainly a film that will be watched more than once, probably in Europe as I can't see the American market enjoying this, it will probably be received the same way as any film with subtitles. All in all a fantastic, original film with more originality than so many other films with 10 times the budget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Out Of Your Seat Scares Weren't Necessary.,"""The Witch"" is a decent film that told the story of a seventeenth century family that was forced to find a new life outside of the New England village they called home and when trying to build that new life circumstance surrounds their lives causing them to turn on one another all stemming from the strange abduction of their new born baby. This film was intense and very disturbing but in in my opinion it could have been a little better. I wanted this film to be straight up scary but it wasn't. I think the writer/director wanted to focus more on how the family was breaking apart due to the evil that was surrounding them instead of focusing more on the evil itself, which I'm not mad at because it made this film different and a little more interesting. The horror part was kind of put to a minimum but it was just enough to keep a horror fan like myself interested. Although I say that this film could have been a little better it is kind of underrated. I think this film was brilliantly written and different from most others of its kind. If you're a true horror fan and want to see a horror film that didn't need to show too much gore and is a psychological thriller, this one is the one to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wonderfully atmospheric and historically accurate take on witch mythology in colonial New England,"The Witch: A New-England Folktale (2015) is an entertaining, wonderfully atmospheric and historically accurate take on witch mythology in colonial New England. Plenty of films claim historic accuracy, but you rarely see it. Mel Gibson is notorious for his pseudo historical (but highly entertaining) historical fiction movies. The Witch, though a semi-low budget horror film, puts those to shame. Listen to what the director says about his attention to detail.""I am positive it is the most accurate portrayal of this period in American history on screen. We went to such lengths to make it so,"" writer-director Robert Eggers told the LA Times earlier this year. ""Everything with the farmstead that we built, everything that you see on-screen is made from the correct building materials that would have been used at the time. Most often we used the traditional tools and techniques to create these objects. And the clothing is hand stitched based on extant clothing."" OK, except the nails, which are round and not square like they would have been in the seventeenth century.Nitpickers have also gone after the filmmaker's stylized title. Cinema Sins' claim that the digraph ""VV"" fell out of use after the sixteenth century (The Witch is set in the seventeenth century), and therefore the stylized use of VV in the title is inaccurate, is only partly true.The Wonders of the Invisible World by Cotton Mather, published in 1693, clearly shows witch spelled with a digraph. However, it is a ""double U,"" or UU. Several other pamphlets, shown here, from 1643 and 1645, both show witch spelled ""V Vitch,"" just like the film title. Printing at the time was more art than science, and printers chose when to use the modern W or the older VV or UU.Even the witch lore is highly accurate to the seventeenth century, from using baby's blood as flying ointment, to enchanted animals cursing weapons in order to slip away unharmed. And, of course, writing one's name in blood in the Devil's book, creepily portrayed by a black goat. Witches were believed to cause their victims to vomit foreign objects, shown when the family's son, Caleb is being tormented and spits up an apple. There are no magic wands, pointy hats, or broomsticks here.Witches represented a malevolent force in the natural and social order, destroying relationships between neighbors and family members. In The Witch, tragedies and minor transgressions gradually unravel the family and undermine the trust that held them together. The tension is palpable as they slowly turn on each other, all while apparently under supernatural assault. The terror comes from knowing this threat destroys from within as well as from without.In many ways The Witch reminds me of Eyes of Fire (1983), in which a group of religious dissenters flee to the wilderness only to face assault by supernatural forces in colonial New England. There's something primordial about the hostility of nature, survival, and the union of wood and spirit. The idea that nature is foreign and hostile to man appeals to our basest instincts.I'm not sure I'd agree with Jay from RedLetterMedia that The Witch is the best film to hit theaters in 2016, but it's definitely the best horror movie to come out for a while. It's an incredible first film for writer-director Robert Eggers. I just hope he isn't another M. Night Shyamalan, whose breakout film The Sixth Sense revolutionized the genre, but he went on to make complete garbage for the rest of his career.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"More contemporary drama with great character work, than thriller/horror","The Witch is a praised movie, that falls under the horror genre. We went into this movie with different expectations, which helped us to enjoy this movie. Although there is a witch, and although there are supernatural elements, that isn't what this movie is about.The movie is about a family of outcasts who try to maintain a living on their own, when natural elements are threatening their life (food, animals), but also their faith in God. Their faith is such a strong foundation and source of love, that when their faith is seemingly threatened, life and sanity start falling apart.And that is what this movie is about. A pretty natural reenactment of how life was in that period. The surrounding, the clothing, the acting, the lines are a very loyal representation of life and values in those times. That alone makes that the movie can feel like a thriller. The brilliant acting and character work will make the viewer feel like he's in a thriller, because the threat comes from the inside, from lies and from naivity.Thank God those times are over, but also thanks for giving the viewer insight in those times, strengths and weaknesses.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Good movie, but...","The great things about this movie are:The acting. From the children to the parents, the acting was great, the dialogue is very believable.The script. It's a good story all around, maybe could have been expanded slightly but it was still good.The setting/visuals. The time it was set, and the location on the edge of the woods makes for a great horror movie.One of the only problems with this movie is that it shouldn't really have been labeled a horror... although I'm not quite sure what would be a more accurate genre. Something psychological. Like ""The Shining"", but with much less of the scary/creepy visuals. (there are still some) It's more about a family's mental breakdown.The other problem I had was that yes, it is a little hard to understand the characters sometimes. The dad is the worst. I had trouble in the beginning but if you devote a little more of your attention to what they're saying it should help.My advice is, don't go in to it thinking you're seeing a run of the mill horror movie where your heart is pounding, wondering when the next jump scare is going to be. There's few, if any. (depending on how easily startled you are). Go in thinking you're going to see a well put together movie, with some psychological elements to it.I was thinking about giving it an 8 because the acting, setting, and dialogue really blew me away, but, I gave it a 7 because I felt the ending could have been slightly better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Truly a Masterpiece,"This film quickly became one of my favorite movies of all time, which compelled me to write a review for the first time. The low score on this movie and equally horrifying reviews is a great injustice for this exquisite piece of art.The movie takes place in 1630's New England the family gets banished from the plantation and have to fend for themselves in the harsh conditions of this brave new world.The story of this film is nothing new, it's mainly based off of folklore that is told during that era. Where the story intentionally lacks from, the characters more than make up for it. The character interactions, their desires and their perceived flaws are absolutely on point. And anyone who studied and learned about Puritans to some degree would enjoy its authenticity. They come alive with their mannerism and their way of thinking. Their relationship with god, religion, and family really help drive it home that these are real human beings.People who would consider this movie to be bad, would say the same thing about Lovecraft stories. They would scoff at Twin Peaks for not being scary enough.In a world with endless, low brow horror sequels, this movie exceeds every expectation and delivers the much needed fresh air that horror fans were suffocating for.It is disturbing, uncomfortable, even grotesque at times with its subject matter and imagery. It manages to keep the tension up throughout the movie with its incredible score and cinematography. It's a rare thing to be impressed by a movie this much, and I'm so glad I had the privilege to experience this awe and respect I had for the movie, even hours after viewing it.I gave this movie 10/10 because the current score is an insult to everyone who appreciates good cinema, and according to the masses an experience is either worth one star, or ten starts. There is no middle ground. Ignoring that, my real score would be 9,3.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"I Expected Nothing, but Got Something","I was listening to a podcast by Mark Rippetoe and for some reason he was talking about horror movies. He highly recommended The Exorcist, but I've already seen that classic at least a few times. He also talked about The Witch and it made me curious, so I went to read a few reviews on IMDb or actually to skim-read them and focus mostly on review titles and the like-to-dislike ratio to the reviews that I considered are well-written by intelligent people. Many of the reviews that were glowing were hammered down by its readers. This made me very curious indeed. It's not often well-written reviews that are positive about a movie get trashed.I watched the movie yesterday (July 2, 2021), at night. No one around. It started off well, and what I noticed was a very good eye to detail, atmosphere, language, and storytelling. I was hooked. It wasn't exactly scary, but I'm rarely scared in life and certainly not by a movie. I'd like to be disturbed, though. This movie didn't do that, I'll be honest, but I appreciated the effort put into this work. It always managed to hold my eyes to the screen. I scratched my head a few times near the ending, which doesn't work for me, but still interesting. Well, it had to end some way. It's not a masterwork.I normally don't bother with recent movies, and 2015 is recent in my book. I usually watch movies decades old. Horror classics are also decades old, or at least those I would recommend. Classics can also be instant, but this isn't one of those. Still recommended to those who like things to build up with style and leave things to the imagination.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Also something that really disgusted me was actually in the first fifteen minutes and that downgraded my score. The best [art of the movie was without a doubt the acting.

"I'm a Christian Minister & Author & I give this a 10/10 & feel it's an ""Important"" film. A+++","This was an absolutely magnificent movie.I am a Christian minister and author and after watching this, I recommended to it many people. I actually feel this is an ""important"" film for Christians and just about anyone else to see ... and I don't say that about most movies.The movie was extremely realistic, and just fascinating. It was also beautifully filmed, had a great score, and the casting was spot-on as well.The family was a typical ""Calvinist (aka Reformed Christian)"" family and if one understands Calvinism before watching the film, one will get a great deal more out of it I believe.Please note, I am NOT a Calvinist and consider Calvinism to be almost entirely unBiblical.I even asked my own children to watch this movie and afterwards we had a wonderful discussion and Bible study as the film deals with a great many spiritual issues and is a perfect film to discuss afterwards.One of the things that has always bugged me about many so-called ""spiritual"" movies is that they show Christians getting ""possessed"" when such is literally impossible. This movie did not do that and I truly appreciated such. Instead it showed devilish attacks and the like, but not actual ""possession"", at least not until and unless a character actually desired such, which is Biblically accurate.Overall I simply feel this is a marvelous film, historically realistic, Biblically accurate, and worthy of being viewed.Thank you for taking the time to read this review and may God's perfect will always be done in your life, no matter the cost,Author Repen T.

Weird Witch,"'The Witch' has a remarkable ability to sustain weird atmosphere and environment, and magical thinking almost throughout its runtime.A crafted and deliberate film which reflects on themes and tonal attributes clearly important to its filmmaker: writer-director Eggers; this directness of vision benefits 'The Witch' greatly.Technical credits and production standards are of a commendably high and effective standard.The period portrayal, whilst necessarily dramatically formulated, is immensely interesting: the language and accents, including the ""vocabulary of ideas"" of the protagonists is a particular high point in this historical horror.On the flip side most of the best moments of the film are clustered towards the first half with a diminution of highlights as the film progresses.The climax is perhaps rather modern in its sensibilities which I found to be really jarring after a film that is constrained to its depicted environment so rigorously by the writing and directing almost all through the prior runtime.Some of the character scenes between family members could have been more energetically staged and frame compositions are sometimes unable to make use of all the potential of the environment.For a considerable contribution to the historical horror/folk horror genres, and from a first time director, 'The Witch' is a strong announcement of a filmmaker with vision and purpose; in itself there is much to commend.I rate 'The Witch' a 7/10 and I would particularly recommend to fans of psychological horror/thrillers, historical films, folk horror and witchcraft/black magic horror.....it is far from perfect but with allowances made for a first time director this is a really good if not quite a very best or great standard film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

VVery Good,"I always like it when directors nerd-out on their films, Eggers is one of those that loves to include tons of superfluous (and also meaningful) details into his scenes because the dude just likes history. If the old english speak isn't an indicator of that I don't know what is. This ultimately lends to him crafting some really enjoyable and immersive worlds and for his first movie The Witch is really well done and well budgeted technically. I don't think anyone could look at this film and say it wasn't gorgeous looking, which admittedly lends to most of its memorable moments. The story is pretty straightforward and easy enough to follow, I think it's just the dialect that throws some people off since admittedly as an American it can sound pretty goofy at times. It also wasn't the most complete experience for me because it does feel like there were moments where I felt like Eggers wanted to do more but because of the budget he couldn't. I do think his later films feel more filled to the brim. But I do think on rewatch there probably are new things to pick up on here and there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The horror movie the masses don't deserve,"The Witch, much like films like Kubrick's The Shining or Polanski's Rosemary's Baby just makes the viewer feel uneasy and nerved right from the start. A slow-burning, subtle and reserved experience that lets you resonate with the characters and really experience the unraveling of their family unit. What really makes this film special is that there's so many things that it could've very easily done wrong, but handled every aspect with class, tact and respect. The term 'Scary' means something different for everybody, so deeming this film as ""un-scary"" does not mean a thing, I will say though that this film goes beyond just 'being scary', it's not that kind of film. It's much more unsettling and unnerving, getting under your skin rather than being overtly frightening or gory. Frights last a moment, but the ability to not only get under you skin, but linger there is a mark of a truly great horror film.It's a story about losing faith, it's a story about guilt and how those things can tear a family apart. For those wanting a 'fire and brimstone' monster feature, you'll be sorely disappointed. This film is much more in the vein of masters like Stanley Kubrick, Ingmar Bergman with even a touch of Andrei Tarkovsky. It's amazingly and intimately well crafted and shot, scored, acted and researched. It takes its time to tell the characters' stories, but does so with a strange, otherworldly and totally supernatural feel. It's just as effective as an intense drama as it is a horror film. This is the kind of horror film that will be discussed for years to come, and only comes around once in a blue moon.I don't want to give away anything in this review, but I will say this: For those that really enjoy the art of film, storytelling, character building and the craft in general, believe the hype. It's excellent.But for those expecting a gory and fun, cartoonishly-satanist and jump-scare littered monster flick, stay away and don't ruin it for the others trying to enjoy their theater-going experience. You'll end up not enjoying it or will find it to be a tedious and boring watch. Even though at a trim 90 minutes, if you find it boring, you have no attention span whatsoever, but that's besides the point.To cap it off, this is the kind of Horror film I'm always waiting for, especially considering the droves of wanton garbage that flood the theaters week after week, and after looking forward to the film for nearly a year and a half, I'm glad to say that it delivered on all fronts. It's as flawless of a film as you can get, and for this to be Eggers' debut feature, he's in for a hell of a career.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Witch is a beautifully helmed ghastly take on black magic straight from folklore,"Whilst witchcraft is a topic still quilted under dubious clouds, the story Robert Eggers weaves is no less than the work of a genius. There is excruciating dread imbibed in his way of storytelling that makes it one of a kind. Eggers maintains a regular pace throughout the flick to milk our fears without going into the shoddy territory. We feast on some high quality filmmaking.The topic of witches has rarely ever touched such a tangible and lucid style of direction. You haven't experienced a disquiet quite like this before, and gore that throws you into fits of anxiety! Acts of witchcraft create a metaphor which is quite clamorous if you really pay heed. You cannot help but feel helpless, cannot stop feeling sorry for the characters entailed, by silently wishing them goodwill. But alas! this is one of the darkest movies ever made. So, if you have a feeble heart just be prepared mentally and you can bear the imminent.The Witch isn't exactly your average horror flick that tries to scare you with disappearing-appearing acts, or by messing around with the cameras, or via zooming in or zooming out effects. Au contraire, it is one of those purest forms of horror that is allowed to gradually develop in you, as you scale its frames right from the very beginning. Very engaging stuff that will leave you traumatized with abominable witch acts! You cannot help but marvel at the way Eggers captures his gorgeous frames. The serenity of the woods that he arrests in his frames icing it with a harrowing music in the background is beyond comparison. Captivating landscapes and natural shots that he takes make the movie a visual entertainer. You can almost read the tranquility of the woods through his endearing screens.The casting has been done brilliantly. Screenplay is smitten with Shakespearean English which some might find hard to understand. Music is very grim but just about perfect for a horror movie. The Witch is a well manufactured affair that Robert Eggers manages to conjoin with his rad direction and writing style.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Poetic and uncompromising, but ultimately confused","The photography here immediately sets a tone: subtly gray, muted, almost visually silent. The slow development of this isolated family's life matches this and it is easy to accept the sometimes obscure details. The film is confidently developed and appears to be building to something larger and more meaningful. But as things happen, questions are raised and intermittently other characters appear. One expects some resolution of all this, some way to place the scattered parts in an overall pattern. Instead the drama intensifies but never with any real explanation of why, not even in the ending which is more the revelation of a secret than a satisying resolution to all the questions raised. Or to put it more prosaically, the payoff in this moody and suggestive film isn't really worth the wait.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Creepy World / Ok Story 7/10,"Story - 5/10 pros: it's an interesting concept and a nice setup for a horror movie. Wonderful time period to explore the seclusion and danger of religion. It just moved way too slow for me. cons: The filmmakers capture a wonderful eerie feel to this film, but rely to heavily on it to continue the audience through a slightly uneventful tale.Cast - 10/10 pros: Anya Taylor-Joy is mesmerizing. Without her I think this film could have fallen apart. Ineson and Dickie provide some truly disturbing performances along side her. cons: nothing to list here, this is one of the major strengths of this filmDirection - 8/10 pros: Eggers captures an unbelievable feel of despair and solitaire, reminiscence to Kubrick's work in the Shining. He is not afraid to take his time to create this sense of feeling. cons: possible he relied on superior filmmaking and didn't focus on story as much.Pace - 6/10 pros/cons: this is a tough one so listing pros and cons together here. This is a slow moving movie, a very slow moving movie, it can be tough to sit through, but at the same time that is one of it's major strengths; it's ability to make the audience squirm.Atmosphere - 10/10 pros: the remote farm looks beautiful. the soft hazy overcast days provide a perfect look for a tale that is just as scary in daylight as it is in the dead of night. This is the brilliance of this film, every day life is just as horrifying as a monster in the woods. The look of this film is top notch. Every shot appears perfectly planned. The costumes blend into the desolate gray of the rest of the world and provide a perfect topper to the sadness of this life. The makeup and blood work is truly disturbing. cons: again the atmosphere and cast are truly special in this film.Overall 7/10 this could have been an all-time classic but story lacked just a bit, still a very great film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not your average horror movie,"The Witch is one of the best horror movies I've seen. The production design and the use of mostly natural light creates a realistic environment which reinforces the audience's suspension of disbelief which, in my opinion, is more important in horror movies than in movies of other genres. Eggers manages to create a dark atmosphere which makes you feel uneasy throughout the movie, a quality he improves on in The Lighthouse (2019). A common criticism of many horror movies is that they use cheap pop-up scares to scare the viewers, something Eggers avoids in this movie. There are only three, maybe four, scenes that look like other horror movies. The rest of the horror comes from the paranoia and distrust within the family the movie depicts.

Unsettling slow burn to hopeless perdition,"Released in 2015 and written/directed by Robert Eggers, ""The Witch"" (aka ""The VVitch: A New-England Folktale"") involves a devout family in the 17th century who leave a Puritan plantation due to theological differences and build a farm house in the New England wilderness. A string of tragedies offers evidence of a diabolical witch dwelling in the mysterious woods as the family descends into madness. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie play the parents, William and Katherine, while Anya Taylor-Joy and Harvey Scrimshaw play the oldest of the five kids, Thomasin and Caleb.The film is based on Eggers' childhood fascination with witches. Much research was done, extensively working from records in English and American museums, as well as consulting 17th century agricultural experts. The labors of Eggers & his team can be observed in the film because it's thoroughly convincing, as far as sets, dialogue and acting go. Speaking of dialogue, I encourage you to utilize the subtitles because you'll only understand half of the Old English verbiage.""The Witch"" is a mix of family drama, folktale and horror, coming across as a combo of four films: ""The Crucible"" (1996), ""The Village"" (2004), ""Blood on Satan's Claw"" (1971) and the satanic ritual sequence of ""The Devil Rides Out"" (ake ""The Devil's Bride) (1968). It's more supernatural and creepy than the first two, but if you like these four films you'll probably appreciate it. ""The Witch"" brilliantly captures the paranoia & superstition of Puritan communities in New England around the time of the Salem witch trials of 1692-1693 and melds it with supernatural horror. Everything is interwoven into a macabre ode of a time & place where people imagined witches and devils dwelling in the dark woods except here they're for real.The family is a good loving family, but they're bound by the legalism of the strain of Calvinism they embrace. The father's proud, non-sectarian spirit cuts them off from the support of the only accessible community. By themselves in the black forest, they're open prey to the devil & his denizens. While the movie's admirable in so many ways, including the fact that it's ambiguous enough to be open to interpretation, it's also generally dull and too unpleasant for my tastes (yes, I realize it's SUPPOSED to be 'unpleasant' to a degree since it's a horror flick, but the third act just gets too ugly and leaves a bad taste). But Anya Taylor-Joy is magnificent and Ralph Ineson is excellent.The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Kiosk, Ontario, Canada. Costing only $3.5 million, it made $40.5 million worldwide with $25 million from North America.GRADE: C+ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY (***SPOILER ALERT***)Some commentators absurdly suggest that Thomasin is better off at the end than living within the religious confines of her family or the Puritan community. Really? She now gets to slaughter babies in the woods and eventually face eternal damnation; yeah, that's just so incredibly liberating. Would she really be happy joining a bunch of murderous beasts, a couple of which just slaughtered her family? Interestingly, grinding babies to death is presumably female emancipation in this ""folktale"" and that's not too far from reality in modern Western culture.Other commentators suggest that we don't know if what's going on is real or the result of mental illness due to extreme religiosity or a perhaps even a nightmare. ANSWER: Yes, we do know. From almost the very beginning we KNOW there's an actual diabolical witch in the area, which we SEE stole the baby and bathes in his blood. Shortly later we observe that this satanic ritual brings back her youth (or, at least, the appearance of youth); and she seduces Caleb, showing that she's a friggin' pedophile. The only thing we don't know is if there is more than one witch or what the devil's place in the events is or isn't, both of which are revealed literally in the final act.Furthermore, if the witch is a delusion of one or more of the family members then that means that Thomasin or one of the others took the baby; of perhaps an animal. So where's the body or remains and why weren't William & Caleb able to find it during their thorough searches? If one of them or an animal, like a wolf, took and killed the infant where's the evidence, where's the blood? We see zero evidence to draw this conclusion.Also keep in mind that the movie is subtitled a 'folktale' and is based on actual documents from the 17th century. In other words, the movie doesn't depict reality, but is exactly what it says it is -- a folk TALE where ugly, evil witches who bathe in infants' blood and devils who masquerade as goats really lurk in the dark woods and are to be feared.So the surmounting tragedies the family experiences aren't a product of hyper-religious paranoia or a nightmare, but rather the result of confrontation with sinister beings, both physical and spiritual, which exist in the 'world' of the movie.Lastly, the message of the film is obvious: Don't leave the strength and protection of the community of believers due to arrogance or you'll be picked off one by one by the Enemy; or, at least, seduced into joining the dark side.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"different terror, with an impeccable photography with a promising actress and director commitment","Sometimes it's good to know that there is horror film that does not hold only scares, The Witch is a different horror movie, unfortunately people too lazy to movies like that, that fear has to scare every 5 seconds, it is sad to see this film with just 6.8 on average IMDb, right now talking about the film, face we already note the impeccable photography, director fits very well the time of film photography and costumes, the cast is unknown to much of the audience (including me), plus the performances are great, especially the beautiful Anya Taylor-Joy, which is an excellent performance, the direction is great, just think in the end he leaves the movie dragged, has very tense moments, has a moment that left me horrified, the soundtrack is great, combines a lot with the film, Tbe Witch is one of my horror films of this century, the cast is excellent, the direction is great, even if the film is drawn at the end, and even being short, the pace can be a problem for some, it is sad to see this great movie be so criticized by people who want to horror movies to receive only scares.

"Good witchery film about a family is torn apart by the forces of necromancy, possession and strange phenomena","The film begins with William (Ralph Ineson), the patriarch of a Puritan family, on trial in 1630s New England. He dismisses those around him as false Christians, and the others claim that he speaks ill of the word of God. William's family includes his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), twins Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson), and baby Samuel. Having been banished from their New England plantation, they start a small farm in the wilderness. William and Katherine attempt to lead a devout Christian life, homesteading on the edge of an impassible wilderness, with five children. There the family is submitted to witchcraft, black magic and weird happenings. A New-England Folktale! . Evil Takes Many Forms !.It is told from the point of view of the teenager Thomasin, well played by the also debutant Anya Taylor-Joy, along with her other stars in the film: Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, Harvey Scrimshaw, Grangier. It is Robert Eggers' first work as a director and writer of films, recreating the time before the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, a few years in which the fear of God reigned over New England, driving religious convictions to hysteria collective.In this terrifying film, the eternal concepts of witchcraft, black magic, and possession come together to tell the disintegration of a family settled in the New England countryside in the 18th century. When William's family is forced to settle in the countryside, strange things begin to happen: one of the children disappears, the crop fails, and the animals become aggressive. Suspicion and paranoia increase and the family accuses one of their members of witchcraft. Then circumstances worsen and the faith, loyalty, and affection of family members are put to the test in an inimitable way. To create the story and the characters, Eggers turned to his own memories, as he states: ¨I grew up in New England and since my early childhood, the past of the area has been part of my consciousness, witches have populated my nightmares. I wanted to create a story from horror to archetypal for New England, a bad dream that arises from the past, a film that transports the nightmare through a Puritan family, and at the same time, takes the viewer to the place where the witches are real and terrifying¨. The script is based on documents and court records from the 18th century, which allows Eggers to proceed an exhaustive reconstruction of the era, which took years to carry out research on the documentation about the daily life of the first English settlers, showing the traditions agricultural practices of the time in England and the changes they suffered upon arriving in North America. Everything that appears in the film was built with the materials and techniques available to a Puritan family at the time. Although mechanical saws and other modern tools were used to save time, what you see: the planks, roofs, nails are those that would have been used then.¨The VVitch: A New-England Folktale (2015)¨ was highly applauded at its premiere at the 2015 Sundance Festival, where it won the prize for best director. The motion picture was professionally written and directed by Robert Houston Eggers and using his ordinary trademarks, such as : frequent use of longtakes, characters that live in some form of isolation, Christian noticeable roles with magical powers and pagan themes/symbolisms. Eggers is an American filmmaker and production designer. He is best known for writing and directing the historical horror films ¨The Witch¨ (2015) and ¨The Lighthouse¨ (2019), as well as directing and co-writing the historical fiction epic film ¨The Northman¨ (2022). His films are noted for its authenticity and for its adequacy to real facts with period pieces inspired by folklore from the locations the story is set in, as director Robert Eggers usually works with historians and doing meticulous research into the historical period.

"In the future, they will classify this film as a classic horror","I walked into this film with an expectation that it would be scary as hell, the trailers showed a lot of cool scenes that left the viewer in anticipation of something that hasn't been done in a horror film since, perhaps the Blair Witch Project? Films about Witches are rare, in my opinion the greatest of all time is Suspiria, mainly because of its originality and the great soundtrack. But this film, I would say is befitting of its epic title. Not since It Follows was I this scared walking the dog in the park at Midnight. For the record, I walk the dog every night at midnight, and I have a tough dog. And I average about 30 horror films a month, my collection is quite extensive, so for a movie to scare me, it really says something. I'm a little worried going to sleep tonight, may have some bad night terrors or something, perhaps I should watch some Dora the Explorer cartoons to ease my tension.

i saw many mmovies about witches. they all toned it down to flying on broomstick and creepy laughs. but not this one , set in 17th century england, it shows what a witch real witch is at that time.

The Witch: A Psychological Paranoia,"The Witch is a movie based on a family living in New England in the 1630s. At the beginning we see the family leaving a community over some dispute and they begin a new life all by themselves out in the woods. Soon after, the eldest child of the family Thomasin (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) can be seen playing with the new born child in the family out in an open field, close to the forest. And all of a sudden the new born baby disappears in front of her and thus rolls out the the very beginning of the destruction of the family. Because of such incident Thomasin is hated by her mother, and slowly we see incidents keep happening to the family which put suspicions on her. Although this a horror movie, but there are barely any scary scene. Unlike most of the horror movies there are no jump scares, no disfigured appearances. Instead it slowly builds up the plot of the movie and plays an interesting turn of events at the end. There are not much to talk about the the characters - the only important character is, of course, Thomasin. One other thing I liked so much about the movie is the setting, really astonishing. The Witch mesmerizes the audience by not letting them bore for a moment with sustained scenes of psychological paranoia.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Best Horror Movie Since The Shining!,"Well some movies are a bit more haunting than others. The Witch is a Period Piece set in 1630's New England, American. It centers around family who moves out into the woods and suspects that there is a Witch that wants to hurt them. I'm just coming out honest that this movie is a 2016 Masterpiece in Psychological Horror. Let's start off with the acting.The Acting is amazing and each character fits their roles very well. There is also a lot of character development between the characters. The Mother played by Kate Dickie is the more sad character and you feel for her in her scenes. The two children played by Lucas Dawson and Ellie Grainger do very well for what they are given and are not that annoying as some other children in other horror movies. The Other Male Child played by Harvey Scrimshaw is amazing also for what he is given and really becomes his character later in the movie. Finally the two best characters were the father played by Ralph Ineson and the Oldest Child played by Anya Taylor-Joy are both fantastic characters and please watch out for them I bet there gonna be in some major titles soon (Anya Taylor-Joy is gonna be 2016's ""Morgan"").The Cinematography is top notch! Easily each and every shot in the film could be in a Art Museum. That's because there is a lot colors and depth to each and every shot which something we don't see in most films today. There are a lot of color schemes of Gray which work for what it is and is likable.Now the best part of the film is how scary it is? Umm... This Movie may just be the scariest movie ever made! There are tons of scenes with tension and lots of disturbing scenes (which I will not spoiler) throughout the film's run time. It also gives some time to think in between the disturbing scenes. Surprise! There is absolutely no Jump Scares in the film, the Film uses horrifying sounds, and disturbing images to scare the viewer to the bone. Also the Film oozes Atmosphere and tone which the tone feels like we really are watching something real and we shouldn't be watching it!In Conclusion, The Witch is a 21th Century Masterpiece and is my Favorite Film of the year. So do yourself a favor and go out, rent (or better yet buy) this Movie, Watch the movie with some friends, and live deliciously.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Masterpiece of a film,"The Witch is a historical period horror movie written and directed by Robert Eggers in his directorial debut. It stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson. The movie's based on English folktales about a strictly religious family that encounters forces of evil in the woods near the place where they live. I personally believe that this film is a total masterpiece in every single aspect. From the great haunting visuals to the genius story told, this film is absolutely incredible. All the actors do a great job, especially Anya Taylor-Joy who is so talented and certainly has a bright future ahead of her. The tone of the film is brilliant and really scary to think about. The family was religious and had ""faith"" in God, but what they did not realize is that they did not have faith in one another and so that creates conflict and from conflict comes sin. Something which they are strongly against, and yet it consumes them entirely, sin is there deep down in their hearts and they could never escape it. The Witch is riddled with ideas that make you think and are chilling that will undeniably stick with you for quite a while after. It is such a well made film, from the smart lighting that reflects upon the characters to the suspenseful score composed by Mark Korven. My only issue is that it is a bit slow at times, but once you get into the characters and the story that is being told, it is a thrill ride from then on. The ending is also insane and frankly really scary too. I loved this film and I would recommend any horror and movie fan in general who just wants to see a masterpiece, to watch it now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"- It's good, it's suspense and drama as well as terror.","It is not a film that scares the public, it is a history film that makes everyone uncomfortable. The film is almost a complete horror, but it is the discomfort it leaves in the air that sums up the film. The silence and the soundtrack bring a certain tension to the film in the midst of such discomfort, in addition to the cuts ending it with a flourish.
The tension and the gloom was what caught my attention the most, even though the discomfort stands out among them because it was added in exaggerated doses. I was also open-mouthed with the performance of the actors, especially with the performance of the younger actors, it is surprising to see this in young people, there is not much of it these days.
I thought the proposal for the image of a witch that was delivered to us and sorcery was incredible, even though we saw little of it during the film, this image proposal is good and at the same time it is traditional and versatile in the director's way, in addition to being obscure , that most of the time the directors look for obscurity and only deliver clichés, something superficial and the opposite of what is really obscure. In short, it is a good film among other good ones, but not as spectacular as a few. It is not a typical terror, it is not what is expected of a terror, but we can call it terror as we can call suspense and family drama as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""The Witch""-  A haunting and complex fable.","One of the most complex and haunting films to emerge within the past decade, writer/director Robert Eggers' ""The Witch"" is a troubling fable of religion and fanaticism expertly combined with the trappings of a classic horror story of witchcraft and savagery. Though perhaps misrepresented by a marketing campaign billing it is a straight- forward creepshow for the masses, the truth is that this is a hard-hitting and expertly crafted art-film, and is a rewarding and startling experience that will leave the open minded breathless. It is without doubt not a film for everyone, and its appeal will be limited... but this cannot detract from the fact that it is a masterpiece from a brilliant new voice in film.New England. The 17th Century. A family is excommunicated from their Puritanical plantation home due to their extreme and fanatical religious views that conflict with the establishment of their peers. Father William (Ralph Ineson) helps his flock to build and craft a new home on the edge of a vast forest, where he hopes to create a new life for his family- wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), twins Mercy and Jones (Ellie Grainger, Lucas Dawson) and infant son Samuel. However, not all is well. The disappearance of Samuel while playing with Thomasin causes an emotional rift within the family, tensions begin to run high due to the circumstances of their situation, mistrusts and deceits are slowly born and will push their limits of their devotion to one another and to god... and it soon becomes apparent that an otherworldly force may be at play... that a witch of the woods may be silently stalking the family.The film is Kubrickian in nature, relying on the slow and methodical establishment of character and atmosphere combined with complex metaphors and symbols to create a masterwork of terror and drama. It is a finely tuned experience, relying on the subtle and the suggestive as opposed to the overt and blatant. Rewarding the analytical and open among audiences, Eggers excels in his craft, building the narrative slowly and with great deliberation while constantly developing and evolving his characters. And while it may seem counter-intuitive, the film is oddly enough at its strongest not when delivering the plethora of chilling sequences and scares that are abundant. But rather, the film is at its strongest when it places its focus on the collapsing nature of the family unit, torn apart by their own doubt and devotion to their obsessive beliefs... even at the expense of logic, reason and safety. Though don't be fooled... this is still very much a frightening film, with many terrifying moments thanks to the disturbing portrayal of witchcraft and savagery. It just also happens to be a very thoughtful, contemplative and complicated film that does great work with its themes, and can be interpreted in a number of ways.The performances are just marvelous and are the other main contributing factor to the film's great success when combined with Eggers' masterful writing and direction. Anya Taylor-Joy stands tall in a breakout performance in the role of Thomasin, who becomes our main focus early on. Taylor-Joy is a revelation and despite her relatively young age, injects complexity, doubt and pathos into the role in a way that is beyond her years. Incredible work. Ralph Ineson is the other stand- out here, as the increasingly troubled William. Ineson plays the character as hopeful but increasingly haunted by his own faith, and it's a stirring and emotional performance. Dickie makes for another great character as Katherine, and she is the perfect compliment to Thomasin and William within the story. I also will give high markings to child-actor Harvey Scrimshaw as the young Caleb. Child actors are a tough sell much of the time, but Scrimshaw (similar to Taylor-Joy) seems to possess a talent that far exceeds expectation and does the role justice.To be honest, I cannot say a single thing to the detriment of the film. But I do feel the need to stress something I touched upon in the beginning. This is not a standard horror flick, and many have felt let-down and deceived by the admittedly poor marketing created for the film's release. The film was touted as ""scary"" and ""creepy"" and ""something we should not be seeing"" in a trailer filled with loud music stingers and many of the film's scares, suggesting a more straight-forward experience. This is not a horror film for the masses. This is not the sort-of movie a group of 17-year-olds will go to on a Friday night and feel fulfilled by. This is very much an art- picture. A movie that encourages thought and personal interpretation. And I think that far too many have dismissed it unfairly for failing to adhere to its poor marketing, as opposed to embracing it for what it actually is. To an extent, I understand feeling duped. And I'm not even a pretentious art-type. I love the ""Saw"" movies more than most. I get kicks out of brainless schlock like Stephen Sommers' ""Van Helsing"" and screwball comedies like ""Brain Donors."" And I think ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" isn't nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be. But you know what? I also appreciate true art. I adore it and embrace it and celebrate it. And ""The Witch"" is art at its purest. And I firmly believe it is unfair to condemn the film because the trailer wasn't the best representation of it.I give ""The Witch"" a perfect 10. It is not only amongst the best horror films of the decade. It is simply amongst the best films of the decade, regardless of genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Tense and atmospheric, The Witch is a period piece that inhabits the ideas of the time, for better or worse","The Witch is a slow burn that pays off with a shocking but gratifying ending.

Taylor-Joy is as excellent in the lead as I would hope, and the cinematography and music really put the audience in a creepy, anything can happen mental space fitting for the witch-fearing setting. The primary focus is on Thomasin's development, as she is used or mistrusted by all of her family. The fear of witches does make it clear how people are eager to find a scapegoat and how the family falls apart so quickly as bad things start to happen. The ending where the goat talks and she goes to join the witches was extremely well done - she had played her part as a proper daughter and everything went wrong, so when she is finally free of obligations with her parents dead, she decides to see what lies on the other side. It's a dark movie and leaves plenty of questions unanswered and open to interpretation - what exactly happened to Caleb? Did the mom or the twins do anything wrong? Are the Satan people/creatures real, imagined, or inhabited by his spirit? As a story of Thomasin's development and family struggles in the time period, it's a good one, but so much of the evil is uncertain. That may be an intentional choice - nobody knew anything or had more than suspicions and fears in the 17th century, so this is a folktale playing off those ideas.

Eggers is a research scholar,"I have seen his other films, some how i left Witch unseen for some reason, lately i have come to know that the director is a brilliant student of cinema.We can see discipline in his work, and mostly the stories he choses are the explanations or historical notes of the tales and fantasies.For example if we take ""Witch"". We have seen in other movies and in stories how witches looks and the story goes to a direction on the plans and destination of those witches, but here and in other films of Egger, He defines the reason how and why one could be a witch. Its a steady and strong strategy for using historics in films,Hes nailing it, just imagine hes giving background stories for the tales that hes been heard before, when he makes new in the future, how vigorously dark it would be..!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I thought this film was pretty good but not horror,"I went in expecting a horror film but what I got was a pretty illuminating woes of people in desperate times. It wasn't a bad film. It was pretty good actually. I thought the characters' were pretty solid. It was interesting watching how the parents, whether they believed it or not, use religion as a herding factor for their family.The film does not necessarily focus on a witch really but more on the family sort of turning on each other. I want to describe it best as possible without revealing much but it is as that one description says. Disturbing and creepy. Oh and the ending kind of sucks and ruined it so if that's important to you, then be wary but if you can look past it the film itself is pretty good imo. Slow paced.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good overall,"During New England 's Puritan era, a family of six (including a pregnant mother) is banished from a community and forced to fend for themselves in the countryside. Once there, supernatural forces intensify their paranoia of witchcraft.The story is sparse but compact. While its ending is too mysterious and leaves many holes, it is still fascinating in its own special way.The greatest flaw in the film is that much of the dialogue is incomprehensible. It has the right intention in using old English and an older dialect. However, as some important lines are muddled, much gets lost.Despite this flaw, the acting is quite good as are the production values. There is a suitably bleak mood that rightly surrounds a family falling apart in facing great difficulty. Their dour, paranoid views of God, Satan, and witchcraft don't help matters. One wonders if their belief systems are at least as horrific as the outside forces.Overall, the pluses outweigh the minuses.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A very unusual Psychological horror,"The quality of this film is very high, as both the actors and direction are a feast for the eye. The character are executed with a very hard-to-learn 17th century dialect, while still having the emotional debt and impact for it to be scary.The cinematography is something different in terms of ""standard"" filmmaking. This is meant with a context to the movie being bleak and dark, whilst the dialogue and tempo matches the tone. This makes up for some high quality close-ups, long drawn out pans of the scenery, and slowly zooming in with tangering background-music.When it comes to the story, it's so intense and mysterious that it holds the drawn out parts interesting. It's a long and slow movie, but it has a slow burn that sticks in the mind - and is certainly something to analyse on for future viewings.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Had hoped for more,"Since the beginning of filmmaking Hollywood has struggled to deal with the subject of witches. In recent decades they have mostly just been used as a source for light humour and even children's films. Films like 'Practical Magic' and of course the 'Harry Potter' series have taken a mostly harmless attitude towards the subject, and the audiences have seemed satisfied. I am currently watching season three of 'American Horror Story' titled 'Coven'. Going into it I had pictured (and hoped for) quite a dark overall theme. Unfortunately what I have found is again a lighter approach, and I would have to say I'm not overly enjoying it. So when I heard there was a film coming out titled 'The Witch', which seemed from the trailers to have a very dark approach taken, I was excited. Did it live up to my expectations? Sort of.I left 'The Witch' with a sort of ""Meh"" feeling, despite having enjoyed it for the most part. Frankly, I had hoped for more. I was aware this wasn't going to be your standard type of horror film with jump scares left, right and centre. An atmospheric horror is fine by me and something I often enjoy more than the alternative. But for me the atmosphere wasn't really having an affect either. It didn't help the dialogue was nothing short of exhausting to listen to and take meaning from. For me that element unfortunately took away from what the film was trying to achieve. It had to be there, it's simply unfortunate.There was a little bit of a mystery element surrounding things, which was probably the aspect I enjoyed most about the film. That may have lead a little to the ""Meh"" feeling I got too though, as I felt the mystery never really came to much. The acting was superb, it would have to be said, and that side of things did a terrific job in covering up what could otherwise be considered a very slow-burning story at times. After the film I was left to ask myself a question. Are witches a potentially scary film subject? I'm yet to be convinced they are.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the more interesting horror films in recent years,"Slow-burn horror movie about a Puritan family in 17th century New England trying to survive their harsh life in the wilderness while battling their own demons as well as dealing with the threat of a creepy witch in the nearby woods. It's certainly a great-looking movie with an authentic period feel. The performances are all excellent. Two of the biggest complaints I've read are that (a) it's boring and (b) the witch is real and not just a metaphor or something like some would prefer. To the first complaint I would say that those people should stick with their found footage garbage. To the second complaint, which is coming primarily from certain types of critics, I say I'm glad the witch is real. I understand the power of suggestion and I value psychological horror as much as the next person, but it seems like the majority of movies made about witches, particularly about them during this period, have been unsubtle studies of persecution and superstition. That's all well and good, and interesting in its own way, but this is scary because the threat is real and you know it's real the whole film. Yes the family is at each other's throats and the bulk of the tension and drama comes from that, but the witch and who she serves are also a big part of the film and provide some of the most terrifying scenes. It's not a perfect movie by any means but I give it props for trying to do something different than the glut of banal exorcism, slasher, found footage, torture porn, and poltergeist movies that fill the horror field nowadays.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Duped,"It's not often I get completely duped and screwed by IMDb ratings, but the 6.8 (especially for a horror film) led me to buy this movie before even first watching (save your judgment, I buy movies all the time before watching and due to a decent amount of research and a pretty good intuition with movies, I rarely get burned). But this movie is an exception. I see many people writing positive reviews applauding the movies ""psychological horror"", and I'm really at a loss as to what they're talking about. I look for only a few things in horror movies (I'm an avid fan), A: Logical and interesting story B: at least decent acting C: some feelings of being scared, unsettled, disturbed, something....this movie severely lacked in the most important one....C. Where was I supposed to be scared? Sure, there was some atmospheric tension with some decent score to accompany, but it lacked severely in anything visual...and after all, it IS a film. I like when a movie makes my mind wreak havoc, but my mind can't MAKE the movie. And if it's supposed to be ALL psychological, well, it just didn't do anything for me. Might I also add, visual does NOT mean gore. I cannot stand movies that lean on gross out gore. Some of my favorites include The Conjuring, The Babadook, The Exorcist, Cube, Sinister, and The Thing.

A completely new experience in the horror genre,"Horror has been having it's highs and lows as of recent. There have been some fantastic film, like It Follows and some duds, such as last year's Dark Summer. Luckily, out of the dark waters of big budget horror comes spectacular indie horror films that defy the genre. The Witch defies what horror has been and what it will be.The Witch is one of the only films to rattle me to the core. I found myself alone in the theater, luckily being the only one to watch this film. I had nobody else there to watch with, feeling just as isolated as the characters in the film. I had to tell myself that this was just a movie several times throughout, as I became so invested in the film that I forgot it wasn't real. Being alone, I was fully able to immerse myself into The Witch, a feeling that I never will forget.This film is beautiful. Not only is the script perfect, the score is absolutely beautiful. It is absolutely haunting, creating the perfect atmosphere for the film. The score was perfect, coming in at the right times, causing so much more tension when there could have been some just from the film alone. This film, as many others films could have been, relies heavily on its soundtrack, as it puts forth even more dread than presented in the film. Without the soundtrack, this film would have felt extremely empty. But, the score needs a great movie to work efficiently. And Robert Eggers directing the film makes the film worthy of such a fantastic score. His camera work seems like he has had years of experience, while this is his debut feature. He had control over all aspects, as well as a clear goal that he wanted to achieve. His choice of color palate also was fantastic, as the cool blue tones had the feeling of dread, which is constantly present throughout the film. There were some scenes that were extremely dark and hard to watch, but this makes the film even more mysterious and it makes you even more uncomfortable than you were before. If this film were directed by another person (many other horror films are like this), the film could have been an absolute trainwreck. But in Eggers' hands, The Witch is able to prosper and become the film that achieves its full potential.The acting was superb as well. These performances felt extremely pure, since it seemed as if I were watching something filmed during the time the movie was set in. The standout, of course, was Anya Taylor-Joy. Her performance was the most genuine, where Ralph Ineson gives the most powerful performance. Both actors together had fantastic chemistry, creating the tension and bond needed for the film to succeed. Katie Dickie also was fantastic, being able to completely become a grieving mother. This cast was honestly just stunning.I can say that The Witch is not for everybody. I've read countless reviews claiming that this is the worst movie that they have seen. I feel that this film should not have had a wide release, as the general public won't, and hasn't, enjoyed the movie at all. If this film was released in independent theaters, I think that there would be a whole other reception from the public, as not everyone would be going and seeing it. Nonetheless, The Witch is absolutely an amazing film.While 2016 doesn't seem like it will be the year where many quality horror films are released, The Witch absolutely makes up for the movies that won't be coming out. While this film may not be for everyone, it should be taken with a grain of rice and should be at least considered, as it is a fantastic film. I can say that this may be one of the best films of the year, as well as one of the greatest horror movies to be released.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Slow burners are not for everyone.,"Before watching this movie I happened to watch ""Rosemary's Baby"" and I found it to be the perfect horror movie. Not the cheap jump scary type but the type that will make you writhe inside and haunt your dreams. THIS was that type of a movie. There were no cheapness in the movie. The movie knew what it was and if you like jump-scares and gore. Avoid this or make up your mindset to watch this.After all that, you might be wondering why the 7 star rating, because I didn't enjoy it entirely. I am not saying it is not good but probably, I wanted more. Let's discuss pros and cons, keep in mind, it is from my personal view-point.PROS- Acting wise, Anya was on point. She was very believable as the helpless girl in a strange time. Ralph Ineson, I loved his voice. I loved how he played a father with flaws. Dickie as the weeping mother with high superstitions and always irritated with Thomasin was nice. The cinematography was awesome. It completely captured the darkness of a time fueled by superstitions. I will give kudos to the director for choosing to make a horror film which is extremely difficult considering how horror movies are made nowadays.CONS- The child actors playing Caleb and the twins didn't have the acting to pull off their characters. Probably they should have been given lesser screen time. I wanted more of the witch or at-least a back story as to how the lore of the witch had started. Not an origin story but a 15-minute intro couldn't have hurt. The goat totally put me off. I tried to be serious when I saw the goat but I accept it. Goats are my weakness.All in all. It is a fresh inclusion to the horror genre and other horror movie directors can take notes from it. If you want to watch this movie, trust me, watch it alone. You will enjoy it. DON'T eat anything before or while watching it. You may have urges to puke.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A unique feat in horror-movie filmmaking,"From the beginning to the end of this film, a unique sense of dread and disgust plagues the family in the film, as well as the family. There's no apt way to describe the feeling this film is going to give you. It's a festering feeling that sits in the pit of your stomach that only gets more agitated as the images of the film sit in the sub-conscious. The Witch is truly unique in that regard; it's a new breed of horror never before seen by the genre. If you're expecting jump-scared and quick-cuts, prepare to be disappointed. This is a film which takes its time and demonstrates mastery of several technical elements of filmmaking. The cinematography is beautifully framed, well-lit and really adds to the uneasiness 'The Witch' aims to evoke. The performances across the board are brilliant, even among the child actors (though, be warned, the entire film is in Old English so pay attention to the dialogue). The direction and production design is especially impressive considering this a first-time director and long-time production designer. Eggers really hit the nail on the head with this horror masterpiece, which will certainly root itself in Horror film history. Do yourself a favor and watch this film whenever you can.

"A Soul-Shaking, Blood-Curdling, Skin-Crawling, Bone-Chilling & Nerve-Wracking Nightmare","A soul-shaking, blood-curdling, skin-crawling, bone-chilling & nerve-wracking exercise in persistently looming dread, paranoia-inducing terror & never-ending nightmare, The Witch (stylized as The VVitch) is one of the best films I have ever seen and is destined to rank amongst the greatest works of 21st century cinema in the years to come.Set in 17th century, the plot concerns a family of devout Christians who are banished from their Puritan plantation and settle on the edge of a secluded wilderness where they build a sustainable life for themselves. But when their youngest mysteriously vanishes from the premises & crops fail, the family starts to crumble and is torn to pieces by an evil that lurks in the woods.Written & directed by Robert Eggers in what's actually his directorial debut, The Witch is one of the strongest debuts in recent memory as Eggers' direction exudes both passion & perseverance that one expects from an auteur. The writing is top notch too as Eggers fills his tale with believable characters and their finely scripted arcs only lends more credibility to its diabolical plot.Production design team create a sinister environment that reeks of evil, and the peripherals of the isolated surroundings only add more eeriness to the whole setting. Cinematography is a highlight, relying on natural light to imbue a sense of realism while its earthy tones, cold colour palette & controlled manoeuvring of camera inculcate an aura of foreboding that only magnifies as the plot thickens.Editing is methodically carried out, for every bit of its 93 minutes runtime plays a relevant role in the final outcome. Mark Korven's terrifying soundtrack further ups the ante by amplifying the tale's nightmarish element, thus catapulting the viewing experience to another level. Every single aspect works in perfect harmony under Eggers' supervision and brings to life a cinema that's as unique as it is unearthly.Coming to the performances, The Witch features a devoted cast in Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, Harvey Scrimshaw & others, and they all chip in with commendable inputs. Taylor-Joy is an absolute revelation in her role and renders her character's increasing vulnerability with great effectiveness. But the real show-stealer is the goat named Black Phillip, and you have to see it for yourself to find out why.On an overall scale, The Witch is a deeply unnerving, extremely disquieting & powerfully affecting cinema that feels like it was crafted by the Devil himself. An absolute gem of genre filmmaking that's just as polished in the storytelling department as it is accomplished on technical scale, this ill-omened folktale is the best movie of its year, one of the finest films of the decade, and one of the genuinely great works of horror in recent memory.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Eerie and Creepy.... but...,"The atmosphere of this film is stellar. The setup of the family being ousted from their village and heading into the woods to live alone really drives home how incredibly lonely it must have been for many people back then. Without regular contact with others, some families only interacted with each other. This film sets up the extreme version of that, with the family deep in the woods. It is bleak and disturbing, even before anything supernatural happens. The acting is good, but it lacked the depth of character development that I needed to really care about the characters. Rather than feeling emotionally invested, I just felt like, ""Hmm, that's interesting."" And it often was. Though at times it was also quite slow. For such a hyped film, I though much of the critical lavish praise was overdone, but it's always nice to see a low-budget indie film breakout.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Clear whispers in the woods,"This movie is based on what I'd like to consider a form of artistic Minimalism. I admit I found it very amusing to enjoy the remarkable results of a movie whose simple plot, reduced employment of CGI and vaguely sketched atmosphere combine so organically. The archaic language is, to my judgment, the only touch of artificial sophistication in a product of natural spontaneity and linearity. What's more simple than a family living humbly in the woods? Yet, it is not what it is nowadays considered ""mainstream"" : the traditional setting of countless childhood fairy tales here constitutes the basis of a perfect horror construction. The contrast between innocence and vice, which also emerged from my previous considerations, is also the central point of this movie, joined by the, also mentioned, illusory nature of the most simple things. Words, looks, basic gestures, animals, even young children are, to quote a famous Log Lady, ""not what they seem"". Furthermore, the Woods used for the setting are simply majestic. The trees are like bricks of a giant wall between the outside and the inside (even if the two dimensions melt in more than one occasion). I find this work to be a clear voice of hope in the darkness of the boring horror scenario which characterized these last few years. ""The Witch"" does not simply rely on clichés to survive in the competitive world of contemporary entertainment, but it neutralizes their dead components exploiting what is left of their creative energy to turn tradition into innovation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A really great debut,"This film encompasses what it was like during the 1600s when religion was the main force that ruled over humans. Instead of uniting them, religion, more often than not, did exactly the opposite - that is the product of humanity's lack of truly understanding what religion is about and how to live in agreeance with its nature and God. Seven members of the family each represent one of the seven deadly sins, and it's fitting that they all end up accordingly to them. This film shows that believing in God and praying each night is not what religion is about - it's about being honest with yourself and others around you, and working your way to build strong relationships, both with yourself and others, which each character in this film failed to do - instead, they kept it inside and ended up severing the bonds between each other, all in their own unique way. Overall, this was an incredible debut from Robert Eggers, who continued to deliver with ""The Lighthouse"", and I can't wait to see what he does next.

"A slow-burner that will work for some, but not all","I recently watched The VVitch for the first time, after having heard great things about it for some time. Albeit, this was a very unusual film, and one that I grappled with for a little while to reach a conclusive idea of my final thoughts towards it. As the directorial debut of Robert Eggers, The VVitch (as it is stylised in the promotional material) is a film that germinates in your mind and leaves a stronger lasting impression days after watching more than it leaves an immediate one.There is a great deal of subtlety that is utilised in this movie, and it is from the age-old concept of the 'fear of the unknown' that the film finds its niche. However, where the film has and will likely continue to divide some audiences is in its presentation. This was a remarkably bleak looking film, full of greys and darker tones; with not a skerric of any real colour to be found. By design, it is a washed-out looking movie. Set in the 17th century with a recently banished lone Puritan family at its centre, the movie is meant to present the hardships and blandness of that era and it does so by its choice of colour palette. The use of Early Modern English in the dialogue is another talking point. The use of this style of language will be jarring to some but it works effectively enough in the context of the film's setting, and apparently, at times was plucked word-for-word from local journals recovered from that period. While each member of the cast does a great job making it feel genuine, there are moments where it feels as if the archaic dialogue gets in the way of plot and character progression.This movie is the definition of a slow burn, having more in common with The Babadook than The Conjuring. Anya Taylor-Joy turns out a wonderful performance and is convincing in her role as the family's eldest child, who questions her existence as the family question their faith. This is a difficult film to recommend and is an atypical horror film, designed to creep under your skin than to shock outright. It is one more in line with those from the turn of the century.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It honestly feels like a horror classic that has been able to stand ground with films like The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. The entire ensemble cast is incredibly strong, being able to engage in this dialogue that could have felt inorganic but feels totally lived-in and natural.

"The VVitch, not the witch project.","I understand why people don't like this movie. If you don't get it, go watch horror movies that don't involve Hollywood themes.

Realism and Witchery,"This barebones cast and even more barebones set try to do something curious and admirable: create a ""realistic"" feeling for what a family in the wilderness centuries ago would do if they encountered, or imagined, witchcraft in their midst.If you don't believe in witches, then this is kind of for you (except the last 5 minutes, which I will not talk about). It makes a compelling case for how people pushed to the edge deal with tragedy and mystery. They live at the edge of the wilderness (not sure where, maybe Northern New England, since there are wolves at hand). They face starvation and hard work and lots of cloudy, rainy days. It's gloomy. But they have God and religion--a very well written version of loving and fearing God and believing in Jesus and yet finding things they can't explain.Hence witchcraft, which means that some one or more people in the group are causing the problem through sorcery. It's pretty vivid stuff. Sometimes it veers into excess--a lot of gore and screaming, which might be okay if you like horror films, but if you don't it's the one difficult part. This is a great addition to movies about the Salem witch trials. And it's an inroduction to the up and coming Anya Joy-Taylor in the lead role.But everyone acts their heart out and this movie, whatever its flaws (or whatever its limitations, rather), gets somewhere.Until the ludicrous last 5 minutes, which makes it all cheap.

Brilliantly shot.,"This was the result of a director who not only painstakingly researched every aspect of colonial life in the 1630s, but who also executed his ideas with striking confidence. The aspects of the film (lighting, sound, dialog, pacing, composition) created an atmosphere so real I was no longer sitting on my couch watching, but rather living this inherited puritan nightmare.The movie's controlling idea is simple: The prevailing human desire to seek reassurance from a higher power can easily be twisted by ignorance, superstition, psychological insecurities and a horrendous misinterpretation of religion into a culture of self-flogging that nurtures guilt and fear until they become invincible beasts, then lets them lose on the mind to devour it whole. The result of this scary process is a flock of pariahs, known by the fancy, superstitious name of ""witches"" who live on the peripheries of society, devoid of any means of compassion, stripped of all sanity and civility, living in a world of morbid fantasies and diseased hallucinations in which they are left defenseless to their auto-cannibalistic minds that devour their sanity.The performances were also pitch perfect and very believable for the characters the actors played and, although this might prove hard to get by for some, they speak in period-authentic language/accents. Ultimately, the film is rather ambiguous as to whether or not the events occur in the manner you see them, but that's the beauty of it: like religion itself, THE WITCH is open to interpretation. And as such, it establishes itself (in my opinion) as one of the best horror films of the last 10 years.The Witch to me, is a brilliantly shot (natural lighting and using a different aspect ratio to get the sense of isolation), well acted and fascinatingly told. It is a simple story that leaves a big impact, if you are looking for an eerie, haunting film that will make you think.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Seminal film in the history of the horror genre,"Having seen this film several times since its initial release in the theater, the feelings evoked here continue to resonate with me and so many fans of the horror genre. The Witch, in my opinion, is an achievement that has set the pace on several fronts:1. Horror that creates a sense of slow-burn unease, spiked by occasional moments of shock. This is a shift from the previously-omnipresent jump scare nature of this genre.
2. Horror that is historically-based, well researched, and thus is even ""educational"" viewing.
3. Horror that is actor-centric, while still clearly being atmospheric.
4. Perhaps the greatest achievement of his master-work, The Witch, was the ability to create and develop characters from centuries ago with dilemmas which resonate today.Kudos to Robert Eggers on his freshman effort, capturing the attention of many actors who now strive to work with this humble auteur of the art of film-making. Because of his recent work, and that of other young directors, I believe the future of horror is in good hands.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Impressive for a first movie,"Pros-
It's very well shot!
You can tell it was made by someone who takes period pieces and film very seriously.
The production design looked very convincing.
It's creepy!
All of the performances were pretty great, even the ones from the children.
The soundtrack was awesome!
There are some genuinely disturbing scenes that most mainstream films would be too scared to show, and that's something to be respected.
There are certain things that the film leaves up to the imagination, and it does it well.Cons-
There are some really bad lines of dialogue in this movie. When you hear them you can't help but say, ""How did you miss this?""",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It is such an amazing film that I keep coming back to watch it again. Everything from the pacing of the film to the cinematography, to the story, is just perfect.I love the ideas, the language, the acting (especially Anya) and the slow eerie ness throughout the film.

Good but severely lacking,"The Witch is a prime example of a film that has a great concept for a story but it fails at delivering all the key ingredients that could have made this film a lot better than it is.The things that are wrong with this film are that it focuses too much with drama, not a lot of things happen, the film is 30 minutes too short and of course the most important ingredient that this film didn't include enough of, it didn't have enough Horror to it.Don't get me wrong, I liked the general story concept of a family in 1630's New England that have forced themselves into exile to the wilderness and are being torn apart by witchcraft and the characters in the film work quite well but that's about it, I mean it's not a bad film but everything else just drags it down into being a forgettable film. If I were to fix the films problems, then The Witch could have been a fantastic Horror film instead of being a let down that it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Misery loves company,"I really looked forward to this having seen the trailer. But Hollywood is the master of making great trailers. I was expecting 'something different' as multiple reviews promised but only received disappointment. The movies is one unrelenting exploration of misery. There is no horror, no creepiness, unless you consider a rabbit scary. It is one long slow decent into wretchedness which would be fine if it billed itself as a drama but if you're expecting any kind of thrills or scares or even suspense or tension then look elsewhere. It's a tale of hardship and suffering and left me feeling gloomy with no redeeming counterbalance.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This is why Witches were Scary,"Modern films such as Kiki's Delivery Service or any film in the Harry Potter franchise take the idea of a witch and make them characters that the majority of people will like. Strong, intelligent, and they don't usually try to cause harm to others. This movie? It reminds/teaches us that witches can be freaking scary.This movie seriously feels like we're being told a story around a campfire in the best possible way. This must be what people during the Salem Witch Trials believed happened on a regular basis. It feels like a legend (or a legal account depending on where you are in history) being told to warn sinners about what could happen if you let the devil into your life. The movie even outright says it in its alternate title, The VVitch: A New England Folk-Tale. If you go into the movie with that kind of mindset, more of the elements will start to make sense.This movie would have been rated higher if I could just understand the entire script! I luckily was able to piece most of the story together through the dialogue I could understand (props to Anya Taylor-Joy and Kate Dickie) but the father and the son were very hard to understand through certain parts of the film. It's hard for me to be fully immersed if I have to go back in my head and think of what they could have possibly said.I hope more people see this film. Seeing the discrepancy between critics and audiences sadden me because this was really well-made. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, with diction being lost to historical accuracy (i think) and shots that lasted a little too long coming to mind, this movie deserves (most of) the credit it is given.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Dark and well done,"A quiet, dark movie that leaves the viewer thinking about the interplay between fraying psychology, reality, and the supernatural. In this regard it reminds me of The Shining.

"So much potential, so little commitment.","This movie is quite removed from the traditional notion of modern-horror. The story takes place in the 17th century New England and follows the life of a religious family venturing out of their colony in search of prosperity. The movie does not use jump scares or other cheap forms of horror to achieve its blood curdling results. Instead it brings to life a complex historical mythology. The constant development of this mythology in the story works well in capturing the viewers interest time and again. With all of this said, the story does fall short in certain areas. The film's ambition is exciting to see, however, it comes up short due to poor acting in some parts and seemingly forced plot points. Had the film flowed more naturally from piece to piece it would have had an overall greater impact in its execution. The film tries to balance pacing with high quality cinematography and the results are accordingly underwhelming. If the movie had been stretched to even two hours, I believe the progression of events would have been magnificent. It is unfortunate to come away from a movie knowing that it could have been so much more than it was.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
To Fear a Witch,"The full title is, The Witch: A New England Folktale. Like Grimm's fairy tales, American folklore has taken revisions over the centuries to become a palatable collection of juvenile life lessons. Anyone who has read the original versions of these stories knows how brutal, horrifying, and far removed they are from our current values. As much as I would not condone reading original classic witch tales to a small child, they do contain much deeper implications and ideas than the simple ""Don't tell lies"" that are gleaned from modern revisions. What's fascinating about The Witch is how familiar the setting and story is, without a single cliché or moment of prediction to speak of. The evil that was feared in 17th Century Puritan America has been so eclipsed by the human horrors of The Salem Witch Trials, that we have forgotten what it was to fear a witch.We know these characters only by their Christian names. William removes his family from their Colonial settlement due to an incompatibility of faith. The colony of Puritans isn't Christian enough. With his wife, Katherine, William takes his 4 children into the wilds of the Northeast. Airs of The Crucible envelope the setting. Common pronouns are replaced with ""thines"" and ""thous"". Dialogue is delivered as if quoted from Shakespeare or the Bible itself. In the past, this oral dynamic has always sounded ardently rehearsed. Somehow, it's natural here. Considering William's rigorous faith, you might expect him to be an overbearingly shrewd father. He is in fact a loving and good man of his time; often a pushover. Katherine is the more fearsome parent, with a shrill voice and gaunt pointed face. While they do live in hardship, this is a good family. Once Fall deadens the colors and greys the skies, things begin to take a disturbing turn.Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie play the parents without an exaggeration of the material. Remarkable still are the actors portraying their children. Harvey Scrimshaw plays William's 10-year- old son, Caleb, as natural as can be imagined. The dramatic beats of a horror movie come with taxing climactic moments and Scrimshaw acts beyond his years. Anya Taylor-Joy plays the eldest daughter Thomasin; a doe-eyed blonde beauty who plays the most relatable character of the flock. The dynamic between Caleb and Thompsin has notes of innocent sexual tension. Their secluded life leaves a great deal of new feelings that can't be addressed due to their customs. These feelings lead to foreign temptations that are preyed upon by the timeless evil beyond the trees.The greatest achievement of this film is how faithful it is to its setting and story, while keeping enough behind the veil to become engrossing. The tale feels as old as any, drawing from universal fears and motivations. How it draws you in, keeping you tied to the victims and their perspective while keeping the evil at arm's length, shows a discipline of craft that greatly compliments the material. Much like vampires, witches have been trivialized and diluted by film into something superficially attractive and entertainingly evil. As with Noseferatu, seeing a witch living a damnable existence of ugliness is much more appropriate. If they're ever beautiful, they won't be for long.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A true Witch film,"The Witch is a dark and gritty take on traditional folklore that alot of audiences are not familiar with today. Probably one of the best depiction of a witch. They are not beings in flashy colorful costumes and spells. Witches are dark greedy sadistic creatures who affect the lands around them,the wildlife around them and the people around them.they use dark rituals and blood sacrifices . Those characteristics and attributes are shown in this film well. A family of extreme Puritans banish from their town for their extreme ways offers a perfect cast to fall victim to. With a heavy tone on religious themes shows concept of good over evil or evil over. Without a doubt the two best performances go to Anya-Taylor joy as thomasin, and Ralph Ineson as the father William. The movie has a slow paced atmosphere that helps fills the scenes with suspense& tension There's an absence of color in much in the film that Adds a sense of deprived life in these woods. The witch is a film that keeps it's audience of suspense and disbelief drawing you in and on Edge wondering what will the outcome for this Family be in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
10/10  ????,"I can not believe that anybody in their right mind would rate this movie 10/10. the producers must have paid off a small town to rate this, because they already knew how awful this would be. I watched 20 minutes of this ""horror"" and decided that this should lead to my first review on IMDb. reason for this is mostly because the trailer actually looks quite cool and the IMDb rating was around 6.5 at the time and this alone would make people spend money on this movie. I am NOT English or American but I have seen enough movies to understand English without subtitles. with that being said I didn't understand half the dialogues in this movie and that is enough to completely loose your interest. If you ignore that and think what the hell it's a horror movie and I'm just gonna watch it for the gore, then you will be disappointed because it doesn't even have that. all in all this is the worst movie i have seen in a long time.

A disturbing and unsettling period horror film,"Any genre has all kinds of avenues to explore when it comes to storytelling. The setting alone can be a factor as to how a story will play out. Specifically period pieces. These types of tales can be a bit tricky to handle based on the accuracy the picture and the direction the narrative heads in. If there was a time though to focus on that was one of the scariest, it would be when witches were a big deal. Witch trials were a serious thing during their medieval times and onward. As soon as a witch was even spoken of, things would go south pretty quickly. People would begin having fanatic fits of hysteria and meltdowns, all to be sure such creature was never present. This is more or less what happens here in this uniquely horrifying film.The story to this film is about a family in the 1600s who is banished from their plantation after a religious dispute. After moving out and settling elsewhere, the family's newborn son is snatched away as to what was surmised as a witch. Fearing the worst, the family begins to suspect everything around them, including themselves. Writing and directing this was Robert Eggers, in his first feature film debut. Accomplishing this is not an easy task to begin with, which already is an impressive start. The script is simplistic yet effective in its story to show just how little is needed to make it good. One of the contributing factors to this experience is the atmosphere that is felt. Much of it is unsettling and ominous looking because of how secluded the location is.The cast are believable in their roles. Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), the first born daughter who witnesses her youngest sibling's vanishing gives a memorable performance. That and her chemistry with her father William (Ralph Ineson) and mother Katherine (Kate Dickie) are quite the struggle. Thomasin's other siblings Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson) are also perform well. Caleb comes in second to that of Thomasin for length of screen time. Both Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie were in the HBO series Game of Thrones. While Anya Taylor-Joy was in Split (2016) and Glass (2019). Bathsheba Garnett and Sarah Stephens who play the witches are quite unnerving to say the least and are very convincing.The minor issues in the story are the parts that are not explained. Some characters' fates go unresolved. Nothing is shown what might have happened to them. This is critical when it comes to showing closure in a story. The other flaw was the cause of the whole plot. As the narrative is executed, the thought of someone being a witch begins to surface. Yet it is never explained as to who was the witch, if at all. Understandably so there will be confusion, but also clarity should be brought to light on the inquiry. As for horror, there's only one jump scare and it doesn't even involve a sting which is great. The rest is unrelenting dread that is displayed. There is blood and gore but not much. It's more of the sense of being left alone that is more horrifying.Cinematography was well shot too. Handled by Jarin Blaschke, the camera remains steady and focused. Many times, the lens is aimed strategically at one place in order to cause unrest with the viewer. Blaschke also filmed for Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet (2009) and Fray (2012). Lastly there's the film score composed Mark Korven. The music heard is a mix of ethereal female chants, minimal strings and very light percussion. All of which present this story in such a disturbing way, it will make the audience feel like there really is something among them that is not right. Korven also scored films like White Room (1990), Cube (1997) and Cruel & Unusual (2014). Either way, it is simple for all the right reasons.Minor points like character resolutions and definite cause of plot is the only issue here. The actors give solid performances, the visuals are quite discomforting (in a good way) and the music is creepily memorable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Deceptive Previews and an Aggravating Film,"I went to see The Witch based on the intriguing previews, plus the high user and critic ratings on IMDb. What did anyone find the least bit redeeming in this wretched film?Based on the previews I was expecting a frightening, exciting, tense movie about, oh I don't know, a witch!?!? Instead I was subjected to 90 minutes of a family's extreme religious superstition tearing them apart. OK, that's not necessarily bad for subject matter, but since everyone speaks in different accents and variations of 17th century English (ye, thee, thou, whilst, etc.) at wildly varying volume levels, I probably missed a good 40-50% of what was said.But what upset me the most was how the film existed in the world of plausibility for the majority of the time and then suddenly shifted into fantasy and the supernatural. Far too many WTF moments that I would have to spoil to enumerate. But just when you think you are dealing with the effects of religious extremism and how it can poison a person's mind, suddenly you get slammed with images of pure folklore fantasy and all you can do is scratch your head and wonder what the heck is going on. It's been a long time since a film has made me want to walk out in disgust.I give The Witch two stars because of the acting performances. The cast had some horrible material to work with but they did a wonderful job of expressing their emotions, fears and doubts about each other's faith. Somehow they spoke the lines they were given effectively as well. In the end they couldn't rise above the material, though, including the fact that like so many movies today, the filmmakers had no idea how or when the story should come to an end.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Don't waste your time.

There was no conflict of why whatever is happening is occurring, there wasn't any sort of big picture reveal, or evidence of something more occurring. It was just like ""Watch this family not like each other, oh and yeah there's a witch somewhere in the woods.""We were trying to watch a creepy horror movie. This film was 90% drama and nuisance and 10% horror. You see like 3 scenes that have the witch that are somewhat creepy, each one only lasts about 10-20 seconds (if that).

Takes you to a dark place you don't want to leave,"""The Witch"" is not your usual horror, it's much solemn and morbid, yet true-to-nature interpretation of the grim era. Admittedly, this might not mesh well for those seeking a higher pace horror, and it's quite understandable with the peculiar premise, but it has an intense atmosphere and cripplingly disturbing moments.A family is banished to a faraway land with little prospect. In there, they find that danger lurks outside their farm and also within their family. Props for the actors, including the children, who manage to create a timely sense of the period. It's not the same medieval type movie, first and foremost it's unapologetically dark.The tension arrives as this family is constantly dealing with daily pressure with not all members having the same footing. It escalates into real threat as the occult talk is seeping into their minds. The eerie soundtracks add to this effect, it just brings a feeling of dread and uncomfortable air.However, this presentation can present a couple of problems, one being it might alienate audience. The accent and slow burn are not for everyone, also it doesn't have a hook like more mainstream The Conjuring with clear narrative as it plays with a lot of analogies and the philosophy of the time.""The Witch"" is a polarizing horror with the peculiar and slow theme, however it definitely succeeds on what it sets to do, presenting an entirely dreadful experience in the woods.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""The VVitch"": A Jewel of Pure Horror Since ""The Conjuring"" Film.","Robert Eggers joins the list of the best directors in the genre of the horror of the decade with his first invention of the genre, along with my great idol, James Wan.There are great attributes in the film, the most important ""printing"". It is logical to think that the movie will comply with poor requirements of today's horror films, but no, this goes beyond, it has tone, it has history, it has soul and has strength. The debut of the director and writer Robert Eggers revolutionizes the genre for the 21st century; trampling all the clichés of the genre and proposing a new face for horror films, it is intelligent, absorbing, stressful and really leaves the audience with a trauma after leaving the theater.The project of Eggers has own terror and does not need jump-scares or any other discounted help to create an atmosphere that even without that it passes nothing wrong feels tension and danger. Perhaps, it is true that ""The VVitch"" won't have the same thematic impact that had ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 1991 but if it will have a drastic impact on films of last 5 decades. To create a masterpiece like this, it is not necessary to record scenes difficult to understand (""Inception"" - ""Donnie Darko"") but record scenes difficult to see, film does not take decisions easy but is one of the few excellent horror films where the psychological is not the first trick. The only purpose of the director was capturing the true tale of the New England where religion took side against evil.An extremely religious family composed by mother (Katherine - Kate Dickie) - a Christian woman committed 100 percent to pray and be in communion in all respects religious-, father (William - Ralph Ineson) - a woodcutter who must confront himself for standing to his family and deal with everything that is over him-, the eldest daughter, and face female protagonist of the movie (Thomasin - Anya Taylor-Joy) - a teenager girl from a religious family that's happening by physical and hormonal changes typical for a young man who is prone to overlook the situation that will give a twist to the plot of her life-, the duo of younger siblings, (and so frightening) Mercy and Jonas - Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson)-two ordinary children who serve as gate to destroy the little stability that the family had had after they banished them (this sounds very similar to ""Adam and Eve"") is confronted to begin again once they were evacuated from the villa where they remained (have to take into account that it is the MDCXXX century (16th century), where there are no hotel, houses or shelters) for purely religious reasons. The father being the head of the family, decides to entrust himself to the Lord and bring them to a forgotten forest to begin a new life together filled with love and peace. After settling there, children play, the father imitates a grower, mother do household chores with her daughter, all normal, until evil touches to their door. Strange but meticulously timed events begin to happen and tension and flame of the film is born and progresses in an uncontrollable manner.A big plus for the movie was the period where was record it, where everything seemed a film of horror, even Eggers' team make it seem better than it was at that time. It is imposing the eye and hand of the director for a show scene with such high quality, dark, evil, totally expressionless. Touching parameters of all horror films but revolutionizing them, as the rain where terror was more dramatic than physical, the forest, where someone was not intended them, someone wanted them, the witch, the presentations were great, Eggers is my third master.The cast is perfect. The formula is again present. No Hollywood stars is needed to give tone and fame to this project. The little unknown cast made us familiarize ourselves better with the characters and in part served to launch the notoriety to Anya Taylor-Joy (born in Miami, but proudly bred by Latinos) and two children.The first appearance of the witch is totally frightening and surprising, it makes to scream to the public with natural elements, with images and a monumental instrumentation that decorate the scene as a typical and disturbing tale of fear.The second appearance of the witch is too much ""Red Riding Hood"" but the more praised. I have no words to express the mysticism, finesse but at once grotesque introduction, ambiance, scenery, everything, everything...While some people, the end not has seemed them very good, for my was the best, and that it was the result of an excellent game, that had that be the end and the way how they projected it was ambitious, real and mysterious. Colors, soundtrack, photography, cinematography, art, performances and the contribution to the genre of mystery and horror is colossal. It left a mark, a record.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"If you're looking for scares look elsewhere, as this bore will deliver drama not horror.","I came into this film with high expectations. Im not sure why, but i did, i must say i was disappointed.On the plus side the visual style is fantastic, the acting is great and the ""concept"" is a good one as well. It builds slowly and does make you think. The dialogue was great and some moments were a bit creepy. The story carries itself more like a drama than like a horror, and the main character does an excellent job at being portrayed as victim/ whatever else it is she is.My biggest complain comes from the slow build up, it is too slow before we see any actual horror. I am a big believer in psychological scares, no need for gore and actual violence to shock and terrify an audience, however this film did not deliver by slowly dragging itself in a boring slow paced drama masqueraded as a horror.The film functions more as a period piece, and at times i could not understand the dialogue. the ending was not clear and to be frank i noticed multiple opportunities that could have been used to frighten the viewers but were sorely dismissed.At times the film is misleading and the lack of clarity is what bothered me most. Its as if the entire film is building up to this dark reveal that ends up a mere shade of pale grey.The film is good and deserves to be seen, not as a horror but as a drama.

Robert Eggers: A Name to Remember,"""The Witch"" is just a brilliant film, and plenty scary. Despite the divide between the critics and audiences on this film (as can be expected by any horror film A24 touches), I highly agree with the critics.One thing that I will talk about is the film's score. I would compare it to ""The Shining"", in the sense that it added to the film's creepy atmosphere. Did it provide some jumpscare music? Yes. But did it do it very often? Thankfully, no.Speaking of jump scares, I actually counted how many there were in this movie: 2. This movie managed to scare me silly with only 2 jump scares. Do you want to know why? Because the movie is very disturbing and creepy.The acting and writing in the film are splendid. The entire cast did a fine job, especially with the meaty dialogue they were given. Their performances made some already scary moments even scarier. I also loved the the dialogue felt extremely contextualized. This wasn't like in ""The Village"", where the dialogue sounded relatively modern despite its supposed 18th century setting. This film's dialogue sounded so old (or should I say ""olde"") that I almost had trouble understand them some times. Eggers has proven himself with this fine debut.My only problem I had with this film was that it should have taken the disturbing content slightly down a notch. That's it. That's my only complaint.""The Witch"" (or ""The VVitch"", if you want to mock the marketing) is a splendidly scary film that should be watched by any horror movie aficionado.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The real challange was finding a reason not to rate 10. Stop reading and go watch.,"Often when reviewing Horror films (my favorite genre) I discuss the acute necessity of lowered expectations if one hopes to enjoy, as sadly this undervalued genre lacks the investment (professional, financial and creative) it so rightfully deserves. More often than not a film of the genre graced with a great trailer, an intriguing poster or any form of positive publicity (mostly informal) is devoid of any remotely sufficient quality of story, acting or cinematics. However, in regards to The Witch - worry not. Bring on your highest expectations and be mentally prepared to trash this film as soon as it's finished, it would do you no good. In my opinion, The Witch is one of the best Horror films you'll watch.Everything about The Witch feels classical and fancy, as something about the combination between Little House in the Prairie and Poltergeist hits the atmospheric spot perfectly. The setting, while simple almost to the point of being unimpressive (but just almost), is original and very seldom implemented in such a terrifying plot. The story revolves around William and his Family, a stereotypically devout (even fanatic) Christian family from 19th century New England. After leaving their community on account of its inhabitants not being sufficiently Christian by William's judgement, the family establishes their own little homeland in a nearby rural plain. A wooden shack, a farm, a stock of barnyard animals and the satisfaction of a hard day's work and doing well by one's cherrished deity. That is, until a mysterious and nefarious force begins to torment the family, weakening their faith as well as their family ties and letting their paranoia drive them apart to the point of hatered.The acting is superb by all members of the cast, particularly the breathtaking Anya Taylor-Joy (daughter Thomasin). You know all these slasher films casting eye candies with mediocre and unconvincing acting? Forget them. Taylor-Joy is genuinely authentic and professional aside from being captivating like a renaissance model. Harvey Scrimshaw (her brother, Caleb) also with a superb performance, damaged somewhat solely by what is obviously a direction error. Ralph Ineson (William) is also a pleasure to watch and experience. Aside from the acting skills, the casting has been as accurate and clever as can be (probably along with some excellent writing, directing and art-dress-makeup). Each and every character feels real, authentic and compelling, making me personally feel like each and every cast member was made for their role. Enough to warrant a 6.5 even if this has been the film's sole quality. It isn't. Not remotely.The story is an emotional roller-coaster, sharply and almost violently dragging the viewer from sadness to anticipation, from suspense to fear, from pity to anger. Indeed, the dark force tormenting the family seems to affect the viewers similarly, drawing them into the story and making the entire experience all the more horrific. It isn't a literary masterpiece, but a good screenplay needs not be to achieve its goal. It only needs to tell a compelling and clever story with the right dosage of fear. Add to that the 19th century setting, the old English texts and the farmhand costumes - and you feel like you're told an old terrifying folktale. An absolute pleasure!The only aspect in which I felt the film didn't fulfill its potential was the ending. A worthy attempt to create a plot twist was indeed made, but unsuccessfully. The ending feels like the worst part of the film, the least exciting and not at all frightening. From certain perspectives one might even consider it a happy ending, which is completely out of touch with the mood the film worked so hard to create. In a word: anticlimactic, the all too familiar bane and curse of the genre. While The Witch is simply that good as to not suffer in quality on this fault's account - I can't help but feel disappointed, as it really was one good ending (not even great, just good and better than the actual one) from being a Horror masterpiece.In summary? I can't remain objective, I loved this film too much. I simply feel obligated to encourage each and every cinema fan to turn off the lights and watch The Witch, preferably at night and home alone. Of course, many of you might disagree with me, it's a matter of subjective preferences after all, but I personally am grateful for the experience The Witch has put me through.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This witch beats Blair.,"""Evil is the nature of mankind."" Hawthorne's Young Goodman BrownHawthorne would be comfortable writing in the world of Robert Eggers' The Witch, depicting 1630 Puritans and the repression fostering that witch hunting world. (Need I mention Hester Prynne?) Sins have been committed, no doubt, and retribution seems to be the order of the day, but as in any solid horror flick like this, the evil forces are not clear, hiding as they do behind forests, quick cuts, and darkness.William (Ralph Ineson) and his family are banned by the elders for his pride, never fully explained but seemingly stemming from his willfully breaking of the communal laws or his severe interpretation of religious law. Once outside the safety of the community's walls, the family is subjected to various horrors beginning with the snatching of the newborn child.What witch snatched him, and it's never in doubt that witches are responsible, is briefly conceded to the shot of a voluptuous, ravenous female seducing teen son, Caleb (Harvey Schrimshaw). Beyond that truth lies a host of allegorical possibilities including Brown's sweeping indictment of humanity (see intro quote) with thoughts no doubt going to Adam and Eve.More possibilities lie in the teenage lust Caleb has for his beautiful teen sister, Thomason (Anya Taylor-Joy) and his brother and sister's collusion with the black goat, a sure stand in for the demon. Along with Dad's sinful pride, these sins seem waiting retribution and what better situation than this self-righteous family situated on the edge of a Hawthornean forest peopled by witches.Beyond the explication of punishment and myth, The Witch is just darn good horror filmmaking: The mise en scene has multiple little objects to carry bleak-house metaphor well, the cinematography emphasizes the dark landscape and hidden horrors, and the characters are grimly poetic enough to be holding pitchforks in front of a Gothic farmhouse.Having been a Catholic altar boy and schooled by nuns, I can vouch for the film's accurate and titillating setups for sin and guilt. This is a horror film bound to please horror geeks and novices and the rest of us sinners in between.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fascinating and Disturbing,"Some of the earliest settlers to America were religious fanatics - The Puritans - who believed in strict, joyless adherence to their principles. One byproduct of this strictness was the growing belief that the Devil, through Witches, would possess the pure in order to lead them to wicked ways. This fanatical belief in witches led to the famous Salem Witch Trials of the late 1690's.Director/Writer Robert Eggers, then, asked the question in his film THE WITCH - ""What if these fables and folk stories of witches were, in fact, true""? The result is a fascinating and disturbing film that doesn't flinch in showing the supposed results of Witchcraft.Is it a good film...not really. It's a little too slow and the Olde Engish language used is tough to follow (lots of ""thee's"" and ""thou's"") and, ultimately, the tale of a Puritan family's unraveling at the hands of the Witch is, as I have stated earlier, fascinating and disturbing to watch, but is it entertaining? Not really.Is it a bad film...definitely not. It is a strongly made film by writer/director Eggers who is better know as a Production Designer and it shows, as the production values are strong and consistent, but the plot is weak (there really isn't a plot, except that the Witch is tormenting the family) and none of the family is particularly easy to root for.So, do I recommend this film? Ultimately, I don't think so. I've used the words fascinating and disturbing quite a bit in this review and that is what this movie is...but entertaining? For me ""fascinating and disturbing"" does not equal entertaining, in this case.6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Understandably slow and with a total feeling of creepiness, The Witch embodies everything scary about an unknown world","Today's movie The Witch finally addresses two things that aren't just scary, but terrifying; historical prejudices and a trapped location. The early seventeenth century marks the earliest of American history, not too long after the pilgrims made a home for themselves in the New World. With a land that was mostly unknown and passage back to Europe taking weeks, that's a great example of a location where you have no choice but to face it head on. Even without the possibilities of something supernatural, there's still animals and Native American attacks that could prove forceful and frightening.At the time, the pilgrims left England as they felt the religious standards were too lose and wanted to practice without ridicule. The last thing you want is to be stuck with pilgrims as their moral beliefs steam from the ideal that if someone is acting out of the ordinary, then they must have made a pact with Satan. This would even lead into the famous Salem Witch trials that persecuted several people that were have thought to have practiced witchcraft. While this film is set decades before those trials took place, The Witch paints a scary picture that would make any fundamentalist into a pilgrim.Within the early days of the New World, William (played by Ralph Ineson) is even more religious then his fellow pilgrims, deciding that he and his family need to leave the plantation and search for their own home. He settles on this parch of land where he builds a farm and try to make a life for his wife Katherine (played by Kate Dickie), eldest daughter Thomasin (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), eldest son Caleb, twins Mercy and Jonas, and baby Samuel. Things get creepy right away when Samuel is taken while playing a game of peek-a-boo with Thomasin.Katharine spends her days crying to god while Caleb and William do their best to hunt to feed their family. Thomasin overhears that her parents want to send her to another family now that she's approaching womanhood. This put more tension within the family as crops are failing and are not even sure they will have enough food during the upcoming winter. Caleb then goes missing during a hunting outing with Thomasin's twin sibling accusing her of being a witch. When Caleb is found close to death, more eyes from the family blame Thomasin for the bad things happening, despite her innocence.The Witch is film that scared me more then half of the horror movies I've seen in the past three years. A lot of it has to do with the setting as the entire story feels unsettling. The dark imagery of the forest, the farm and even a simple dinner feel threatening as if there is no escape from any danger.Anya Taylor-Joy is a total breakout as she represents the last of innocence that any girl would have, regardless of that time period or now, within this circumstance. She carries the movie well enough that we wanted to see whether she'd escape.The story manages to remain more layered then it needs to be. With little explanation on what the monster is here. The filmmaker understands that the scariest ideas may not be the unseen force, but rather the people that start to look at you at the first sign on trouble.I would love to watch this again, though subtitles would be a welcome addition. Everyone talks in an older, Middle-English tone that makes the setting more alien, though a little hard to understand. Slasher fans may find this too slow, but it freaked me out.I'll give this ten black goats out of ten. The Witch is everything I want in more horror movies; a total feeling of creepiness, a defenseless set of people, and a unique setting. I'm sure that more horror writers will take inspiration from this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Prepare for a SERIOUS creep-out out...,"Getting right into it, this movie will give you the creeps at some point: if not many points. This is also one of those movies that has a bit of a slow build up. However, it is ALL necessary. For whatever reason, now-a-days people just want all things RIGHT NOW and in a hurry. Give me action! Give me gruesome! Give me the feels... but in order to hit you right between the kisser just right, there needs to be some ground work laid. This movie does that. The other challenge is the period which this movie takes place: 1630. Not the most exciting nor technological times. What this movie does quickly is establish main characters and jumps right into plot. It lets you know that this movie is focusing just on this family. While there's mention of other people, you don't really care. The few main characters all add something good to this gumbo.The art direction and cinematography are brilliant in setting tone, mood, direction and capturing the essence of the suspense, struggle and mysteries that seemingly plague this family. And then... there's that creep factor. On a scale of 1-10, I'd easily give this movie an 8 for 3 reasons. #1. This movie is based off of written accounts. Whaaaaaat?? #2. This is one of those movies that uses kids in that RIGHT way to slap you with effect. #3. This is not your cute little Bewitched or Sabrina the Teenage witch kind of stuff. This is the kind of witch you had nightmares about and made you not want to go back to sleep, ever.The only reason I give this a 7 and not higher is because it lacks some depth and isn't quite unique, but is an original ""witch"" movie in my opinion. The Witch kind of reminds me of The Village and Wicker Man, but better than both combined and multiplied by 5. The build up isn't for everyone as mentioned above, but may take a bit to get through. Additionally, I'm not the reviewer to give out that covenant 10 or even 9 very easily. But, this movie does have a lot going for it and worth the watch if you want a good creep-out or horror movie. There's A LOT worse out there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Unnerving, Wacky, and Super Realistic","The Witch is a good movie, but it also has a very narrow audience. For those that love slow, yet tense, horror films that are as bizarre as they are scary, this film is for you. The Witch is unnerving, super realistic, and wacky to a fault. I will say that the film's writer and director Robert Eggers did an amazing job for a directorial debut, and he is undoubtedly a force to watch in the future.From the opening scene of the film to the very end the film is unnerving. The film is quite slow, but never really boring, because the filmmakers did a great job creating a very tense tone. The tone is essentially formed from three major elements of the movie, the bone-chilling music, the ominous cinematography (especially in the forest), and the always noticeable presence of darkness lurking. In this film the titular character isn't in the film often, but their presence is felt. Combine that with the excruciating attention to detail, and the film takes on a sense of reality.The film is extremely realistic, and that is because Eggers took the time, and had the attention to detail to make the film as realistic as possible. While the dialogue may distract some, it is exactly how people used to talk in the colonial era. The lighting is usually dim, but is to is realistic as the film is literally made to look as if it's being lit by candlelight or moonlight. The actors were on point, most likely due to great direction, and the sets were almost exactly what one would expect things to look like back then. That kind of dedication, deserves respect, but it also helps the audience get lost in the filmic world.However, the film is downright wacky, and in some ways that's great, and in others it hurt the film a little. The film is unlike anything I've ever seen before, in an interview Eggers said his original pitch was ""too weird, or too obscure"" considering the film he made, I want to see that film because this one was wonderfully obscure and weird. However, the film was a little hard to follow, at times it felt as though too many things would happen in a short period filled with moments of confusion, which did help reinforce the insanity the characters were growing into, but made it harder to follow.It may not have helped the film, but as an observation, the film was devoid of humor. In the end, the film is original, unnerving, realistic, very well made, but does have an obscure feeling to it. The cinematography is beautiful, the filmmakers had an amazing attention to detail, and horror fans will most likely like the film. If you like the wacky, weird, obscure horror films that don't rely on clichés and jump scares, check this film out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"The Witch is monstrous, horrifying, cunning, and seedy enough to gratify your well-deserved disgust.","When I saw the first preview for VVitch in October, I pondered whether or not to see this movie, not because it didn't look interesting, but because I questioned the impact it would have on my spirit and moreover my soul. Rob Zombie's The Lords of Salem (2012) was one of the better takes on the witch in American Cinema. His representation was frightening and enchanting, drawing you into it's madness as the female protagonist, played by Sherri Moon Zombie, slips into the world of the witch. Cable TV Shows like American Horror Story and True Blood also crafted their versions of the folkloric succubus, while mainstream media and broadcast TV typically glamorize these demonic women to fit popular culture.The Witches of Eastend (Netflix, Jenna Dewan Tatum) put a Norse spin on the origins of witch clans, while the shows Salem and A Penny Dreadful brutally recant the trials which suspected and actual witches faced. Both shows are led by phenomenal actors; Janet Montgomery, who plays Mary Sibley in the Lovecraftian drama, Salem; and Eva Green, Casino Royale's to die for Bond-girl, who darkens every scene with her piercing blue eyes, passionate prose and gorgeous charisma.Last summer, I listened to an audio book entitled, The Teachings of Don Juan, by Carlos Castaneda. The book is an autobiographical account by Castaneda of his exploration into the world of hallucinogens, with a Native America (Don Juan) witch doctor serving as his apprehensive guide. After returning from one of his hallucinations, Castaneda is warned by Don Juan that a witch has found a way into his psyche and might manifest him/herself in the physical world unless Don Juan draws her out. The account of the exorcism is a frightening moment for the reader and author. It is the same underlying feeling of Castaneda's journey that courses through each word, each scene, and embodies this real world witch, a movie so carefully and perfectly crafted by Robert Eggers, it ensures cult status.The Witch is horrifying in its very presentation, with the threat of the unknown always looming. A shining light within the film, Anya Taylor-Joy, plays Thomasin, the beautiful eldest daughter of a farm fed family. Her coming of age, along with several subtle nuances create a duality within the film which is slowly delivered with small, yet impacting, climactic moments. One of the more apparent overtones in the movie is represented by a beautifully candlelit sequence where William (Father), played by Ralph Ineson recites a prayer while holding up a bit of bread that will soon be broken and eaten by his family. William's appearance resembles that of an imagined Christ, on one occasion his clothing appears as swaddling cloth as if an aberration of the Son of God was plucked from a Renaissance painting and superimposed into this film.William's twin children are an indulgence of the eyes and ears, to say the least, their perfect delivery of the well-crafted dialog all but solidifies the films believability. Their relationship to the families blasphemously black, horned billy goat is a trepidation, their counter charm an essential ingredient in the films making. It's always difficult to see children in a role which may expose them to moments of stolen innocence, yet the poetic dialog and tactful inclusion/exclusion of the children during brutal yet necessary moments in the movie allowed for a clear conscience. That's not to say you don't get your witch. The Witch is monstrous, horrifying, cunning, and seedy enough to gratify your well-deserved disgust.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Danger! Evil-staring Lagomorphs,"I got intrigued by the premise of ""The Witch"", like many others with me I presume, because it's allegedly based on authentic writings and immigrant stories from the actual era in which it takes place; namely New England in the 17th Century! Far too few horror stories take place in the Middle-Ages, if you ask me, and - at least to my recollection - the existing ones are only loosely inspired on contemporary historical milestones, like the several interpretations of the infamous Salem witch trials in 1692. The tale of ""The Witch"" is situated much earlier in that same dark century – in the year 1630 - and focuses on a family that gets banished to the far edge of the community, to a farm right next to an ominous forest, where they gradually get confronted with occult occurrences, so the least you can say about the concept is that it is original. The first reviews that I read on the internet or in specialized magazines were also very stimulating, as they practically unanimously agreed that ""The Witch"" is indescribably atmospheric and petrifying. Having seen the film now, I can definitely concur  ""The Witch"" is most certainly a unique experience when it comes to eerie atmosphere. Literally from start to finish, writer/director Robert Eggers creates a gloomy and foreboding ambiance that makes you uncomfortable and keeps you on the edge of your seat, even when there's basically nothing happening at all. The slow pacing, integer character drawings, bleak performances and silent but sinister extended shots of the forest and treetops all contribute enormously to the mounting of the tension, but there was one element in particular that personally struck me as ultimately macabre and innovative. Robert Eggers and his obviously multi-talented cinematographer Jarin Blaschke excel in filming ordinary animals but simultaneously making them come across as extremely menacing and even pure evil, like the goat – Black Philip – but especially also the uncannily staring hare! Can you imagine After literally having seen and reviewed thousands of horror movies, I honestly never had thought that I would get uncomfortable from looking straight into the penetrating eyes of a  rabbit! Unfortunately, the atmosphere and these unique peaks of suspense are the only true strongpoints of ""The Witch"" (apart maybe also from the solid performances). The plot, even though compelling and full of potential, is too thin while the continuous biblical speeches & dialogs are somewhat unnerving (although I surely reckon that the religious overtone is inseparably linked to the era). Since even the tense atmosphere is something you get used to quite rapidly, the lack of an actual plot and narrative structure causes the film to become soporific. To simply label ""The Witch"" as a period horror piece would also be unjust, as it much more qualifies as a harrowing drama, particularly during the many scenes where the family loses another child or gets torn apart due to (false?) witchcraft accusations. Being a father of a newborn child myself, the sudden and inexplicably mysterious disappearance of baby Samuel had a more than nightmarish effect on me. All this and more (style, casting choices, period recreation ) to at least ensure us that Robert Eggers is a promising and out-of-the-ordinary young director to keep an eye on! That same goes for the naturally beautiful and gifted young actress Anya Taylor-Joy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Haunting and unsettling depiction of hysteria in early United States,"The shadowy and untold world between what we fully believe and the unexplained is scarier than anything in your well-worn campfire stories.A highly zealous puritan family in New England circa 1630 is banished from a large settlement and forced to live on their own in the uncharted spooky woods that surround the area. A year later as they forge a living together out in the wilderness, something begins to act on all of them, something devious, wicked, and insidious. Their oldest child, a daughter named Tomasin played remarkably by Anya Taylor-Joy, is taking care of the new-born baby when it is snatched away. Almost immediately an unspoken change occurs between her and the rest of the family especially between her parents played strongly by Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie. They begin to act strange around her, seemingly suspecting her of the deed and perhaps something more nefarious. But do they really believe that she is in some way responsible? Is she completely innocent or in fact turning into something from folklore and scripture?This stunning debut from writer/director Robert Eggers is a tense-atmospheric- historical drama centering on the fringes on hardened belief, the unexplained and supernatural, and the maddening hysteria that can come from all of them crossing- over into each other. Set some 60 years before the infamous Salem Witch Trials, Eggers has seemingly traced the root causes of the tragedy, most notably with the extremely pious that anything beyond their understanding is an affront to God; the core of their beliefs. The victims of this infamous Witch Hunt tragically unable to plead their innocence against the tide of fear and paranoia that griped their towns, neighbors and families.Anya Taylor-Joy as Tomasin plays the ostracized girl with doe-eyed innocence, but with fleeting glimmers that something may not in fact be right with her, supernatural forces notwithstanding. She is growing into maturity, suddenly experiencing changes both physical and emotional and because of the distancing she is feeling from her family she is coping with them on her own. Only her brother Caleb, played powerfully by Harvey Scrimshaw, seems to even be able to reach out to her, nonetheless an uncomfortable undertone to their relationship develops that further divides the family.As family members begin to suspect one another of evil tidings, the grey New England skies seemingly become darker, their farm animals begin to act wildly and the very woods themselves take on a menacing presence. Getting to the point where even a wild hare is as unsettling sight as the titular Witch on-screen. That is masterful horror cinema, akin to Polanski and Kubrick, generating an constant oppressive atmosphere of dread. The horror genre is experiencing a welcomed resurgence in that last few years with the likes of The Conjuring,The Babadook, It Follows, because the filmmakers carefully take the time to portray their worlds from an oft-kilter perspective. To take a line from the Bard ""Something is rotten in the state of Denmark"". Something is wrong, we can't quite point it out, but something isn't right.That is what true horror is, derived from a primal fear of the unknown and unexplained. Horror genre filmmakers in recent years have tried to manufacture scares into what one can call Shock cinema. Trying to put ""frightening"" images and gore on-screen and using jump-scares to try an jolt their audiences into thinking for an instant ""Well, that was scary."" While that may work for amusement park rides, film is a completely different beast. It is able to grant a unique perspective and understanding of the nature of fear. Nothing should be on-screen to shock an audience, at least in the cheap thrills department. You can be unsettled and disturbed by what is happening in the narrative certainly, but as part of the film's experience you should be trying to understand why you are feeling that way.The Witch is the crown-jewel in the recent string of truly disturbing horror films. A darkly beautiful film shot by Jarin Blaschke that treats its New England forest setting in a suffocatingly claustrophobic manner. The production design team render period authenticity from the cloths, lodgings and especially the 17th century style of English- speaking that may be hard for some to follow but the dedicated performances keep you engaged and concerned. The eerie musical score by Mark Korven makes the haunted woods seemingly sing not unlike the monolith in 2001. All these outstanding cinematic elements compliment one another to create a vision of hysteria that would manifest itself in real-world horrific ways in the area's history.At my screening just as the end credits appeared, another member of the audience cried out ""That's it? What was that?"" in a unsatisfied tone. ""What was that"" indeed, I guess we never really truly grasp what lies waiting for us in the darkness when we journey to the edges of what we're used to.9.5/10 (An unsettling film that depicts the primal fear of the unknown in uniquely disturbing ways.

Disappointing and hard to get through,"""The Witch"" is a movie that starts with promise but ends up a chore to sit through. With each development of the plot it doesn't feel like you are in the hands of somebody who knows what they're doing, who's leading you from one twist or surprise to another. In fact, nothing in the movie is really surprising, or shocking, and it's not in the least scary.The filmmaker went to a lot of trouble to get the actors speaking and sounding right, and looking right. But aside from that, it's a frustrating experience, because nothing really comes of anything. You expect something but don't really get anything.There is one scene I didn't like, that made me feel for the actor involved. A young boy is made to appear naked in front of an older girl. If you are into that kind of thing, don't get excited: you can't really see anything, but you can tell he is undressed. Don't you wonder about how they filmed such a thing? How did the boy feel about being made to do that?",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wanted a Second viewing - was amazed - re-wrote my review,"After seeing The Witch the first time I compared it unfavorably to the Shining and found it lacking some structure, expecting a psychological meta-narrative outside of the horror genre and outside the idea of witches in general. I wrote a review not really praising it but finding the film interesting. The film stuck with me, however.I then read ""The Witches: Salem, 1692"" by Stacy Schiff which is an historical account of the much later trials (that we are all vaguely aware of, but whose details I for one was unfamiliar with). It also contains some of the material and texture that the filmmaker was employing in writing his film. Reading the book actually made me want to watch the film again and evaluate it on it's own merits, not some half-baked expectations of my own.I saw it again and was amazed.I found the film to be powerful, extraordinarily disturbing, dense with period texture and a real horror masterpiece. The psychological narrative was not some modern re-imagining of a mindset plagued by superstition, but an historical reconstruction of an authentic, period world-view which was dramatically and brilliantly played-out - it is eerily effective. I was sad it came to an end - I wanted to see and feel more of the experience the film provides.I am delighted to have been so wrong about such an amazing film and able to enjoy it again, for the first time!

Outstanding true horror film.,"Probably the best new horror film in several years. From the beginning, the film establishes an unrelentingly bleak and oppressive tone and barely lets up. It has some of the most upsetting and terrifying moments I can recall in a film. The cinematography is Oscar-caliber, and the soundtrack and sound design are top-notch. It kept me in a constant state of dread for its entire runtime.You need to watch this in the dark and in complete silence. You cannot talk through this film. It requires complete immersion.I'm very confused by the 1-star reviews I'm seeing. I can only conclude that these people do not have much of an attention span, or don't have much of a horror palate. Or, they've been conditioned to expect cheap scares like the scary face moment in Insidious.The Witch doesn't rely on jump moments, and to me that's a great thing. In the horror movie canon, I can think of a few jump scares that feel earned and really enhance the scene, but they are a small minority of the total. Some good ones would include the monster reveal in The Descent or the alien jumping out in the access tunnel in Alien. Most jump scares aren't like that. They're in the film to create fake tension. Unfortunately, I believe many moviegoers have come to expect the rush of adrenaline that comes with a jump scare and have come to associate this with the horror experience.I would urge the people giving it 1 star to watch a lot more horror films and try to really gain some knowledge about the genre, and then come back and watch this one again.

Costume design is great, cinematography is good if that's what you're looking for. Not worth the watch if you're looking for a horror psychological movie. Do not waste your time watching this if you think its on the same level as hereditary or vivarium.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Quintessential 21st Century Horror,"The Witch (VVitch) is one goddamned scary movie, and it's not because of cheap thrills and jump-cuts galore. This is a movie that buries itself deep into your psyche, slowly builds up as a monster movie as well as something along the lines of a psychological thriller. In an era when it seems like horror has little more to contribute, here comes a movie that packs a punch comparable to great modern films like The Babadook.It's an undated time when America is barely colonized. A small family is banished from the city for religious betrayal or some such thing. It's hard to know for sure especially as the opening shot is of the magistrates of the town sentencing the family to leave at once. We see the reactions of the father's children. They are young, confused, willing to follow their parents and yet unsure of what the implications are. With little more than a wagon loaded, the family departs and sets up a small farm on the edge of a dark forest. Al is well.If you have seen the trailer, you know the general feel of the film. What surprised me was how quickly the film jumped into the thick of the terror, as the infant baby is kidnapped before their oldest daughter's eyes. Perhaps it was a wolf, and through frantic searches, they give up hope as the baby is known to be dead by either animals or hunger. The next- youngest, a set of twins who playfully run throughout the farm, claim to know stories of 'the witch of the wood.' It's laughed off.When I recall to mind great horror movies, I think of moments that catch you off guard, where you as an audience member are generally frightened for what is about to happen. These movies follow no clichéd plot lines nor are they predictable by any means. In The Witch, I was led on a journey that was so terrifying if only because the audience knows something that the family does not: there is a witch, indeed.Our first introduction to her is a scene so disturbing and eerie that my mouth hung open the entire scene. It's not long after the baby goes missing. There are a few shots as we see the witch mostly in shadows, as she goes about business that takes fear to a new level. The imagery coupled with some extremely Kubrick-ian music (think 2001: A Space Odyssey), this becomes a film so drenched with tone and darkness that it draws your attention even in the quietest of scenes.I really don't want to say too much more about the story, except that the family grows to suspect the eldest daughter for a variety of coincidental reasons. Though we know there is a satanic force lurking in the trees, the majority of the films turns inward as we watch a family devoted to God unravel with suspicion and fear. It's a believable family, with the father a kind and compassionate man, his wife God-fearing and unhinged, and children that are raised to know little more than good versus evil and His Holy Word.Robert Eggers directed and wrote the film in an astonishing debut as a filmmaker. There is a confidence in his style that already feels like it comes from a master. The performances he draws out of his small cast (especially the children) are remarkable, and at times this feels like a movie that is already a classic in the horror genre. My sole concerns (and deductions in the rating) come from the film's ending, one that feels cheap and unneeded for a movie so layered with style. It's a film that uses no special effects until the very last moments, and even then, was it really necessary? The final moments also contain a reveal that shows the truth hidden throughout the entire film, and even then, perhaps a bit of ambiguity wouldn't have hurt.The Babadook. It Follows. The Witch. Year after year we have seen a select group of films that simply redefine psychological horror, and they are few and far between. The trailers beforehand included two or three movies billed as being scary yet appear to be little more than slasher films with buckets of gore and fake blood. When will filmmakers learn that it isn't blood that frightens an audience, it is the unknown. Do not miss this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Confused by the excitement if this film.,"Well done (both by the director and the actors) film depicting ostracization from persecutory and the descent into paranoia leading to the entrance of evil. Humph. While visually inticing and the story is well played by the actors, this doesn't come together enough to make a ""film"". It is excellent in its pieces, but I didn't find that it took me to a higher level of cinematic experience. I can appreciate slow burn films and have enjoyed many. This slow burn seems to lead me to a sparkler, and while still ""beautiful"" in its essence, decidedly underwhelming",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A somewhat flat and boring storyline...,"I had initially looked forward to getting to sit down and watch ""The VVitch"", though it is only 2 years after it was released that I actually got around to do it. I do remember watching the trailer back prior to the movie came out and was intrigued.The story in ""The VVitch"" was plagued by a horribly slow storytelling, and it didn't really help that almost next to nothing happened throughout the course of the entire movie. It was only towards the last quarter of the movie or so, that the movie started to pick up pace and things started to happen.One thing that did work in favor of the movie was the acting performances put on by the cast. The actors and actresses were really doing good jobs with their given roles, despite having a limited script and storyline to work with.There was a really good and realistic atmosphere to the movie, and it definitely seemed like it was quite true to the time period in which the movie was set to take place. And the costume, props and sets were quite convincing, adding a lot of flavor and detail to the movie.""The VVitch"" didn't fall into my liking, because it was just too slow paced, and the ending of the movie didn't sit well with me either. This was somewhat of an acquired taste of a movie by the hands of writer and director Robert Eggers, and I believe that having an interest in the time period and particular aspect of American history that ""The VVitch"" is set to take place in is a definite must to fully enjoy this movie.One thing that puzzled me was the fact that if you have seen the original trailer to the movie, then you have essentially already seen the entire movie. Everything else is just filler that really doesn't serve much of a purpose to the story.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
gets under your skin and haunts you,"Sometimes you can't believe what you're seeing in a cineplex that will more than likely only show the latest from the major studios. A film like The Witch or most other films from the studio A24 - mostly (if not all) done independently and then picked up for distribution - such as Under the Skin or Springbreakers, would normally be relegated to some art-house theater where not many people could see it. But unlike some distributors who think in only day-and-date theatrical/VOD (or just VOD only), A24 puts something like The Witch as basically a mainstream release (needless to say I saw the trailer for months, many times, in front of big horror and other releases). But I love that a film that goes for being all about simply scaring you by its brooding imagery, period dialog and actors who you won't know unless you have every cast member of Game of Thrones memorized (hint, it's the parents), gets to be seen by so many people. It's not about silly jump scares or characters who are idiots... well, not in the sense of the usual teenagers, but let's get to what I mean.This is all about witchcraft, but it's also not the simple 'riding around on broomsticks' shenanigans or anything that comes close to being jokey. Filmmaker Robert Eggers (which is all the more astonishing as it's the director's *debut*) suffuses his actors and crew into a setting that is unmistakably 17th century New England, and it's from here everything else can be conjured up. His story follows a family of Puritans from England who are cast out from their community (we don't know why, no real need to, except that the father and mother are, to say the least, very religious, even for the Puritans!) They set up a farm and are preparing for a long season until they can grow their crops. They have a bunch of kids, an teenage daughter, an adolescent boy, two twins and a baby. Right at the start the baby is taken by... who? What?Sometimes having some ambiguity can work in a film's favor to make the horror from the story and place even more potent. There's not too much ambiguity with The Witch (unless someone wants to warp around things to their liking, or found something I don't know), and it's clear: there is some real heavy-duty black magic going on in the nearby woods, and whether the spirits (in human and animal form) come to the family because they're religious or just because they're evil beings that like to slather themselves with blood is a little more open to interpretation. And in less confident hands it could have become schlocky or unconvincing, set in a period so that either monotonous imagery could unfold (it could have easily been a too-hard-to-take pace wise effort) or all about the special gore effects.Eggers finds the sweet middle ground, and creates a portrait of a family undone by their own religious fervor, while also being true to what were, at the time, historical accounts of witchcraft. Whether those carried much creedence, Eggers doesn't care - he commits to showing these woods and showing something like a goat or even an apple as something deathly serious, and yet loaded with significance. He doesn't move the camera around like crazy, and of course he doesn't need or should have to: the production design is among the greatest in any horror film, not to mention the certain color palette that he and DP Blaschke give to every shot so that it's like the world is drained of color - grays are even grayer, browns dirtier, and blacks somehow much blacker. It's a serious, darkly directed film, but there's always an intensity about it that doesn't make it ponderous to a point that takes one out of the movie.A large part to why the film is so effective and chilling is the acting. The main adults (Ineson and Dickie, rarely below a 10 emotionally speaking, though Dickie has the trickier role as the one who has to try, up to a point, to keep his wits about him) are very strong here, both playing variations on God-petrified mortals, but the movie for me really belongs to Anya Taylor-Joy (her first major movie role, expect to see her in many things to come) and Scrimshaw as Caleb.For the former, she has to carry many scenes all based on why she is a trustworthy person, and she sells it, while for the latter, this boy, it's a role that needs someone to play the period dialog (which is only occasionally obfuscated by the accents) and having to be genuinely scared to death when faced with the evils in the woods. When you have characters who are both ""simple"" folk of the Lord while also being capable of being twisted by the same dark forces they can't escape, you need people to sell it. They all do, to lengths not unlike out of Polanski at his fiercest.So combine a filmmaker who wants to make Dread with a capital D his priority, a setting and location and things like just a barn or a door that feel eerie and ominous, and actors who dig in to characters who could very well destroy one another due to their fears (except for Thomasin), and you got a unique genre piece that works just as well as drama as horror, if not better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A new kind of horror,"""The Witch"" suffers from a lot of deceiving promotion that made it look like our average cheap theatrics horror. It's actually a slow-burning, elegant dark fairytale dripping with a uniquely eerie, dreadful atmosphere and effectively brought to life by realistic characters. For his first feature film, director and writer Robert Eggers did extensive research on the 17th-century witchcraft folklore and puritan lifestyle. He went for a minimalistic approach, preferring realistic and crude staging over costume drama glamour and gothic cinema cliches. Everything is shot with natural lighting and little frills, yet each frame is haunting, poetically beautiful, blending perfectly with the supernatural elements. Visual effects and gore are kept minimal, yet there are a lot of genuinely disturbing moments. The approach and taste are modern, yet the style, pacing, and aesthetics somehow remind of classic cinema a la Bergman and Herzog.The plot is simple and predictable: an outcast puritan family sets up a farm near the woods where a coven of witches lives. Needless to say, the witches cannot wait to get their hands on the children. You kind of know what is going to happen while you watch, and there is no mystery to solve. Everything is clear from the beginning, but what matters here is how the film manages to create a particular atmosphere and empathy for the characters through tasteful visual storytelling. The relationships between the six family members, the way superstition and faith in God manage to pull all the strings even before the witches actually come into play. You can't help feeling bad for all of them. The acting is good and natural, bringing out the dramatic tone of the dialogues without cheapening the lines. Subtitles or earphones are highly recommended for non-native speakers as it's easy to miss many nuances.The film starts a bit too slow and verbose indeed, but the pacing gets a little better in the second half. Still, it will not give you what you want if you are looking for an entertaining film full of special effects, action and gore. Go for it only if you are into psychological and contemplative cinema. It lacks that unconventional, groundbreaking thing that a true masterpiece needs, but it's definitely one of the most elegant horror films out there, and a great directorial debut for Robert Eggers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Slow Burning Horror,So if you're looking for a stereotypical horror film that has plenty of jump scares and over the top blood this movie is not for you. Where The Witch pulls it's horror from is how little it presents. The unsettling location for 95% of the movie takes place makes the characters and the viewer feel isolated. It's beautifully shot and the natural lighting adds to the gloomy setting. Where the witch scares you is building up this very unsettling feeling and sense that something is wrong and concluding with sharp and sudden visual horror that will leave a mark on you.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It is an OK horror movie with some gems and some apparent flaws.,"I decided to watch this movie after reading some terrific reviews and praises that it received. In the past, I have enjoyed slow-burn horror movies such as ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Anti-Christ"" tremendously, and ""The Witch"" appears to be in the same league. However, after watching this movie several times, I cannot help but feel like it leaves much to be desired. Overall, is it a terrific movie? I do not think so. It is enjoyable but not that great. I really wanted to like this movie but I simply cannot. Allow me to explain myself (mild spoilers ahead so please continue at your own risk).First of all, let me discuss the PROS.+ The female lead Thomasin is the brightest gem of the movie. The actress did a fantastic job portraying a naïve, pure, struggling yet strong and loving teenage daughter. I could not help but feel pity and sympathetic for her and the situations that she was pulled into. In my opinion, any actress that can provoke such a feeling from the audience deserves praise.+ The twins Jonas and Mercy are also well-acted. They did exactly what they were supposed to do: be an annoying and hellish pair. I felt very uneasy whenever they delivered their lines or sang their Satanic songs. They create some pretty strong hatred in me right off the bat. Again, in my opinion, this is terrific because it shows that the actors know what they are doing by invoking the right emotion response from the audience.Now, I will discuss the CONS.+ The choice of speech: this movie suffers from poor choice of speech/dialects. The director chooses to use Old English in this movie to give it a more realistic feel. I think this is fine in itself. However, I feel like this choice has backfired. And the actors' talking manner does not help either. They sound incoherent and some of their conversations just do not flow well. More on this later. A lot of the dialogues are very hard to understand. I had to turn on the subtitles and I still had problems following some of what they are trying to say. First, I thought maybe the problem was because I was not a native speaker but then, I found out that even native speakers had trouble understanding the speech in this movie.+ The mother: this character, in my opinion, is a failed attempt and really impaired the experience. Early on, the audience know that she is in pain due to the mysterious disappearance of her infant child. The audience are supposed to feel sorry for her and sympathize with her behaviors. However, I doubt anyone could pity her because she had very little character- development. All she does in this movie is be unreasonable, grieve, and complain in a high-pitched voice. Her speech is also incoherent because she 1) speaks too fast, 2) jumps from one point to another without using any conjunction, and 3) ends her sentences abruptly. I find her voice and character to be increasingly irritating upon repeated viewings.+ The pace: for a horror movie, this movie lacks scare scenes. While I do appreciate how the director took time to deliver some good unnerving scenes, this movie is too slow and fails to keep the audience anticipated. It has almost no scary moments until the very end. And even then, the scenes are not that scary except for one or two of them (the crow being the best scene of the entire movie, in my opinion). I firmly believe that a few more scary moments and a less slow pace would help the movie tremendously.In summary, this movie is decent. It is in no way a mindless average horror movie, but it is not that great either. I give it a 6/10.PS: Sorry for any bad English in my review.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A vvell-done movie,"This film doesn't rely on cheap jump scares to deliver its scares. The form of horror this film gives you is by taking you in the world of the characters - rather one character in particular - and the terror that gradually leads to the climax of the story. The bonds between the family members are pushed to the limit as they grow increasingly desperate and some become antagonistic to one another, charging each scene with a sense of profound unease, so you're never certain of what will happen next. That is the masterstroke of the film, the continual slow-burn tension and uncertainty that will keep the viewer disoriented and searching for concrete answers. The film pivots on metaphors, symbolism, period specific dialogue, and character choices to convey a representation of the biblical stories it centers around. Technically, this film is mind blowing; Production design successfully creates a sinister environment that reeks of evil, and the peripherals of the isolated surroundings only add more creepiness to the whole setting. The gorgeously looming and oppressively atmospheric cinematography, as well as the sweeping and dreary score, that often imitates what is happening on the screen, building tension to a crescendo that adds to the horror of this film. In terms of the performance, the ensemble cast does a fantastic job.Overall, While I do understand the themes, ambiguity, and purpose behind this movie I didn't really find it that interesting or scary for that matter. The reason why critics and audience are so divisive on this film is the same reason why critics and audience are divisive on ""Hereditary"" - they are both are a slowburn horror films that depend on creepy atmosphere, exploiting tension and unsettling imagery to delivers their scares. People don't mostly appreciate that type of horror, just like me to some extent but you still got to appreciate as they're real work of art.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Stellar scenery and amazing atmosphere!,"Do not go into this movie expecting horror or gore, this is movie is all about the atmosphere, calm and mellow at times, but surely intense enough throughout. Absolutely stunning imagery and scenery all throughout the film a it is set in a 1630's forest. The movie does not solely revolve around withcraft and magic as the title might lead one to believe, it takes a rather different approach giving us insight into the heavy religious influence in the 17th century.Overall, the movie has a great vibe to it, watching a film like this makes you forget about the usual appeals of horror/thriller movies as you easily get sucked into the atmosphere of this movie even without much crazy and intense action you are feeling the rising tension between the close-knit family as the eldest daugther becomes suspected as a witch. Note that there is an enourmous religious prejudice and bias in this movie as it is all about god worship and being an obedient person living out god's will. If you have a problem with the heavy religious tone this movie has, i would suggest not watching it, because i can understand how redundant that can get at times.A really relaxing, but tense film, that is worth watching for many different reasons, do not expect gore or horror as i have said above, enjoy the sound effects, beautiful imagery and the usage of old english, which is rather rare in movies and art nowadays!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A cut above a lot of other modern horror.,"A God fearing family manages to end up banished from their village in 17th Century New England. They decide to set up cabin and ranch at the edge of a truly spooky forest. Their troubles are only beginning when their adorable newborn son Samuel disappears without a trace. And a lot of the blame is laid at the feet of the teen aged daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy).We never ever see very much of the title character in this effort by writer & director Robert Eggers. He chooses to parcel out his true horror rather carefully, instead focusing on creating a mood and atmosphere that is absolutely stifling. His film is somber, serious, and even depressing. It's definitely not for all tastes. It sets a tone in a sequence approximately eight minutes in, involving Samuel. This will cause ""The Witch"" to lose some viewers, for sure, but all I can say in Eggers' defense is that he spares us the goriest details.Eggers was inspired by a variety of folklore, fairy tales (I can certainly see a ""Hansel & Gretel"" influence), and records of settlers during this time in North American history. His *very* literate dialogue is often taken from these records. The dialogue and its delivery is therefore highly antiquated, so that's one other thing that some viewers might not care for. But it's refreshing that Eggers takes such a careful, measured approach to telling a tale that could be referred to as ""slow burn"" horror. The look for this picture is perfect; its drab visuals are very suitable to the story being told. But don't worry; there is some gore here and there.The performances are incredibly sincere and intense. Taylor-Joy has tremendous appeal in the lead role. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are superb as the parents. Harvey Scrimshaw delivers a mature performance as the son Caleb. Bathsheba Garnett has such a creepy presence in her seconds of screen time as the true form of the Witch. And the goat Black Phillip manages to be quite the character too, especially towards the end.Overall, an interesting fable open to some interpretation, with many themes and questions of faith throughout.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"""Be sober and alert. The devil prowls the earth.""","Robert Eggers' ""The Witch"" now replaces my all-time favorite horror film (previously Robert Wise's 1963, ""The Haunting"" with Julie Harris, now a little dated). What the two do have in common is a literary-mindedness, fine performances, superior cinematography, and that which is new and strange, that is, nothing is predictable.In the case of ""The Haunting"" sexual repression, loneliness and maybe a psychotic heroine; for ""The Witch,"" sexual tension from single room living as well as a religious repression, a dark foreboding wood, and a landscape unfamiliar to the inhabitant, that is, a New World. In both cases, an ignorance that needs some kind of definition so fear/panic can be managed. Ignorance is usually at the heart of the supernatural, but both films manage to convince the audience there is some kind of actual unknown force threatening the characters.Eggers researched cases from the 1600's prior to the infamous Salem witch trials. Using court documents and lore, he's put together a convincing logic for what happens during the course of ""The Witch,"" whether it be contaminated food, starvation or isolation born out of new surroundings or expulsion from society.The spookiness creeps in slowly. The personality quirks of the family explain a lot. Never before have two ""twins"" been more cause for alarm than Mercy and Jonas and their ""pet"" goat Black Phillip.The use of archaic language both Christian incantation (and other darker forms of religion) really raise the hackles. When Mercy and Jonas taunt an untethered Black William (a goat) with repetitious rhyme, I wanted to flee. But family members are stuck with them, and tensions build in their new surroundings as various significant and insignificant mysteries begin, and alarm and panic consume the family where no one is trusted and blame comes quickly to the lips, causing more and more tension. As pioneers, they are living on the margin of survival, in and of itself terrifying.What happens in the wood is both beautiful and fraught. Jarin Blaschke's painterly cinematography draws us in to the drama, as does the careful costuming and production design. The film harkens back to the work of Carl Theodore Dreyer's 1920 ""Leaves from Satan's Book,"" and masterful exploration of occult throughout his long career.But it's the music that pushes this over the edge. Mark Korven's dissonant chorale and seemingly period instruments are as unfamiliar to us as the surroundings are for the family, driving us as mad as the fear that inhabits the characters.All of this is accomplished in an almost casual way. But slowly the injection of the unknown and fear of it, consumes us without the usual tricks that have become so familiar (and anything-but-scary) the many horror films that are cranked out by the industry. ""The Witch"" is different which is bold enough. But it's also accomplished in what it sets out to do and earns a very special place in the canon of horror films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sound design put me off,"Decent movie. I would recommend watching it with subtitles and headphones though because the screeching violin and howling gospel turned me off so bad. It gets really loud and annoying in one scene, and then the next they're mumbling in old English. I was watching this in the middle of the night, because that's how I roll when I wanna watch ""horror"" or ""suspense thriller"" films. Big freaking mistake. I had to spend most of the movie turning the volume down when the screeching score was too loud and the turn it up when they starting talking again. Ruined the whole experience, and at some point I couldn't stop laughing because it was so ridiculous. I know its supposed to build up tension and suspense, but the howling ladies just got awkward after a while. The film itself was beautifully shot, but overall it was about 20-30 minutes of the movie that was actually worth my time. I like a few scenes, but most of it was either ruined by mumbling actors or howling gospel.

Just superb. Highly Recommended.,"My Rating : 9/10I love the 'darkness' of this movie. It's unique and so much fun to watch it unravel in the climax. The Witch is slow-burning, not exactly horror in the 'jump-scare' kind of way but it has it's moments of Satanic imagery which are equally powerful.An atmospheric thriller/horror. Much, much better than 'Hereditary'.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Short review for impatient viewers,"The acting in the movie was excellent. Especially the kids, they were amazing and very realistic. However I feel like the story line could be improved. There wasn't a solid story in the movie.The character development was not that good. We didn't get to know much about characters. This was a perfect opportunity to create a horror masterpiece but they let it slide away.I give this move 6 out 0 because of the perfect acting and visuals.If you are impatient like me i definitely advice you to watch this movie because everything happens fast enough.Follow me on Instagram @punkifex",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Absolutely Riveting,"The Witch, or as I prefer to write it, The VVitch, follows a family as they are exiled from their home city and settle on a new plot of land where they are haunted by what they believe to be a witch from the woods.I went into this movie knowing it was slow, particularly the first 20-30 minutes. However, I didn't find this to be the case at all. Maybe this was because I mentally prepared myself for the beginning or maybe not, I don't know. But I'd suggest preparing for a slow movie right off the bat.Everything about this movie is pretty phenomenal. To start, the acting is spot-on. Every character is almost perfect, with the exception of one or two points with the child actors. But even then it wasn't terrible, it was just not as good as everything else. For the most part the child actors were great. Every line of dialogue is very well delivered, despite the fact that it's an old way of talking. Every actor seems to feel each line of dialogue and made it genuine and real, which I haven't seen at all in these kinds of movies.The writing is, while done in a way from the 1630s, easy enough to understand while still maintaining that accuracy. It requires the audience to pay attention to what they're seeing to properly understand it, but it's not too terribly complex, nor is the story complicated or requiring you to understand every single word to know what's going on.The movie actually has a very original concept. It takes a relatively unoriginal general idea/type of horror and makes it something original. The VVitch is more of a family drama caused by the result of a witch hanging out in the woods. And in that way it makes the characters realistic and relatable, but it's also something we don't see every day. Its a realistic, relatable horror movie that shows the effect that an element of horror has on a family.Of course, part of making a good horror movie is making it scary, and this one succeeds on that level as well. It doesn't cater to all the typical horror tropes, but instead goes for subtlety. It's a slow- burn horror, so naturally the horror is few and far between, but thanks to the immense build up of tension and curiosity throughout the film every reveal or bit of horror is all the more effective.The movie is mostly straightforward, but there is plenty that isn't explained. It requires you as the audience to think just a little to completely understand the movie, which I appreciated. The movie doesn't just spoon-feed you all the information you need to be completely satisfied. It treats the audience like a bunch of capable-of-comprehension people and allows you to figure stuff out on your own. Again, it's not like it's overly complicated though, it's pretty easy to understand.The ending was pretty great too. Without any actual words, the movie manages to communicate a lot about the story to the audience. Plus it's just creepy and messed up, and that's always to be appreciated in a horror.To top all this off, the movie has a great look. The shots, especially at the beginning, are beautiful. While they do die down towards the second and third act, the entire set is just so cool to look at that every shot is a scenic one. But as far as visuals go, it's not just in scenery. The set itself looks fantastic, and the costumes are spot on. I rarely notice these things, but dang, the costumes were good. Apparently they were even made from the same materials and patterns from the time, and it certainly shows.I got so into this movie that about half an hour in when I wanted more pizza I didn't want to get up to get some, nor did I want to pause the movie. I didn't want to break the momentum of the story, and I didn't want to miss anything. So I sacrificed pizza for this movie. Eventually my friend paused the movie, at which point I grabbed the rest of an entire pizza and and took it with me to finish the movie. I wasn't going to going to risk going hungry again. The movie managed to steal my appetite by the third act though. It wasn't gross, it was just unsettling.Overall The VVitch is fantastic. It's got great actors, great characters, great writing, an original concept, a great ending, and is overall a great movie to look at. I absolutely loved this movie. It's easily one of the best of the year, maybe even the best of the year. In the end I'd certainly recommend this movie, so long as your not going in expecting your typical garbage horror flick.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Perhaps the Best Horror Film of the Decade,"It's between this film and ""Hereditary""; the two horror films that I consider to be the best of the decade. What makes ""The Witch"" such a powerful horror film? In my opinion, it's that the scariest thing to happen in the whole of the film happens in the last few minutes, leaving the viewer with a shocking image that has such dark and grim meaning behind it, that it's nigh impossible not to be shaken and disturbed. I remember the first time I saw this film I thought it was great, and then I walked out of the theater and went about my day, but that final image kept creeping into my mind, infecting the dark corners of my room as I lay waiting for sleep. The implications of those last images are truly, in every sense of the word, horrifying, but more on that later; the rest of the film does an almost perfect job of building a world that feels infringed upon by evil on all sides, creating a place of apparent solace that is still rife with corruption. ""The Witch"" is about the infectious, parasitic, and sumptuous powers and allures of evil, and there's nothing more horrifying than that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Disturbing and scary,"""The Witch"" is one of those types of horror movies that doesn't rely on cheap jump scares or sexual content to be a success. No, this is one of those unsettling and terrifying horror movies. This particular film has an excellent cast with Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, and Kate Dickie carrying the film. Because the film is set in 17th century New England, it is quite hard to understand what is being said a lot of the time, but that is what makes this movie work in a sense.The film is basically about a Puritan family who are told they are banished from their own village because they violated some religious rule that we are not told of. They end up moving to a small farm in the woods with a horse and several goats. Well, from there, things start going downhill. Their baby goes missing, presumably snatched by a wolf, but the children think something more sinister is going on. Supernatural disease also strikes when Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) goes missing, but comes back in an apparent possessed state of mind. The film is terrifying and suspenseful, and absolutely nothing is cheesy about it. It is actually quite mysterious, too. Is it a wolf? Is it a witch? Is it a demonically possessed goat? Is it Thomasin? Give this one a watch. I'm going to rate it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?,"Maybe not a movie for everyone if you don't like the classic horror or the classic jumpscare infested movie. However, this movie is to put it simple- A piece of art.This movie takes place during Pre Salem time. Based on documented events and court trials, it's scarily accurate. The way they speak, dress, act- I absolutely love the historical accuracy of this film.
The movie is about a family representing all that is against the church at the time- they are all sins and none are completely innocent. It's about a family coping with loss and coping with the issues that a modern family might have- Such as sibling arguments and the idea of not having a means of living- or money for most of us. This movie puts up a very long build-up, suspense filled and to those who might not be very artsy- slow and possibly annoying.
But I simply loved it. The actors are perfect for there roles and uncomfortably chosen too. The cinematography is something else as well, with shots that are hard to explain or shots that are beautiful and light on the eyes, really quite enjoyable. Another note that some of the scenes may even require research to understand such as the beginning scene with the baby due to its historical accuracy, which to me is just more fun... But maybe not for others who just want the plot shoved down there throat.Anyway if you're not into jumpscary stuff- Don't watch this. If you're feeling kinda artsy and into something thats accurate and kind of beautiful, I'd watch this. Really an awesome movie :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sorry. No,"The Witch: A New England Folk Tale (2015); this film's impressed with itself; it's got a grasp of old/New England dialogue, which gives it an air of authenticity. But it's not a good film: 1) it's boring 2) it's low budget; not necessarily a bad thing; look at Resevoir Dogs (1992) which shows a movie can be good without a big budget. But in this case it doesn't do the film any favors; maybe if they had more money it could've been more of a horror film with spfx make-up, blood and gore etc., and then perhaps it wouldn't have been as boring 3) not much happens; in other words: boring. It's supposed to be a horror film. But it's not; lots of dialogue; showing off how people, hundreds of years ago in America, supposedly spoke. Maybe I'd be less scathing if it wasn't for the rave reviews; people carrying on like it's a great film. Dear filmmakers: just because you know how people in puritan New England may have spoken, doesn't mean you can make a boring film that comes off more like a theater production: film's not theater; in film you can do things that can't be done on a stage; after all, this is cinema, not theater. If you want to see a movie that's sourced from a play, that's got a grasp of puritan New England dialogue + good acting, that covers similar terrain and that isn't as boring, watch The Crucible (1996) starring Daniel Day Lewis and Winona Ryder. 5/10 for trying (easy to criticize; try making a film)",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Highly recommended,"This movie is all about atmosphere. Fantastic cinematography, acting by the entire small cast, production, low key score. It's extremely slow, but worth watching for the excellent and unique atmosphere the director managed to create. The language and locations help that too.

The plot is based on folklore tales and for me it was secondary to the enjoyment of the film - just put your brains in neutral, don't try to find any sense in was is happening and you'll enjoy it.The cinematography, although rather ""static"", was simply breathtaking.

Coffin loads of atmosphere and dread,"The past couple of years have offered up some very interesting horror flicks that defy genre conventions. Movies like The Babadook and It Follows continue to haunt me at the back of my mind whenever I think about them, like now... This year we have another frightfully good one - The Witch.Like the previous luminous examples, Robert Eggers' debut film focuses on themes rather than on the usual tropes and plot to drive the story. It is a marvel of minimalism and a wonder of unnerving terror. Eggers' meticulous construction of historical details is spellbinding and he even goes to the extent of having the entire cast utter King James English. The Puritan world of Christianity is the disquieting battlefield and the sweet family stands no chance. It almost feels like the story of Job in which God has deserted them and lets the devil play with them like dolls. The drab cinematography is immaculately precise, every frame carefully thought out. Above every aspect of filmmaking, Eggers got the difficult ominous tone spot-on. The sense of dread is so overwhelming and enveloping that you can't breathe. 5 minutes will feel like 10 minutes - usually when I say this I mean it negatively, but not with The Witch. The film has coffin-loads of atmosphere, and the horror is so real that it borders on pure torment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Crafting the witching,"There are two movies at work here (see also the title). One is about placing us in a remote place and time, New England in the 1600s when it was uncharted wilderness, giving us a presence in a life outside maps. A family has been ostracized and comes to live in a remote farm at the edge of the woods. Dread here comes from knowing we are on an edge of the world and no one will be coming for help.And then we have another kind of presence as you might guess, lurking in the woods and circling from afar. The apparitions are scarce, which seems to have put some viewers off, but are harrowing when they came so we stay the duration until the next one. The first one in particular is so well timed and ghastly; we know right away this will be a world without mercy, without cuteness about evil.They made it overall, this is worth watching, it creeps. The difference is all in the first kind of presence that ushers us in a world of human frailty. There are all kinds of ways to explore that edge, only one of which is the notion that evil is being hallucinated, reality cursed by belief in a narrative about evil powers. The forest as playground for chance havoc transformed in the traumatized mind. The filmmakers toy with as much in the scene with the kids becoming possessed by the sight of possession, then snapping out of it. And it's of course in Thomasin giving herself over to delicious madness, levitating out of mind that witnessed what it did.I would have liked to see a Herzog version, even more knowingly centered in shedding knowledge to give us mind levitation, from his days when he was still a shaman of the craft of seeing. Or this with a lusher camera that listens for the night. We don't altogether escape movie- ism here and this kind of film more than others needs to reach me primal, although it must be an uphill struggle.

Egger's visionary old horror tale is a gem for the horror universe,"Eggers finally gives the universe of horror films a rare gem. An ancient gothic fairy tale, dark, ancient but not unprejudiced.

"Not everything fits into the ""horror"" category cleanly","The Witch is an atmospheric period drama/fantasy/thriller that is true to its surroundings. At the time and place, superstitious ideas about witches and devils, sins and redemption was a very social and personal normal condition. The Witch takes the classic fairy-tale approach down a dark path and one becomes a helpless spectator in a world that is both beautiful and frustrating at the same time. The acting is superb and writing borrows directly from historical Puritan and Elizabethan documents to preserve accuracy of dialog, set pieces and culture. It's a disquieting journey with a twist, but if you appreciate this kind of emotional investment in a film, you should find The Witch to be rewarding.

"Slow-burning, Disturbing Horror Period Piece","The Witch is a horror film set in 17th century New England, and after a family's youngest child is taken into the forest under supernatural circumstances, paranoia challenges the family's Christian beliefs and threatens their lives in ways they never could have imagined. The Witch premiered at Sundance last year, and following rave reviews, has finally received a wide release. The Witch is a very different horror film that relies on atmosphere, disturbing imagery, and sound to craft a slow, but terrifying, horror experience.The story in The Witch takes familiar ideas of witchcraft and Satanism and puts them in an isolated setting with a family of six on the outskirts of the forest. The father and mother preach strict religious values, so after their youngest child goes missing, the family slowly begins to point fingers and the dark situation becomes a witch hunt within their own family. I liked this unique spin on witchcraft and demons, but I only wish the characters were more interesting. The mother and oldest daughter were the two most interesting characters, with the rest of the family being entirely forgettable.The dialogue is taken straight out of the 1600s, so while it is authentic, some lines and words are hard to make out. Because this dialogue is combined with thick accents and some characters mumbling, there were times were I was legitimately missing entire sentences. The Witch does explore some interesting themes for a horror film, like faith and isolation, which I appreciated.But most importantly in a horror film, is it scary? Yes, in chunks but not as consistently as I would have hoped. The scares are not jump-scares or anything like that. The scares are enhanced, and sometimes carried, by sound entirely. There are many times in The Witch where there is nothing on screen but the forest in the distance or a rabbit in the barn, but the sound gives you an unshakeable feeling that something terrible is about to happen. It's some of the best use of sound design I've seen in a horror film in some time.There's also some really disturbing imagery I can still visualize a day after seeing The Witch. The use of off-screen space is cleverly utilized to add to the more psychological moments. There are palpable moments of dread throughout, but after these sporadic moments, there are lengthy scenes of downtime with the family speaking to one another in the cabin. So while The Witch does have atmosphere, the pacing of the scares and the storytelling makes for a somewhat uneven film from start to finish. However, the final 10 minutes are so incredibly twisted and satisfying that it makes up for the slower moments up until that point.While I mentioned I was not in love with the characters in The Witch, the film uses the forest as a character itself, and very good one at that. The forest has an unmistakable presence and is completely captivating because of the potential darkness that lies within. Shooting on location with the forest and beautiful landscapes, combined with excellent costume design, results in a low-budget film that looks incredible. The cinematography is breathtaking, and I love the film's use of desaturated color to add to the dark tone.While The Witch is slow at points and some characters are not very engaging, I still found the film to be a beautiful and unique take on the horror genre. Not to mention the last 10 minutes will remain etched in my head for the foreseeable future. If a horror movie can affect a viewer for even a moment following it's conclusion, it's definitely worth a watch from any horror fans who thinks they can stomach lots of gore, mutilation, and goats?If you liked this review, check out my website for more reviews and movie articles www.watsonmoviereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This won't be to everyone's taste.,"The Witch is an indie flick, it will be enjoyed by lots of people who are aware of this and were expecting this. It's a film for lovers of real horror, not Hollywood horror, people who have a passion for art films filled with great cinematography will appreciate this movie. The stereotypical, mainstream movie goer who is hoping for jump scares and cliché horror plots will ultimately be disappointed.There is a scene within the first 15 minutes or so which is uncharacteristically brutal and gory. The rest of the movie doesn't resemble this level of horror and this scene will last in your memory long after the credits have rolled. This is a horror, there is no doubt about that, it just isn't a horror in the conventional way of the mainstream Hollywood movies.A devout Christian Family are banished from their plantation and set up home on farm on the edge of a woods, in the middle of nowhere. Before long, strange things start happening, their new-born seemingly vanishes into mid-air and their crops start to die out. We see the stress and strain take its toll as they slowly begin to turn on each other and become more and more emotionally unstable. Paranoia, hopelessness and resentment are all strong emotional factors and we truly get to see how these traumas can shake a family to the core. Their distress leaves them as a collection of individuals rather than a compact family, vulnerable to the evils within the forest.The Witch is a slow burner, a very slow burner. There were parts which I found boring and seemed to drag for no particular purpose. It is a very heavy dialogue driven movie with very little action; it focuses on the family and their relationships with each other much more than what is lurking in the forest.The acting has been praised very highly but I honestly didn't see it as that strong. I can appreciate that speaking in Old English was a challenge, especially for the child actors and this showed quite glaringly. The father of the family and the eldest daughter gave the strongest displays, both showcasing their emotions very well.The Witch has a fantastic score, the music used is perfect, capturing the old era and adding very strong tension. The music used with the breath-taking cinematography made for one very special looking movie. It is full of panoramic camera work, slow and drawn out shots which create tension and atmosphere perfectly. You never felt like there was going to be a jump scare as it is very obvious that it isn't that type of movie, but the tension is there nonetheless – it is essentially a very uneasy watch. Another strong aspect for me was the ending. I was watching the movie unravel, with underlying thoughts of how they would end this movie. I won't say too much as it's a spoiler free review but I was very, very impressed with how they did it. The very final scene was powerful and graphic, it ended in a way that felt very concluding way and ended in a climax of drama.I felt like I had an idea of what this movie was going to be like and I was completely wrong, leaving me at the time, slightly disappointed. I have since been able to appreciate The Witch for what it is and when I look back on it I can see how very impressive this movie actually is. I will be watching this again as I feel I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have upon my initial watch at the cinema.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of THE WORST and misleading movies EVER!!!,"Like most other reviews here, I was lured to this movie by an intriguing trailer and high IMDb reviews. Well, there's goes IMDb review credibility. The movie had nothing to do with horror, and barely had anything to do with a witch, but was little more than an old world family religious drama. I'm not going to waste too much time getting into the thin story but it was basically dead boring. The mother of the family was way over the top and desperately needed a good smack. The other characters were uninteresting or downright irritating (the cartoonish twins come to mind). Within the first 20 minutes, I knew I was in trouble. It just got worse from there.Several people gradually walked out of the theater, and I should have been one of those smart enough to know nothing would redeem this mess. When the movie ended, the entire remaining theater groaned and were very vocal in how much they hated the movie. What made it worse was that I decided to treat a couple of friends of mine on a Saturday night to what we were all excited to see, but unfortunately I lost $34 and a couple hours of life that could have been better spent doing something more entertaining or interesting, like lancing a boil. But we did get one unintended laugh from the film, and that had to do with a crow and the mother.

Into the Shadows: 'The Witch' Conjures a Haunting Tale of Puritanical Terror and Familial Descent,"In the realm of horror, few films dare to tread the path of the slow burn with as much conviction as ""The Witch."" This is a film that understands the genre's roots are not in the shock of the moment, but in the creeping dread that lingers long after the credits roll. It is a testament to the power of atmosphere, a meticulously crafted piece that eschews jump scares for a pervasive sense of unease.Set in the 1630s, ""The Witch"" transports us to a New England suffused with the paranoia and piety of early Puritan settlers. The film follows a family exiled from their community to the edge of an ominous forest. What ensues is a chilling unraveling of their familial bonds, a descent into madness and despair that is as compelling as it is harrowing.Director Robert Eggers exhibits a masterful control of tone, crafting scenes that are as beautiful as they are haunting. The authenticity of the setting is one of the film's greatest strengths; every detail, from the archaic dialogue to the rustic homestead, feels painstakingly researched and realized. This commitment to historical accuracy does more than just sell the setting - it immerses the viewer in a world where the supernatural seems not just possible, but inevitable.The performances, particularly by Anya Taylor-Joy as the eldest daughter Thomasin, are remarkable. Taylor-Joy conveys a complex mix of innocence, fear, and burgeoning independence, anchoring the film as it spirals into darkness. The rest of the cast follows suit, delivering performances that feel genuinely of the time, adding to the film's eerie verisimilitude.""The Witch"" also excels in its sound design. The score is a sparse, dissonant affair that gets under your skin, while the natural sounds of the wilderness are amplified to an almost unbearable intensity. It's a film that understands the power of silence, using it to build tension in a way that is almost unbearable.However, the film's dedication to its aesthetic and tone comes at a cost. The pacing is deliberate, which, while effective in building atmosphere, may test the patience of viewers accustomed to a more conventional horror tempo. Additionally, the film's commitment to period dialogue, though admirable, can occasionally render the speech difficult to decipher, potentially alienating those not fully attuned to its rhythms.Furthermore, while ""The Witch"" is undeniably atmospheric, it is not without its flaws. The narrative, for all its intrigue, sometimes meanders, losing itself in its own moodiness. There are moments where the film's subtlety can feel like obfuscation, leaving certain plot points frustratingly opaque.""The Witch"" is a film that demands attention and respect. It is a bold, unflinching piece that redefines what a horror film can be. It may not cater to all tastes, and its slow reveal of horror may not satisfy those seeking immediate gratification. Yet, for those willing to embrace its deliberate pace and absorb its oppressive atmosphere, ""The Witch"" offers a deeply unsettling and thought-provoking experience that lingers like a shadow long after the final frame.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Witchy Woman,"(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: The Crucible meets The Shining meets Rosemary's Baby in Robert Eggers' well- received but wildly overrated debut film.GRADE: C+PLOT SUMMARY: Set in the 1600's, faith lends a shaky hand to a devout Christian patriarch and his family as they encounter strange occurrences in a small New England town. Labeled as heretics, the family is shunned by the community and settles near a dark forest with talks of witchcraft and other evil forces lurking about.JIM'S REVIEW: While the film is called The Witch, it is its subtitle, A New England Folktale, that reveals more about writer / director Robert Eggers' first film. Folktales were originally cautionary tales told to impressionable children to forewarn them of the dangers in the real world. The film uses its time and setting most ingeniously, recalling the religious repression of that period and the mass hysteria associated with sin and witchcraft in a Puritan village. It has also garnered the awe of many impressionable critics as well. While this psychological thriller has some strong and disturbing imagery, it cannot hide the many illogical twists in the plot that are more evident after the film reaches its unsatisfying conclusion.One is initially captivated by the story, production values, and acting as the film tells its tale of a family surviving on its own after being exiled by the community elders. There are strange satanic goings-on as they settle into the woods (a bad place to be in most fairy tale lore): daily fire and brimstone sermons from an arrogant shiftless father, William (Ralph Ineson), Katherine (Kate Dickie), a cold and hateful mother who seems more possessed than humanly possible, lustful glances by a confused son, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), a pre-pubescent unhappy daughter, two creepy twins spouting evil talk, and a baby who goes missing. Nothing goes quite well for these outcasts.The atmosphere is indeed moody and eerie, although the pacing of the film is in need of some stirring. Eggers is a solid director, and a talent that shows much promise. He creates a wonderful setting with much historical accuracy and his penchant for occasional surreal images with black birds, goats, wild rabbits, and subtle uses of blood to accentuate the perils surrounding the family are haunting and very effectively done.The acting is uniformly strong. Mr. Ineson, sporting an anachronistic 21st century six-pack physique that could have tempted many a Puritan, handles the speechifying astutely and Ms. Dickie brings a sullen and disagreeable presence to her character, but it is the acting of the two younger members of the clan, namely Mr. Scrimshaw and Ms. Taylor-Joy who deliver the emotional connection needed to care about this stoic family and their creepy dilemmas.Yet, as the story progresses and more and more supernatural things befall these victims, the leaps of logic become harder to accept. Mr. Eggers' script ultimately lets down the audience. His flair for visuals compensates for a lack of cohesiveness in his screenplay. There is also an over-reliance of heightened sound effects and atonal musical cues that telegraphs something wicked before it comes this way.Just as folktales are themselves cautionary stories, The Witch may hold one's interest in its storytelling, but this reviewer must caution any moviegoer that this well-crafted tale will leave you more bothered or bewildered than bewitched.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"""who be the witch of the wood?""","A triumphant debut for director Robert Eggers who crafts a terrifying exercise in slow-building horror with The Witch, perhaps the year's most daunting watch.The story centers around a family in 1630s New England as they are haunted by supernatural forces such as witchcraft, black magic and possession. The first thing Robert Eggers successfully establishes is the setting from which this takes place. An unbelievable achievement in what can only seem like the 17th century, the filmmaker captures not only the tone of such a life but incorporates a script that breathes a Shakespearean essence which further elevates the drama and heightens the horror. The Witch invitingly creates such a dreary and desolate mood that often times feels suffocatingly unbearable and yet remarkably compelling, it is as if the film itself uses supernatural forces to allure you, but that's just great filmmaking don't worry. The cast here are impeccable, consisting of only 6 actors, they immediately set an emotionality that will secure your investment for the rest of the running time. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are veterans who never miss a beat, even with terrific child actors lead by a superb newcomer, Anya Taylor-Joy, who perfectly seizes the accent and blend moments of drama with horror.The Witch is immaculately constructed, with exquisite performances and a haunting tale about the decay of a family corrupted by the witches of the woods, no pointy noses or crooked hats in this one however.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I just felt really bad after watching it because there was no reasoning or resistance from the main characters. They are all pathetic in terms of integrity and personality. REALLY bad film with pointless and gruesome imagery that is probably meant to disturb you in a witch crafty type way.

Like a nightmarish bedtime story,"From the moment the film begins, you're trapped in a spider web of dread.This is the tale of a deeply religious English pilgrim family who is exiled from their community, and made to start over alone in the countryside with nothing. From there, things go from bad to worse. That's all I should tell you about plot.For right now, let's talk about the overall aesthetic of the movie.""The Witch"" is one of the most deliriously gorgeous films I've ever seen, owing most to its impeccable direction and production design. This is a movie that could potentially unseat ""Eraserhead"" as the most atmospherically bleak, unsettling, tense, and hopeless film ever (okay, at least for me). The experimental, string-based score ropes everything together -- deafening crescendos are shuffled with uneasy undertones and moments of paralyzing silence. The acting is excellent on all fronts; my only slight complaint being Ralph Ineson's overall diction, which seemed forced at times and occasionally muddled his line delivery.But for all intents and purposes, this is an incredible movie. The reason for my 8/10 and not any higher is because it just isn't accessible to most people. Despite its stunning design and direction, many will be left unsatisfied or feeling stupid because they feel like they don't ""get it."" Probably like you, I hate movies that make me feel stupid. When I saw ""The Witch"" in theaters when it first came out, I felt stupid. I thought the movie was terrifying, but I felt stupid.After a rewatch two years later, I finally understood why it's so scary, and why none of us should feel stupid, whether you've already seen it or not. I'll explain.This is a movie that has been lambasted for being ""slow,"" ""boring,"" and having little to no discernible plot or explanation. While the film is admittedly a slow burn, you have to be prepared for what you're getting into. The hint is in the movie's subtitle: ""A New England Folktale."" That's exactly what this is -- it's a period piece, and a culmination of extensive research into the behaviors and speech of 17th century settlers in New England (look for an interview with director Robert Eggers with the British Film Institute). Much of the script is in an early-modern dialect, which can be confusing at times. Some of the themes could initially be dismissed as laughable; for example, the idea of a witch stealing an infant being both fathomable and deeply horrifying.It's easy to see why many wouldn't be engaged by this movie beyond its production qualities. But we mustn't forget -- this is the era of Puritans and the Salem trials.Let's get some context.The correct mindset to watch this film in is thinking about it as an experience similar to reading ""Macbeth"" in high school. The cool thing about early-modern literature is that we all experienced it the same way -- whether we're currently 18 or 80, we all read that play in high school and were probably initially bored by it, despite understanding its importance. It's something that we imagine was probably terrifying and original a few hundred years back, but today seems stale. In truth, it was the written/oral product of King James I's obsession and fear of demonology and witchcraft. It was the real deal back then.Meanwhile, the Puritans are settling in New England because they don't think the Anglo-Catholics are taking God seriously enough. The seed of witch hysteria across the Atlantic is planted, and we all know how things go in Salem.The United States wasn't introduced to Shakespeare until the 1800s, long after this time period. But if they could've read/seen it, would ""Macbeth"" had been scary to the deeply religious Puritans? Maybe. What if they could experience a terrifying folktale as we experience movies today in the 21st century? Would they run screaming?Today's horror films that are watchable mostly use (or at least attempt to use) original ideas and themes. ""The Witch"" isn't that. It's a folktale. It's written and shot like one. This isn't ""It Follows;"" there is no deep, allegorical connection to be made. It's a bedtime story told to impressionable little children by candlelight.Dark folktales are never exactly masterpieces of plot and thematic structure, and this movie isn't one either. It has a very simple plot that isn't very scary (at least by modern standards). What's scary is the way it's delivered. Don't go into this movie like you're a snob and grasping at straws to develop ""hidden meanings"" or whatever. If you're really into film, this is probably ingrained in you whether you like it or not. Get rid of it before watching this. There is no hidden meaning to this film. It's not pretentious -- you're just thinking too hard.Relish in the atmosphere. Go where the film takes you, even if it's confusing or nonsensical. It's okay to be confused. Being confused can be scary and uneasy. The monster under the bed is scarier if you don't know why it's there or where it came from.Experience this movie in complete darkness and with the best possible sound system.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"If Jesus couldn't save himself, what makes you think he's gonna save you?","First-time writer/director Robert Eggers has had quite a ride with his debut film ""The Witch,"" earning the respect and endorsement from the Sundance Film Festival, the majority of American critics, and even the Satanic Church. His film is meant to be both an homage and an ode to New England folktales and fairy tales centering around witchcraft and the supernatural. Most of the film's dialog and structure came from folktales from over two-hundred years ago, as stated in the film's end credits, and the look and feel of the film is remarkably 17th century, right down to the environments Eggers utilizes.If nothing else, ""The Witch"" is destined to be one of the most aesthetically refined and remarkable films of the year, let alone most beautifully shot horror film of the year. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke emphasizes the eeriness of the deep-wooded New England plantations, with precise focus on the location-swallowing fog and the overcast skies. As dreary and as miserable as the film looks, it's also immersive in the regard that it clearly plunges you into a different world; one you haven't been familiar with in horror films in quite sometime. Every year, we're almost guaranteed to get a Gothic-style, Victorian-era film that emphasizes lush scenery and immaculate cinematography, but rarely do the visual conventions of 17th century folk intersect with contemporary horror. In that respect, ""The Witch"" is a novel concept that sets itself up for noteworthiness on the basis of its locational possibilities alone.Before I get any more carried away than I already have, the plot must be introduced. Set in the aforementioned century, the story revolves around a traditionalist, god-fearing family led by William (Ralph Ineson), the intensely religious patriarch. His family consists of his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), his eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), his son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and his young twins Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson). The family leaves their old land to start a new life on a farm, where Katherine gives birth to her fifth child, which is subsequently abducted by a witch before being sacrificed.This starts an unrelenting curse on this family that works to destroy it by going after its most innocent and helpless individuals, the children. Eventually, Caleb winds up becoming the witch's next victim, as a controlling and possessed spirit enters his body and begins to overtake him, all while the family is grieving over the loss of their newborn. Meanwhile, William and Katherine find themselves considering sending Thomasin into an arranged marriage now that she is becoming older, and seeing as she's proved herself in capable to take care of her younger siblings.As one can see, ""The Witch"" is very much a family drama, with psychological and supernatural horror ingredients injected into the film's premise to add the unsettling undertones. Unfortunately, ""The Witch"" gets its atmosphere down to a tee so well that it forgets to make a story that's as creepy as it sets itself up to be, let alone moving or worthwhile. Despite such wonderful, gloomy settings, the film never becomes very creepy or interesting enough for audiences to care. Everything, from the characters' personalities to their religious guidance, feels within arm's reach of us, and while the authentic, period-specific dialog is a commendable element, it only works to further distance people from the film's themes.This is truly a shame because I appreciate what ""The Witch"" sets up: a family rooted in deeply traditionalist, religious doctrine that is slowly finding out that Jesus, God, or any other kind of figure from their Bible cannot save them from the evil and sin that runs amok in the world. The idea that Jesus couldn't save himself is one that's hard enough to grasp, but what happens when one realizes that, because of that, he cannot save him or her either? William, played very well by Ineson, who goes for assertive and unnerving here, has the hardest time grappling with this idea as he watches his family crumble before his eyes.With that being said, watching ""The Witch"" can be a frustrating experience just because of how lifeless it often is. The level of character interest doesn't come anywhere close to the interest level of the film's setting, and as a result, there's little to connect to or embrace. It wasn't until about the hour mark that I truly felt conflicted as a viewer; here's a film with a biting, interesting premise and themes that's weighed down, not only by its esoteric approach, but also by its lack of legitimate creepiness until the last twenty minutes.""The Witch"" doesn't flatline entirely like ""The Forest"" or other horror films of recent years, particularly ones neutered in content and approach to attract a younger crowd, but it doesn't titillate or excite like ""It Follows"" or ""The Sacrament,"" both films with similar premises, strong themes, but far more accessible characters and consistently interesting setups. Some will claim my soft dislike for ""The Witch"" comes from my lack of tolerance for slowburn horror, but consistent readers of my work know I hold slowburn horror near and dear to my heart and vastly prefer it over the tropes that have become commonplace in contemporary, American horror. The problem with ""The Witch,"" at the end of it all, isn't its pace, it's the paces it takes in the wrong direction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Gahbage,"The Witch is a period piece in Horror disguise. There was no suspense, no tension, no fear, no nothing. It had so much nothing that there wasn't even any color.

Maybe if I knew what they were saying more than 50% of the time it might be a better film. Even when you could tell they were speaking English, the mumbling was hard to get past.

"Good plot. Not so good audio, or video.","Decent movie, but didn't meet my high expectations, from reading other reviews.The pros: has enough action/suspense; it held my attention throughout. And, unlike so many others that I have seen lately, does not suffer from an abrupt or anticlimactic ending.The cons, unfortunately are too hard to ignore. First and foremost, the lighting is bad. Granted, there ought to be some darkness in a scary movie, but I had to turn the TV screen to almost full brightness, so to see much of what was happening.Another problem, was trying to figure out half of the spoken words. The place and time in history may call for ""old english"", but that plus the low volume of sound, make it hard to get what the characters are even saying. Especially the dad, who mumbles too much. I have quite good hearing, but could hardly understand a word that he said. Dare you turn up the volume, you'll be blasted by some other sound. You'd best turn on closed-captioning (if even available).Bottom line: if not for the problems just mentioned, I may have given the movie an 8/10. But a 9 or a 10: no way.

Atmospheric horror in early colonial America,"This film is set in New England sometime in the 1630s.

Is the devil really at work or are they gradually going mad?If you want lots of violence, gore, death and scary moments you are likely to be disappointed... however if you like psychological horrors with an increasing sense of paranoia and dread this should be just the thing for you. The remote setting creates a great atmosphere. For most of the film I wondered whether the characters fear would be proven real or ultimately exposed as a delusion brought on by stress and religious fervour. The use of period language added to the sense of realism even when things were getting strange. The small central cast in impressive; most obviously Anya Taylor-Joy, who plays Thomasin and Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie who play William and Catherine respectively.

Chilling slow burn horror chamber piece carefully balances psychological and supernatural horror,"Set in 1630s New England, a family that's been shunner by their community over a religious dispute is forced to move far into the forest on their own. The film is told from the perspective of the eldest daughter, Anya Taylor-Joy in a standout performance that's also her film debut, one day is watching her baby brother who mysteriously disappears before her very eyes. It's revealed that a witch has stolen the unbaptized child for a blood sacrifice. At that point, the family begins to suspect one another of consorting with the devil and practicing witchcraft, which is where things begin to unravel. First time writer/director Robert Eggers has made something of a minor masterpiece with this slow burn horror film that never quite comes out to explicitly state whether anything supernatural is happening or if it's all in the paranoia imaginations of it's characters. This isn't to say the film isn't scary, because it's scary as hell. Although not a standard jump-scare horror film in manner of ""The Conjuring"" or ""Paranormal Activity,"" Eggers delights in slowly building tension between characters and peppering it with some truly haunting and chilling imagery. When Taylor-Joy's younger twin siblings befriend a goat named Black Phillip, hold onto your horses! There are few films I would visually compare this too (Dante Tomaselli is possibly the only current horror filmmaker I might compare Eggers visual style of horror). It's shot primary using natural lighting and the camera is largely invisible in that it doesn't draw attention to itself with showy pans or zooms. It's primarily frightening and chilling static images that stick with you, whether it's Black Phillip striding through the forest, a red cloaked raven haired beauty becoming the viewer closer, or some of the more overt horror images I won't spoil here which may or may not be hallucinations or dreams. Eggers has stated the film is based on folktales, fairytales and written accounts of historical witchcraft, including journals, diaries, and court records, with much of the dialogue coming directly from these primary sources, which gives the film a sense of authenticity that's missing from many period films about witchcraft. Witches have long been a horror film staple, but they rarely come off well. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is likely the best film about witches and like this film, it rode a delicate balance between supernatural and psychological, but no film about witches has better captured the folktale/folklore elements of witchcraft than ""The Witch."" The silent film ""Häxan"" may be the only other film I can think of that possibly captures this period feel, but that silent film documentary style was quite different from a narrative form of storytelling. In ""The Witch,"" the imagery of a black goat with a broken horn, all the talk of ""signing the book,"" different animals which may or may not be familiars, talk of a witch's teat, or the plot point around an unbaptized child all feel straight out folklore and effectively tap into primal audience fears. The film also greatly benefits from a truly remarkable score by composer Mark Korven, who creates an unsettling dissonant soundtrack using a minimalist approach. Korven actually built his own original instruments to create some of the frightening and original sounds used for the film's score, which makes the soundtrack to ""The Witch"" one of my most favorite film scores in years. Overall, ""The Witch"" is not a standard horror film that will appeal to your average Fangoria gore-hound, but is more of an arthouse horror film for horror fans who appreciate a slow burn horror style of filmmaking that takes its time to build character and tension.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good Movie - worth seeing,"This movie is very well made, with some great performances - notably Kate Dickie as the wife/mother. She is very fitting to this role as was the male lead.What I loved: Its portrayal of the 1600's puritanical thinking; strong ties to religion and therefore the devil, willingness to see the devil in anything that went wrong. The desperation of trying to hold on to your family and way of life. The performances of the actors were tremendous and very believable. The mother/ daughter relationship was well done - the daughter looking for her mother's acceptance and approval, the Mother always at odds with her. The younger siblings that were as annoying as today's younger siblings. The bond between the siblings. The setting, so lonely and isolated. The animal scenes, i don't want to spoil anything so i won't say more. The building desperation over grief, fear, threat of starvation. The ending - loved this. The twins were creepy! And I loved that I had no idea if there really was a witch, and if there was, who was it.What I didn't like: What season was it in New England that there are no leaves on the trees yet the weather seemed temperate? I'm thinking November, but they must have been some really hardy people. They never once seemed cold or were tending a fire. Whereas a movie like The Revenant literally made me feel cold throughout, this one seemed to be filmed during an Indian Summer. The music - I liked parts, but hated how the music would rise and get louder only to simply end in literally nothing significant. It would simply change to a black screen and then a new setting. While the music was exotic, it failed to match the tempo of the scenes. The dialogue was hard to hear and at time I could not make out what was being said because of both the accent and the old style language.I would definitely recommend seeing this movie - but I do think that it could wait until it is available on demand.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the worst horror movies I've seen,"I'm a big fan of the horror movie genre and I was excited to see this. The whole '1630s New England' thing and witchcraft interested me, but I knew I would be thoroughly disappointed from about 45 minutes into the movie.The movie falls flat miserably and has very slow pacing with no pay- off. The acting was very mediocre at best. The only noteworthy performance was Anya Taylor-Joy, but obviously that wasn't enough. The actual writing had no ambition and I feel like the director took too many conservative options with the story just to be safe. This resulted in no significant set-pieces to happen to create tension or any kind of suspension or mystery. My biggest con is the non- existent soundtrack. A fundamental element of the horror genre is the gripping soundtrack but this movie just didn't have any. Because of this, many parts between segments were just stagnant. Cinematography was poor as well. They could've done a good job at capturing the wickedness of the forest, but they showed no ambition at doing that.Overall, an extremely lacklustre and unambitious movie. Considering this is 6.8 which is very good for a horror movie - this, according to me, is highly overrated.FINAL IMDb RATING: 1/10 - AVOID",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A wicked masterpiece,"""The Witch"" is undoubtedly one of the most skillfully made horror movies I've ever had the privilege of seeing. This movie excels on multiple levels: the performances, the cinematography, the score, art direction, production design - and above all - its unmatched uniqueness. I'm fully confident that this movie will be remembered for quite some time.Something so horrifying occurs during the first five minutes that we are 100% invested for the rest of the movie. We have seen this in the trailer: a young woman is playing peek-a-boo with her baby brother in an open field. Suddenly, the baby is snatched up by an invisible witch and taken deep into the woods. For the record, this movie does not attempt to leave the baby's fate up to question; we see everything. This is an incredibly bold move to make in the first five minutes, and it's frightening as hell.This is not a movie that relies on jump-scares or gore. Rather, it's a perfectly paced slow-burner. Through flawless directing, we are completely aware of how serious of a role religion played for people of this time period. This allows us to understand their overwhelming fear of witchcraft and evil. It wasn't a superstition to them, it was a reality. What makes this film so exceptional is that we are able to feel that fear for ourselves. We sympathize so much with the family on screen that it breaks our hearts to see them afflicted with so much fear. It feels like we are witnessing an incredibly convincing nightmare from 1630s New England.From start to finish, we are presented with so much vivid historical detail, that it's hard to look away from. The dialogue, the costume design, and the historical accuracy make the film all the more realistic. It legitimately feels like we are seeing the 1630s in-the-flesh; not one detail is missing.I highly recommend this movie - not just to horror fans, but to film-lovers everywhere. The sheer level of focus makes it unlike any other horror movie. The performances are so convincing that we see actual fear in the characters' eyes. Nothing looks fake. The score is eerie and deeply unsettling. The cinematography is hauntingly flawless.""The Witch"" is never difficult to take seriously. It is all at once a perfect historical film, a heart-breaking drama, and - above all - a blood-curdling horror film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An horror movie with gives much attention to period details,"When ""The lighthouse"" (2019, Robert Eggers) came out I intended to see also his debut film ""The witch"" (2015). When ""The lighthouse"" turned out to be a disappointment I began to doubt if I would still see ""The witch"". After all I am glad I have done it. ""The witch"", which has much in common with the Estonian film ""November"" (2017, Rainer Sarnet), is a more subdued and a better film than ""The lighthouse"".""The witch"" has been carefully made. Much effort has been put in getting the period details right. One example of this is the use of antiquated language.This attention for period details has made ""The witch"" into a multi layered film. Layer 1 has to do with the extent to which the events are shocking for the viewer. Layer 2 concerns the extent to which the events are shocking to the main characters. With respect to layer 2 one has to consider that the main characters are deeply religious people for whom there is no real difference between the natural world and the supernatural world.The fear for the devil is for them very real. Because the devil can appear in various manifestations (including taking possession of a human being), this fear gives rise to a growing sense of distrust within the family. This fear and the resulting distrust in layer 2 makes the film more tense in layer 1. One can see the same effect in science fiction films in which an alien can take on a human form. See for example ""The invasion of the body snatchers"" (1956, Don Siegel) or ""The thing"" (1982, John Carpenter).",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Excitingly Original But Aurally Challenging.,"This is a creatively fresh entry into the all too frequently cliched horror genre. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting from the small main cast, the original storyline and the historical authenticity brought to the production. However this high regard doesn't extend to the supposedly seventeenth century English dialogue spoken by the characters. I've generally got a pretty good ear for English dialects, but have to confess in this film I only understood around about 25% of what was spoken onscreen. It wasn't just the dialogue itself. It was also the rapidity and pitch with which the words were enunciated which annoyed me. I really would have preferred to be reading sub-titles and since I wasn't watching a DVD, this wasn't possible.

In my personal opinion this movie should have been labeled as a suspense because that is all it offered, watching and waiting for something horrifying and terrifyingly to happen, which never comes. I was greatly disappointed. I feel that so much more could have been done that would have made this movie so much better. The story in itself is a very tempting and drawing subject. The execution of the story was just absolutely terrible.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A future horror classic,"This ain't no Hocus Pocus kids! Witches aren't usually the first port of call when coming up with horror film ideas. They work well with family film's like Nicholas Roeg's surreal adaptation of Roald Dhal's The Witches but can cackling old women with pointy hats and broomsticks scare grown adults? After seeing Robert Egger's striking debut, the answer would seem to be a resounding yes. The Witch is the best horror film since Kill List and is sure to become a future horror classic. I like to think of myself as a hardened horror movie nut but The Witch did actually manage to scare me, more so than the recent It Follows and The Babadook.It's a fairytale for adults and Robert Egger goes down alleys as dark as a film can get. Within the first five or ten minutes, I could tell that I'd be in for a stunning ride as we're treated to some seriously nightmarish imagery involving a naked old woman smothering herself in the blood of a baby, accompanied by a screeching score which is sure to give you the shivers. Terrifying sequences like this appear sporadically through the film so it never feels overdone, it just adds to the mounting tension in each scene until it explodes into the most wonderfully indulgent finale.A lot of films set in medieval times can be a bit trying. A Field in England and Black Death both felt like the setting let the film down by getting bogged down in confusing olde worlde Shakespearean-esque language. However, The Witch is never anything more than compelling throughout. The sole focus of the film is the family and all the parts are acted beautifully by the relatively unknown cast. The audience becomes incredibly involved and invested in the characters so you care about what's going to happen to them. There's a sense of dread in every scene but you're never quite sure about what's going to happen next which makes for unpredictable and absorbing viewing.I can't talk about The Witch without mentioning just how gorgeous the film looks. You could pretty much take any shot and hang it up for display in a gallery because it's just beautiful to look at. The eerie shots of the deep wood reminded me of Lars Von Trier's equally unsettling, Antichrist, however The Witch has a more fantastical quality to the images which adds to the Brothers Grimm fairytale kind of vibe. There isn't a second in the film's tight 90 minute running time where a shot doesn't ooze atmosphere. It's so refreshing to get a horror film which doesn't rely on a few seconds of gore to shock the audience, but actually takes it time to conjure up genuinely frightening images. There's stuff in this film which won't leave my head for a long time after viewing it.Equally as atmospheric as the imagery is the sound. I can't think of a more striking score or sound design since The Shining and it helps a lot to generate such an unsettling atmosphere. The exceedingly creepy dissonant violins and loud chants build scenes up to a shattering intensity where I found myself holding my breath. In fact, the whole film has such a strange and unnerving quality to it. It feels like you're watching something you shouldn't. It's no wonder that the film's even been endorsed by the Satanic Temple itself with the Temple's spokesperson calling it ""a trans-formative Satanic experience.""The Witch has to be my favourite film of the year and one of my favourite horror films full stop. I found it absolutely captivating and full of tension from beginning to end. It's pretty much as perfect as horror can get and exudes the quality of a classic chiller from the 60's. Robert Eggers is definitely going to be a director to look out for in the future. He's proved to critics that the horror genre is alive and well and can still genuinely scare the hell out of people. The Witch is a sensational experience for the eyes and ears, it's cinema at its finest. It is a delicious masterpiece of horror.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Decent but flawed witchcraft story,"'The Witch' isn't your conventional horror film. It isn't particularly scary or gory, but it is eerie and atmospheric. The film certainly has some positives - it is very well made and it does build up tension nicely, especially towards the end. It is, however, ultimately let down by some major flaws.The first being some of the acting. Generally speaking, it's okay, but some of the younger ones are guilty of overacting in a few scenes. UK viewers may also struggle to engage with Ralph Ineson's character, given his distinctive voice which is heard in many British TV adverts. All I could think of when he spoke was Dacia cars. 'The Witch' is also very, very slow to get going. The first half of the film is on the verge of becoming boring - there's very little tension and scares are few and far between, but it does pick up.Overall, I thought 'The Witch' was decent, but it could have been a lot better. It is unique in its approach, placing a greater emphasis on the dialogue and content rather than simply the gore and scares like a lot of other horror movies. A solid but flawed horror.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the better horror films of the 2010's.,"I am really surprised by the relative low rating on here. I guess the slow pace and that the film is focused on religious doubt throws a lot of people off. To me this is archetypal tale of witchcraft and I love the film's refusal to explain anything in great detail. There is a naturalism to the acting and the setting that lends itself to this feeling like folktale handed down by the generations. The film's quite unnerving specifically because much of the details are left to the imagination. While the film is ultimately supernatural horror I found the film's treatment of a family dynamics getting frayed to more emotionally involve then the average horror film. And the father's pride getting the best of him really works as a religious message.In any case the visual lushness, especially the cinematography, of the film is rather hypnotic and the film has quiet power to it. Eggers is a really gifted director at invoking mood and atmosphere. This feels like a Puritan warning more than a modern horror film.Good film",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Woulst Thou Like To Live Deliciously?,"The Witch is an ambitious movie, it's dialogue all in Olde English, yet it does not bring home the proverbial bacon. It is nevertheless driven by a vision, it is pretty well made and puts on the radar some awesomely gifted child actors. Set in 17th century New England, it deploys the drama of a community confronted with a brave new world, left to the devices of their puritan roots to make sense of it, and eventually conquer it. Problem is, some collateral damage is unavoidable.Meet the Family, it does not have a name; they are an allegory of whatever can go wrong when America, land of the free, home of the brave, retracts into a witch hunt. McCarthy, neo-cons, whatever will happen next. Father (Ralph Ineson, whose gravelly voice is a third of the pleasure watching this movie), is banished from his community because he's too much of an integrist, even though he's a loving husband and father. He, his wife (Kate Dickie) and their five children are left to ""conquer this wilderness"" during an hostile season.Things quickly unravel from there, in a weird mix of The White Ribbon and Barry Lyndon, with some John Constable painting and a dash of Caravaggio being poured in the mix. Tomasin, the titular witch, anoints herself so to get rid of her younger siblings' annoyance and it uncoils a death trap fueled by ignorance, superstition and bigotry.Various animals intervene as God's will, or the Devil's. There is an evil hare, an even more evil raven, a hapless dog, and Black Phillip, a goat with a mellifluous voice, or so hear poor Tomasin, the unlikely heroin of the piece (Anya Taylor-Joy, wonderful). Then it goes like a country song, losing the last born, the harvest, the trust of your beloved ones, the horse, the wife, more children, your life.Everything is blamed on possibly evil, menstruating Tomasin, including the death of her brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw, nothing short of astonishing), who meets the witch, maybe, in a spooky scene with awful consequences. Everyone dies in retribution from animals associated with the Devil, but Mother, so mad by now she attempts at strangling Tomasin. ""You reek of Evil"", she yells at who was her beloved daughter a few days prior.One won't say how it ends. More ethnology than witchcraft, more puritan hysteria in the vein of The Crucible or The Devils than, say, Ouija 2, The Witch is a meticulously planned, meticulously filmed object of not so much fascination. It is quite good though, and its acting is superlative. Viewing advised.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A beautifully set horror tale that stands out among genre garbage,"This piece is close to art form when it comes to the genre of fantasy horror; the casting is perfect and the parlance accurately immersive, while the setting and the atmosphere are well crafted by light and sound. There's the lonely picture of a small colonial family holding on to their meager patch of turf and the all-consuming gospel of an indifferent ancient god, as they face a wild web of trees and shadows in the preying woods at their doorstep – while a wolf is blamed as the lurking danger and cause of sorrow, it's the very Christian witch hunt and devil-chasing within the settlers that will yield self-fulfilling rituals of rapture and sacrifice.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good but not scary 😡,I just watched this last night and I likeed it. It was dark and creepy but not as scary I thought it would be. I saw it on Netflix so it might have been tamed down a little.

Work like this takes true talent,"Let's travel back in time.... way back to the time of the settlers. Things were very different back then. Religion had a much stronger presence in society. Along with that, you had rampant paranoia of witchcraft. These two historical facts play a big role in the core plot of The Witch.The plot focuses on a family that has just been banned from a village. With nowhere else to go, they travel outside of the village and try to make it on their own. They start growing their own harvest, each member of the family doing their part in the work. They rely heavily on their very intense Christian faith. Unfortunately for them, weird things start to happen.... starting with the children.Soon it becomes clear that supernatural forces are at work around them. The only question is.... who is to blame? Paranoia plays a role here, so much so that it eventually leads everything to a breaking point.The acting in this film is some of the finest you'll see. The performances given scream talent, you can really tell that this cast was passionate about their roles. Anya Taylor-Joy blew me away as Thomasin, she really captured the emotion and depth necessary to play the role. Kate Dickie is also great here, she plays Katherine, the distraught mother. Dickie throws herself into this role and delivers a truly captivating performance. Lastly, is Ralph Ineson, who plays the extremely devout Christian father. I loved him in this role! He totally nailed it as William, portraying a confused, angry father trying desperately to understand what's happening to his family.I absolutely adore the score in this film. It's so unsettling and sets the perfect tone. That along with environment and visuals create a very chilling watching experience. What I love about films released by A24, is that they are all so raw and disturbingly realistic. If you want real horror and it's an A24 horror film, you're almost guaranteed quality. The ending is another great asset this film carries, it ends in the most chilling and unsettling way. I refuse to spoil anything, you'll just have to see for yourself.9/10 for The With.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unnerving supernatural thriller with something more clever in mind,"For the past several decades, horror fans have grown fond of horror classics such as slashers, psychological thrillers, and supernatural thrillers dealing with characters batting against paranormal entities. Only a hand of full films of the genre are successful at balancing both cohesive character and plot development while carrying on an effective scare factor, even fewer achieve this feat as effective as this thriller directed by first-time filmmaker Robert Eggers. Rather than driving audiences into to straight-forward scare fest, this film centering on witchcraft as the primary antagonist, focuses on the eerie atmosphere and construction of the plot leading up to its shocking twist in the finale. The film is set during the 1630s, decades prior to the Salem Witch Trials, a period of prosecutions and executions of men and women who were accused of witchcraft. It follows William (played by Ralph Ineson) and Catherine (played by Kate Dickle), a devout Christian couple living in a isolated countryside of New England who value leading their five children into their following with God. When their infant son Samuel mysteriously vanishes and the crops began to deteriorate, the family begins to suspect one of them is cursed with witchcraft. As their fears and suspicions mount, the family find their lives terrorized by the demonic force.This film is not the horror thriller many people come to expect, and instead has something more unique in mind rather than blowing up in your face with jump scares and sight scares that's become a common tool in many other films of this category. Relying heavily on visceral storytelling and character development, the film conveys it's scares by building up suspense through hints without feeling the need to fully reveal the occurrences but the aftermath of how the family is affected by witchcraft. When it's all done, the most of the scares come not from what the viewers know but what they don't know, along with an eerie, hair-raising music score by Mark Korven and a few shots of grim imagery. For most of the time, it's quite effective. Now the film moves at a fairly slow pace which is enough to bore those who lack patience, but in the end what results is creepy and intensely thought- provoking experience filled with engrossing performances by Ralph Enison, Kate Dickie, and Anya Taylor-Joy who plays the eldest daughter. Even the younger children make advantage of their time to shine. As Christianity and witchcraft play prominent roles in the story, the film moves in profound directions that demands you for questions. The biggest mistake this film makes is assuming you have expert knowledge on witchcraft. Though the film succeeds on provoking thoughts in viewers, it occasionally falls victim into convoluted elements raft are either confusing or overly ambiguous, maybe both. There are plenty of scenes you leave scratching heads. At the same time, there is plenty of shock and creepiness, particularly the ending.The Witch is both a creepy and deeply visceral experience uprooted by an intelligent direction by Robert Eggers. Though it has some flaws, this film works at a fairly solid level and by the next decade, has a fair potential of going down as a cult classic. It is a unique experience that values more thought-provoking themes than typical jump scares, and by the end, it's a thriller that demands for your attention, even if it doesn't attract those looking for a straight forward scare fest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Family Torn Apart,"Paranoia tears apart a superstitious and devoutly religious seventeenth century family in this unusual horror movie that debuted to considerable acclaim at Sundance. The film's most striking aspect is the attention to period detail; not only are the sets and costumes authentic, everyone also converses in Old English with appropriate vernacular, which helps to capture the flavour of the times. The film additionally benefits from a superb lead performance by Anya Taylor- Joy as the eldest daughter whose parents and siblings gradually begin to suspect of witchcraft as she undergoes adolescent changes. The less said about the actors playing her siblings the better though and the film's attempts at authenticity are sadly compromised by the washed- out visual approach with so many greys and blues favoured that the style calls attention to itself. The project also narrowly misses the mark for psychological horror. It is, after all, made quite clear that something sinister and malevolent is in the midst, giving little room to question whether it is all in their minds, onset by religious paranoia. That said, there is much to like in the notion that religious fanaticism further drives the family apart and causes them to distrust one another rather than bond together to combat the evil around them. The ending, if a tad overly literal, is highly memorable too and the film certain leaves much to ponder over. 'The VVitch' may not be all that it could have possibly been, but it is quite understandable why it has amassed such a following in this era of highly recycled horror movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Witch (9/10),"The Witch is set in New England during the early European settlement period of America in the 1600's. The dialogue of the film was too written well considering the dialect people spoke back then. At one point the English subtitles had to be turned on just to properly follow some of the things the characters were saying. The characters with the tough script really pulled off this horror film with high emotions and uncertainty of faith, something obviously very important to people back then. The atmosphere of the film was very hopeless right from the get-go creating uneasiness and a somber mood. The film steadily gets better and more disturbing, leaving the viewer mystified to many different aspects of the story-line. The Witch is very much a psychological horror building up to the climax, which had a fantastic pay-off. The ending is very chilling with a couple memorable scenes and bits of dialogue.

'The Witch' proves low-budget scares are still possible,"It's rare these days that we see the hysteria and fear that gripped 17th century New England captured on the big screen, but the low-budget 'The Witch' does so in a way that is simple yet chilling.The story follows a devout family of seven who settle in the wilderness of Massachusetts just in time for things to fall apart. A series of unfortunate events ensue shortly after they take up residence, including the disappearance of the youngest family member (a baby boy), infighting among multiple family members and accusations of deceit and witchcraft. Of course, the latter is what drives the majority of the film, as the young children Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Granger and Lucas Dawson) accuse their eldest sister Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) of the act. Taylor-Joy dominates with her performance, which is not an easy feat considering the film is so depending on acting compared with other elements.One way 'Witch' succeeds is it is not overt or over the top in what it shows (at least, for the most part). Most of what gives the audience chills is not seen on screen, but it instead implied. Although, the use of devices such as the family's black billy goat is a creative way to send shivers down spines. Another aspect that works well is the gray scale filming style that's used. The coolness of the color used conveys the damp, dark atmosphere and harshness of the environment in an effective way.To be sure, there are a good deal of disturbing parts in 'Witch.' Some of the scenes are difficult to watch, but again, a lot more is hinted at than is actually shown. Near the film's finale, things unwind at a rapid rate, but this is the culmination of a slow build to the climax.'The Witch' is not a masterpiece, nor is it one of the more memorable films of its kind to come out in the past few years. But it's a good example of how low-budget efforts can find an audience and rival their much more sophisticated, pricey peers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Whatever you make of it,"Making it his debut, the film is written and directed by Robert Eggers as it tells the story of a highly religious family in the 17th century of New England. After being apparently banished from their village, they begin their lives on a farm, where as mysterious things start to acre. The film introduces us to Anya Taylor-Joy as she gives a fine performance as the eldest daughter, Thomasin. It also stars Ralph Ineson who is terrific as the father, William, and Kate Dickie (whom you may recall from Game of Thrones) as the mother, Katherine.Except for maybe a couple things, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when viewing this. But right after doing just that, I will say that this is the scariest, most disturbing film I have ever seen; not in my life, but certainly this year. I will say, however, that there are in fact flaws. The first few minutes of the film are slow, yes, and the dialogue throughout his difficult to understand most of the time. But with that said, there are few to many disturbing and instance scenes; more specifically, a lot of WTF? Moments. As for my verdict, this may not be for everybody, but I highly recommend giving it a try.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Three Great Performances and One Director to Watch For,"One of the best aspects about horror movies is their unbridled creativity. Large studios have made it their business to corner the market on large tent-pole blockbusters, goofy comedies and stereotypical biographical dramas. There are only so many ways to make an audience laugh or manipulate them into tears; there are virtually unlimited ways to disturb them. For that reason horror lives largely in the realm of independent cinema where any young person with a dream and a vision can become the next Sam Raimi or Peter Jackson. Robert Eggers, director of The Witch seems to be aiming even higher.The Witch opens with William (Ineson) and his family leaving a Puritan plantation in New World, New England. Banished from the safety of the plantation, the family builds a humble cottage near the woods and struggle to make an ample harvest for the winter. Katherine (Dickie), William's wife fears death while the children begin to fear something much more nefarious hiding in the woods. This fear is planted when the youngest of the children, the infant Samuel is taken while in the care of the eldest daughter Thomasin (Taylor-Joy). After a series of incidences and misfortunes, the family begins to suspect Thomasin has dabbled in witchcraft.Robert Eggers drains the film of all of the predictable jump-scares and needing stock characters that populate most horror films, and instead loads his story with elaborate period detail and an overwhelming sense of dread. Each tableau masterfully evokes the stunning compositional techniques of Andrei Tarkovsky and to a lesser extent Carl Theodor Dreyer. His wide shots are alienating and contemplating while his closeups are symmetrical and solemn. Only the editing of Louise Ford and crew hints at a modern sensibility, everything else is remarkably old-school. Most audiences accustomed to the average schlock-horror may find this film far too pensive to endure. Especially given the fact everyone speaks appropriately for the time period.This is a shame too, because when this slow-boiling fright reaches its climax the pace only adds to the horror and shock. The constrained William and his family become victims of hysteria constantly looking for the grace of God when there is only deceit, hypocrisy, fear and the woods. Every single cast member is uncommonly committed to this film. Every once in a while there comes a film that graces us with one singularly brilliant performance. The Witch rewards us with three stars in the making; Anya Taylor-Joy, Kate Dickie and Harvey Scrimshaw who plays Thomasin's younger brother.The Witch joins the recent crop of decent horror films that seep into the mind, provide interesting characters and make monsters out of intricate details. The Conjuring (2013), The Babadook (2014), Oculus (2013) and A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) all build their horror on a foundation of dread and suspense instead of butchery and chaos. This is not to say The Witch isn't bloody; it is. Yet the primary goal here is not to disgust but to disturb in a way that makes you leave the theater with an unnerving shiver. If you're feeling brave and are incensed by the eerie The Witch will certainly leave a strong impression.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Best Horror Film of 2016,The Witch is one of the best horror films of 2016. This is a film that you'll either love it or hate it. I'm one of those people that loved this film. The film is creepy but not really scary. What's creepy about this film is the atmosphere and the musical score. What was scary about the film was the haunting imagery. The acting for the film is phenomenal everyone does a great job. When I was watching this film it felt like I was in the 1600's. Whoever did the set designs and the costumes all deserve an Oscar nomination. The directing for this film by Robert Eggers did a fantastic job for his directorial debut and I can't wait to see what he does next. There were a couple problems that I had with the film but they're only minor ones. The pacing of the film does have a couple slow parts and the language that the characters speak is hard to understand but later on in the film you start to have a better understanding of what they are saying. A lot of people didn't like the ending but I thought it was a good ending and I will be remembering that last shot for awhile. Overall if you're a fan of these art house horror films then this is for you.

Bracingly Original Debut From Director Robert Eggers.,"I am not at all surprised by all the buzz (positive and negative) that THE WITCH has received. It is not at all what the trailers would lead you to believe. Instead of a 17th century BLAIR WITCH PROJECT or the standard jump cut, sound cue, blood bath that constitutes most horror movies today, it is a poetic meditation on what 17th century people believed witches were capable of. In that sense it recalls a Swedish silent film from 1922 called HAXAN (The Witches) which explores legends of witchcraft from Medieval times through the present day (ca.1922). The subtitle ""A New England Folk Tale"" is accurate and appropriate as, even though it unfolds in real time, it tells the story of what happened to one 17th century family who were exiled (ban-ish-ed) from their community for being overzealous.The re-creation of a 17th century setting complete with costumes, settings, and characters speaking King James English was remarkably well done. The performances by all the actors were all spot on. Utilizing little known performers helped to enforce the illusion that these were real people that we, the audience, happened to time travel back to. The cinematography was stunning and the disturbing, period sounding score was remarkably effective enhancing the doom laden atmosphere of the surroundings and the story being told. Special mention should be given to two performers whose characters are deeply affected by what happens to them. They are Kate Dickie as the mother and especially Harvey Scrinshaw (great name!) as the oldest son Caleb.First time feature director Robert Eggers also wrote the original and disturbing screenplay. A lot of it seems taken from an anthology of witchcraft folklore called WITCHES, WRAITHS & WARLOCKS by Peter Haining which reproduces folk tales from England & New England. It is also written in archaic King James English,which makes it hard to understand. Fortunately the DVD/Blu-Ray comes equipped with subtitles so that you can fully understand what you are hearing. It helps to clarify not only what the actors are saying but what is going plotwise. THE WITCH is certainly not for your average horror film fan but for a more demanding audience that is willing to spend time with it and let it develop. When the big payoff finally comes, it is worth hanging around for. All in all, a remarkable effort which I'll be revisiting from time to time...For more reviews visit The Capsule Critic.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Photography - Stunningly well done,"I'm reviewing this only 28 minutes into it and I have paused many a time to absorb the imagery. The director is either a master photographer or has one at his disposal.With period pieces such as this, setting the mood is all important. Given the nature of the plot a dark foreboding presence is requisite.

"If it weren't for the offensive content, this might have been one of the best films of the year","The creepy atmosphere was first rate and the performance by Anya Taylor Joy was outstanding, but unfortunately the script was utterly tasteless. There was certainly a mass hysteria promoted by Christian fanaticism in the colonial period and many innocent people were murdered because of it. I'm sickened by the direction that this film takes because rather than creating a horror film that explores how twisted and demented people of the time were and then gruesomely illustrating their terminal descent into madness, the film actually gives credence to their fanaticism by making their fears into reality. And to make the point, I'm not against supernatural elements in storytelling, in fact it's one of my favorite themes, but depicting women, animals and forests as wicked and depraved things to be scared of is completely unacceptable.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Pretentious without substance,"This movie tries hard to be high-brow but ends up pretentious. It's definitely not scary. Anya Taylor-Joy is mildly talented, and I've liked her in a couple of movies, but other movies have sucked. The dialog in this one is a petty stab at sounding eloquent but is mostly washed up with religious references. I recently watched the entire Deadwood series and thought the idea of having a period piece have good dialog was promising but was wrong with this one. Thy hath smited too much. The first scenes of the witch killing the baby also seemed promising with gore and effects, but it was a letdown when the entire movie revolved around the family arguing. All of the smaller children were pretty annoying, and so was the mother. The film claims to be derived from folklores, but none of it is based in reality, which is another misleading part about it.

The Witch slowly engraves its illustrious witchcraft into your mind.,"Not the first time I've watched this slow burner, and quite controversially I did not enjoy it. A couple of years fly by (faster than an old hag on a broom, might I add) and the film community ever increase their adoration for this horror. Did I miss something on my original viewing? Turns out, I did. A separatist family are banished over a religious dispute and encounter evil forces in the woods that seclude their New England farm. Surreal imagery provokes the inevitable question of ""is it real or imagined?"", and Eggers' directorial debut opens an ominous window into a period horror that transcends its own art form. Accompanied by Blaschke's stunning cinematography, Eggers directs you gently through this New England folk tale that, whilst not genuinely scary, provides a thick layer of uneasy atmosphere. The biggest complaint that is commonly thrown around is how ""boring"" it is. I implore you to grant this beauty another viewing. The pace, particularly during the first and third act, was consistent and well constructed. Balancing a thematic narrative that perhaps hosts too many metaphors, with illusory imagery that enhances the chilling tension that is substantially more effective thanks to Korven's score. No, I suspect the largest hurdle to bypass is the dialogue. Utilising a more unconventional 17th century dialect that, whilst feels freshly authentic, hinders character investment. It's difficult to quantify this choice as a detriment or a blessing. It does visualise the hysteria that culminates from devout Christians, and the fear of sin or corruption if individuals stray too far from the word of God. But due to Ineson's deep voice and Dickie's heavy accent, it is more often than not difficult to fully comprehend the dialogue. Fantastic performances though, but it just somewhat loses its edge with the dialect. I'm still indifferent about the ending, doesn't feel satisfying enough with its ambiguity. Still, I have to say that this is a gorgeous supernatural period drama that perhaps is too unconventional for most audiences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Masterfully crafted, wholly original, profoundly moving and utterly terrifying","This is truly the greatest horror film of the 21st century.

Robert Eggers displays a powerhouse of technical filmmaking precision and masterful writing. The actors are incredible and the music is unforgettable.

Misleading title and way too slow,"Despite the movie title this film had not that much to do with the actual witch. The witch only made three appearances throughout the entire movie (and all of them have been rather short in nature). For a movie titled ""The Witch"" this is not acceptable. Furthermore the movie doesn't really tell the story of the witch but rather focuses on a secluded/exiled family which also happens to be highly dysfunctional. And when I say dysfunctional I mean it. They are constantly bickering about the most trivial matters and accusing each other of witchcraft. It was quite honestly one of the most boring movies I've ever watched (considering that I've watched well over 600 movies so far that's supposed to mean something, I reckon). I definitely wouldn't recommend it.From a storyteller's perspective the movie doesn't have much to offer either. The witch is ""evil"" for no apparent reason ergo is evil for the sake of being evil (which is a storytelling no-go of the highest order, in case you didn't know). I had really high hopes for the movie because of the trailer. Much to my dismay the trailer ended up being better than the actual movie itself.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A beautiful experience and it gets the simple yet important things right. But not so much as a scary horror thriller.,"Horror is a genre that has a defined scope which is governed by certain rules based on society's understanding of how ghosts/demons/spirits/'witches' etc function. While believers treat it as a social drama, others do so as a fantasy. So it is very important for the makers to have enough clarity on who their target audience are. In the recent times the makers have mostly catered to the latter audience dealing these stories as fantasies where these unnatural forces have the capability to control the technology (read 'Unfriended' or 'The Ring' series) which is fun to watch sometimes when done good.'The Witch' goes back to the roots of orthodox methodology of film making in horror genre which is thus far so overdone that it is difficult to present in a way that attracts audience attention. Director Robert Eggers does overcome this challenge with a tight script, suitable cast and going to a period (mid 17th century) when witches and witch hunting is still a norm in that part of the world. Right from the first frame, it draws you into that period, into their family, into their beliefs, into their conflicts. Once the connect is established, it plays around with its smart twists, whodunit mystery and creepy background score where you are forced to invest your emotions but not sure where.William (Ralph Ineson) is a righteous believer in spreading the Holy word and that is the purpose of his arrival in America with the pilgrims. He feels cheated and confronts the society when he finds a changed agenda which gets him banished from the village along with his family comprising of his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), elder daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), young twins and a toddler. When they settle in a plain near the forest, things go south when their toddler disappears from the hands of Thomasin followed by Caleb's abduction in the forest. When Caleb dies, each family member starts blaming each other and that builds up a certain disgust and mistrust among themselves leading to painful confrontations.It takes a while to settle into and start understanding the period diaglogue, but that adds a little freshness into an otherwise simple story. There is also a huge variation in the character arcs and their performances - for example Kate Dickie plays a depressing character who goes all melodramatic, while Harvey Scrimshaw and Ralph Ineson gives a textbook stage performance. The twins are cute and high-spirited while Anya Taylor-Joy gives a rather subtle contemporary performance. Though the background score gets a little intrusive at the beginning, it settles down well and starts being effective and plays an important role along the way. The whodunit thread may not be a driving factor, but it adds to the mix of things. There could have been more scary thrills to give it a bit more mass appeal and some scenes could have been squeezed a bit more to generate the necessary edginess.A beautiful experience and it gets the simple yet important things right. But not so much as a scary horror thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
More drama than horror but still worth a watch.,"I've been looking forward to seeing this movie as I'm a huge horror fan but after watching it I'm a little bit disappointed by the lack of actual scares in the film. In all other aspects it's really well crafted; the cinematography is stunning, the acting is great and the authenticity of the time period is impressive. I liked the storyline but I found the execution a little bit confusing. The witch is shown at the start of the film dispelling any mystery and what follows is mostly a psychological drama following the family of the story as they question the bizarre occurrences that are unfolding due to the witch's magic. The dialogue is in old English but still easy to follow, the actors do a wonderful job of delivering the lines and getting into character. I thought the direction was good but I did wish it was actually scary rather than, in my opinion, mostly just being creepy and atmospheric. I wanted something more terrifying or bizarre but in the end it was, bar a couple of occasions, quite restrained even when depicting mystical goings-on. I thought the imagery could have been heightened but it's all very realistic which struck me as an odd choice, I just felt that it could have had a little bit more to it. I would definitely recommend checking this out as it has some good moments and a very rich moody atmosphere but don't expect to be blown away or particularly scared.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Thy movie suffers as thine ending sucketh..,"First things first. Without doubt, one of THE best opening scenes introducing the ""big bad"" (the Witch) and setting the tone for a horror movie. Hell, the movie is worth seeing just for the introduction the Witch gets.Now comes the part where the movie messes it up. It takes way too long showing an uninteresting puritan family's daily banter, which you most likely will have trouble understanding because thy speech is olde and rotten.Which means that you have to listen to them pray every time somebody drops the spoon or thinks they sinned or something (which is pretty much all the time). It added to the charm at first, but after half an hour, it got old and annoying.But the movie has another trick up its sleeves. The forest. That's right, the movie starts with the foreboding forest as the backdrop for the puritan family and presents it as a dark entity where only evil lives (why anyone would want to build a home next to it is a mystery, I sure wouldn't, I've seen Blair Witch :P). The scenes which are shot inside the forest are really well done with creepiness meter definitely on the edge constantly.Now comes the part where movie decides to ruin it all, again, but showing the typical moronic ending the movies with witches have. Manages to kill any suspense anything the viewer might have imagined, by showing a generic portrayal of witches. I know they were trying to be authentic to the beliefs of the people at the time, but they REALLY could've used something original and creepy. I am trying to avoid mentioning anything that would give the ending away, that's why this para is vague.I took of two points just cause of the last 10-15 mins which basically ruins any suspense or hope you had built up till then.BUT, is it a must watch movie? I didn't get scared, I only find psychological horror (Blair Witch) scary and this movie is not a psychological horror movie. In-fact, it shows you the monster in the beginning and avoids jump scares (there are only few and they are toned down as well) religiously. What this movie does well is the creepy atmosphere, which I haven't seen done since I saw Blair Witch as a kid one sunny afternoon.So yes, it's a movie you should definitely watch, despite my 6/10 rating.

Codswallop!!,I went to see this today on the recommendation of some film critics. This film was so horrid I thought I was having a flashback to the bad old days of Ed Wood. In fact Plan 9 From Outer Space was much more enjoyable to watch. The first 15 minutes was quite good but after that it was all downhill. The lack of suspense and aimless direction had me bored out of my brain. I was hoping by the end of the film that there would be a good old witch burning at the stake to liven things up a bit.

"Resting between horror and drama, this folk-take is ominous and unsettling in its own strange, almost mundane way.","Resting somewhere between horror and drama, this period-piece folk-tale is difficult to categorise and even harder to describe. 'The Witch (2016)' is incredibly subdued throughout, its ominous tone helped by a uniquely grandiose score. As such, it only barely holds your attention while it plays to a mundanity of the time and lifestyle its characters occupy. There's a sense of tension building in the background, though, and the off-kilter moments that stand-out are certainly quite unsettling in their own strange way. However, the ambiguity tips over into the oddly overt in a bizarre final scene that, while compelling, has no ramifications other than serving as an abruptly over-the-top end to an otherwise subtle story. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Finally something fresh in the horror genre,"You probably know already that The VVitch is not like the many formulaic horror films out there, with jumpscares and other clichés.I am not a fan of morror films, mostly because I am easily scared, but this one is fantastic and for my taste. I was not scared during the movie, I saw it during daytime, so this made things easier, watching it at night would not do me good. The beauty of this film is, for me, the atmosphere, taking place in the XVII century, packed with many thee and thou, with a religious puritan family, and the psychological horror, you don't if what you see is something supernatural or not, until the last thirty minutes obviously. Some scenes are disturbing, yet subtle, I think, and this is why I loved this film. I liked all the characters, most of them were used in the best way possible, didn't like the twins. Anya-Taylor Joy and Ralph Ineson, his voice suited perfectly with the film concept, were great here. The disturbing aspect, the tension, the moments that were unsettling, the build-up, everything here is great. The costume design, the production design, the soundtrack, the cinematography here, it is perfect, and looks like the film was shot during the 17th century, it was so emmersive, at least for me, I am a history fanboy so the experience was amazing.Oh, and Black Phillip.

A solid horror movie (without jump scares!),"The Witch is one of those rare horror films that pop up every few years, which are genuinely well-crafted pieces of work. One illustration of this is that it does not rely on jump scares like most horror films. Instead it relies on an increasing sense of dread to create its horror, combined with strange and unsettling imagery.The film looks great. The colours are dull, and the New England forest setting is bleak and desolate. Perfect for a horror film set in the 15th century. The film's sound is also a standout, in particular the music. I don't know what the composition of instruments was, but it fitted the film perfectly. (One thing I found annoying however, was the dialogue, which in parts was difficult to understand.)Unfortunately the story lets The Witch down. Even though I didn't watch the trailer or know much about the film, I was unsurprised by what occurred in the film, from about 1/3 into it. I find predictable stories, especially in horror films, boring to watch. Fortunately the execution of the story in The Witch is great, but it doesn't quite mitigate this problem.In terms of casting, I think the stand-out here is Harvey Scrimshaw, who plays a young boy called Caleb. He has several key scenes and he nails every one of them. The other is Ralph Ineson as William, who seems a shoe-in for a Game of Thrones role at some point.Overall, I recommend this to any horror film fan -- you will definitely enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

enough to make your skin crawl,"The Witch offers up an oppresively freaky folktale that still manages to go for broke with demented and disturbing stuff, whilst still keeping it moody and reined in in equal measure, walking an admirable tightrope with style on one side, substance on the other. The substance lies in the interpersonal relationships between a hapless New England pioneer family trying to hack it alone in the land, living next to a deep dark forest that serves home to the titular cretin, plaguing their existence at every turn. The style lies in that forest, as well as a musical score that will shake your bones up and then some, accenting a tale of religious dread, insidious distrust and primal paranoia in a time before reason had grasped humanity, it seems. Plus there's a big scary goat called Black Philip who seems sentient, which was enough to give me the creepin willies. The family is booted from a plantation for some vague religious politics involving the haughty patriarch (Ralph Ineson is excellently fervent and riled up). Tryon to start a homestead on their own proves to be one nightmare after another out there though, especially when virginal daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor Joy, a striking beauty) loses the young baby during a split second game of peekaboo on the outskirts of the forest. Things go depressingly downhill from there as the collective sanity of this clan starts to evaporate into feverish mania, while the woods and the witch constantly loom over everything. The dialogue is all period specific which helps with authenticity, and as far as atmosphere goes, you practically drown in it, quite an achievement really. I took quite a long time in getting to see this, and I didn't quite expect then level of literal horror on display. I was thinking it'd be more unseen, metaphorical, slow paced. It really does mean witch though, as well as that nasty damn goat. You'll watch your back at the petting zoo after sitting through this one. Well done.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A masterpiece that isn't for everyone,"The Witch is an amazing atmospheric horror film, I'm reluctant to call it a horror as it's mostly a drama but there's always a sense of unease so I think it does slot into the horror category overall.The plot is not mainstream Hollywood at all, it's quite slow moving which may put people of if they're expecting quick action, scares and gore, it's best described as a slow burn. It involves themes of religion, isolation and, to a lesser degree, lack of finances.The acting was phenomenal, Anya Taylor-Joy was brilliant as the naïve but determined daughter and the hugely underrated actor Ralph Ineson was convincing as the stoic and hardworking William (the Father). Also notable is Kate Dickie as the mother and Harvey Scrimshaw as Thomasin's little brother Caleb.Cinematography is another strong point, the colour schemes are used extremely sparingly and skilfully, not quite being black and white but not dashed with so much colour as to lose the film's tone.

"If you're a true horror fan, you have got to watch THE WITCH","A cinematic achievement in horror. THE WITCH is superbly crafted. Writer/director Robert Eggers has given us the perfect blend of psychological and supernatural thrill that will terrify you to your core. You'll never stop talking about THE WITCH long after it's done.A family in 1630s New England was banished from their settlement, and so the couple and their five children are out living in the wilderness, struggling to survive. Faith is the only thing that keeps them together. But their newborn son mysteriously vanishes and their crops fail, and the family begins to turn on one another, as they are torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.What's brilliant about THE WITCH, on top of its excellent attempt on trying to be accurate to the period it portrays, is that it's very different from any of the other horror movies we get out there. No jump scares, no cheap gimmicks, no pointless plot. Everything is built up to lead you to creepy and unnerving discomfort and much of it also reminds me of dark paranoia thrillers of the '70s, where there are plenty of suspicions and blame to go around. Writer/director Robert Eggers successfully messes with his characters' and the audiences' minds. In addition to that, great choice on using the olde English mixed with excellent costume design and chilling cinematography, and young talent Anya Taylor-Joy is a revelation, THE WITCH gives a unique and refreshing take on this genre.

"Not what i was expecting, but OK movie overall","Greetings from Lithuania.""The VVitch"" (2015) is kinda disappointing flick to start with. It has a very good premise, settings are good, and overall tone was nice, as well as acting by all involved. But the thing that disappointed me was not the very clear narrative. I love when horror movies plays with you straight, like ""The Conjuring"" or (my favorite ever) ""The Exorcist"", but ""The VVitch"" is another type of horror film. It doesn't show you things straight, and i'm not sure that i understood the ending well. I messes with you, but at the end it doesn't have this ""punch line"", it's more like a mystery movie then a really horror film.Overall, ""The VVitch"" is OK movie, not a mainstream horror picture by any means, so if you like to watch some good creepy horror movie alone by in the late night, it will do it's job in terms of overall tone, but as a horror movie it's a miss. Still, OK movie but not a horror movie experience i was looking for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"God, Devil, Psychological Terror","We all have our vices and hot-buttons. In the horror genre, I find the most fertile ground remains the push and pull between God and the Devil.It's also the most challenging and ambitious field to plough, as films such as The Exorcist and The Omen have commanded top billing in this pantheon for a half-century and counting.Imagine, then, the thrilling shock of discovering the film The Witch toying with the idea of competing with those cornerstone films on their own turf. Beautifully shot with coldness to the cinematography that perfectly suits the harrowing subject matter, this is a claustrophobic film in which feel isolated and cornered despite taking place in the middle of nature. We feel the mounting terror of the characters; a natural reaction, surely, when Beelzebub is systematically and incrementally messing with you as he closes in, and just because. This is nothing short of one of the greatest horror films made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not your typical everyday horror movie,"The Witch is a very different type of horror. I'm saying this now, NOT EVERYONE WILL LIKE THIS FILM! In a world where we're used to films that rely heavily on jumpscares, The Witch goes on a more psychological route where it doesn't use any of the modern-day horror tricks like loud noises or jumpscares. This is what makes it very conflicting for the audience. For me, I found this technique highly effective.As a huge fan of the horror genre, I haven't seen a horror film which is so capable and insanely crafted like The Witch. This is the writer-director Robert Eggers' first feature film and I could tell he has a lot of talent. Each and every shot is handled so meticulously that I'm surprised that this is Eggers' first movie. Eggers really cares about this project. From the colour scheme, the costumes, the lighting to the atmosphere. All of this became so important to make the audience feel like they're in the 1630s. The attention to detail fully immersed me to this world. The decision to make everyone speak in the Old English language further enhanced the realism and brought you even closer to the characters and atmosphere.The acting by everyone involved was perfect. The way everyone spoke and emoted felt so real and so believable. Each performance was strong and felt like this was a real family. This aided me into believing all the events that take place over these 90 minutes. The script is thought-provoking and requires the audience's full attention to understand what's happening. A core element in a horror movie is the music. The Witch has such an uneasy and terrifying background score that adds to the atmosphere.I loved the way the makers portrayed the Witch in this film. Despite not showing the Witch much, you still sense its presence terrorising the family allowing the film to become more unsettling. The only problem I have with the film is its pacing. I felt it was a bit too slow. However, the film's harrowing atmosphere and characters made this feel like an experience like no other.As a debut, I have immense praise for Robert Eggers' take on the horror genre and look forward to his future projects. As mentioned before, The Witch isn't for everyone. This movie is made for horror and film lovers who appreciate the craft that goes into creating a movie as well as understand what true horror is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Enjoyable enough but not as great as most say it is,"Banished into the wilderness from their homestead, a Puritan family living in a remote cottage are shocked when their baby's disappearance leads to further misfortune as the paranoia that fuels their lives are soon found to be caused by a malicious figure targeting them, and must find a way of stopping it.There was quite a lot to like with this one. Among the more prominent aspects here is the strong storyline that manages to offer up a dark and chilling atmosphere throughout here. Not only is the period setting put to splendid use by getting people out into the wilderness full of superstition and ignorance, but the idea of the family on their own in this situation offers quite a lot to really enjoy. Even though their child's disappearance is a grave incident that rightfully and emphatically disrupts their lives, that we still see them carrying on with setting traps, harvesting their crops, and going about their lives with a sense of distrust and disbelief in religion that wholly affects them. That manages to work its way quite nicely through the film with the tragedies that are shown to occur here. From the seemingly innocent, including the misadventures while hunting to the strange animal attacks at their house and finally the strange disappearances that soon befall them, this starts setting an ominous tone of something playing games with them in the woods surrounding the family. As this goes on and the incidents start to point towards the daughter being the culprit, the feverish intensity that brings upon the graphic action in the finale as everything gets twisted around into a rather shocking and conceptually terrifying conclusion. Overall, these factors are enough to make this one quite enjoyable There are some generally detrimental factors that hold this one down though. The biggest issue affecting this one is the highly underwhelming tempo and pace that this plays at. There's not much in the way of energy or momentum gathered in this one, which is by design due to the period setting but also the lethargic and sluggish way this carries on once the family's started to be affected. The lack of action and main focus on the family trying to put the stress of the situation onto something other than each other features rather uninteresting elements including their useless quarrels or inability to see past their religious fervor to the plain truth. This also points to the other big factor in the film which is the highly obvious lack of physical presence by the witch throughout here. Rather than getting plenty of screentime casting spells or putting in an appearance to set things in motion, this one only has two brief sequences with the titular being until the final minutes and neither of them is genuinely scary or tense. That ends up leaving this one with an inordinately long time with nothing much happening beyond the family strife and paranoia-filled delusions at the center of the storyline and can lead to a rather full experience. These factors are what hold this one down the most overall.Rated R: Language, Violence, Full Nudity, and violence-against-children.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Funny Farm,"William and his family have to find a place to live after they are banished by the elders, and find a spot in the New England wilderness at the edge of a forest. Little do they know that the forest is inhabited by a witch (what are the odds, huh?). Anyway, strange things happen in and around the farm. Since they are Puritans they can't figure out what could be wrong, since they are extremely religious and obey God's commandments. So they search for an answer.""The Witch"" is well acted and pays great attention to detail, and to outward appearances recreates life on an early 17th century farm. The family's speech is sprinkled with 'thee's' and 'thou's', and, although the film is in color, it is washed out to lend the feeling of austerity and adds to the bleakness of the landscape. I thought Kate Dickie, who plays the mother of the piece was outstanding. Not sure if they give Oscar noms to actors in indies of this type, but if so, she would qualify. I also wonder if life on a 17th century farm was as lethargic as depicted here.""The Witch"" is more of a melodrama than a horror film but there are a few scary moments. Speaking for myself, I get tired of trying to connect the dots of this type of movie, where you must chalk up natural aberrations and illogical circumstances to The Supernatural. The picture contains the usual defiance of reason which has no explanation except whatever you assign to it. And so you make a colossal effort to suspend your disbelief to make it all work.

A brilliant terrifying horror film that'll chill you to the bone,"Really great horror films doesn't come around too often. I read a little about The Witch for about a year ago and was immediately interested in the story. It seemed so simple and disturbing, a British family in the 17th century that has traveled to America in hope of finding happiness and success. Not agreeing with the local church, they leave the village they've been living in, to move out to the country and build their own house. Once they are settled in, strange things begin to happen and it seems that someone in the family is more than a human being. Relatively unknown actors and a feature film debut for director Robert Eggers.Witches on film have been portrayed before, like The Blair Witch Project. It is something disturbing and brutal about witches, especially if you think about our own history here in Sweden where we for a long time burned women believed to be witches. The Witch is a drama horror film that doesn't rush its introduction. A lot of the story is created from the mood and the music. Instead of telling the story and explaining things through dialogue, Eggers lets the music and the cinematography speak for themselves. Sometimes the camera sweeps around the forest with creepy music playing in the background. Also religion plays a big part in the film. God and the belief in him, is always there and gets even worse when the family thinks they've been cursed. To make it even more realistic and believable, the dialogue is written in old English taken directly from old real writings from the same time.

One of the Best Horrors of 21st Century,"Writer-Director Robert Eggers' debut film The Witch redefines horror filmmaking. It is not that scary and there is no gore but the atmosphere he creates for the film is so tense that you keep thinking something macabre is going to happen. That, in my opinion, is an achievement. The meaning of Horror has changed over time. Earlier, we had films like Rosemary's Baby, Suspiria and The Shinning which relied heavily on the atmosphere, music, and story rather than monsters behind the closets. But nowadays, almost every single horror film relies on cheap tricks to scare the audience which may or may not be good depending on who you ask it to. These movies are so frantic and desperate to scare the audience that they don't focus on the other elements of the film. Sometimes, it may be effective but most of the time, it isn't. It has become old, cliched and predictable. The most important aspect of a film is storytelling, and if you fail at that, if you sacrifice that, then there's no point in making a film. Fortunately, we have seen some brave attempts in the last few years from some passionate filmmakers. The Babadook, it Follows, and, The Cabin in the Woods were amazing films that were not completely hollow and bereft of emotions. The Witch is another such gem from A24.Based on the Salem Witch trials which took place in the early 17th century, The Witch tells the story of a Puritan family. They (Husband, Wife and Five Children including an infant) are banished from their village over some disagreement with the community. They decide to live at the edge of the Woods thinking of it as a gift from the God, only to find themselves the target of an unnerving terror that lays in the woods. Soon, their infant disappears and things take an ugly turn. Once is starts terrorizing them, they can't make heads and tails of it. Weird things start happening in the midst of this paranoia, the family members turn on each other. Is it the work of a Witch? Are they being hunted by the Devil? Is the God punishing them?Reviewing a film like this is very difficult. Most of the people won't like it because it sells itself as horror and people are going to be disappointed as there isn't much horror in the film, at least not in the way people expect. That is the reason it is rated 6.8 on IMDb whereas the RottenTomatoes ratings are at 91%. People don't like slow movies (most of them). They expect something to happen every second so that they can keep devouring their popcorn. The Witch is completely opposite of that. It will be loved by those who see filmmaking as an expression of art and not just mere entertainment. The Witch excels at technical things and it gets most of the things right. The atmosphere in this film is creepy. I have never seen anything like that in any other horror film.The cinematography is gorgeous. Every frame has been crafted with great precision to aid in building the atmosphere. Some shots are long and the camera keeps zooming in, which kind of makes you feel uncomfortable and uneasy. The camera does not make any sudden movements, it moves slowly, zooming in, zooming out, immersing you in this whole madness. The greyish color grading makes everything look lifeless and bleak, which adds to the horror element. The shots in the woods often include the actors at the bottom half so the trees look enormous, symbolizing how insignificant and helpless the family really is. The walks in the woods make up for some really tense moments.In one of the early shots, the camera shows the family sitting on the ground and praying. They think their prayers have been answered and they have found a perfect place to settle down. Then the camera keeps zooming in towards the woods before fading into black, almost soaking you in this inevitable dread and hysteria that follows. It's scenes like this that make The Witch an absolute joy to watch.Some choices are very interesting and thoughtful. During one of the scenes, we see Thomasin (Anya Taylor Joy) and her brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshow) sitting near a pond. This scene serves two purposes. It shows that there is a pond/creek nearby where they get their water from. It also tells you more about the story. I can't spoil what happens during this scene but it is there for a reason. Also, look at the color grading and how grey things look.The night scenes are filmed with the minimal use of artificial lights. Most of the time, candles are used and the scenes are dimly lit. You can't help but think about something evil lurking in the dark. It is the fear of that unknown that scares you. It also results in some beautifully crafted shots such as the one attached below.
the witch hauntingBut that being said, the most frightening character in The Witch is the atmosphere. Especially, The woods which is the resting place for the witches and other devilish things. That is what makes it relentlessly terrifying. Just take a look at the below pic for example. Thomasin (Anya Taylor Joy) is stuck in the woods and it is starting to frighten her. The Cinematographer captures that feeling of dread by filming the huge trees in the background. He does not show the full view. Not knowing how high the trees go and how deep the woods are is what scares us. She looks helpless as everything seems much bigger than her.This whole atmospheric treatment results in the feeling of paranoia, which will linger with you till the end. It also does not shy away from filming some vomit-inducing scenes.The other important aspect of The Witch that helps build the atmosphere is the music. It perfectly complements the visuals and adds another layer of horror to it. We must thank Mark Korven for that. The music in the Witch is spooky and terrifying. I can't find the perfect words to describe it but it scared me more than the visuals. The music during the climax scene is so intense that I do not think I have a heart strong enough to download that soundtrack. The best way to describe it would be - Think of all the sounds from your scariest nightmares and put them all together in a single clip. It is dissonant and pretty unique. It will not give you jumpscares but is unsettling, nonetheless. You will keep thinking about it long after you've seen the film, that is if you are into music and know what good music means. It captures the whole essence of the film.Talking about acting, everyone is pretty solid but the child actors steal the show. They make the film what it is. half of the time I wanted to kick them because they irritated me beyond my tolerance limit and that is what the director was trying to do. Anya Taylor Joy is great as Thomasin. The father and mother are equally good. Harvey Scrimshaw has delivered a brilliant performance as Caleb, the son who is guilty about commiting a sin. His acting in this film blows everything Adam Sandler has ever done, away. How could he be so good?Eggers' direction is solid throughout the film. His storytelling abilities are amazing. He calls The Witch, A New England Folktale and that is what he turned it into. The tension and atmosphere in this film are what I expect from a horror film. It maintains the same atmosphere throughout the film and never lets go. It all builds up to an ending that hits you like a hammer to the face. I bet no one will be able to guess the ending. At first, I thought it was not that great. But the more I think about it, the more sense it makes.The reason I hold The Witch in such a high regard is because after watching the film, I had a feeling that I had consumed something evil and it was disturbing my inner-peace. Despite sharing my thoughts about the film, I am still not sure why I liked it so much that it may be one of my favourite horror films of all time. I guess, that's what good movies do to you. You don't know why you love them. One more thing that baffles me is how well researched the whole thing is. They even used the old English which is a bit difficult to grasp even with subtitles, especially for non-native speakers. But it results in a realistic film.The Witch is a film made with passion, by a passionate filmmaker, for passionate Cinephiles who don't mind an artistic horror film. It's not easy to watch and most of the people won't like it since they'll be expecting jump scares but if pulverizing babies is your thing then, do give it a try because it is a masterpiece of Horror filmmaking. I didn't like it as much in the first viewing but it kept making me think about it and now that I have seen it around 6 times, I can say that it is one of the best horror movies of the 21st century.I doubt anyone is going to make a horror film like that in the near future.P.S - If jump scares are your thing and you hate artistic films then leave it. It isn't scary.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Folklore and Gender,"When religious devotees lose their faith, they succumb to worldly temptations, and the systemic oppression of women serves as the very crucible that forges the emergence of witches. The film's haunting score, paired with its cold, desaturated color palette, masterfully constructs an atmosphere of suffocating dread-a cinematic hypnosis that pulls viewers into its shadowy world of moral decay. Meanwhile, the film incorporates folk elements such as the black sheep symbolizing the incarnation of the devil and the rabbit representing an ominous sign, which add religious and historical depth to the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Disappointing,"While there was one scene, early on in the film, of incredible terror, the balance of the film was entirely predictable, difficult artistically, and thematically set us back nearly 500 years in vilifying women and witches/ wiccans. While true to the hysterics of the time over anything the recent English immigrants could not understand and therefore labeled as evil, (the dense woods, disobedient women, breasts, etc.) artistically this film is a mess. Let's start with the overuse of blank screens for long seconds (minutes?) of time. This may have been intended to build suspense, especially with the use of fraught vocal music in the soundtrack, but it is used far too often, and the screen is kept blank too long, followed by- nothing! Apparently in this film, it's the equivalent of dropping a screen on stage while the actors change places or costumes. It could have been employed once or twice to great effect if the blank screen didn't last as long, (the viewer on my left mumbled ""WTF?!"" at the second or third use of this) and if it was followed by a surprise or shock to the viewer. Then there's the dialogue: approximately 25% of it, especially early in the film, is indecipherable and at different volumes. The elder son, Caleb, has a different (Cockney) accent than the rest of the family. OK, the Puritans were creepy in their singular devotion to The Bible, and living in and adapting to the apparently always dreary New England was a bit much for their imaginations. But why must women be portrayed always as The Shrew, The Temptress, or the Agent of Satan? I give this film 2 stars for its novel attempt to depict the life of early Puritan settlers in their uneducated, superstitious and hysterical ways. Otherwise, in all, I was mightily disappointed.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The 17th century New England Puritan family and a witch.,"This isn't a particularly memorable movie but it is well made and an interesting viewing. The first-time filmmaker was wary of witches as a young boy and this naturally took him in this direction. Much research was done and some of the dialog in the movie was taken verbatim from accounts of what went on back in that period. This is what it may be like if you believe witches are real.It is a Puritan family in the 1600s that becomes disenchanted with the compound they are in and strike out to find a new home. They do but strange things start to happen and continue. The main character is the teen daughter played by Anya Taylor-Joy, a teenager during filming, as Thomasin. This was actually her very first role in a movie and she is very good.I watched it at home on DVD from my public library, my wife skipped, movies with a witch are not her bag.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I have no issues with this, they're children, though I found certain scenes slightly laughable rather than intense.Other than that though, it's a slow burner, grey, bleak, some very intense scenes, a brilliant score and some relatively traumatic moments.Without giving much away, this is in no way your typical horror movie, but I'd definitely recommend you give it a try.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not a masterpiece; is only a good film.,"They wanted to compare this movie with The Exorcist when in truth they are very different movies. The first is the best horror movie of all time and this is a good movie that using ideas known to all ends in a cathartic and even happy ending. It is very difficult to sympathize with a family of religious fanatics and from the beginning we hope that something terrible happens to them because they are unable to live in community. Then the facts are precipitated using the trigger of the lack of sacred rituals which reveals the potential eternal damnation. It is very difficult to grow up in a sick environment and the story takes us on the descent into the abyss of a family that knowingly made all possible mistakes. With the tradition of the new cinema where everything interesting happens in the final ten minutes (as in Sinister, Paranormal Activity and many others) we find everything fantastic and terrible presented in a suggestive and then majestic way. In this particular case it is logical to accept the pattern of a pact with the Devil since otherwise life would have been hell. It is the paradox of the film: changing one hell for another.

I think its a well crafted effort.,"I remember reading the 'official entertainment review' of this movie after it had come out. It was panned by the critics. I went to see it just to see what they were complaining about and I found a film that was original in every sense. The characterizations were a bit strong but maybe thats the way people were back then. Nobody can say for sure since nobody is alive from that time period. I thought that somewhere in the film they could have found some way to explain why they used two 'v's' to make the word 'witch.' The reason being that the word 'witch' came from Scandinavia in the form of the word ""vvitch"" meaning ""sorcerer"" (usually a male person as posed to a female person) which has a more powerful evil connotation that the commonly used western term 'witch.' The origins of the term are darker and imply greater evil than a 'witch.' Anyway-the film was gritty in an interesting and different way and I think the film attempted to convey the darker connotation of the concept of a 'sorcerer.' Not a film to watch alone at night.

It creates and builds a creepy sense of foreboding and dread, and is precisely scary because it creates horror out of happenings that anyone could relate to: loneliness, isolation, male inadequacy, religious extremism, disintegrating family dynamics, mental illness, the death of a child. You don't need supernatural oogie boogies to make any of these things scary. Up to a certain point in the film, and despite the fact that we see the witch herself, the film allows its audience to interpret the story as not having a supernatural element at all, and instead be the physical manifestations of the internal mental anguish of its characters. But not content with that, the filmmakers have to make the Satanic spin literal, which immediately makes the film less scary, since I don't believe in God, Satan, Heaven, or Hell, so there's very little in any of that mumbo jumbo for me to be afraid of.What does scare me is religious fanaticism, and that's where I think this film is most effective. It shows what happens when a group of people who have nothing but faith on which to rely begin to lose that faith, and the lengths people will go to to explain random events as not being random at all but rather the conscious design of a higher being. The mother and father in this film would rather see their own children branded as witches and likely killed than admit that cruel things sometimes just happen, not because humans are being tested or humbled by an all-powerful God, but rather because sh*t just happens. When you've got parents who are willing to offer up their children for sacrifice to prove to themselves that their belief in a fairy tale is justified, you've got an allegory, whether intended by the filmmaker or not, for the kind of religious extremism plaguing the world now, let alone 400 years ago. Now THAT's a horror movie.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Metaphors are for cowards,"A literal interpretation of a fairy tale was a lot to swallow in the beginning. I was way too much in the metaphor land of oh, what is this symbolizing? Oh, it's this really what is happening or is this a metaphor for something else, but sometimes metaphors are cowards and we just need a take the story literally.The movie is really told well, small cast of characters really works of each other well, Slow degradation of the family and the way that the characters believes, are shaken its just really emotional and personal well done.The mystery Horror of it all really helps. The Pride of the father figure and the mother's despair and the children not knowing what to do, other than going at each other throats just really well done.The Old dialect and the set design works so well, it really fills like I was in the time period of the movie.Is a Fantastic original take on, old fairy tales and I would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"I Am Blown Away - Intelligent, Suspenseful Horror","One of the biggest problems with most modern day horror films is the fact they spend more money on fake blood and guts than they do paying good actors, directors, writers, etc. Most of the modern horror films are the stupid in-your-face blood, guts and gore with a crappy or non-existent storyline. And they do not know how to build up suspense and create subtle, intelligent horror. This modern day horror film, The Witch, is quite the opposite. The Witch is highly suspenseful, very atmospheric, excellent story and over all scary.The film is considered to slow to some people, and I can see why... it's not the silly chop them up film that they are used to. The Witch is in the spirit of good classic horror... slowly building into a terrifying ending to a fantastic story. It's about a very religious family in the 1600s who's child came up missing, their crops failing, intense family moments and witch nearby in the woods. Very creepy things happen to the family.If you like the subtle, suspenseful, eerie horror films - then watch this film! I am blown away at how good it is. I fell in-love with this film the first time I watched it - and it's rare for me to enjoy modern horror but I truly enjoyed this film.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I'm very pleased to say The Witch is one of the best horror movies I've seen in the last 10 years. It has a smart script, a great cast and a creepy score.The film centers on a pilgrim family whose religious fanaticism gets them thrown out of a colony and forced to live in the woods nearby. Shortly after settling, the youngest goes missing while under the charge of Thomasin, the eldest daughter. The family quickly implodes.The director is in no hurry to rush this story.

Quick review,"I watched The Witch and I thought it was alright. The acting is pretty great and the child actors were just as good as the adults. The cinematography is great as well, but some of the shots are ruined by bad CGI, there's a shot where the smoke from the chimney is frozen still. The script is also pretty good and the use of the dialect of the time period was interesting and worked very will. That's what I liked. I thought the pacing was really bad and it made the movie boring when things that don't directly effect the plot were happening. Speaking of the plot I did not really like the direction the film went, it felt quite anti-climactic despite some really important things happening, I felt this way because I could see where the story was going as soon as the third act started. Finally something that is very important to me is music in and out of film, and the music is this film sucked, even worse than having bad music it was so inappropriately used that it genuinely ruined quite a few scenes for me. Having the main score absolutely Blair over a still shot of the forrest is so obnoxious.Overall I recommend The Witch if it's the type of movie you think you will enjoy, overwise you might not enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Barely horror,Well filmed and good acting but this movie is not scary one bit and almost boring at that. Actors could be hard to understand at times when using super thick accents.

Seems authentic and eerie,"This was a very very good movie. The acting is superb and the old language used adds to the authenticity of it.So so tired of movies set in times hundreds of years ago where women have beautifully coiffed hair, men swear and use slang that would never have been used, people have straight white teeth, and they kiss with open mouths. No! In the 1600s these were God-fearing people who would never swear as it would be a blasphemy. They never revealed any promiscuity for fear of being stricken down. Plain folks worked and little else. We have learned our lessons but men were considered superior and that's just the way it was.On top of this it was a good story with several layers to analyze.

The Best Wicked Witch Movie So Far,"To be honest, I am not a big fan of witch-themed movie, but I have watched a few, and none of them is as good as The VVitch. Its style is not quite as usual as other horror movie, making the movie unique. Brilliantly eerie scenography and cinematography create a thrilling and suspensing ambience. The conflict within a family and between their religious belief, society, the wild, also The Satan and Witch cleverness, transcends any other witch movie in my opinion. Another plus point, as the movie goes, you will keep guessing how the story will end, and that's what will keep you focus till the end of it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Well, one version of the actual witch is ... hot; the rest of film ...","This film is perhaps unlike any other film I have seen. Yes, there is horror, but it is not the type of horror that might cause your girlfriend to cuddle closer. It's creepy; VERY creepy.The acting is superb; I actually tuned in to see another film with Anya Taylor-Joy after watching ""The New Mutants"", but alas, she is only about 20yrs old or so for this film --- younger than I prefer. But she IS a very lovely young woman.This film might have scored higher for me if I could have understood more than about 1/3 of the dialog -- much of it, I""m sure, may be Period-Accurate; but to me, unintelligible. Hence my lowish rating.Again this film is quite creepy. Set yourself up for a level of creepy that you may not have seen before; but you may enjoy the film as I did.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Something lost along the way,"I have always preferred horror movies based around tension rather than gore or jump scares. When I first saw a trailer for The Witch it seemed like the perfect horror movie for me. The time period and setting are even enough to bring chills just thinking about it but I am sad to say that these are probably among the best features of this movie. The Witch fails in so many ways that I am having trouble remembering the few things in which it succeeds, and those few things are not nearly enough to save this disaster.I don't want to make this review a list of things I hated about the movie followed by praise for Anya Taylor-Joy so I will begin with her performance. Really the only highlight of the movie, Anya Taylor-Joy brought the fear out of not only the terrible things happening, but also the feeling of being trapped as she was. Her character was the only one who I really felt for through the movie as all of the other characters were dis likable for the most part.I guess I will start with the story and whatnot since that is probably my biggest complaint. The story goes nowhere. The plot seems to be a series of boring farm chores and deep prayer scattered with a few moments of fear. There was no sort of effort to make the story circular, or to really even bring many of the things brought up in the beginning to a satisfying conclusion. The old saying of ""Don't show a gun in the first act if you aren't going to use it in the third"" is disturbingly broken here. The worst part about the story is that it is not even innovative. The normal worn out horror genre format is here with the first hour of the movie being a crawl with a brief moment is horror splashed in. Then the last half hour aims to shock and disturb leaving the last 15 minutes for the real scares. The Witch does all of this poorly as none of the moments of tension hit nearly as hard as they think and the overall payoff is not clever or satisfying.The direction of the movie is filled with close up reaction shots that most of the time amount to nothing. The camera will show a character horrified and then when the viewer finally gets to see what is so interesting it always ends up disappointing. There were absolutely no shots in this movie that were really impressive. The look of the movie actually was also impressive, but when juxtaposed with basic camera placement and movement it just offsets each other.Good horror movies are a dime a dozen these days, but The Witch seemed like it had a good understanding of how to make a good one. Again the time period and subject are a wealth of entertainment for this genre but the makers of this movie got lost somewhere along the way. I would not recommend this to anyone other than people who really like horror/thriller movies just to let them have an opinion. In my opinion this one is an easy pass.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Unusual, but unique horror story","This film is listed as horror, but I'd have to argue it might be considered more of a suspenseful drama to many. Though it has horror aspects to it, it didn't quite scare me out of my skin. I'm also not one who enjoys horror films unless I'm in the correct mood to watch.The film follows the story of an ostracized overtly religious family who is cast out from their village and left to farm on the edge of the woods, which seem. Though the exact time of the film is left unclear, it is clearly set in the 1600s or 1700s, when fear of the devil and witchcraft were prominent.The family is slowly plagued by unknown dark forces, which the family believe to be a witch... or maybe even one of their own.The film has several surprises, a few small jump scares and definitely had me on the edge of my seat for a large part of the film. As a drama, this movie has a lovely cliffhanger of an ending, and as a horror film, it will definitely leave you feeling uneasy.The old English style language used in the film is hard to keep up with at times. But there are few negative things I can say about this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Chilling Dive into Puritan Paranoia,"In this movie director Robert Eggers crafts a haunting journey into the heart of 17th-century New England, where a Puritan family grapples with supernatural forces and their own unraveling sanity.This atmospheric horror film stands out for its meticulous attention to historical detail and a slow-burning narrative that steadily builds an atmosphere of dread. Anya Taylor-Joy's standout performance adds to the film's eerie ambiance, as the family becomes ensnared in a web of malevolent folklore and religious hysteria.The cinematography, marked by its stark beauty, enhances the film's unsettling nature, and the unsettling score further intensifies the unease. Eggers skillfully exploits the fears of the unknown, creating a narrative that blurs the lines between supernatural horror and psychological terror.For those seeking a horror experience that delves into the psychological abyss, ""The Witch"" is a mesmerizing descent into darkness. It's a film that lingers in the mind, leaving you haunted by its chilling tale of paranoia and the supernatural.#TheWitch #HorrorMastery.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Well acted, eerie and good cinematography but lacking exciting scares","This film was interesting.The acting from the cast was superb and they all felt very immersed in their respective New England characters.The cinematography was well shot and depicted this village as cold, dark, primitive and spooky.The only thing it was lacking was effective scares and real edge of your seat horror. This film uses a lot of omens for the Witch and hardly ever reveals her as an embodiment of the witch in a terrifying way at all. This was effective to build tension but there was no real scary moment.

An expertly crafted unsettling picture.,"If you are into artsy films with solid substance, then you will appreciate this film. The Witch takes risks and succeeds on nearly every one of them. The unsettling and eerie nature of each scene gave me goosebumps. The score gives off a similar feeling that The Shining had, and it elevates each scene when it is used. The actors succeeded in being believable in the films dramatic and thrilling scenes, and the script asked a lot out of them. I cannot commend the cast enough for pulling off certain scenes. This film may disturb many people, and I would definitely proceed with caution if you are sensitive to religious themed horror.My only true negatives would he the slow start of the film and the rewatchability.

"""What went we out into this wilderness to find?""","Robert Eggers vividly recreates an authentic Puritan world in this unnerving film boosted by a strong atmosphere and tremendous performances from its cast. Ralph Ineson steals the show here as William, a devout Christian father who takes his family out of the plantation they are living in after a disagreement he has on religious matters with the plantation leaders. They set their markers down in the New England wilderness, and begin to farm. Strange and devastating things begin to occur before long.

Facing starvation, the family soon begins to turn on each other, as Puritan fears and paranoia suffocate the household.""The Witch"" offers a subtle type of horror in an original and unique setting. The film plays like you are watching a heavy drama on stage (""The Crucible"", perhaps?) and yet the horror elements just keep building and building, accompanied by a strange score, and serve to rack up the tension, and your nerves, before reaching its crescendo in the final scene.

The costumes and scenes were good as they did portray that era and what it would be like to be living in those conditions and times.

"initially interesting film that is hungry for cheese, and sticks of it","Perhaps the idea of a witch in the woods preying on a humble Christian family living at its edge was just too strait for writer / director Robert Eggars.I liked the set up and the first half. We are presented with a small handful of intelligent and sympathetic characters and there is a clear sense of where (but not what) the threat is. Then just past the half way mark, the scenes get progressively silly and derivative of better horror movies. You feel the irony of a witchcraft movie that has been possessed and lost its soul and direction.The decision to use strong period dialect is simultaneously frustrating and intriguing. It commands the audience to be intelligent listeners but there are times when sentences get muddled underneath the heavy British accents. The theme of fearing abandonment by god (or possession by darkness,) is prevalent as the story gets underway. At first it feels like a historically accurate motive for character vulnerability, but instead it becomes a device for hokey paranoia as our characters start pointing fingers and accusing each other of witchcraft.The dramatic momentum that slowly accumulates in the first hour comes undone in the last half hour. The Witch starts as a story about characters but regretfully caves in and conforms to the horror genre by summoning gimmicks like the possessed animal that turns on its master. Once the chaos starts to pick up you get the feeling that a lame ending is inevitable. The last scene of a movie is visually quite strong without being showy, but the punchline feels meaningless beyond saying that darkness prevails; again very generic for a horror film.Strong acting and eerie scenery are the additional highlights, but the finished product is neither scary nor memorable.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

But not much happens in the movie! It's boring. Me and my friends had to keep making jokes to maintain our attention. The movie tries so hard to build suspense, but when the suspense ultimately has no pay off, it undermines the stakes of the movie. And you know, as nonreligious viewers we're just not all that frightened by goats, devils, and witchcraft. You have to try really hard to make that scary. And I'm told there's plenty of people that think this movie is really scary. But I don't see it.But what really does the movie in, is the fact that it has an unsatisfying ending.

"I'm definitely not a cinephile, but...","...if this is ""a horror movie for cinephiles"" then maybe I really AM one?Seriously though, this isn't a horror in the most widely-accepted meaning - there's very little actual gore, there's no mass murderer/psychopath/slasher stalking anyone, no creepy possessed dolls or haunted abandoned houses, no jump scares, none of the usual horror movie trappings. Instead, we've got something much deeper - more of a character study of a DEEPLY religious family in Puritan times, complete with period-appropriate speech, cast out of their community due to a religious dispute. They leave the settlement and make their own home a few days' walk away at a home and farm they build by the edge of a forest, including adding a newborn baby boy to the family.What follows next is a genuinely gripping journey as we watch this family struggle with an apparently failing farm plagued with food rot - leading to a lack of food - and an apparently failing belief in god - leading to/caused by them being plagued by a local witch. Or are they? Is it all just some kind of hallucinatory experience caused by eating rotten produce? The movie is never truly clear on what the family actually experiences. Maybe they ARE just delirious, maybe their goat IS just a temperamental a-hole rather than the devil incarnate.Either way, the cast are all fantastic, the score is brilliant and a little off-key and off-kilter, the cinematography is intentionally drab and feels washed out which sets the tone perfectly.In short (too late?) if you're looking for a typical horror slasher/gorefest, then look elsewhere.

Season of The Witch,"On a Robert Eggers kick since I saw Nosferatu and his Witch movie while mostly a slow build and burn was overall enjoyable. The simplicity in the nature of the plot is what I think keeps you intrigued and invested until the bitter end. Plus only clocking in at 90 minutes helps a ton to keep it from dragging on too long and it already has its slower sections in the first half of the film. The second half ramps up a bit making you second guess the family the witch stalks. Are they having delusions or is the witch really lurking in the shadowy forest surrounding the exiled puritan family's barn home? The way the film was shot too was once again gorgeous. Robert Eggers used the same cinematographer for this movie as he did in his other films like The Lighthouse, The Northman and of course Nosferatu. Lastly the acting I thought was pretty solid too from game of thrones veterans like Ralph Ineson and a young Anya Taylor Joy. I guess if I had to nit pick I'd say that the first half of the movie felt a little too bland and uninteresting in some parts until they started digging into the whole witchery conspiracy at hand when animals and their family members begin to start behaving erratically. Overall it's an interesting take on a witch and witchcraft in a time of the 17th century England when it was a hot topic at hand in the puritan and English culture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"I suspect those who gave this only 1 star, are as shallow as mud.","This is an amazing movie that I've watched 3 times already. Yes, it is a little difficult to fully understand the actors as they are speaking in an Old English accent, but it just adds to the authenticity. For those who rate it only 1 Star, they never watched the movie, watched only 15 minutes of it, or are the top of guy who loves to jerk off to gun magazines. They would rather see Saw, Saw 2, Saw 3, Saw 4, and so on. Only blood, gore and guts gets these trolls off. Perhaps if they watched it with an open mind, they would appreciate the beauty of this film.This was never about the evil witch in the woods, this was about the cultural and familial pressures that cause an otherwise innocent and good Christian girl to turn bad. A witch may have killed some people she loves, but she isn't turning towards a new family of women or serving the witches, she's turning towards a life of serving herself. Now that she's alone, she can be free, and must do something to save herself. Rules did nothing for her, and now she will live without them.This is a movie about how you make witches, and the woman on the movie posters and dvd case is not the witch coming from the woods to do harm, it's Thomasin walking into the dreaded wild, away from God, away from oppressive, controlling Puritan society, and away from the bitter, painful life of pioneers and colonists that has won her nothing but loneliness, hunger, and abuse.

"One of the best dramas and suspense of the 2010s, but it doesn't come close to Rob Zombie's film about witches.","It is a period drama that talks about family relationships around the beliefs of each member. This is a very complex theme that this film knows how to carry out, and it mixes it with a bit of suspense and gore, and I think that the terror here does not appear for a second. Taylor Joy is convincing in her performance, as are Ineson and Scrimshaw, who at a certain point takes the lead role in the film. The photography and setting, although a little short on exteriors, are the ideal complement. In any case, it is one of the best films of the 2010s in terms of this genre, but in no way surpasses Rob Zombie's film about witches, It is because Rob Zombie's film does contain terror, suspense, intrigue, tension and drama, even sensuality, but The Witch does not, it lacks any of these.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Over rated low budget so called HORRO film.,"I would be lying if I said this movie was great. I went to watch it yesterday in the cinema and was really looking forward to it with very very high expectations after seeing the trailer and the high ratings of IMDb and RottenTomatoes. The title simply misrepresents the movie. I was extremely disappointed at the end of the film simply because it didn't deliver what it was supposed to deliver, HORROR. I only saw the WITCH on two or three occasions throughout the film and didn't feel any witchcraft or dark magic whatsoever.Over all, without going into much details, it felt that the film was all over the place and going in many different directions that did not lead to nowhere. The script in my opinion was not the right one for this movie, it just builds up the suspense and makes one feel hyper endlessly without any jump scares and it lacked the element of surprise which you would expect in a horror film. The storyline misleads the audience to something unfinished and the chain of events do not make sense at all. I did not understand what happened to the two children and why they were screaming and when they were bewitched and by who. Also, I did not quite get what the goat's or the rabbit's role in the film, they just appear and disappear and the goat stood once which I was expecting it at that moment to transform to the real witch so we get to hear what she has to say, but unfortunately, it didn't happen and it only attacked the man and killed him, very simple and straightforward. Any goat can attack and kill a man you don't need to go to the cinema to watch it lol.Finally, I think the people who over rated this film should review their taste or at least be truthful what they saw. There was nothing to like about this film unfortunately and it is just a waste of time I must say. I know what a horror film should look and sound like, and if this film is rated 7.4/10 on IMDb, and Silent Hill is rated 6.6/10, then you must know that there is a clear issue in this regard and it makes you ask the question, who is really managing the ratings and how do they do it?I hope I have been fair in my judgement regarding this movie as I feel I am only telling the truth about how disappointed I am.Thank you",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A grotesque picture of religious horror,"At its roots, the horror genre attract us because it forces us to face our personal demons: this kind of terror coming from facing unknown monsters that are metaphors of our daily life struggles or fears strangely intrigues us.When horrors deal with religion though, they usually just use it as an excuse to make horned demons appear pretty much everywhere but The Witch is extremely different: we barely see any monster, violence is kept at a minimum and the terror usually comes in form of a terrible sense of unease.When this New England family is banished and forced to live in exile amidst the woods, we immediately see that their journey is doomed. 
The younger child, Samuel, disappears and it doesn't take long before each family member starts blaming each other until accusations of witchcraft and demonic possession arise. 
Not too differently from Carpenter's The Thing, The Witch focuses on the personal relationship between the cast members and their feeling of un trust that the father tries to sedate through prayers and sermons.The Witch rarely gives some answers, it keeps the viewer constantly wondering why some things happen, whether someone in the family has signed a path with the Devil or some evil force has simply decided to put its hands on the Abbot family.
The more we watch, the more we're inclined to think someone in particular attracted the Witch of the Woods and we're left wondering until the bodies start piling up.The Witch isn't a movie for everyone though: the slow pace doesn't always help building up the suspense and more in general the screenplay asks the viewers to be patient and wait for the final climax. 
Those who are up to it though, will enjoy one of the creepiest and amazing horror movies of the past years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Eggers' slow-burning folk horror,"Robert Eggers' directorial debut is a simmering folk horror tale aptly titled The Witch. With its linguistic and scenographic accuracy, the movie transports you passionately back to 1630s New England and into a family of early settlers, whose everyday life is harsh and pious to the extreme. When their newborn son suddenly disappears in broad daylight, the oldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) watches her family members slowly disintegrate into grief, guilt, devoutness and distrustfulness. The film bases its existence on how people in this time and place had nowhere to turn to for answers except inwards or to religion. Their inability to understand their own and each others' situation and emotional life is the implicit horror here, even if the film's ensuing delve into some very prevailing superstitions from the era is the explicit theme for Eggers' foray into the horror genre. Perhaps it was a little misleading to market the film as a more standard horror flick, even if it certainly helped the sales. Because this is a slow-burning tale which cares less about genre-expectations than about settler era ghost stories and the circumstances that made them necessary or at least relevant at the time. If The Witch ultimately is missing something, it's the ability to link the characters' perception of fear to our own. But Eggers certainly demonstrated the talent that would lead him to create the even more intense The Lighthouse a few years later.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The entire movie looks very authentic and believable. The buildings look just like they should, the costumes look like handmade clothing, and I read it was all shot with natural light.

Put Some Respect on Robert Eggers' Name!,"Hard to imagine that The Witch, was created by first time writer & director, Robert Eggers. Similar to 2014's It Follows, it is a watchable horror that does not rely on cheap thrills, jump scare scenes nor gore. Rather, the film relies on masterful filmmaking and acting to create this dark and deeply unsettling vibe. This compliments its excellent, non-conformist storyline that features a terrorizing Witch in the Woods and how she leads the family to a crippling descent to hysteria and madness. Very compelling! Technically, the visuals of the film is amazing. Props to the cinematography and use of natural lighting. Music deserves high praise as well as the choice and execution REALLY builds up the dread. As for acting, amazing performance by the family particularly our debutant, Anna Taylor-Joy. Her portrayal of Thomasin was a revelation, as she renders a sincere output of hopelessness and vulnerability. Overall, the Witch is a deeply unnerving horror that has a great and well acted storyline, that feels crafted by Evil itself. If only I adored slow burn horror films more, it would've gotten a score higher than 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Should not be marketed as a horror film,"The 1 star may seem harsh on a film that critics seem to be praising like crazy. After reading reviews like ""one of the best horror movies in decades""...I gotta say, it is NOT a horror film. It is a dark family drama with a supernatural underlying story.The music is great. The acting is great. The movie was incredibly boring for what we were planning on seeing. It is being mis-marketed as some incredibly frightening horror film, but it is a snoozefest if you go in expecting this to be scary.The film opens with a bang....but then drags and drags with no real terror...just a family going insane due to religion and isolation. Think of it more along the lines of a slightly eerie Drama, better categorized with the likes of Cape Fear (NOT a horror film) or Straw Dogs. If Blockbusters were still around...this movie would have no business being in the horror section. It should be categorized as a Drama. Period.Horror films sell tickets, whereas indy dramas do not. This marketing ploy is a trick to fill their pockets. But, it IS NOT a horror movie. If you think you are going to see some terrifying horror movie, you will be extremely disappointed as I was.1 star from me since I was bored out of my mind after being so hyped up to actually see a decent HORROR film in theaters.If this was shown to me back in school when we studied the Puritan days (you all remember reading the Crucible, I'm sure), I would have been entertained and would have enjoyed it. But, due to how to movie was marketed, I went with horror buff friends who are all stoked to see what was supposedly "" the scariest horror film in decades.""Since it calls itself a horror film, I am gong to rate it as if it were one.

Atmospheric and Eerie,"The overall aesthetic of this film matches how people would feel about witchcraft during the time where the movie takes place, and it captures the feeling of dread and the unknown perfectly through its score, dialogue, and cinematography.While the pacing was not my favorite, the characters felt authentic from the way that they spoke to how they handled the situation that they were all put in. Some of the reactions from the characters seemed a bit asinine, but I suppose that is what the directors were aiming for with the lunacy of what was causing these strange occurrences.Overall, I enjoyed the ambiance that the film presents and the encompassing elements that support it, and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't really want to be ""sacred"" but more ""creeped out"" or ""unsettled"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Witch is slow paced and trudges along with a sense of dread and despair to the point of making one feel uncomfortable but mixed in are some beautiful shots, amazing sound design, and a truly haunting story of family who gets more then they bargained for.The Witch does focus more on the psyche and effects that belief in the supernatural can cause but does not let you down by saying that it's all just make belief.

There isn't much of an overarching story. Things happen to the characters and they react to them. Or sometimes characters will make very out of character decisions to create drama. The lighthouse for me worked better in this way because the characters were more engaging, we spent more time with the lead whereas Anya Taylor Joy's ""Tomasin"" doesn't have enough of a focus in my opinion.It's hard to criticise this movie because all my complaints with the film are things that were done very intentionally and might work better for other people or if I rewatched it.I do wish I had watched it on the big screen, because watching this at home on a low quality screen did ultimately take away from the experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Quite simply - an awful movie. This year's It Follows,"I saw it last year at a festival and disliked it heavily. I found the movie to have no scares and scant dread for that matter. The reason being?

Disturbing Take on Puritan Folktales,"(Rating as a movie) After watching The Witch, I felt something in my stomach. It was a feeling that I rarely feel after watching a film. The feeling that this movie created in my stomach was dread. Is this movie scary? I think so. But it wasn't the actual witch that had me sweating throughout the the film, rather, it was the psychological torment that the main characters were going through during the events of the movie. Seeing each character break down into madness was haunting, and was only complimented by the amazing soundtrack that added an extra layer of tension to each scene. The characters were extremely well written, each with their own motivations, fears, and flaws. The acting in this movie is fantastic, and never at any point did I not believe any of the characters, they were all portrayed very well, and even the child actors did a pretty good job. The whole film takes place around one small house, which creates a feeling of isolation and hopelessness, which is complimented by the film's ugly, grey color palette and dark lighting. Disturbing things happen throughout the film, but despite this, the film never relied on cheap gore to shock audiences, but rather sets up a disturbing canvas, and asks the viewer to paint the rest of the picture. It leaves the most disturbing moments up to interpretation, and as a result, made them more impactful to the audience. This psychological build up continues to grow until the very end, at which point the film just pours out all of the madness that it's built up for the audience to witness. I wouldn't classify The Witch as a horror, but rather, a dark drama with disturbing elements of horror sprinkled in. As a movie, I'd rate The Witch 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of my favorite non-traditional horror suspense movies.,"This is a movie for suspense thriller lovers. Not so much horror people.

If you like picking apart movies, this is one for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"The supernatural is joined to a genuine fear, victim of prejudice and ignorance, motivated by social and religious issues that could be in vogue at the time portrayed as today","Bringing several dialogues that, according to screenwriter and director Robert Eggers, were transcribed from real accounts recorded in 17th century New England, the film follows a family that, right at the beginning of the projection, is expelled from the small village they inhabit for reasons which are not entirely clear, but which seem to be a response to Patriarch William (Ineson)'s extreme interpretation of the Bible and of the Christian faith itself. Alongside his wife Katherine (Dickie), teenage daughter Thomasin (Taylor-Joy), pre-teen Caleb (Scrimshaw) and three young children, the guy starts to occupy a cabin located on the edge of a forest. However, isolation and the failure of crops begin to wear out the family through hunger and a tragedy that ends up compromising everyone's psychological balance once and for all. Little by little, the young Thomasin starts to be harassed by her own relatives when she becomes a suspect of witchcraft.The plastically studied photography by Jarin Blaschke collaborates to create this climate of oppression and constant fear, efficient in putting the public before the dilemmas faced by the protagonists of a plot passed centuries ago as if they were contemporary experiences. Identification is immediate, and this only serves to increase the degree of horror experienced on both sides of the screen. The father is the brute force, but also the charitable look. The mother is all tension, guilt and accusations. The eldest daughter tries to keep her sanity, while the boy struggles to show maturity, even though his little age contradicts him. The couple of younger children look as angelic as they are demonic - it's all a matter of point of view - while the baby... well, that one has little to tell us. And not because I don't know how - after all, certain looks speak more than a thousand words - but simply because I don't have the time to do so. In the midst of an innocent prank, he disappears without a trace, in an inexplicable way. Suspicion immediately falls on the firstborn, responsible for taking care of him. The family is divided, some believing her innocence, others accusing her of witchcraft and worse curses. But would she be here in the cabin where the origin of evil lives, or deep in the woods beside the small ranch?The Witch is a horror film less concerned with scares than with the idea of exploring the darkness of the individuals who inhabit its world. For most of the projection, the genre-defining ""terror"" emerges not in the form of evil spirits, brain-eating zombies, or even literal witches, but from within your characters, manifesting in the form of stupidity, superstitions, and religious fundamentalism. The Witch is located in the period of colonization of the USA, showing the trajectory of a family of extremely religious immigrants who are expelled from their colony, being forced to live with the still unknown new world. Thus, the terror in The Witch is based on two factors, the fear of the unknown, the dread of this new land, represented by the forest next to the family's new home; in addition to the guilt arising from religious fundamentalism, in which these characters believe they are doomed to sin and tempted at all times by evil. These two psychological factors and as if they left that family susceptible to the supernatural, as if fear and guilt were the gateway to the macabre, or that these signs of another world are the result of a blinding fear, which does not allow one to perceive reality. And so, the film tries to place the spectator on the same level as the figures in its narrative, betting on a terror that is much more sensitive than visible.Eggers is just one of several first-time directors who form a kind of newly formed avant-garde in the independent horror movie market, which is increasingly distancing itself from Hollywood. This rupture is the result of a repetitive and excessive use of cinematic artifices in the commercial terrors of the big studios. Despite being efficient, techniques such as jump scare, those sudden changes in the image or in the soundtrack, are used tirelessly, often in a single film, and ended up saturating the Hollywood model of horror.Instead of trying to scare the audience in each sequence of scenes, the alternative productions aim precisely at creating a gradual tension that only dissolves at the climax of the film. These productions do not focus on physically startling the audience, but on psychologically involving them in their disturbing plots. For this, they also get rid of other gender stereotypes. The gratuitous sex and violence scenes, for example, which have always been characteristic aspects of horror and are nothing more than tools to attract the public's attention, are almost absent in this type of production. This is not to say that these films are necessarily less bloody and sexual, but rather the opposite: the objective use of these types of scenes makes them more intense and less banal, appearing as a repression rather than an expression of sexuality.Here, the narrative is more concerned with subtlety than overt fear. Much of this effect of constant tension is built on by Mark Korven's efficient score, which employs dissonant vocals and sounds that, created essentially by string instruments, keep the viewer in a constant tension that suggests a threat whose nature we cannot identify, but which it certainly seems to have its origins in the forest that surrounds the characters and which, photographed by Jarin Blaschke as a gigantic and dark wall, creates a claustrophobic tone even when the scenes take place outside the cabin. In addition, the high contrast presents in the night scenes, which envelops everyone in a seemingly impenetrable dark cloak, not only maintains the suffocating tone but subtly points to the existence of an invisible evil that can invade the environment at any moment.But the discomfort aroused by The Witch is also the result of the realistic way, anchored in a detailed production design, with which the family's difficulties to simply survive in the early 17th century is portrayed: a daily life of exhausting manual work, zero hygiene and very few resources in case of illness - and, no wonder, the filmmakers lead the viewer to see everything through a gray, desaturated and sad palette. In addition, the sound design is clever in using noise and whispers as a recurring source of uncertainty and insecurities - from the murmurs coming from the forest to the simple (but palpable) fragility of children who overhear conversations between their parents and sense the gravity of what is being said. Even without being able yet to understand what the discussion involves. Betting on a funereal setting, with a color palette that gives the feeling of something rotten in the old wood, in the muddy floor and in the actors themselves, ""The Witch"" is an atmosphere film, with its fear being built by suggestions and symbolism, walking a fine line between the sacred and the profane, and indicating with each new scene that something very wrong - and bad - is about to happen. From the goats on the farm, to the wild nature of the twins, to the very look of young Anya Taylor-Joy, with hair bordering on white and wide eyes that make her perfect for horror movies.Eggers still applies several techniques that immerse you even more, positioning the camera so that we can't see the full extent of long shots, alternating the use of natural and artificial lights - photographer Jarin Blaschke should have been nominated for an Oscar - and counting on a dissonant and ear-scratching soundtrack with classic compositions. In addition, from the costumes to the production design, it's as if we were transported to that place and we were without action in front of everything and without knowing exactly what the director's true intentions were, which makes the experience even more suffocating.And in doing so, the film turns the gradual collapse of that family into the center of its horror. William, Thomasin and the others know that emotional bonds are breaking down and that deep psychological wounds are being opened, but they lack the intellectual, cultural and emotional sophistication to understand exactly how to prevent this from happening. Complicating this, of course, is Thomasin's sexual awakening and physical transformations - a symbolic device as classic in horror as, say, a vampire or... a witch. Constantly, in works of this genre, female maturation is seen as the initiator of supernatural events, from Carrie the Possessed, through The Panther's Mark, Hell Girl and The Experience - and, in The Witch, Thomasin ends up being blamed and demonized simply for develop, since much of the aggressiveness with which she is treated is a direct result of the discomfort it causes in the men of the family and, indirectly, in her mother.But if ""The Witch"" has bothered many for its religious themes - and it should, then, in a way, all young Thomasin wants is freedom to pursue the pleasures of life that we all like to think we're entitled to, and what constrains is the patriarchal and archaic way in which the religious family lives - it was the lack of jumps cares that had unsuspecting viewers slipping into an art movie as they waited for the first of many sequels. But if the boring (in the best sense) hour and a half of the movie wears you out early, pay attention to the details, the suggestions, the looks, the movements of each creature on screen.The efforts gathered here reveal a refined work, which plays with the act of scaring responsibly, with parsimony and great care, without revealing anything beyond the account and measuring with wisdom each new revelation. The supernatural is joined to a genuine fear, victim of prejudice and ignorance, motivated by social and religious issues that could be in vogue at the time portrayed as today.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"An excellent, moody slow-burn horror film","The Witch is a horror film directed by Robert Eggers, starring Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, and Kate Dickie. It follows an American Puritan family in the 1630s living in exile at the edge of a nearby forest as they are tormented by hostile otherworldly forces.Firstly, the acting. Anya Taylor-Joy's performance as Thomasin, eldest daughter of the family, is wonderfully intense and sincere in displaying the hardships of the life of a young Puritan girl, especially one whose role in the family is so thankless and ignored. Throughout the film, she tries to win her mother's approval and dutifully support her family, but is instead repeatedly used as a scapegoat for much of the family's woes. Ralph Ineson plays gruff but well-meaning father William, and Kate Dickie plays distant mother Katherine. Every character feels real, no doubt helped by the authentic dialogue accurate to the time period, which must have been difficult to remember and was painstakingly researched by the production team.Secondly, the atmosphere. The whole film has a constant air of tragedy and sadness, and even in scenes where there is nothing overtly scary happening, the viewer will be on the edge of their seat, expecting something horrible to happen, but no. The tension builds and builds. Over the course of the film, the bonds between the family members are pushed to the limit as they grow increasingly desperate and some become hostile to one another, charging each scene with a sense of profound unease, so you're never certain of what will happen next. That is the masterstroke of the film, the continual ""slow-burn"" tension and uncertainty that will keep audiences disoriented and searching for concrete answers.The film, aside from being a horror film focused largely on exploiting tension and unsettling imagery, is also an excellent demonstration of how harsh the average Puritan family's life was at the time, out in the wilderness without support, and how quickly a family can succumb to paranoia thanks to stress and tragedy. Thanks to the mixture of more mundane family drama and gripping terror, there are many ways to interpret the film's events, and I am glad that the film allows for that flexibility since I feel that horror, with its basis in creating fear, should let audiences draw on their own fears and experiences while watching.In conclusion, the film is an excellent ""slow-burn"" horror film, with masterful performances, a great mood and atmosphere, and the benefit of being vague enough to allow for multiple interpretations.Score: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Low Key Horror,"The Witch is a 1600s New England relative of the Arthur Miller novel, The Crucible, which has been revived on Broadway. This time around, a man, William is sent away from a puritan community for some obscure violation of rules, and settles in the wilderness with his wife and children. A baby is abducted and further strife ensues while everyone prays for deliverance from evil. The scenery is breathtaking and the cast is excellent with the major drawback of old English accents which are difficult to understand at times to these modern American ears. The terror builds slowly and first time writer-director Robert Eggers shows promise as a filmmaker. I would recommend subtitles for non British viewers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Terrifying,One of the best horror movies I've ever seen. So well-made. I love this movie so much that it has become an annual Halloween tradition. It's nerve-wracking and intense.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
