I can identify with this movie,"My grandson advised me to watch this movie. I'm not much of a movie watcher but was greatly impressed with the movie. I was employed by a major company in the late 60's This movie occurred a little before that. I was actually a teen when John Glen took his trip into space. I and many other blacks had no knowledge of this crew of women and how they contributed to the NASA project. In the late 60's, there were race riots and lots of racial conflicts. I remember in my senior year, Westinghouse Electric was located in a black community but had no black employees. They came to the black high schools and wanted the top 3 stenographers from each school to apply to their company. This was based on efforts from the community to hire black employees. We were tested. We all had to have 3.8-4.0 QPA's and be able to type 80-100 words per minute and transcribe at 100 wpm. I was 1 of the lucky ones. I had an academic diploma with business classes as my minor. Ten women were hired. I was so excited. But the minute I walked out on the floor, all eyes were on me. There were no black/white bathrooms, but we were pushed to the back of the line and not allowed to use the mirrors until all the white girls had left the restrooms. It wasn't a rule, but we were shoved to the back. We were laughed at and talked about in front of our faces. But under no circumstances was I going to allow somebody else to take this job away from me. We took it! We were treated like we were from a 3rd world country. The white girls didn't even know how to change the typewriter ribbons. Their typing speeds only had to be 45-50 to get in. Shucks, I had to be the best! I was awed to have typed on the IBM Selectric typewriter. The same one in the movie! But we had to care for their machines as well as our own. In high school we only had manuals. Eventually I went to Univ of Pgh. to study accounting at night. I took all of the courses required to get out of the steno pool, but was consistently turned down 10 years trying to become an Accounting Clerk. While whites with less education and less seniority were chosen over and over again over me. I had to type for the controller, because of my super fast, error free statistical typing skills while his secretary filed her nails and poured coffee. Of course, I was never paid what she made. To make a long story short, we black women stayed. Some of us for 40 years. It took years before we were looked at like humans--before people would talk to us, eat at the same lunch table, sometimes they would make us wait last to get on the elevators to go home. But over the course of 10- 40 years, we earned that respect. We did become manager secretaries. We did earn engineering degrees at night and worked our way up. We did end up with white women becoming our best friends. We became their bridesmaids instead of their maids. We went to their parties, instead of cleaning up after the parties. This movie may make some people uncomfortable, and perhaps you don't believe it was like that for smart black women, actually any black person. But believe me, I am a living witness at age 67 to recall the bigotry and hatred I once experienced as a young woman 18 years old, only to retire from the company with much respect. Many of my friends that started when I started, are still in touch. We always laugh and say ""We were the first."" Because we knocked down those walls of prejudice and differences and created a path for people of all colors to follow. I loved the movie. I only wished that those women had been recognized a little sooner for their contributions to the NASA PROJECT. The portrayal of bigotry and indifference is real. It really did happen in the 60's. As a child I remember the black/white bathrooms--not being allowed in Howard Johnson's on the turnpike and going shopping in the department store via the back warehouse door. Katherine was older than me. Did she run almost a mile to the bathroom? Maybe, maybe not. But don't judge this movie based on that. Some real prejudices were worse than that. History cannot be changed, only learned about. I am proud to be a part of that growing history along with Katherine.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Punches all my buttons: segregation, space, engineering, computers","I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for ""colored"" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, ""Hidden Figures,"" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human ""computers"" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As ""colored"" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Major Feel-Good Movie, just gets better as it goes along","In the opinion of this reviewer, an extraordinary achievement.The characters on which the film is based were special and unique on their own, and well deserving of the sort of semi-documentary films that Hollywood likes to serve up.However, to take that story and bump it up to a major ""feel-good film"" that engages the viewer from the getgo and does not let up until the very end of its 2 hour and 5 minute running time, THAT is what elevates this project to greatness.I want to be clear on this because it is important. There are two ways to do a feel-good film. One is (ironically!) by the numbers, using proved plot arcs and other script devices to make it work. An example of this for example is the latest Disney release MOANA which has taken some heat from critics for being derivative and not original. But that, you see, is the tried and true method to achieve the effect that the producers wanted. And it works.The other way to make a film engaging and fun is to use your instincts and your actors to get the most from each scene. No rule book, no fixed way of doing a scene, just doing what works. This is, I believe the way that writer/director Theodore Melfi set out to do Hidden Figures, and boy did he pull it off! The acting is stellar. Costner has matured in his latest film roles and his work here is as far from the nonsense he used to do (like the dreaded Robin Hood) as the earth is from the sun.Taraji P. Henson finally lands a great role, the kind of role she was looking for when she left the hit series Person of Interest a tad early.And every good film or TV series needs a character who is ""the glue"" or a reference point that the viewer can use, like a compass needle, to see where we are in the main story. Here Octavia Spencer gives the performance of her life as that ""glue"" and helps the director to pace the film.Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Really Good Movie,"Hidden Figures is a really good movie. I never read Margot Lee Shetterly's book, but I might now. This is a wonderful movie about civil rights, space travel, and new technology. It pulls in many different characters and personalities. Theodore Melt did a wonderful job directing. The story focus on the technical aspects. However the movie is never slow, it keeps moving and keeps you interested. The casting was good. Octavia Spencer, Taraji Henson, Janelle Mona, and Kevin Costner did an incredible job. There was also wonderful performances by Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst. Hidden Figures is a fun and exciting movie about advancement in ideas and technology. Its is also a very uplifting movie about bravery and taking chances. It is really good. I enjoyed it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Don't let ""Hidden Figures"" be a hidden treasure!","Appreciation. It's a condition which requires information and understanding and results in increased compassion, acceptance and inclusiveness. There are few ways to enhance appreciation for others more effectively than a well-made movie and the 2016 historical drama ""Hidden Figures"" (PG, 2:07) takes full advantage of that opportunity. Without being too busy or too preachy, this film helps the audience better appreciate the struggles of being a minority – and a working woman (and even a mother working outside the home) – in the early 1960s, the pressure involved in competing with the Soviet Union in the early years of the space race, the difficult challenges surrounding getting man into space (and returning him safely to earth) for the first time and the courage it required of those who were willing to go. That's a lot for one movie – and might be too much for many – but ""Hidden Figures"" is up to the challenge.The film is an adaptation of Margot Lee Shetterly's book of the same name and follows three black women who worked in NASA's computer section in 1961. That's not to say that they worked on computers – THEY were the computers. Back when electronic computers (with only a fraction of the capacity and speed of today's mainframes) took up an entire room – and were just beginning to be installed in places like NASA – talented mathematicians did calculations for the space program by hand.Dorothy Vaughn (Oscar winner Octavia Spencer) is a mathematician who is also mechanically-inclined, develops a talent for programming IBM computers and is a natural leader, but is denied a well-deserved supervisory position by NASA culture – and her supervisor (Kirsten Dunst). Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) is a brilliant mathematician who struggles to balance the demands of her increasing responsibilities at NASA with caring for her three young daughters whose father has passed away. Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) is an outspoken aspiring engineer who is held back from becoming an actual engineer because of her lack of education, which she has difficulty overcoming because of segregation.All three women make progress in their attempts to reach their goals and fulfill their potential, but with much difficulty, based on their gender and their race. Dorothy has been managing the women of the computer section for some time, but has to fight for the title and the pay – and even takes it upon herself to learn more about NASA's newly-arrived IBM computer, while understanding that doing so could eventually cost her and her co-workers their jobs. Mary continues to make valuable contributions to NASA's efforts, while trying to work through the catch-22 of needing additional education to become an engineer, with the only nearby school offering such classes refusing to accept any black students.But most of the screen time belongs to Katherine's story. As the most talented mathematician of all of NASA's human computers, she is called up to work in NASA's Space Task Group where she works directly with the standoffish Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) and is supervised by the group's director, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). Even as Katherine continues to demonstrate her capabilities, she is still subjected to drinking coffee from a pot labeled ""Colored"" and having to walk 20 minutes (each way) to the building where the nearest restroom for black females is located. Eventually, she earns the respect of her peers – and comes to the attention of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) himself, who comes to trust her calculations above all others. Katherine also attracts a different kind of attention from the commander of a local Army Reserve base, Lt. Col. Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali), who is also single. Embodying the dual meaning of the movie's title, Katherine works out the hidden figures needed for Glenn's mission and Jim doesn't mind that her figure is hidden beneath those unflattering 1960s dresses, as he comes to care more about her heart – and the very sharp mind hidden behind her even less flattering eye glasses.""Hidden Figures"" is a marvelously entertaining film. The script adaptation by Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi tells its true story accurately and engagingly, weaving its many story lines together seamlessly, educating and entertaining their audience throughout. Melfi also directs and uses his talented and award-worthy cast to thrill us, to make us cheer and give us moments of humor and just plain fun. I was impressed at how much this movie packed in without seeming cluttered, how much it affected me emotionally without being manipulative, and how much appreciation I gained for these women, their struggles and the importance of the times in which they lived and accomplished so much. It's also surprising that so little has been widely known about these women – until now. Don't let ""Hidden Figures"" be a hidden treasure. See it soon! It's out of this world.

"Evident Heroism, Hidden Doubts","This is one of those ""based on true events"" films that the moment you return from the theater you're going to hop on the internet and explore the story. That's a good sigh. Unfortunately, here the need to do some fact checking might not stem from all the right reasons.Hidden Figures is an upbeat, inspiring tale about the role three African-American women played in the NASA program during the early 60's. First Katherine Johnson (Henson), our lead, a gifted mathematician and human computer trying to carve out a roll in the Space Test Group. Second, Dorothy Vaughan (Spencer), leader of the ""colored computers."" She wants both the supervisor title she deserves and to survive the transition to IBM's mechanical computers. Finally Mary Jackson (Monae), who is trying to overcome discriminatory policies to become NASA's first female engineer. These women must meet challenges in the workplace then return home to more struggles African-Americans were fighting nationwide.Having the performances to anchor your character drama goes along way. Henson is solid, but Spencer is Oscar worthy and Monae's performance is part of a spectacular 2016. I will be on the lookout for more from this talent. Kudos to the supporting roles played by Ali and Costner. Beyond the highlight performances, the scenario is well worth a shot. We have seen heroes fighting against segregation. We have seen space race movies. The mix presents America at its finest and most appalling. A cute combo. The woman at the core are also very deserving of a chance in the sun. The problems creep in with presentation. The director/writer Melfi and co-writer Schroeder were clearly unsatisfied with the quiet, real nobility with which these woman conducted themselves. I cannot say if what the creators did is ethical, but the addition of obviously manufactured drama was a damning decision. This leads to some awkward trust issues. After watching some Hollywood like Johnson erupting at her boss's boss, it becomes more difficult to believe in the little things. Did Johnson really need to run a half a mile just to use the restroom? Or even the climax. On the day of the launch, did John Glenn trust Johnson's calculations over the IBM? It turns out only one of these inclusions are factual. Not the one you think, and perhaps the true story demonstrates more bravery.I'm not going to share any more of my digging here. Others asked the same questions and the answers are readily available. The point is after I watched Hidden Figures I wanted to learn if I had been lied too. Sad, because doubts are not what stories this wonderful deserve. Beyond this major stumble, Hidden Figures is well worth anyone's time. Educational, but entertaining. Positive without preachy. Family friendly in a genuine way. At the theater, I sat next to a nineish year old who kept asking her mother questions. The daughter was interested and wanted to follow every detail. The mother gave brisk answers not wanting to miss a moment. That's a true event, I swear, and the best praise for Hidden Figures I can muster.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Powerful and Inspiring,"Hidden Figures is a real gem of a film.First and foremost this is down to some incredible performances. Taraji P Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae were an absolute joy to watch. From the very first scene with all three of them on screen together, you just knew the film was going to be something special. All three of them were fantastic and I couldn't take my eyes off of them. The supporting cast were also great, but it really was all about these three talented actresses smashing it.The story is something very special too. It was one I knew nothing about, but am so glad I now know more about it thanks to this film. Hidden Figures tracks the careers of three women working at NASA at the height of the space race. The film is so inspiring as we witness their perseverance, their incredible spirit and talent, and their pioneering impact on humanity's exploration of space. This alone would have been impressive, but these women were able to achieve what they did in the face of gut wrenching sexism and racism. Hidden Figures does such a good job of shining a light on the racism and despicable attitudes that these women had to face, and as a result is a pretty tough watch at times.What also makes this film very special is the expertly crafted script. If, like me, you have no idea about science and maths, don't let that put you off. The script does a great way of simplifying things, so that you can appreciate the gravity and importance of what these women were doing, without getting bogged down in heavy exposition.I really could not recommend this film enough. Everything about it fits together so perfectly, from the direction to the acting to the score, its just such a good well rounded film.Watch Hidden Figures ASAP! You will not be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Black women in the space program film that gilds the lily,"We baby boomers remember the intensity of the space program very well, and it's brought home in ""Hidden Figures,"" a 2016 film starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spancer, Janelle Monae, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, and Jim Parsons.The acting in this inspiring story is excellent, natural, and low key.Based on a non-fiction book by Margot Lee Shetterly, the film is about three black women who entered the space program as mathematicians. At NASA they had a dual fight - not only were they black, but they were women in a man's world.The film shows the segregation and prejudice they encountered. It also shows a world just before computers came in, with space trajectories figured out in pencil. Totally amazing. The story culminates with - what else - John Glenn's historic orbiting of the earth.Fortunately for these brilliant, ambitious, and determined women, the prejudice shown in the film was actually overdone to make the story of their accomplishments stronger. Their accomplishments were pretty darned impressive anyway.In the film, Katherine (Henson) has to walk 40 minutes to the ""colored"" bathroom until her supervisor, Harrison (Costner) finds out about it.In truth, though this is something Mary (Monae) did encounter, Katherine didn't know about a segregated bathroom and used the regular one for years. Katharine, in fact, when interviewed, said that while prejudice existed underneath, in truth, everybody was concentrated on their work.Costner's character is a mixture of different people, as is often done in films. He didn't really allow Katherine into an important meeting - she started pushing to attend them, and did, beginning in 1958.When Mary goes to court so she can attend a white school at night, this didn't happen, though the school was segregated. She requested and received an exemption. You can see that would have looked pretty unexciting on film.I don't think embellishing incidents and creating new ones that don't hurt the true story is a bad thing - the screenwriters wanted to make a point and more importantly, since it is film, do something visually. I think they could have done it without every character so totally against these women.I'm white, and having worked in many offices, I can promise you there's a Jim Parsons character in every one no matter a woman's color. Back then men resented women in positions of authority. Probably many of them still do.The purpose of true stories told in film, I feel, is to get you interested in the topic and read about it. Anyone looking for complete accuracy is going to be sadly disappointed, as I think some of the reviewers on this board were.But in the end, we still had three amazing women working in the space program - and John Glenn did in fact ask Katherine to verify the IBM calculations before his launch. Pretty darned impressive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A powerful, inspirational movie.","The Americans are desperate to beat The Russians to get the first man into space, NASA plans to send John Glenn up, this film charts the role three African American women played in launching the rocket.I watched it when it first landed, and I enjoyed it just as much on a second viewing. It's uplifting, moving, and a hugely important story.I have always been fascinated by space travel, and by the key role that NASA played, but even the great organisation itself had its flaws.It highlights the significant level of racism that people ensured at the time, the segregation, the white and black amenities and facilities, it's sickening to watch now, but this is how people lived.The acting is terrific, every single performance is on point, every character matters, and has an important part to play. Octavia Spencer however, I think she steals the show, a performance that is genuinely captivating.It's a fascinating story, and a beautifully well made film, one that inspires and uplifts.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Well-meaning film undermined by inaccuracies,"The stories of the roles women played in the U.S. space program make for good counter-points to works such as 'The Right Stuff', which focused on the astronauts and the mission controllers (overwhelmingly male). 'Hidden Figures' presents the stories of three 'coloured' women (to employ a contemporaneous term used throughout the film) who worked for NASA at the dawn of the 'space-age'. Each of the three represented significant firsts for African American women in the space program: Mary Jackson became as an NASA engineer, Katherine Goble/Johnson as a high-level mathematician co-authoring research reports and Dorothy Vaughan as a supervisor (and later computer programmer). The women achieved these milestones through persistence, competence and drive and their stories deserve to be told and celebrated. Unfortunately, the movie chooses to make up facts and alter the time-line, presumably to make the story more dramatic. The whole '1/2 mile trip to the coloured toilet' is fiction, NASA had desegregated before the story takes place, and after the second or third trip, the scenes began to strike me as demeaning. The segment where Dorothy Vaughan, having read an introduction to Fortran, walks into the room containing the non-functioning IBM mainframe and immediately spots the problem (not plugged in?) is ridiculous. No one expects movies to be history lectures and telling complex stories in a couple of hours requires a lot of streamlining and consolidation (e.g. Kevin Costner's character is a composite of a number of senior NASA team-members), but making up significant events simply because they look good on screen undercuts the credibility of the story and is unpardonable in a movie that wants to be taken seriously (Harrison didn't exist, and if a metaphorical crowbar was taken to the ""colored"" bathroom sign, it was welded by Goble/Johnson). All of this is unfortunate, as the movie is (IMO) generally entertaining and presents a story worth telling. I was quite enjoying it until the IBM scene, which seemed so unlikely that I googled up the 'accuracy' of the film, and hit endless critical 'fact checking' sites (many neutral but some with an agenda). Like the dire ""Red Tails"" (2012), the filmmakers should have had more faith in their material (and their audience).",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
It made for an old-fashioned movie going experience...,"This is the true story of three African-American women who worked for NASA on the Mercury program in the early 1960s. Solid performances by all, some laugh-out-loud scenes, and some very emotional moments. It's also an important look back at the civil rights issues of the time period. The climax is a bit Apollo 13ish, and I'm fairly certain some scenes were embellished, but who cares. You should walk away from this film smiling, maybe even a bit choked up.And in spite of it being an overall positive experience, I could feel the oppression at certain points - Dorothy at the library just trying to find the right book, but it is in a part of the library to which she cannot gain admittance due to her race. Mary being reminded that she must sit in the back of the court room, again because of her race. Katherine runs across campus just to find a bathroom that she is allowed to use and never once complaining about it until she is publicly berated about her use of time. Kevin Costner's character appears to be a generally good person who doesn't care about race, and yet still never even thought about the difficulty of being forced into a certain bathroom half a mile away.You don't need to understand the mathematics to enjoy the film, but I admit, it was fun to hear some concepts I haven't heard since my college days.The theater was almost full, with people of all ages. I was particularly happy to see some kids there, as there is much for them to take away from this film.Twice during the movie the audience broke into applause, and then applauded at the end credits as well.

Never chooses to rise above its safely formulaic Hollywood trappings,"A well-meaning crowd-pleaser, with nice performances and a truly exceptional true story running things, that never chooses to rise above its safely formulaic Hollywood trappings.I found this movie's depictions of such clearly bigoted white people and their Civil Rights era forms of racism (colored bathrooms and coffee pots) that never really digs into the more insidious nature of institutional racism, to be problematic. This overtly racist world feels so far removed that it almost makes it seem like racism has been solved, that it's no longer an issue.All you have to do is be exceptional, a once in a lifetime genius, and racism won't be able to stand in your way. It suggests that black people do have to work harder and be superior in an obvious way in order to overcome, and this is never addressed in the movie.

A good showing of the discrimination shown the black people in the 60's - it was well represented but the story took front page. I love these women - they were mothers, wives and eventually recognized as experts in their field of math and coding. I grew up in the late 50 and 60's - so impressive that the three did not let anything hold them back. They did it quietly and with respected results - but this story should have been told in the 60's.

"Very uplifting and inspiring and one that I do highly recommend. One the family can, and probably should all watch together","""Look around. We are already living the impossible."" Katherine Johnson (Henson) is one of the smartest mathematicians in the world. She works as a computer for NASA at the height of the space race. Needing to answer back after Russia sent Sputnik into space the US is readying to send a man into space, but are struggling with finding a way to bring him home. It ultimately took a group of unlikely employees to accomplish the mission and show the world what America is capable of. This is a movie that I have heard nothing but good things about since it was released. When a movie is talked about as much as this and in such a positive light it is difficult for it to live up to the hype, usually. This one came close. I will admit this wasn't really what I expected though. I really expected this to focus more on the racial tensions that the women went though. While that did play a large part in this it seemed that that aspect was an afterthought. I'm not saying that's a bad thing though. The movie seemed to focus more on Johnson and the others proving themselves through her job to the point of being needed, regardless of gender or skin color. That is a lesson everyone needs to learn. As for the movie itself. It is very uplifting and inspiring and one that I do highly recommend. One the family can, and probably should all watch together.

"Exceptional, Jarring, and Thought-Provoking Unsung Heroes","Not knowing what to expect, I checked out to see how the story of three female individuals made a difference at NASA back in 1961. I've witnessed in past historical dramas of where racism included violence, but that is not the case regarding Hidden Figures. Rather it focused more on how it was overcome in casual, everyday life (especially the workplace).The story revolves around three brilliant African-American women by the names of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson as they live their lives working at NASA among a nearly all-white staff. Despite segregation still circulating at the time, each of them proved that no matter what color they were, it's their intellect and willpower that got them through each obstacle of the day and also helped make history for astronaut John Glenn to be the first American astronaut to completely orbit the Earth.With an interesting balance of wit and drama, I found its tribulations to be the main focus. Since the movie was based on true events, to me it felt like a wonderful tie-in to the 2014 drama ""Selma"" since that too revolved around a time when people marched to spread the word of ending segregation. But unlike Selma where black people and Dr. Martin Luther King fought for the right to vote, Hidden Figures tackled both the obstacles of racism and even sexism in of all places NASA. It was very jarring to see that despite the characters' extensive knowledge in their work and upon receiving their own respective degrees in their studies, it's still looked down upon by the self- righteous higher-ups. Taraji P. Henson (Empire) sure brought out a splendid performance as mathematician Katherine Johnson. Likewise for her costars Octavia Spencer (The Help) and Janelle Monae as they helped balance the drama, including sass to boot. Kevin Costner and 'Big Bang Theory' star Jim Parsons also helped give some depth (though I wouldn't call them antagonists) in these women's lives.Personally, I enjoyed the events that unfolded overall. When it came to the racial undertones and confrontations in a few scenes, myself and a few others in the theater old or young were left curious and appalled at the same time by how this was a thing in the 1960s compared to the present.

Implausible in places, like when Dorothy ""fixes"" the computer, it would not be possible without knowing the machine architecture. The men, apart from Harrison, were made to look stupid.

Exceeded my expectations!,"The performances by Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monáe,and Kevin Costner were compelling. Taraji P. Henson was superb. The story line is remarkable and that it is based on a true story makes it so meaningful.Aside from the fact that I thought it was well made, strong story line and fantastic chemistry between these characters, it may have resonated more with me from the professions they help, their individual self respect for self and one another, and how they looked beyond their perceived lot in life. To the really life women who the story is about, how courageous you all were and how important was your work.

Heartening and disheartening all at the same time.,"Disheartening because of the horrible racial prejudice shown - hard to believe that things were like they were. Heartening because of the undoubted success these three women made of their lives, and of course they are a representation of what countless others did.My one criticism of the film is that I find it hard to believe that some of the situations presented actually happened. Did the Costner character really not see the kettle marked ""coloured""? Was it really a trek to the bathroom?But this can only be a minor criticism and surely represent the prevailing attitudes of the days in parts of the USA - and lets be honest still in existence in many other parts of the world today. In this sense the film is a salutary reminder of how insidious prejudice can be.An entertaining, moving and sobering film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not a film to remain hidden,"Wanted to see as many 2016 films as possible, especially those that won or were nominated for the big awards. 'Hidden Figures' also had the further interest on being based on an incredible true story, with just as incredible people, set during a very interesting and still hard-hitting period of history.'Hidden Figures' was one of the best-received films of the year critically and it is not hard to see why. Not saying that it's perfect or one of my favourites of all time, and it won't work, and has not worked, for everybody. Can definitely see the criticisms directed against it, or at least a few of them. There are a lot of exceptional elements here too that make it an illuminating and entertaining film that is hard to dislike regardless of any factual inaccuracies and distortions.The film is very well made, beautifully shot with the 60s setting recreated and evoked expertly. The direction keeps things moving while giving some breathing space, allowing the character interaction and situations to shine through (and shine through they do) and making the most of the story and period. The music is a dynamic fit.Particularly good here are the performances, with Octavia Spencer and especially Taraji P. Henson giving two of the year's best performances. Kirsten Dunst is given her meatiest material in years and her performance is one of her best, likewise with Kevin Costner. The three lead characters are ones you root for all the way, ones you laugh with, are moved by and are inspired by. Katherine in particular.Much of the script sparkles in sharpness, wit and insight. Parts are amusingly absurd which provides a levity that stops the film from becoming overly-serious. Parts make one reach for the tissues. Parts make one angry in a way that is appropriate. And throughout a great job is done honouring these characters while not making them complete saints.Not everything works. The colleague characters, though acted very well, are nowhere near as interesting or well developed. They are instead too one-dimensional and pat, with only Costner's character showing a glimpse of any kind of an open mind.It does get a little heavy-handed, a hard trap to avoid with the subject matter and period and credit is due not trivialising segregation. Especially true in most of the characterisation being too neat, parts that are a little preachy and the coloured bathroom running gag getting a little repetitive. Personally wouldn't call 'Hidden Figures' offensive, more that subtlety isn't a strong suit.Overall, very well done, not a film to remain hidden and does inspire to read more about the story, the characters and the period. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Simply Hard to Believe,"The movie made most whites look bad and all blacks look smart. That by itself, is racial, but let's think a minute about the 1950's. There weren't 20 or so Black Female Mathematicians in America during this time that could do analytic geometry,much less all in Huntsville, Al. They didn't even teach analytic geometry in Black schools back then. A real stretch was the woman picking up a book on FORTRAN and after reading it made an IBM computer work when Techs from IBM couldn't. That is so insulting it made me laugh. By the way, where are these kind of mathematical geniuses today? No where, because there are none. I think this movie took very large liberties with the story. Still, the movie was entertaining, just impossible to believe.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Delightful and powerful from start to finish,"To answer my question brought about in the intro of this review, 'Hidden Figures' falls in the ranks of being a titan in its class. This film brings on an array of emotions throughout the duration of its run time. From delightful happiness, to laughter, to anger, and more. Overall though, it was a pure delight and feel-good film to witness and enjoy. The story is empowering to see what these three women overcame during their life and stopped at nothing to achieve what they set their minds to. For a dialogue heavy drama, I was impressed by how attention-grabbing the story of 'Hidden Figures' was. Usually, I have a tendency to lose focus on dramas but this film did such a great job at delivering a captivating performance of the story through the multitude of emotions it presented to the audience... The cast of 'Hidden Figures' all are such powerhouse performances during their respective screen time. Easily, my favorite was Taraji P. Henson, the ""star"" of the film, so to speak, all though surrounded by other equally powerful actors and actresses. Alongside of her, Kevin Costner had a great performance and very memorable one on top of it for me. If there were any negatives I can truly put together for 'Hidden Figures', it may be that I feel Janelle Monáe's character was a bit underplayed with the screen-time given to Taraji's and Octavia's, but it was still an enjoyable performance to witness.A rightful film deserving of its 2017 Oscar nominations. 'Hidden Figures' is a delightful film to watch with a story that captivates its audience through an array of emotions.

Best movie I've seen in a long time!,"Based upon a true story about the people behind the scenes at NASA in the early 1960's, it has something for the whole family--fantastic writing, award-winning performances, historically accurate events, settings and fashion.The movie is kid-friendly, and presents a restrained introduction to discrimination issues of the day.

Hidden Figures,"Someone commented that this movie was almost of an Oscar winning quality if it was not so length. This is besides the point. The real argument for this movie is that it details the facts about African Americans contributions to the collective efforts of everyone who made it possible for the Astronauts to venture into space. Most importantly, in a society that has made attendant efforts to discredit African American's knowledge even in the study and field of the sciences. Consequently, this movie gives the general populace a clear understanding of the contributions of these 3 African American women as an affirmation that no race is essentially gifted beyond others and particularly not beyond African Americans who have in all aspects of American history stood head to head with other races in every aspect of development regardless of the immense efforts by some to malign them as inferior or lazy people.Lastly, this movie along with others in similar categories is an affirmation to young African Americans that those who came before them have done better and they must endeavor to follow in those footsteps not minding the systematic lies that has been continually perpetrated by certain elements in the American society against African Americans.PMG",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Engaging Story of Endurance,"This film gives us a set of characters that I never knew existed. They were women involved as ""computers"" during the early days of the space program. We get to know each of them a bit. Unfortunately, they are defined a bit too much by their work. It would have been interesting to get into more of the day to day pressures they experienced when they were not at NASA. With that said, it still is interesting to see what went on and how they strove for dignity and acceptance in the face of racial prejudice. Of course, NASA was (is) in the South, so hanging over everything are all the things that those who simply lived normal lives had to deal with. I understand that the whole thing with running to the bathroom was fiction. But it made a point. The writing on the blackboard and standing on a ladder is visual, but it was more likely done in notebooks or on pieces of paper. Did an entire group of these women march into the IBM computer room and take over? Probably not en masse. But I gave it a nine because it was a hallmark in showing us what these ladies, who were every bit as competent as their white counterparts, had to do to get respect. The movie is touching and exciting. I was pleased to see the events surrounding John Glenn's historic flight. I remember as a high school kid, how much we feared for his fate. The performers are quite delightful in their own ways. I thought the relationships with the husbands and husbands to be were a bit too contrived, but that's fine. We weren't there. See this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Well made historical film.,"Based on true events, the film takes place in 1961 and three African American woman, Katherine(Taraji P. Henson) Dorothy(Octavia Spencer) and Mary(Janelle Monae) who all go to work for NASA in the beginning of the space program, when they are trying to get a man in space. The woman are all very smart, but struggle to deal with racism and sexism.A very well made true story, now I'm sure that some things where creative for the film. I liked the 60's setting, Henson, Devine, and Monae all give great Oscar worthy performances. Kevin Costner really shows his strong commanding presence in the film, he is so good you feel he is your boss. Jim Parsons(The Big Bang Theory) is alright, does not get much to do. Kirsten Dunst is also quite impressive. I also liked to watch the beginning of the space program.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Great work of fiction, with a few real events","I didn't watch this to be entertained, though I was. I watched it to be educated. At some point I thought the film was being overly dramatic and doubted that the events happened the way they did. What I have found is that few of those really dramatic moments even happened.I was not watching this to see African American women experiencing discrimination and not being taken seriously (although I halfway expected women not to be taken seriously). I watched this to see strong intelligent women accomplishing a lot for the U. S. space program. And to some extent, I saw that. Maybe things didn't happen quite the way the movie says they did, but the scenes with Katherine Johnson doing the complicated math were quite effective. And I learned about a group of women called ""computers"" back when people hadn't yet learned to think of the word as referring to machines. I may have learned details of the specifics of discrimination and the protests that I didn't know.Most of the scenes showing the women being treated as less than equal never happened, but if we pretend they did then they were quite well done. Maybe there was a little too much focus on what the women went through, which they may have, but not at the time depicted.I'm not familiar with Taraji Henson but I didn't have to be. She became Katherine Johnson for me and that's all that mattered. And a great job she did. Imagine learning all that math! Maybe she had something like cue cards but that couldn't have been easy. Memorizing lines is one thing, but complex math?I know Octavia Spencer better. The role that stands out the most for me was a nurse for troubled teens in a short-lived series. Here she inspired confidence and wouldn't let anyone stop her. Did Dorothy Vaughan really get the computer (machine) to work when no one else could? Who cares? It was great to watch. And she taught the women she ""supervised"" very well. At least the way this movie tells the story, the women taught those men a thing or two.Janelle Monae was also inspiring but we didn't get to see much of what she did, and we should have.The strikes meant CBS had to have a backup plan until scripted series were ready. As a result, I've come to see a very different Kevin Costner than the good but tough guy depicted in this movie. But the rich ranch owner was actually a good guy too. How can Costner be anything else? Here, he was threatening people but being very reasonable, with justified demands for changes that should have taken place. People were warned about him but his demanding nature was actually not scary.And Jim Parsons did what he does so well: Playing an intelligent jerk who hates being told he's not perfect. Although I'm used to a more likable version who is at the same time quick to insult his inferiors. Here, his character doesn't really seem all that smart because Katherine Johnson seems to do his job better than he does, and that's just not right! But we know he must be good at his job in order to be one of the elite, and we just don't get to see it.Glen Powell (interesting coincidence) made a great John Glenn.The man Katherine ended up marrying was too nice and too good looking to be believed. Good job, though. Her kids were also likable too.I won't give away too much but one of the final scenes will have you on the edge of your seat like with the events of Apollo 13. Amazing! And all of the scenes showing news coverage of the space program were quite effective. I will say I was expecting more, but this movie focuses on a much shorter time period than I had expected.Great looking cars, though I would have been happier with older cop cars. Both cop cars shown (might have been the same one twice) were from several years after the events of the movie, and by that time cars didn't look quite as good.Family friendly? I did see that the movie was edited for TV, and there's nothing too concerning in what I saw. Kids in school should see this as part of their education.Regardless of whether it was real history, it was a fine effort.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Love it until I realised it is fiction,"I feel rather stupid believing this movie, which is little more than a propaganda piece, and is so factually incorrect that it is little more than a fairy story.Now that I've done some research it seems that this is a long way from the truth. In other words, it is just history rewritten.This trend of rewriting history to fit a modern day narrative is becoming all too common and is shameful.It is worrying that people can go to the cinema, as I did, watch this, and go home thinking that what it depicts really happened, when just a small amount of reading up on the topic clearly shows that it didn't happen in the way this movie portrays it.It would be nice to see a more accurate version of the story at some point, but I won't hold my breath.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
What an Inspiration!,"This absolutely fantastic film will inspire so many people to never give up on their dreams and talents. It shows that you can do anything if you put your mind to it.The movie takes place in the 1960s where sexism and racial discrimination is still at a high. There is fear of the Soviet Union since they already have the technology to send astronauts into space, though there is still hope for America. This is a true story which revolves around three extremely intelligent African-American women - Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) and Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) who all work for the NASA program. They are the brains behind the launch of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell). The woman struggle with using their brilliance since they live in a world where the color of their skin defines who they are and who they are not going to be.The acting is fabulous! Taraji P. Henson is made to play Katherine Johnson. Taraji highlights the braveness and intelligence of her character, adding a bit of a quirky side as well. I feel that I know her character like a friend. Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) is my favorite character out of them all. She has this determination in her that is mind blowing. She can be very serious at times, but one of the most hilarious people at others. Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) definitely takes on the leader role. When watching this film you feel for her struggles and want her to succeed so badly. Octavia brings boldness and sarcasm that just makes you adore her. I felt the strong friendship between these woman.I could tell how much time was spent in designing the set and costumes. The sets are so realistic that I felt transformed into that time period. I loved looking at the small details added to each set. Renee Ehrlich Kalfus designed the costumes which are so colorful and suit each character perfectly. It is so interesting to see how different the clothes were back then. The costumes helped add to it being the 60s.My favorite scene is when Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) breaks down the colored woman's bathroom sign to show that everyone can share the same restroom. Al Harrison is the head of the NASA launch program. This is my favorite scene because I loved seeing someone who looked beyond the color of people's skin.The main message of this film is to never give up on your dreams, even when people tell you that you can't. The three woman look beyond their gender and their skin color. They look at the talents they have. One example of this is when Katherine Johnson is talking to Jim Johnson. Jim is surprised as to why they are having a woman do such important things at NASA. Katherine retorts with an inspiring line ""Yes they let women do some things at NASA Mister Johnson. And it's not because we wear skirts. It's because we wear glasses!"" I recommend this film for ages 9 to 18. The younger audiences will enjoy learning about the past and be inspired to shoot for the stars. The older audiences will like the comedy and the amazing story. I give this film a 5 out of 5 astronaut stars.Reviewed by Talia J., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst dot org.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
review of reviews,"There are reviews of this movie with pretty low ratings and the reasons that follow have to do with what the person feels is an overstated sense of racism at NASA at this point in time. Segregation, and hence racism in Virginia was enforced BY LAW, so you need to understand that first. There is some good fact checking that has been done about NASA, these women and that time period, and even though this movie is overstated a little, there are commenters who have said that racism pretty much didn't exist in NASA because they were focused on the mission. Well, that's far from true also. The movie does take poetic license on how it's applied and to who the effects were felt the most. For instance, this is from one site that checked the story and got details:Did Katherine have to run across the NASA Langley campus to use the bathroom? Not exactly. In Margot Lee Shetterly's book, this is something that is experienced more by Mary Jackson (portrayed by Janelle Monáe) than Katherine Johnson. Mary went to work on a project on NASA Langley's East Side alongside several white computers. She was not familiar with those buildings and when she asked a group of white women where the bathroom was, they giggled at her and offered no help. The closest bathroom was for whites. Humiliated and angry, Mary set off on a time-consuming search for a colored bathroom. Unlike in the movie, there were colored bathrooms on the East Side but not in every building. The sprint across the campus in the movie might be somewhat of an exaggeration, but finding a bathroom was indeed a point of frustration.As for Katherine Johnson herself, Shetterly writes that when Katherine started working there, she didn't even realize that the bathrooms at Langley were segregated. This is because the bathrooms for white employees were unmarked and there weren't many colored bathrooms to be seen. It took a couple years before she was confronted with her mistake, but she simply ignored the comment and continued to use the white restrooms. No one brought it up again and she refused to enter the colored bathrooms.Another point that was made is that Katherine Johnson said she didn't FEEL racism while she was working there. You need to read in detail to understand that racism was present, although maybe not prevalent. But, what a person FEELS is unique and I know what she meant. She meant that she was wrapped up with the work and her feelings about THAT overrode any other feelings she may have had. It doesn't mean she didn't SEE racism. She CHOSE to feel the positives, since EVERY human controls their feelings whether they know it or not. You either do it actively or passively.What is TRUE is these women DID face racism at NASA, and if you think they were treated or paid like a white man working at NASA, you are pretty out of touch with the 40s-60s Southern US, which still does it's best to find subtle ways to provide more advantage to whites. I could give a few examples right here where I live, such as closing any licensing offices in predominately black areas so if they want to get an ID they have to make a very long trip, followed by passing ID laws. Subtle.They happened to be incredibly smart and NASA needed them so they accepted them even though they were black, but they weren't treated the same. The site I visited was History vs Hollywood. A good read there will fill you in to the reality of the story. For me personally, considering I KNOW how much humility, control and pride swallowing they had to go through to even be employed, I can kind of forgive the screen writing of variations of the truth, because they were surrounded by racism at the very least in many subtle ways and in some cases very overt ways. Of course the three women felt it and experienced it in different ways.Go read before you write a review blasting it for its display of racism. Frankly, it would have been a biased movie to protect the feelings of the white audience if they DIDN'T show it, and it would have been more disingenuous than the slight exaggerations that ended up in the screenplay, and THAT would have been done to sell tickets and discs.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Must see Movie,"Our actual history is filled with people and events that we just never learned about. ""Hidden Figures"" is one of those movies that shines a light on three brilliant and amazing women and their unheralded contribution to the space program.Katherine Coleman Goble Johnson - Dorothy Johnson Vaughan - and Mary Jackson were brilliant and driven and contributed greatly through their knowledge of mathematics and computer languages.Taraji P. Henson - Octavia Spencer - and Janelle Monáe portray them with power and grace. There is a hunger that comes from living in a time and place where they know they will never be able to really show how intelligent and relevant they are. They balance that yearning with the day-to-day trappings of a mother/wife.Aldis Hodge and Mahershala Ali show the balancing act of being a strong black man in Virginia in 1961 with the reality of their life outside of their community.Kevin Costner - a bit ham-fisted at times - still gave one of the most subtle performances of his career. Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons also elevated their games to fit into this stellar cast.The ensemble was strong - not a week link in that chain. The writing and directing were sound - seamless. Theodore Melfi's deft touch let the players and the script sparkle. Mandy Walker's cinematography was perfect - simply perfect.This movie better grab a handful of those golden statues.

Well made but flawed at its core,"Every year around this time we get at least one film that focuses on race. The reason it usually comes out at this time of year is that the Academy Awards eat it up and it receives multiple nominations. The same thing happens with the holocaust as a subject almost every year without fail. I have no problem with this. If that's what people like in their films then c'est la vie. The problem only occurs when the film starts entirely falling back on the race factor. When the entire purpose becomes showing how evil the white man is, and how special black people are simply because they are black.I read a quote from the real-life Katherine Johnson saying she couldn't understand why anyone would want to make a film about her life. In a way she makes a very valid point. Making a film about this lady is in its own way a little bit racist. It's saying this story is film-worthy simply because she was black. This will probably pass over most audience member's heads, but anyone who stops and thinks about it will realise this is actually quite insulting.As far as being watchable goes the film is actually very good. The two hour run time flies by and there are some very well laid out scenes that impressively get across the message the film is trying to sell. There is also some very fine acting, particularly from Taraji P. Henson. In one scene in particular, around the midway point, she completely blew away.I think this film would have worked as a story on its own, even putting aside the race factor. The fact that its in there does add another level to the film, but I'm not entirely sure it was necessary.

Excellent Performances Highlight Nice Drama,"Hidden Figures (2016)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Katharine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) are three black women working at NASA where they face certain segregation issues. When Russia gets a man into space, the U.S. kick it up a gear and Katharine is selected to help due to her math skills and soon all three women are breaking new ground.HIDDEN FIGURES tells a true story and the title certainly fits because I'm going to guess that a lot of people weren't aware of who these three women were. Everything a film comes out that is based on a true story some people break out the tired ""it isn't 100% accurate"" debates. Well, this movie isn't a documentary. It's a docu-drama so it's obvious that certainly things are going to be altered for dramatic purposes so attacking the film for changing a few things is just silly.As far as the film goes, it's certainly a crowd-pleaser as you get a terrific story, three strong women to look up to and of course some great performances. The performances are certainly the key to the film's success because the screenplay offers up all three characters a lot of development and thankfully the actors pull off their parts. Henson certainly deserved an Oscar-nomination that was robbed by Meryl Streep. She certainly gives one of the best, the strongest and one of the most emotionally powerful performances of the year. I'm willing to bet years from now her performance will still be remembered while Streep's is forgotten.The supporting cast is terrific as well with Spencer once again delivering a very good performance in the role of a woman who pretty much allows herself to walked over until she sees what standing up can do. Monae is also wonderful in her supporting bit and offers up some much needed comedy relief. Kirsten Dunst is also very good in her role as an obvious racist. Then you've got Kevin Costner offering up his strongest performance in years as Katharine's boss who is willing to break rules to get the job done.HIDDEN FIGURES is technically very impressive with a rousing score, some great cinematography and plenty of nice direction throughout. If you're a fan of mainstream movies meant to make you stand up a cheer then you've got a winner here.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Another story that needs to be told,"Greetings again from the darkness. The space program has created many iconic images over the years: rhesus monkeys in space suits, the Mercury 7 Astronauts press conference, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin erecting a flag on the moon, and numerous Space Shuttle missions – some successful, others quite tragic. We've even been privy to cameras inside the space station and the NASA control center. Despite all of that, director Theodore Melfi's (St Vincent, 2014) latest film uncovers a part of history to which most of us knew nothing of.Adapted from the book by Margot Lee Shetterly, the film stuns us with the story of the ""Colored Computers""  the African-American female mathematicians who manually checked and cross-checked the endless calculations, formulas and theories required to launch a rocket into space and bring it (and the astronaut) back home. It's a crowd-pleasing history lesson and an overdue tribute to, and celebration of, three intelligent women of color who played crucial roles in the success of the American space program We first meet a young Katherine Johnson as a child math prodigy whose school can't provide her the challenge she needs. Next we see her as a bespectacled adult (Taraji P Henson) on the side of the road beside a broken down car with her friends and co-workers Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (musician Janelle Monea). They are on their way to work at Langley in the computing department. Dorothy is the ad hoc supervisor of the group and is in a non-stop battle for the title and increased pay that comes with the job. Mary is the razor-tongued one who is striving to overcome all of the obstacles on her way to becoming the first female African American Engineer at NASA. These are good friends and smart women caught up in the racism and sexism of the times and of the organization for which they work.Soon, Katherine is promoted to the Space Task Group run by Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). This is a group of true rocket scientists, and Katherine is charged with checking and confirming their work  a thankless job for anyone, but especially for a black woman in the early 1960's. Her supervisor (Jim Parsons) refuses to give her the necessary security clearance – huge portions of the work are redacted, making it increasingly difficult for Katherine to run the numbers. This is a seemingly accurate and grounded portrayal of racism in the workplace. At the time, racism and sexism were mostly woven into the fabric of society  it's ""just the way things are"". It's almost a passive-aggressive environment with separate coffee pots and restrooms clear across campus.There are numerous sub-plots – probably too many. We even get an underdeveloped romance between Katherine and a soldier named Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali, so great in this year's Moonlight). We follow Mary as she goes to court in pursuit of the right to attend the college that offers the engineering courses required for her certification. We see Dorothy with her kids, as well as her ongoing head-butting with her condescending supervisor (Kristen Dunst), who claims to have nothing against 'you people'. Dorothy's response is clever, crowd-pleasing and a reminder that this is an air-brushed version of reality  but also a view that we rarely see. As the Mercury Project progresses, we see how Harrison (Costner) is so focused on getting the job done, that he is oblivious to the extra challenges faced by Katherine – that is until her emotions erupt in a scene that will have Henson under Oscar consideration.The slow implementation of the first IBM mainframe is important not just to NASA, but also to Dorothy and her team. They see the future and immediately start self-training on Fortran so that they are positioned for the new world, rather than being left behind. Eye-opening sequences like this are contrasted with slick mainstream aspects like no slide-rules (not very camera friendly, I guess), stylish and expensive clothing for the underpaid women, and a steady parade of sparkling classic cars in vibrant colors – no mud or dents in sight. Sure, these are minor qualms, but it's these types of details that distract from the important stories and messages.The film does a nice job of capturing the national pride inspired by the Mercury project, and astronauts such as John Glenn (played here by Glen Powell, Everybody Wants Some!!). It even works in some actual clips and captures the pressure brought on by the race to space versus the Russians. There is an interesting blend of Hans Zimmer's score and the music of Pharrell Williams that gives the film a somewhat contemporary feel despite being firmly planted in the 60's. This mostly unknown story of these women is clearly about heroes fighting the daily battles while maintaining exemplary self-control. It offers a positive, upbeat and inspirational message  believe in yourself, and don't pre-judge others. Don't miss the photos over the closing credits, and don't hesitate to take the family to the theatre over the holidays.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Genius has no race,"People tend to believe that only men can work in NASA. But are women also able to do it? This question is perfectly answered in a film ""Hidden figures"" by Theodore Melfi which is based on a true story about three female African-American mathematicians in NASA.""Hidden figures"" tells cinema audience about a trio of NASA scientists, each of them playing an important role in sending the astronaut John Glenn into space in 1962. Although each female lead is given their own plot lines, However, the biggest attention is paid to Katherine. At the beginning of the film, she actually looks like a hidden figure. But thanks to her talent, persistence and extremely hard work as clearly seen during the whole film, she becomes one of the main people, without whose contribution John Glenn's flight wouldn't have taken place.I've never heard about the story of this strong and will-powered woman. ""Hidden figures"" has helped me to find out Katherine's struggle for women's rights to be equal at work not only with men but with all white people. Another fact that I learnt from the film is that Katherine was an incredible mother although she was a single parent with an intensive workload; she gave her children attention, energy and warmth after a hard-working day. Such overresponsibility and resilience positively affected her work: she did all the calculations flawlessly which contributed into her acknowledgment and further victory over racism and segregation.Overall, I'm sure that this inspiring story is a must-see for all women in order to understand how hard and long the way not to be a hidden figure in your profession is despite your doing it perfectly and with love. Katherine's persistence in combination with her maternal qualities can present a lead to follow.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Unveiling the Unseen Stars: ""Hidden Figures"" Shines Bright","""Hidden Figures,"" a captivating cinematic masterpiece, delves into the untold story of the remarkable black female mathematicians who played pivotal roles in America's space program during the tumultuous 1960s. Directed by Theodore Melfi, this inspiring tale showcases a perfect blend of historical accuracy, heartwarming performances, and a triumphant celebration of courage and intellect.Set against the backdrop of the Space Race, the film follows the lives of three extraordinary women: Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe). Navigating through a time when gender and racial discrimination were rampant, these brilliant minds defied the odds, proving that talent knows no color or gender boundaries.The film's strengths lie in its masterful storytelling, adeptly balancing the struggles faced by these women in their professional and personal lives. The script, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly, brilliantly weaves together historical facts and captivating character arcs, making it both engaging and informative.The performances in ""Hidden Figures"" are nothing short of phenomenal. Taraji P. Henson's portrayal of Katherine Johnson is mesmerizing, exuding intelligence and resilience that immediately connect the audience to her character's journey. Octavia Spencer, as Dorothy Vaughan, brings a powerful blend of determination and wit to her role, while Janelle Monáe adds a touch of charm and tenacity to her portrayal of Mary Jackson.The supporting cast, led by Kevin Costner as Al Harrison and Jim Parsons as Paul Stafford, deliver compelling performances, adding depth to the narrative and highlighting the challenges faced by these women in a male-dominated space program.Furthermore, ""Hidden Figures"" successfully captures the essence of the era through its visually stunning cinematography and an enchanting soundtrack that transports the audience back to the 1960s. The attention to detail in recreating the historical settings is commendable, immersing viewers in the world of early space exploration and civil rights activism.However, the film isn't just about space missions and technical prowess; it poignantly portrays the societal struggles these women faced on a daily basis. It challenges viewers to reflect on the persistent biases that marginalized individuals have endured throughout history and the impact of their resilience in breaking through barriers.At its core, ""Hidden Figures"" is a powerful tribute to unsung heroes whose contributions paved the way for progress and equality in STEM fields. It serves as an inspiration to dream big, defy limitations, and embrace diversity, as these are the very factors that drive innovation and human achievement.In conclusion, ""Hidden Figures"" stands as an extraordinary cinematic achievement. It educates, entertains, and inspires, leaving audiences with a sense of wonder and admiration for the extraordinary minds that reshaped history. This heartfelt tribute to unsung heroes deserves its place among the stars in Hollywood's constellation of great films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Inspirational and Motivating,"Hidden Figures is an uplifting movie set in the 1960s, that sheds light on the frequently underappreciated contributions of African-American women to the early years of the American space program. This film was written by Margot Lee Shetterly, an African American author from Hampton, Virginia. The film presents a compelling narrative that skillfully combines history, science, and social justice. The brilliant mathematicians and engineers at NASA are portrayed by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe in outstanding performances that give life to the characters and make their struggles and victories incredibly relatable. The discrimination these women endured because of their race and gender in 1960s segregated America is depicted in the movie with skill. It emphasizes their determination, courage, and exceptional abilities, which ultimately broke down barriers and assisted America in making significant strides in space exploration. By reminding us of the countless untold tales of people who made a significant contribution to our world, ""Hidden Figures"" effectively communicates the significance of diversity and inclusion in science and technology fields. This film shows great examples of un-invisibility and how people of color had to prove themselves to have a voice in society.During the production of Hidden Figures, Margot said that it had been a whirlwind for her because the film rights were optioned before the book was even published. She talks about how before the movie was even made the producer called her and told her they wanted to make a movie on it and she had to deliver a book that wasn't written yet. Margot would receive drafts of the scripts and point out flaws, but the producer insisted that she and the process be trusted. Margot was ultimately happy that she did because she adored the result.By showing how the contributions of African-American women in significant roles at NASA were historically disregarded and marginalized, the film Hidden Figures successfully conveys the idea of un-invisibility. Despite playing crucial roles in the success of the space program, these women were made invisible not only because of their gender but also because of their race. They also lived in a segregated society where their achievements were frequently discounted or ignored. By pushing past the barriers of un-invisibility, challenging the general stereotypes and biases, and ultimately demanding recognition for their significant contributions, which were instrumental in advancing science and space exploration, they overcame the barriers of hyper invisibility.Finally, I believe Margot Lee Shetterly did an amazing job with the book which later portrayed how people of color were treated in a workplace in the 60s regardless of the impactful work they were doing in the movie as well. I also think if one has not seen the film or read the book they should, not only because it was truly well done but because it gives a better understanding about the type of situations a person of color was put in and how little they were thought of by others, as well as not getting enough recognition for the groundbreaking work they were doing that later led to history being made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Putting the Race into Space Race,"As a child of the early 60s, the 'Space Race', as started by John F. Kennedy in his famous speech announcing that America would put a man on the moon before the decade was out, is something that is still inherently thrilling to me. As also illustrated in many films, for example ""Pride"", and TV series, such as ""Life on Mars"", the 60s and 70s were also a world away in social terms for where we find ourselves 50 years later. Looking back today at the casual racism and sexism of that time is quite shocking. Seeing some parents bringing their child into the cinema to see ""Hidden Figures"" it made me appreciate just how alien some of the scenes on the screen would be to a child. Why would Black people only be able to use a ""colored bathroom""? Why would a black person in a room full of white people have to drink from their own coffee pot? Why would it be so strange for a woman to hold a senior position in the organisation?This is the backdrop behind ""Hidden Figures"". It's NASA in 1962 and the race is on with the Russians to get the first person into orbit around the Earth. Getting the first person into space has already been lost after Yuri Gagarin's Vostok 1 success. But the Americans are not only struggling with the rocketry, which has a nasty habit of exploding spectacularly on the launchpad. They are also struggling with the mathematics required to successfully place a craft into orbit and, crucially, allow it to re-enter the atmosphere without burning up: America needs a successful mission, and to see a pilot with 'The Right Stuff' descending to earth in a blazing crock-pot on live TV is not part of the planned PR exercise!Enter three unexpected heroes in the form of Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button""), Dorothy Vaughn (Octavia Spencer, ""The Help"", ""Insurgent"") and May Jackson (Janelle Monáe, ""Moonlight""). The three friends are all struggling in different ways at NASA's Langley Research Center to be recognised in the system that – as black women – is severely biased against them. Central to the story is Johnson, a widowed mother of two, whose maths genius becomes key to unlocking the safe return of John Glenn. The secondary stories have Jackson having to go legal to get to be the first African American engineer in NASA (unbelievable!) and Vaughn, in probably the least dramatic storyline, struggling to be recognised as a supervisor in the supervisor job she is doing.Also co-starring is man-of-the-moment Mahershala Ali as Colonel Jim Johnson, Katherine's potential new boyfriend, and Kevin Costner as Al Harrison the head of the Space Task Group. (NASA report that the film 'simplifies' the complex management chain actually in place with ""Harrison's"" character being an amalgum but most aligned to Robert C. Gilruth). It's great to see Costner back on the big screen again, and the character walks a fine line on the segregation argument: you feel the actions of the man are aligned with completing the mission rather than his own personal beliefs. Jim Parsons (""The Big Bang Theory"") also co-stars as Johnson's spiky chauvinistic and racist supervisor as does Kirsten Dunst, in a similar role, as Vaughn's supervisor.A key mention at this point to the score by Hans Zimmer which adds greatly to the emotion of the spaceflight scenes. However, more generally in the sound area – and as a postgraduate physicist – can I just remind film-makers YET AGAIN that there is NO sound in space, so adding effects to booster separations and ""whooshings"" of spacecraft as they go by is NOT required! (You can't imagine how much I cringe at these moments).This is ultimately a film about girl empowerment and black empowerment, so it is not surprising that all of the women in my life have gone gaga about this film. As somebody completely outside of that particular Venn diagram, I found the film to be a solid and respectful telling of a true story that should have been known a long time ago. Was it as gripping and exciting as ""Apollo 13""? No, not in my view. But as an educational missive aimed at that – presumably perplexed – young child in my screening, this is a timely reminder for the present political system as to how far the world has come in fifty years, and how we must NEVER retreat down that road again.(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com).",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
We All Pee the Same Colour,"A story of brilliant minds who had to overcome the ridiculous rules of society. The best people for the job should get the job... period. Key word should, as this was clearly not the case in history, and even going forward. Even today, there's so much emphasis on what someone looks like, the colour of the skin, gender, as a basis on who gets what job. And that includes minority representation. It should simply be whoever is most qualified, but sadly the world is not that simple.'Hidden Figures' is indeed a feel good movie, as these three incredible women overcome these hurdles that seemed impossible at the time. Sure, they worked at the prestigious NASA, however, only a fraction of their ability was utilized until they showed what they could do through perseverance. Now, we need some more Katherine Goble's/Johnson's, Mary Jackson's, and Dorothy Vaughan's to get us back to the moon and to Mars.All three actresses were great, and I'm always a fan of Kevin Costner.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Actresses Shine While the Story Lacks,"My first thoughts after seeing the trailer to Hidden Figures was to question its watchabliity. My second thought was that Hidden Figures may be just the opposite. It had a story that as the title describes is relatively unknown and deals with one of the most exciting times in history. On top of that is a great solution to a Hollywood problem, the lack of leading roles for women, especially ones of color. Hidden Figures provides 3 leading roles for women of color, but unfortunately focuses far too much on that aspect of the characters, and not enough on their actual accomplishments. Oh and that watchability thing, well that's a problem too.The real truth is that the story underneath it all is pretty lackluster. These women were certainly achieved some great things in a world that wanted them to do the opposite, but movies do have to be entertaining. The plot is not driven by these women and them overcoming both racism and sexism, but by the space race and the countless amounts of white men who benefited from it. The amount of scenes showing the women being treated like trash almost double the ones that show them succeeding. Race and sexism should certainly be part of this story, but it took over most of the movie which is disappointing.The best thing about Hidden Figures are the three leads. Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughan and she fits into the supporting role perfectly. I don't want to call her a motherly figure, but she takes control a few times on the movie and it's great to see Ms. Spencer getting awards looks again. Janelle Monáe plays Mary Jackson and has the difficult task of acting alongside two fantastic actresses. She brings a lot of character to Jackson, but feels flat compared to her co stars. The real jewel here is the performance of Taraji P. Henson as Katherine G. Johnson. Henson lights up the screen, and even though she is normally known as a bit of an over the top actress she brings subtlety to the role. She gets her moments to go all out and boy does she use them, another possible awards candidate and Ms. Henson's finest performance yet.Hidden Figures will probably have a few Oscar noms by the time all is said and done, and while it is more deserving than movies like Hacksaw Ridge and Birth of a Nation, it does not deserve to be in the same category as Moonlight and La La Land. While watching Hidden Figures I was reminded of Loving, not because racial tensions drive both movies, but because they both have the same nagging issue, they are stories that are just not fit for movies. I would much rather watch a documentary on either the story of the Lovings or the women featured in Hidden Figures. At least I would gain some historical knowledge rather than being made to feel bad because people with the same color skin as me were assholes 60 years ago. Hidden Figures is not a bad movie, it just wants to be something its not, and that is never a good way to make a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Feel-good but don't forget the past,"First and foremost, this is a feel-good movie. I love feel-good movies and this left me feeling good with emotional twinges of happiness verging on tears of joy. You'll feel better and uplifted after watching it, and possibly ashamed of certain aspects of America's past.Because it's also a story of prejudice and segregation and the inhumanity - and, let's face it, downright stupid ignorance - of man to fellow man, and woman and African-American women in particular. And, yes, even though it takes place in the 1960s, it's about the inherent arrogance and stupidity of men so nothing changes there! Makes you wonder how much better so many areas of life and business would be if women had more input or control.The three stars - Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe - are superb and Kevin Costner is excellent although his role is hardly demanding. Kirsten Dunst, one of my fave actresses, seems almost to be playing a bit-part, slightly under-acting, but convincing as someone who, perhaps, changes their mind.The best lines go to Spencer and Dunst:Dust: ""Despite what you may think, I have nothing against y'all.""Spencer: ""I know. I know you probably believe that.""Badoom!!!Yes, the director also had a hand in the screenplay but not solely and it was based on a book so if there were any indulgent excesses they were generally reigned in.Throw in some info about the space race and this is an all-round excellent movie, well worth watching for many reasons, and family-friendly, too!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hidden Figures,"This is quite a compelling story of three ladies who played a crucial part in the NASA operation that ultimately put John Glen into space. All three were mathematicians drafted in to provide their skills but unlike so many of their colleagues, they were subject to prejudices surrounding their race and their gender. The women adopted the best solution to combat this bigotry, though - they decided there are more ways than one to skin a cat and so let their astonishing talents do their talking for them. Luckily, Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) had a boss in Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) who was essentially a practical and politically motivated man who cared far less about segregation and much more about beating the Soviets into space. His attitude, that swiftly builds into a considerable degree of respect, enabled her to step up and demonstrate she was every bit as good, if not better, than those white men around her - all rather uniformly dressed in white shirts and ties. Across the corridor, the equally adept Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) was fighting her own battle for recognition as the supervisor of a crack team that was charged with installing, programming and validating the workings of a brand new IBM computer. Finally, the triumvirate was made up by Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) whose skills were going to be crucial if the heat shield on the module charged with getting the astronaut (Glen Powell) back to Earth safely was going to work properly. Director Theodore Melfi manages to delicately marry these three threads together keeping the story interesting and investing us not just in the struggles of these women but also in the excitement of the practical science unfolding before us. Henson and Spencer are convincingly understated with their performances and though Monáe is less prominent, the three characterisations still resonate well and informatively. I knew nothing of those people before I watched this - I'm glad I did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great Acting - Fun Movie,"Hidden Figures is the story of three little known women who played a crucial role in the early days of the US space program. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe were all wonderful in their roles; each bringing specific personalities to their characters.Taraji P. Henson is a mathematics wunderkind who is called upon to assist in calculating the math requires for launches and recoveries. A single mother of three daughters, she graciously and calmly works through the difficulties of being a lone black woman in a department full of white men in the racially segregated state of Virginia. Her calmness breaks in one scene and she wonderfully states, quite loudly, the obstacles she is forced to endure and overcome. This is quite a contrast from her normally calm dignity. As a side story, she is also involved in a burgeoning romantic relationship and she shows another totally side of herself - that of a shy, demure woman, which she carries off perfectly.Octavia Spencer, a very strong actress, does a wonderful job as a black woman with the responsibilities of a supervisor that she is not allowed to have the title or compensation for. She deals with her supervisor, Kirsten Dunst, with patience and tolerance and delivers what I think was the finest line in the film in response to Dunst's comment that, ""I have nothing against y'all."" Spencer replies, ""I know you probably believe that."" Surrounding me in the auditorium was a subdued murmur of knowing assent and acknowledgment from the audience. Clearly, the black moviegoers all have had that thought, probably more often than one would like to think. As a white male, the sounds of the audience gave me pause and had great impact. That line, alone, made this movie worth seeing.Janelle Monáe plays a woman with the talent to be a NASA engineer, who has to jump through hoops to get there. She provides the bit of lightness that keeps this film lighter than the topic may generally have dictated.Without exception, the supporting cast excels - from Kevin Costner, the boss who just wants to get the job done and tolerates no impediments; to Jim Parsons, the engineer who always insists on following the rules - NASA's as well as his personal rules based on his biases; to Mahershala Ali, who plays Henson's love interest.This movie is well worth viewing on many levels - as history, as a treatise on segregation and race relations, and as an example of how determination can overcome the most difficult of obstacles.Not only was this an excellent film; it was also a film that I was glad I saw.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"'Despite what you may think, I have nothing against y'all.' 'I know, I know you probably believe that.'","Writers Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi have adapted Margot Lee Shetterly's book 'Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race ' for the screen and as directed by Theodore Melfi and a superlative cast, this film makes a major difference in the way both the space program and the ingenuity and intelligence of black women in the early days of NASA will now be forever viewed. It is a thrillingly believable film about the significance of black women producing miracles at NASA during the height of racial struggle.The time is 1961, JFK was president, Martin Luther King Jr. was the man of attention in civil rights, and the rush to hurdle a man into space was central to America's thinking and desire. As the United States raced against Russia to put a man in space, NASA found untapped talent in a group of African-American female mathematicians that served as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in U.S. history. Based on the unbelievably true life stories of three of these women, known as ""human computers"", we follow these women as they quickly rose the ranks of NASA alongside many of history's greatest minds specifically tasked by Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) with calculating the momentous launch of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) into orbit, and guaranteeing his safe return. Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe), and Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) crossed all gender, race, and professional lines while their brilliance and desire to dream big, beyond anything ever accomplished before by the human race, firmly cemented them in U.S. history as true American heroes.The men in the picture include Jim Parsons (thankfully stepping out of his Big Bang character), Mahershala Ali, Aldis Hodge, as well as the white women in positions of power – Kirsten Dunst, Kimberly Quinn – all offer solid support. But this is a film about a time of transition in so many arenas, and visiting the realities of colored bathrooms, prejudice, and the fierce competition with Russia are well to remember. The film is not with out flaws (the musical score is not at all form the period, though is sounds well) and there is a little too much time spent on the social lives of these extraordinary women, but it is a film everyone should see – it is just that important to realize the major role black women played in the beginning of computers and the space program.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

He steals every scene, and this is one of the best performances I've seen him give. In addition, Taraji Henson gives a strong lead actress performance and Jim Parsons and others contribute good supporting roles.All in all, in a year of a diverse batch of good movies and awards and Oscar contenders, Hidden Figures stands apart and differentiates itself as one of the best feel-good movies of triumph, courage, and achievement.

"Solid Performances, Story Falls Flat,","Hidden Figures is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a terrific cast. There are uplifting performances from the likes of Janelle Monáe, Kevin Costner and Marshala Ali, who all are truly commited to their roles and have left their own personas, portraying these real life beings with all their soul. Taraji P. Henson is without a doubt the highlight as Katherine G. Johnson, she is absolutely mesmeric in this part and had me engaged every single moment she was on screen, delivering a real, truly extraordinary performance.I did find that the film did not try hard enough to bring the struggles of these three women to the forefront. While I would usually like this kind of light hearted humour that features here, it felt like an injustice for such an incredible true story, it failed to uplift me as a result.As well as that, I was never convinced by Octavia Spencer, it felt as if she was just acting and was not truly immersing herself in to this part.

It's something we've been trying to do for a while, but everything was set on a hurrying motion once the Soviet Union launched Sputnik.The 1960's had us racing against the Soviets for everything; power, technology, and especially the accomplishment of space. It was all about being the first and the US government wanted to make sure that NASA could make that happen. Like I said, the problem was solving a lot of problems that it took to get people to space and making sure they could get back. NASA had hired some of the most intelligent people around, yet they were still having trouble finding the right solutions. The answers seemed to be found within the minds of outsiders as shown in Hidden Figures.In the early 1960's, racial segregation is still an issue. Things seem to be a bi more progressive at NASA as they have employed several African-Americans to do a lot of the computing that complicated things. Here we focus on three individuals; mathematics genius Katherine Johnson (played by Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (played by Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (played by Janelle Monáe). They seem to be doing well at NASA, even though they still face some discrimination from their white superiors. Once the Soviets get the first people into space, NASA is looking to get an astronaut to orbit the Earth.Katherine is hired up to help compute launch and landing numbers for the Space Task Group, being directed by Al Harrison (played by Kevin Costner) and his assistant Paul Stafford (played by Jim Parsons). Meanwhile, Dorothy sees that her and her fellow computing workers are about to be out of a job now that new IBM computers are being installed. To ensure work, Dorothy takes it upon herself to learn to new computer and see if she can get her coworkers to understand it. Also, Mary is being recommended to become an engineer, but company regulations require a certain course from a college that's white only.Unlike Moonlight, which was a bleak and human look at a struggling African-American, Hidden Figures is more upbeat and hopeful portrayal of changing times. Does that make it better then the latter? No, as Moonlight is something that'll be studied in a lot of college courses in race relations, Hidden Figures is more general with it's approach and will be played in the high schools as a history lesson. That is definitely not a bad thing as this movie is still entertaining, especially considering that the majority of the plot is solving a complex mathematical formula.All three main actors (Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe) are fantastic and carry their own stories well enough that your never disappointed that the movie is cutting away to their segment. I was curious about how all the of them were going to proceed, given the unfortunate rules of the time. I liked the majority of the cast around them (with the exception of Jim Parsons, who only seems to be playing a version of his Bing Bang Theory character). The film can get a little slow towards the hour mark, but it all picks up towards it's finale which I wont give away.I'll give this eight Mercury rockets out of ten. If you have any interest of the space program and it's history, then I cannot recommend this movie enough. Hidden Figures has a lot energy and passion of portraying this real life story. Like Rudy, I think this'll make people want to follow their goals more. So see if this rocket story launches in your favor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A bright spot for our times.,"What a breath of fresh air in these dark times! Hidden Figures is an amazing, uplifting, inspiring story focusing on the successes of three African-American women whose mathematical and computer-science skills directly helped NASA launch astronauts into space (and back) and eventually to the moon.The bulk of the events depicted are from 1961 at the Langley Research Center and Project Mercury. If you had asked me ""When did NASA desegregate?"" I would have been stumped, because I never knew NASA was segregated. The movie gives a palpable sense of the raw frustration and pain caused by senseless discrimination, and it does so so simply by facing us with the harsh reality and indignity of having to walk over a mile each day just to use the bathroom. The women entrusted to make critical astronomical calculations couldn't even be trusted to share the same space for a minute or two in what is one of the most common, natural, and inherent aspects of humanity.And it's a double-whammy: they're black, and they're women. Hidden Figures is just as much, if not more so, about sexism and exposing the baseless belief that women either should not or cannot excel at science. There's a great satisfaction when the Director of the Space Task Group literally sledge-hammers the bathroom signs down, ending a practice that never should have started.Do yourself a favor and catch Hidden Figures on the big screen, see it with a big crowd, and feel a sense of humanity trickling back in.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Terrific film,"What a great film. Brilliant performances all round and a really engaging and moving treatment of a very important part of history.

A Great Movie of Consequence,"I am giving this movie the highest rating possible for dramatizing the human spirit in a very positive way during a dark and difficult period, the period that I knew growing up from childhood to adulthood. I lived the era without knowing the great contributions being made by Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn and Mary Jackson until I moved to Hampton, Virginia. The sadness of the story is that it took a movie and President Barack Obama to recognize their achievements more than fifty years later. This unto itself is an absurdity, until you realize the players were completely out of character from mainstream (white) America back in the day! I give the choice of title for the movie a very high rating. To this rater, hidden numbers is more a metaphor representing the numbers of brilliant African-American women hidden in an obscure and remote building, while making daily contributions to the success of the NASA space program. Their brilliance is overlooked and never taken for granted, as though they were simply plugging in grunt numbers for a NASA team of scientists to decide what to do with these numbers.Taraji P. Henson gives an inspiring performance as Katherine G. Johnson. She lets her light shine to portray moments of glory and triumph, just as the real-life Katherine would have done. There were one or two scenes that might have conflicted with the protocol of the era, but I understand the need for convincing some audience of how things might have been back in the day. Someone had to make decisions, so it might as well be the Boss, as portrayed by Kevin Kostner.Overall, it was a great movie, very entertaining, and this writer did learn a thing or two about a time in history not so far away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Inspiring, beautiful and hopeful","The untold story about the three African American women who helped NASA fly the first astronauts into space is finally put on the big screen.

A timeless journey,"""Hidden Figures"" unfolds as a timeless journey to the '60s, gracefully weaving a tale of empowerment. The characters, led by the brilliant Katherine Goble Johnson, embody resilience and intelligence. The meticulous set design and costumes immerse us in the era's essence, capturing the societal shifts and NASA's transformative strides.The film masterfully navigates racial and gender dynamics, shedding light on unsung heroes. Katherine, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, played by a stellar cast, bring authenticity to their roles. The chemistry between characters, especially the evolving relationship between Katherine and her colleagues, adds depth to the narrative.The soundtrack complements the storytelling, resonating with the spirit of the times. The decision to intertwine personal struggles with professional achievements makes ""Hidden Figures"" relatable and impactful.While some may find the plot predictable, the film's strength lies in its ability to evoke emotions and inspire. It transcends the historical context, delivering a timeless message of perseverance and breaking barriers. ""Hidden Figures"" is not just a recounting of the past but a celebration of triumph over adversity.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
great story,"Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) work at NASA's Langley colored calculating division in the still segregated Virginia. The facility is waiting for the new IBM computers and calculations are done by hand. The Russians are rocketing ahead. Katherine is assigned to director Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) who is under pressure to launch an American into space. Dorothy is a supervisor in practice but Vivian Mitchell (Kirsten Dunst) won't let her have the title. When the IBM computers are installed, Dorothy quickly learns to be an expert programmer leading the other colored girls. Mary must fight to attend an all-white school to be an engineer. The hard work culminates in John Glenn's flight on Friendship 7.This story is a great unknown American history. Sometimes, it pushes too hard on the social commentary button. It's not really necessary since the story lays it out so well. There is no need for Taraji to make that big speech. A simple proclamation of her bathroom use and the fact that she's dripping wet should be enough to allow for a great moment for Al Harrison. There is also no need for him to take down the bathroom signs in such a theatrical way. The problem with these theatrical moves is the diminishment of the inherit power of those moments. Instead of commenting on the coffee pot, somebody could later drink her coffee as a point of transformation. While it doesn't make the movie bad, it is unnecessary for this great story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Early Runner for Movie of the Year,"When I saw the trailer for this movie I thought, ""That's interesting. They're doing a fictional movie about Black American women that worked for NASA in the 60's."" I figured that it had to be a fiction because I'd never heard of these women at all. Not a peep. This may be an indictment on myself more than anything but I don't consider myself that uninformed or inattentive that these ladies existence would completely escape me.Having saw the movie this evening I left there blown away. Regardless of the women or their race and regardless of it being real or fake it was a brilliant production. But once you add to the mix that they were Black (which for obvious reasons was significant at that time period), they were women (see last comment), and it was a true story... the movie is elevated exponentially.No disrespect to Muhammad Ali, James Brown, Jesse Owens, Jackie Robinson, Ray Charles, Tina Turner and others like them with biopics, but I was overjoyed to see a movie detailing accomplishments of Black Americans that didn't involve sports or entertainment. It was warming to know that we could do other things than run and sing.But as I mentioned; this was an excellent movie in any case and it had A-listers to further solidify it. I thought Kevin Kostner (Al Harrison), Jim Parsons (Paul Strafford) and Kirsten Dunst (Vivian Mitchell) were terrific. Kirsten Dunst pulled her role off too well as a woman you'd want to physically send into orbit with no rocket. And as good as they were I think Octavia Spencer (Dorothy Vaughan), Janelle Monae (Mary Jackson) and Taraji P. Henson (Katherine Johnson) were that much better. I think this was an incredible story that needed to be told and told well. This movie did not disappoint and it was justly done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Hidden Gem,"While Hidden Figures suffers a bit from a run-of-the-mill biopic structure, the astounding acting across the board is enough to keep the casual movie fan pleased.I always love checking out stories that I have never heard of. I've seen The Right Stuff, Apollo 13, and I know a little bit about the background of NASA. But I knew nothing of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson. Going into a film with little previous knowledge can be immensely rewarding experience. And although Hidden Figures isn't the best movie, it's most certainly a film worth seeing.Playing the three ""hidden figures"" are Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae respectively. Aside from quite a few supporting performances from Spencer, I'm not overly familiar with these actresses' work. And perhaps unexpectedly, all three of them are terrific. Spencer gets the least to do out of the three, and still has a memorable banter with Kirsten Dunst, a racist co-worker. Monae brings a fresh and lighthearted character into the fold and complements the two of them well.Taraji P. Henson on the other-hand, is on a completely different level. If it wasn't for Portman, Adams, and Stone giving such acclaimed turns this year, Henson would have likely been a front-runner. Considering she's playing someone without much wiggle room to show emotion, it's impressive that I felt as though I could understand exactly what she was feeling in every scene. She only gets a few scenes to express herself in a grand way emotionally, and she makes the best out of them. It was easily one of the best performances of the year.Even though this story is very interesting on paper (three African American females working for NASA significantly helping America's chances of winning the Space Race), I feel like the film could have taken advantage of the story even more. I love the relationships these women have together and I instantly bought into their chemistry, as I did the material with each of the women's personal lives and families. But I don't think it came all together as neatly as I would have hoped. I wish we would have gotten a little more time with the three women together, instead of hammering home the underlying message involving racism. There's no question this story needed to be told, but at times the execution felt more formulaic than natural.+Henson is extraordinary+Incredible story+Emotion hits a few times-Directing and editing felt a little choppy-Needed more time spent with just the three of them7.0/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Inspiring, Heartfelt, and Unintentionally Timely","Frontrunner for my favorite film of the awards season, Hidden Figures contains heavy doses of irony that may not have been intentional at the time of production. Set during the transition to the 1960s, with skinny ties and Jim Crow laws, the zeitgeist of the cold war, and the pressure cooker of the U.S. space program after Sputnik, it was a time before electronic computing was commonplace. Unimaginably, the math for the orbital mechanics of the Mercury missions was being performed on slide rules, pencil, and paper. The revelation of this film is that some of the human ""computers"" that did this vital work were African American women, who despite their brilliant contributions, were segregated and marginalized because of their color and gender.Chalk up one for amazing timing One cannot ignore that for these past few months, making America ""great again"" has, for an outspoken intolerant minority, meant reverting back to this white male-dominated social structure with all of its overt sexism and racism. In this light, seeing the inhumane treatment visited upon the hardworking heroes of this film moves beyond sepia-toned history and elicits real, contemporary rage.The superb cast is lead by Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer, who are exceptional and nomination worthy as real-life mathematician Katherine G. Johnson and supervisor Dorothy Vaughan. Mahershala Ali (Moonlight) is terrific as the socially awkward love interest Colonel Jim Johnson. Kirsten Dunst turns in a surprisingly solid performance as a hardened by-the-book supervisor, and Kevin Costner thankfully melts believably into his role as chief of the space program. Jim Parsons' portrayal of an overtly racist engineer is sadly wooden, and is the only weak spot in an otherwise strong ensemble.Theodore Melfi's film is definitely a glossy Hollywood telling, and effectively pulls at the heart strings with every element, but the work does not descend too frequently into unnecessary sentimentality. Scenes of the heroines' home lives feel sweet but not overly romanticized, and scenes of their hardships are more matter-of-course than melodramatic. The film is beautifully lensed by Mandy Walker, and has a wonderful kinetic energy. This is robust, big studio filmmaking certainly, but it has at its center memorable real heroes, an inspiring story, and great heart.Highly recommended! Go, and take the kids.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
there's effort involved,"I had never known the story of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson before ""Hidden Figures"" got released. Even if it's hard for the viewer to follow the scientific lingo, it's still a fascinating story, as the three women fight tooth and nail to both help with NASA's space program and for acknowledgment of their contributions. I saw a correlation between the fact that landing a man on the moon was a major effort that we could nonetheless achieve, and the fact that taking on institutionalized racism required a lot of effort but was still an achievable goal. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe portray the women as individuals who simply wanted to be able to support their families but also figured out how to contribute to NASA's work. These were some brave women. You may recall that Henson, Spencer and Monáe brought the real Katherine Johnson out on the stage when they presented an Academy Award.Also appearing are Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Mahershala Ali (of ""Moonlight"", in which Monáe also co-starred), and even Jim Parsons in a role not too different from Sheldon Cooper. I guess that his character is a stern, socially competent Sheldon.All in all, it's a fine movie. Maybe not the ultimate masterpiece (and there's the question of accuracy), but I recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amazing and inspiring,"One of the most beautiful movies I've watched. I am glad those hidden figures, didn't stay hidden for me. It is for sure within the scope of Interstellar proficiency, but guided by true events, which makes the wow effect even bigger. It humbles you and brings you down to the most treasured human behavior. It shows that hard work and not giving up on your self on the first place and then, not giving up on your dreams, will take you places. It reminds of compassion. There was nothing redundant.

It's much more than brainy women!,"""Every time we get a chance to get ahead they move the finish line. Every time."" Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae)The pre-launch action prior to the late John Glenn's epic orbit in 1962 is uniquely lensed through the points of view of three black women who, as math-based NASA computers, were instrumental in the success of the project. Hidden Figures goes beyond the romance of the history to touch on multiple cultural challenges with soft, fuzziness and smarts.On one level, this biopic hammers home the stupidity of segregation especially when it requires math genius Katherine (Taraji P. Henson) to spend 40 minutes to go to the ""colored"" toilet. Well, launch honcho Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) takes care of that problem by tearing down the sign and with it the prejudice under attack in the Civil Rights Movement.Costner embodies the rational but humane spirit of NASA, which, like him, needs to get the job done regardless of social inequities, as leaders like him reach beyond computation to bigger issues like beating the Russians in the space race. His cool but caring and global instincts mirror President Kennedy's drive to succeed regardless of the civil rights turmoil.On a second level, Hidden Figures tackles the second-class citizenship of women, who despite capabilities as powerful as those of men, are excluded from meetings that would put them in charge of the rapidly-changing computations especially about the tricky re-entry going from parabolic to elliptical or the other way in a dance with death. I'm being unfairly flip because the heart of this drama is not math but the right of all humans to be equal.The premise of the film with brilliant ladies marginalized until they direct their individual fates is an apt metaphor for oppressed and undervalued people.On a third level, this entertaining drama deals with the colossal emergence of computers, in this case giant mainframe IBMS, which threaten not only our Russian competitors but also the jobs of our brilliant ladies. Have no fear, for Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) comes to the rescue as supervisor par excellence.Hidden Figures could be criticized for its lenient treatment of wrongdoers and its benign depiction of the heroines, but I prefer to think like Costner's character that we should go beyond the ""figures"" to the bigger gestalt of universal equality. In this warm history, even the Russians come off well enough as experts who beat us into orbit (Yuri Gagarin).Yet, we beat them to the moon! That striving without cultural barriers is the anchor of this romantic adventure, just as riveting as any superhero blockbuster, a genre that has gone way beyond prejudice long ago and far, far away.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
math and prejudice,"Very few films were made until now about the beginnings of the American space program, and I am wondering why. Here is a true American saga that took place at a time that is still remembered by many of us. It's a story with famous and anonymous heroes, a story that begins with the dismay and fear caused by the Soviets taking early lead in the race to space (with the launching of the Sputnik and with sending the first man in space) and ends in triumph with the Apollo program and the moon landings. And yet, Hollywood still has to approach the period and make the movies about this great story and the men that made it possible. Hidden Figures only partly fills some of this gap, looking at a little known aspect of the first space programs, from a specific perspective, with the emphasis on an unexpected and unknown aspect - the racial prejudice that faced and had to be overcome by the first Afro-American contributors to the program. It tells the story of (until now) little known heroes who not only were 'colored' but also all happened to be women.Hidden Figures is a fiction film based on the nonfiction book Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, written by historian Margot Lee Shetterly. The script authors and director Theodore Melfi where extremely careful in the details, from dialogues that aim to be as close to reality as they are remembered by the heroes who lived the period (including apparently a scene that looks very Hollywood-like but apparently did happen, with John Glenn on the launching ramp of the very first flight asking for the computations to be checked by 'the girl' he met in the preparation meetings room) to details about how buildings, corridors, rooms, parking lots looked at the NASA compounds in Virginia. What is shocking today especially from a non-American perspective is the extent to which segregation and racial discrimination was part of life and of the books of laws a little more than half a century ago, in the country that was leading the democracy block in its fight against Communism, and was working to send its first men to space.Yet, the 'inspirational' tone dominates the film, and the viewer has the feeling that almost every fact, action, or spoken dialog is in line with the point that the film aims to make. A more realistic or neutral approach would have made the message more convincing IMO. I did like the characters development, the fact that three women who are the lead characters in the film have each her own personality, talents, way of overcoming prejudice. The three actresses are Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe and I hope to see them in more (good) movies ahead. Kevin Costner and Kirsten Dunst are cast in supporting roles and they do a good job. Hidden Figures is a solid and in some places emotional film, but cannot break the convention of genre and style that it seems that the authors imposed on themselves.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Wonderful must-see movie!,"Lots of tender moments in this movie. One historical inaccuracy is in the opening scene circa 1926, when it becomes quite apparent that Katherine is gifted as a young girl in elementary school, the teacher uses an electronic calculator to verify Katherine's answer to a complex multiplication problem. Electronic calculators were not invented until the late 60's and not in widespread use until the 1970's. The proof in is the rest of the movie where all the scientists at NASA use mechanical calculators which were indeed in widespread use in the 50's and 60's.

What an excellent film with an amazing message,"It is hard to look back at a time that is still quite recent and see how people can treat black people so poorly.

They simply maximized their talent and became indispensable. By doing so, they became honored in their places of work and (better late than never) honored with this film for their lifetimes of achievement. It sucks to know that they needed to be that great to overcome hate, but their greatness is part of overcoming hatred/bigotry on the grand scale.

An inspiring tale of overcoming adversity to achieve greatness.,"Virginia, 1961. Race segregation was in full force and women were expected to stay at home with the children. Needless to say being an African American female was replete with hardships; every small step forward was on the back of sacrifice and suffering. This uplifting true story is a testimonial to the unwavering efforts of three brave women who, through their genius and determination, forged the first steps towards equality at NASA. Writer-director Theodore Melfi has chosen the crowd-pleasing path, opting for a more light-hearted tone that allows the audience to revel in the brilliance of these women rather than getting bogged down in the difficulties that they faced. The tough topics aren't shied away from entirely though, one particularly heart-wrenching scene places the issue of segregation front and centre when mathematical genius Katherine (Taraji P. Henson) is forced to explain that her bathroom breaks are so lengthy due to the building having no 'coloured toilets'. It's not an overly subtle screenplay, the broad strokes of struggle often boiled down to showcase moments like the aforementioned confrontation, but it's delivered with such passion and pluck that it's utterly affecting. A spot on cast helps with the energy too: Henson shines throughout as a widowed mother of three, Octavia Spencer bustles with resolve as the pragmatic Dorothy, Janelle Monáe spices it up as sassy engineer Mary, and Kevin Costner brings his All-American charm to a forward-thinking NASA manager. Insightful, moving and entertaining, Hidden Figures is an inspiring tale of achieving one's dreams despite constant adversity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Treats its characters as human beings who deserve our respect and admiration,"Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson are not household names. In fact, they were not even on the radar until Theodore Melfi's film Hidden Figures told their story. Based on the book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly, Hidden Figures is about three African-American women working at NASA in the 1960s who broke through barriers of race and gender to become essential contributors to the U.S. space program and without which, famous astronauts such as John Glenn and Allan Shepard would probably have never flown. All three were employed by NASA but only as ""computers,"" people who worked for the engineering and flight sections performing manual calculations.As the space program pushed through boundaries to match the Russian man in space program, barriers had to be broken on the ground as well to complete a successful mission. Though it was 1961 and the civil rights movement had already begun under the leadership of Martin Luther King, restaurant lunch counters, water fountains in public parks, libraries, and bathrooms were still segregated. In the film which was nominated for Best Picture at the 2017 Oscars, the three women, Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) have to deal with humiliating incidents of racial prejudice they repeatedly encounter on the job though they were as brainy and qualified as their male counterparts.What they lacked was the title of engineer and mathematician and the respect of equal pay for equal work. Dorothy is denied the title of supervisor by her boss Vivian Mitchell (Kirsten Dunst) even though she is already doing supervisor's work. Mary wants to become an engineer and work in the engineering section, but she requires college courses which can only be taken at a school that denies entry to people of color. Katherine, a mathematics genius, works on a Special Task Force for Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), but her main job is to check the calculations of her white male co-workers, including that of the coldly disdainful Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons). They all feel the pressure to do their jobs without complaining unless they are labeled as troublemakers.This means the indignity of Katherine putting up with having to walk a half mile to go to the nearest ""colored"" rest room, Mary having to go to court just to be able to take night classes at the local high school, and Dorothy having to plead her case to her boss to be given the title of Supervisor. Hidden Figures is more than an entertaining feel-good movie, though it is that. It is a long overdue recognition of what life was like for African-Americans under segregation and the special burden that women had to face. While the film is a hard-edged depiction of racial prejudice, it is not preachy or one-dimensional but treats its protagonists as human beings who deserve our respect and admiration.Melfi cares for his characters, showing Katherine's courtship by Colonel Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali) and the women's family and church life with warmth and humor. Granted the film is not notable for its depth of characterization or its subtlety and Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson were not saints, yet the truth is that saints are not necessarily those who perform miracles, but are also those who stand up for human dignity. In that respect, the three women deserve the title.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Knowledge is a weapon of greater use,"Going straight to the point what is great about this movie it's the message behind it. When it comes to research, whether it is on physics, maths, science or whatever it is, doesn't matter your gender, your skin color or anything...it matters your knowledge. Nowadays when many of these questions are being raised again, it's great to see a story showing us the opposite and reminding us how important it is education and the discovery of new things, because it's exactly breaking those limits that we are reminded that all of our traditions can be changed... A man had never gone to space until he did, and a woman's place was at home until it started being at an office or whatever it is she wishes. Hidden Figures reminds us of that (we already know, but I guess sometimes people like to forget..). It's based on true facts so it's easy to believe it. It's not ambitious , it doesn't intend to be more then what it was, but still an interesting story, given life with the right amount of drama and a nice soundtrack. It's a good movie, not the best for me, but honestly one of those that everyone should see just for the reminder of how important history and education are.

Hidden Figures is a ... movie based on actual events. While the film dramatizes some aspects, it is true at the struggles of the women at the center of the story: Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson. The victories for racial and gender rights were not achieve easily or quickly, and our work is not done"" (you can see this video on the net, look for the NASA channel).This movie is a jewel for all ages. I will definitely take my older kids (10 and 8 years old) to see it, because I always talk to them about the dangers of racism and how rotten racism and sexism is, and they love spaceships. At the end of the film all the cinema clapped. I'm Spanish and Spanish people tend to do what they feel, we are loud and emotional, but I didn't see a clap like that in a long time.

Correcting History's Oversights,"Now that more black voices are being heard in Hollywood, I realize how badly one-sided history has been taught to American students. Thank God it's changing.We are better off knowing the full story.In the last few years, films like ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Selma"" have brought to life stories too long neglected, and ""Hidden Figures"" is a revelation. I grew up in the Apollo era; every rocket launch was a national event, with every American reaching for the stars. The turmoil in the streets notwithstanding, the space program provided a sense of optimism for the future. That was the era in which ""Star Trek"" was born, and through ""Star Trek"" some of that hope survives still.Yet, in all that time, nobody told us about three black women who did as much as anyone else to make it happen. We did not know that a black woman helped to get John Glenn into orbit. (In Ron Howard's otherwise excellent ""Apollo 13,"" we are never told about that same woman's role in saving the flight.) These and other oversights are corrected by ""Hidden Figures.""The film tells the story of NASA mathematicians Katherine G. Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughn, though Johnson, excellently portrayed by Taraji P. Hanson, is the film's main focus. All three work at NASA in 1961 Virginia. The film doesn't flinch from the blatant racial discrimination of the era. The only bathroom reserved for black women, for instance, is half a mile from Katherine's desk.Vaughn's story is almost as compelling as Johnson's, but also funnier; there's a reason Octavia Spencer is up for an Academy Award. Anyone who's been working beneath his abilities and had a frosty relationship with his supervisor will identify with Vaughn immediately, and appreciate how she resolves it. I also have a personal reason for appreciating Spencer; she reminds me of every black female boss I've ever had.Actually, there are three facets to ""Hidden Figures"" (and I wish Hanson's hadn't been so well hidden): the civil rights aspect, the excitement and progress of the space program, and, at last, a film which doesn't denigrate intelligent people. ""Hidden Figures"" is easily accessible by anyone, but does not portray having intelligence as a bad thing. Since most Hollywood films are aimed at the dumbest possible market, I can tell you that this alone makes ""Hidden Figures"" a welcome breath of fresh air.I should mention Kevin Costner, who plays project head Al Harrison. Al is generally calm and distant, as you would expect a NASA engineer to be, but he has one scene where he isn't. It's a complete departure and an unnecessarily jarring note.""Hidden Figures"" isn't perfect, by any means. The plotting is fairly conventional, and the scenes of the women at home could fit into just about any movie. The script doesn't try to give its characters much in the way of depth, but that's not the filmmaker's purpose, anyway. There is a whole aspect of American history which has been overlooked for far too long, and ""Hidden Figures"" does a worthy job of making that right.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Enjoyable and still overrated,"Enjoyable and still overrated Having seen is now, by far the best part of it IMO is the fact of being a movie based on true events. The positive message that talented black people made it through the barriers of then-segregation with persistence is indeed nice. But it is put into scene with a too much schmaltz. The sets reproduce the 50&60ies quite well, as space adept you might also love the technical scenes of the rocket gear in action, but it somehow ends there. A bit curious it made it to the Oscar nominations IMO, at least it didn't win any rightly. This would have been indeed to much concession to the pioneer character of true events behind.What I liked most or was portrayed best, I think, was how the feeling of the then-imposed rule for blacks of standing back ""humbly"" was put into scene.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hidden Figures is a fine story of the African-American women who were valuable to the NASA space program of the early '60s,"This movie tells a story of NASA's space program of the early '60s that hadn't been told before: that of several black women-with three showcased here-doing some behind-the-scenes math calculations or figuring out the new IBM operations of their computers as the country is readying the flight of the first American man in space, John Glenn. Taraji P. Henson especially shines as Katherine G. Johnson, who was so advanced in her chosen profession that she graduated from college early and eventually was the one who figured the right distance for Glenn's mission to succeed. Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae are fine in their roles as well. Nothing more to say except, I highly recommend Hidden Figures. This review is dedicated in memory of the late John Glenn.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Simple after thought after watching the movie.,"This movie did a great job of showing us the history and did a wonderful work on keeping us on that time period. This movie is not much of an emotional roller-coaster but rather just a small kids ride. If you are like me, who watched all the trailers you could find online, then you will be very glad to remember that this movie is TRUE! It's not fiction! It's REAL and these three women did such an AMAZING JOB! and it's bittersweet that we only hear about this now. You might get a little frustrated that too many people didn't get to know about this but I guess we should cherish this moment that this story did get told, and it wasn't just another forgotten history. The actors did a wonderful job and one thing that I wasn't too satisfied with was Al Harrison. The three women's stories were well told and I was full from knowing about them, but I was left hungry when it came to Harrison, I was curious about him.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Where ""The Right Stuff"" meets racial segregation","""Hidden Figures"" (2016 release; 127 min.) brings the story, ""based on true events"" we are reminded at the beginning, of three African- American women working at NASA. As the movie opens, we are in ""West Virginia, 1926"", where we see a young girl amaze everyone with her math skills, and she is soon offered a scholarship to attend classes for the gifted. We then move to ""Hampton, Virginia, 1961"", where we get to know the three ladies. They are having car trouble, and when a police officer drives by and checks what the problem is, he can hardly believe they all work at NASA (but does give them an escort). At NASA, the ladies are working at the ""Colored Computers"" section, but then one day, Katherine is asked to join the ""Space Task Group"", as the space race with the USSR is in full swing. At this point we're 15 min. or so into the movie but to tell you more of the story would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second movie from writer-director Theodore Melfi (after the Bill Murray vehicle ""St Vincent"" a few years ago). Here he brings the larger than life (yet true) story of how these three ladies ended up playing an important, if not critical role, in the space race, in particular getting John Glenn into orbit, yet at the same time suffering from the racial segregation that was into place still in those days. The 'running joke' in the movie is that Katherine disappears time and again to run to the ""Colored Ladies Room"" which is 1/2 mile away from the Space Task Group. When one day confronted about her long absences by the agency's head, she boils over in emotion and anger and humiliation when she explains why (truly a chilling moment in the movie). Not long thereafter, the agency's head does away with the segregated bathrooms, claiming ""Here at NASA, we're all the same color!"" (the theater's audience erupted with a huge applause at that time, amazing). The movie truly is a mix of ""The Right Stuff"" and the horrible racial segregation and discrimination that was the accepted norm then. (Interestingly, ""Hidden Figures"" is set in officially segregated Virginia, just like that other recent and equally important movie ""Loving"" about an interracial couple's fight to get their marriage recognized in the late 50s/early 60s.) ""Hidden Figures"" is helped enormously by the heartwarming performances of the three lead actresses: Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae (recently also in the equally excellent ""Moonlight""), but most of all Taraji Henson as Katherine. Kevin Costner as the agency's head is okay too. Kirstin Dunst is barely recognizable as Vivian, another NASA employee. There are tons of great songs in the movie, both oldies from that era but also new tunes (sounding like oldies) penned by Pharell Williams (the score is courtesy of veteran Hans Zimmer). My only 'complaint', minor as it is, is that the movie's running time is a bit too long for its own good, and could've easily be edited/trimmed by 15-20 min.""Hidden Figures"" expanded wide this past weekend. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED to the rafters, literally sold out to the very last seat. The audience laughed and cried, and when the end credits started rolling, gave it a thunderous applause. It blows the mind that the story of these ""Hidden Figures"" has never been brought to the big screen until now, but better late than never I suppose. In any event, ""Hidden Figures"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Welcome Tribute To The Real Brains Behind One Of Mankind's Proudest Achievements,"Tweaking the real-life events every now n then to highlight the issues prevalent during its timeline and for some added dramatic effect as well, Hidden Figures is a mostly lighthearted & competently made biopic about the three unsung heroes whose key contributions made it possible for mankind to leave its footprint on the moon.Set during the 1960s, Hidden Figures covers the story of three African-American women who work as human computers at NASA. The main plot follows Katherine Johnson, a maths wunderkind, who is assigned to the Space Task Group to work on their latest project and, along with Mary Jackson & Dorothy Vaughan, made the impossible possible.Co-written & directed by Theodore Melfi, the story is narrated in an amusing but insightful fashion and keeps a stringent focus on its trio of characters. The plot mostly covers their remarkable work at NASA but every now n then, it would offer a little glimpse into their private lives. The screenplay smooths out the narrative by modifying a few details but it works in the film's favour.The racial & gender issues it presents within the feature are as relevant today as it was at its time, however, the director does well to balance its thought-provoking themes with other elements and makes sure that it remains an enjoyable, accessible & universally appealing ride. Last but not the least, its warm colour palette, well-timed humour & fluid camera-work makes it even more inviting.The three relevant characters exhibit well-defined arcs and are expertly brought to life by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer & Janelle Monáe. Kevin Costner & Kirsten Dunst chip in with serviceable inputs while Jim Parsons feels like a miscast. Also, if his presence alone is enough to convince you that he must be playing some intelligent guy, then you have been watching a terrible TV show for far too long.On an overall scale, Hidden Figures is as enjoyable as it is informative, and is a welcome tribute to the genius minds who were responsible for some of our proudest achievements. The undercurrent of Cold War paranoia is evident throughout the story and is overdone at times but the movie retains its uplifting feeling till the very end. Bringing into light the real brains behind human spaceflight's greatest triumph, Hidden Figures is an amusing, entertaining & satisfying delight.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

This movie is based on true events. It made me realize that the equality we often take for granted in our lives today is thanks to pioneers like them. I learned that the historical reality of segregation and discrimination against Black people, which I knew, was even more unfair and inhumane than I could have imagined. The 1960s was a pivotal period of transformation in overcoming such discrimination, where individuals with extraordinary talent and leadership fought for and achieved equality. To prevent the repetition of such discriminatory history, it is crucial to pass on stories like this film to people living in the present through visual works and other mediums.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Inspiring and Impressive Movie,"The film talks about global issues we still face today, which has evoked my interest. I remember seeing a clip of the film before, but I've never watched it 'till last year, and I'm glad I've finally watched it. The actors did a brilliant job of portraying their roles because it made me feel the emotions that they conveyed during the movie. The cinematography was also extraordinary because it showed the past, but the movie style is with the present times. It also showed empowerment, not just for women but also for every people of color, and I think this was the most inspiring part for me. The three main protagonists showed that even if they have different skin colors and are women, they can still do jobs that men can do. They showed how much a woman is worthy of any work in the present time. The film has inspired me because they have done incredible things to make history, and they have proved that everyone can do what they want to do and be who they want to be. If they work hard and be determined to reach their goals, they can. It was compelling and inspiring to see because I love films, particularly those based on a true story and show history. Overall, it was just extraordinary, brilliant, and inspiring. For me, it is 10/10 recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A feel-good film about three brave women,"It's a NASA biopic of three African American mathematicians set in Hampton, Virginia, in 1926 and 1961/62. The movie begins by showing the young Katherine Gobel Johnson (Lidya Jewett/Taraji P. Henson) as a precocious student with exceptional mathematical skills. We then meet Katherine, Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe), who work as ""computers"" at the Langley Research Center operated by NASA in Hampton, Virginia. They do mathematical calculations related to NASA's early efforts at space travel before computers took over this work.The three women face severe hindrances in Virginia's still-segregated work environment. Katherine works in an all-male Space Task Group run by Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) and Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons). Dorothy does the work of a supervisor but is not recognized as such. To stay employable, Dorothy learns Fortran to program the soon-arriving IBM computer. Mary works on the heat shield team and wants to attend university extension classes at an all-white high school.The film follows each of them in their quest, with particular emphasis on Katherine, who becomes a key figure in planning John Glenn's (Jim Powell) first trip into space.""Hidden Figures"" is a PG feel-good film about three brave women. It significantly exaggerates conflicts to make them more impressive. Dorothy was already a supervisor by 1949. Katharine never had to go to another building for a colored washroom; she used ""white"" washrooms from the beginning. Katharine was a permanent member of the Space Task Force by 1958, co-authoring reports and attending meetings. Mary Jackson did not have to go to court to take the courses she wanted. These are only some of the historical liberties taken.Henson, Spencer, and Monáe work well together in their characters. Some subplots and characters are extraneous. Kevin Costner plays, as usual, Kevin Costner.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A fantastic character piece that does an excellent job depicting the mood of the United States during this era,"Hidden Figures (2016) is a movie I recently watched after DVR'ing it off FXM. The storyline follows three inspirational woman who played major roles in the race to space - one as an engineer, another who helped usher computer systems into the government and another who was a mathematician who helped design the rockets and their trajectory. This also depicts how they succeeded despite being treated often as second class citizens.This movie was directed by Theodore Melfi (St. Vincent) and stars Taraji P. Henson (Hustle & Flow), Octavia Spencer (The Help), Kevin Costner (Field of Dreams), Janelle Monáe (Moonlight), Mahershala Ali (Luke Cage), Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man), Jim Parsons (Big Bang Theory) and Aldis Hodge (One Night in Miami).The storyline for this picture is a fantastic character piece and does an excellent job depicting the times and mood of the United States during this era. The circumstances are interesting and well presented. The acting is out of this world and the film is perfectly cast. I was thoroughly impressed by the writing and dialogue and the end is triumphant.

Telling the stories of those in history who experienced a level of segregation and discrimination that most would never remember is hard. To be entertaining while respecting and celebrating the achievements while reminding viewers of how far we have come is even harder.

I am late as usual to most parties but I liked, then loved the film enough to watch it twice then buy it. Glad to help support this. A great story for women, people of color, and all Americans.

an emotional great film about 3 extraordinary strong women,"We follow three young women, black women, as they begin their journey at Nasa in a time when white colleagues would rather take a separate coffee pot than share it with a ""colored"" colleague. In a time when segregation and discrediting was writ large in the United States.""Hidden Figures"" does a really good job of shedding light on the racism and despicable attitudes these women faced, making it a pretty tough film at times.At the same time, the film still managed to retain a lightness that prevents it from becoming too serious. The focus is on the three extraordinary characters who were special and unique in their own right. They were women who worked as ""computers"" in the early days of the space program, and we get to know each of them a little. Due to the fact that the film is based on true events, the fate of the protagonists touches me even more and goes to the heart. Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monáe and especially Octavia Spencer shine in their roles. It was an absolute joy to watch these talents. I also liked Kevin Costner very much. Only Jim Parsons could not convince me. Somehow he is too close to his ""Sheldon Cooper"" role only without being funny. Through the impressive story, good dialogues and the great performance of the entire cast, you are captivated from the beginning to the end of the 2 h 7 min. Without the film loses pace. You can laugh and sometimes even shed a tear.A big compliment to director Theodore Melfi. He keeps things moving while giving some breathing room. The music rounds out the film expertly; everything fits together here. Great work has been done throughout to honor these characters without making them complete saints.-----

We are hiding the farm animals now like we did these brilliant humans,"I watched this movie through the lense of self-development as I picked it up from a self-development movie list online. A lot of it is atmospheric, about the circumstances, and annoyances of black women who worked at NASA. It is really inspiring to see them being so looked down upon, and given no consideration, and yet still somehow managing to take very important positions within a male dominated field especially at the time. It was very exciting seeing coloured bathrooms being demolished.I will say that NASA, and space travel, even though impressive leaves a bad taste in my mouth for we could have all this focus on our planet, the animals, and nature that we currently have. Where are the geniuses innovating ways we can preserve our climate? When will we focus on the planet the way we focus on stars? Different people should have different aspirations, but I don't want humanity to die haha. So anyway this was something different for me to watch because all I am focused on is nature right now (and self-development now haha).Another aspect which stands out to me is family, and love, and how these smart people get to be in these admirable positions. There is status gained while doing this work. I think I got quite jealous, and contemplative. I am astounded by how serious, and non playful it is to be working there, but also this is a movie so perhaps it is just a popular perception of how it is, but since these people were even racist, I guess it must have looked like that. Everything could be so much better if we had love, and compassion for each other, if we didn't laugh at our differences, and let the smart people do their work that they want to do.This movie got me thinking about how I could contribute in terms of smarts to humanity. We get to do this, and we should do it just for how cool it is, but we should also care about the animals, and the planet because that is even cooler. It is nice that we are less racist, but we are even more cruel to the animals now as factory farming got worse, and worse. In the social justice aspect humanity hasn't progressed at all - we just found new victims to commit even worse crimes on.We need animal rights movies like this currently not to say that this is bad, and I give this movie the best rating, but what we do to animals is far worse, and they deserve our attention right now as a socially discriminated species. We do not even acknowledge the animals as a species, and discrimination of them as speciesism. The public is being kept in the dark, but also a huge portion of it stay willfully ignorant of the struggles the animals face.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Very good, not quite great","This is a really watchable inspiring storyMy only criticism is that during a time of actual segregation and serious racial tension, they portray this in a rather patronising and dumbed down and even contradictory way. Essentially all white people are racist.I found it difficult to believe the petty racism shown by scientists to the black mathmatician e.g. Providing a small segregated coffee pot. In contradiction engineers were apparently not racist but supportive.I believe more could have been shown of this, the 'bigger' picture of racisim and the civil rights struggle in the USA. In my opinion the minor petty racism displayed by scientists, undermined an important message on how racism was inshrined in law at this time.

An inspiring tale of three iron-ladies at NASA! [+72%],"The going was never easy for Afro-American mathematicians Katherine, Dorothy and Mary at NASA. Their inspirational story has been (partially) recreated by Theodore Melfi and makes for an engaging watch. Though some facts could have been tinkered with, much of the misogyny and discrimination faced by these women at various circumstances during their stint and NASA (and elsewhere) are picturized in a believable manner.The friendly banter between the three women (especially the scenes in the car) is a scream. Spencer, Henson and Monae are wonderfully radiant and light up most of their respective scenes. Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst and Mahershala Ali and the rest pitch in with above-par supporting performances.It must have surely been intimidating for an Afro-American woman to work/study in institutions filled with scathing white men who tend to look down upon the colored. Katherine having to run half a mile to get to a 'colored' ladies restroom relieve herself, use a coffee machine designated for the 'colored', being denied entry at male-dominated meetings are just few instances where the viewer starts rooting for her character by default. That she is a wonderful mother only adds to her already-likable character arc. Sames goes with the other two women. Dorothy eventually goes on to head the programming department while Mary graduates in engineering, only by way of upgrading themselves through substantial efforts. The scene towards the end where Dorothy's white colleague played by Dunst finally addresses her as 'Mrs. Vaughan' declaring her newly-discovered admiration, is one of the stand- out moments in a film that boasts of several.The climax, although one that looks slightly tweaked to champion the presence of the three leads, is a well-cooked 'feel-good' meal.

Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) tries finding a way to maintain his group employable when technology seems to be close to does their jobs, and finally Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) pursues her dreams against every odd to become an engineer.This movie starts great. It has heart, and it has a great cast full of great actors. Every character has a personality that differentiates from others, and they set their motivations. But the movie starts to fell flat halfway through it.My interest at the beginning of the movie was really high, and I like every character but then at the middle of the movie I start to lose focus. I think is predictable what's going to happen and they don't try hiding it. It's a simple good movie that demonstrates how these women have to work twice as hard as anyone else to be noticed as equals. It doesn't intent to be more than that. The message is clear but they should have more focus on that in the middle of the second act.This movie gets 7 out of 10 because it has heart, talented cast and an incredible story.

Admittedly there is a sort of ""token nice white guy"" who's used as sort of a Deus Ex-Machina to resolve the main conflict of segregation in NASA. However, I'm not too well versed for how it actually went down, so I won't make too many harsh judgements on that particular scene.

Power of the Will,"Or of the Kevin - yet another movie where he stands up for people that are being treated unfairly and badly. You can think this wears out with Costner, but you can also just let him do his thing (mostly succesful and enlightening) and enjoy the movies or just not watch them. This is not really hard to predict, but the performances make it special.There are moments that depending on your world view may seem like middle ages, but unfortunately they really happened (maybe exaggerated a bit for effect). There are things being said and done to our main characters that are beyond despicable. It would be easy to give up on many occasions, very easy. But then you wouldn't have a movie, now would you?

You had to be there,"It's hard to recreate the early 60s on film since there was so much going on. Society was changing, we were moving from Eisenhower to Kennedy not only in style but in POV, sex and drugs were in your face, beatniks had turned into hippies, Frank Sinatra was out and Bob Dylan was in, civil rights was as much a concern in the North as in the South, freedom rides and the Peace Corps took up the time of college kids, women were redefining their roles, and we lived with the threat of nuclear war. How do you capture all of that? You don't. And this film doesn't either. but it does capture some of the angst for women and for ""colored"" people, and especially for ""colored"" women.Set against the space race, the film focuses on the lives of 3 women, inside NASA and in their private lives. The acting is terrific from everyone, but the photography is pretty pedestrian, especially the constant framing in doorways. The music is also disappointing, especially for an era in which music was ascending in importance.Leaving aside the film's shortcomings, the story itself is of major importance and a valuable addition to other films about the space race.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
See these HIDDEN FIGURES,"There are times when you see a movie ""based on a true story"", that you roll your eyes and realize that this is a VERY sensationalized account of what happens.  And then there are times, such as what happened with the new film HIDDEN FIGURES, that all I wanted to do was to go home, find out more about it and wonder ""why didn't I know more about this.""HIDDEN FIGURES is a very good film about a very interesting part of our recent history that deserves to have more light shed on it.This film tells the tale of the...ahem...HIDDEN FIGURES behind the ""Space Race"" in the 1960's - most intriguingly - the contributions of African-American women.As told by Director Theodore Melfi (the underrated ST. VINCENT - if you haven't seen this, then your'e in for a treat) from a screenplay by Melfi and Allison Schroeder based on the book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly, HIDDEN FIGURES focuses on the efforts of African-American women, embodied by 3 of them - Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson - as they navigate racism and sexism to ""just do our jobs"" and help put the Gemini 7 Astronauts in space, and the Apollo Astronauts on the moon.This easily could have been an indictment of how America treated women and minority races in the sixties - but it is much more than that.  This film shows the heart and courage of strong Americans in the face of adversity and overcoming those adversities with strength and dignity.Much of this strength and dignity can be traced to the 3 actresses in the lead roles - Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae - who incorporate these women with nobility, but avoid the trap of making them ""Saints"", they are real women working towards some basic goals in their everyday lives.  Spencer is nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her work as Vaughan, but I thought Monae's work as Jackson was just as strong, and maybe a little stronger.  This might be surprising as Monae is fairly new to acting, but if anyone caught her work in the Oscar nominated MOONLIGHT, you can see this performance is no fluke.  I wonder if her nomination was hindered by votes for her split between those two performances.The real hero of this film, however, is the lead performance given by Henson as Katherine Johnson, ""The Computer"".  Her portrayal of Johnson showed her as charming and frustrated and strong and impotent and smart and unsure - most of it at the same time.  Henson has been overlooked for her performance during this awards season, and that is too bad, she is TERRIFIC.Ably assisting these 3 are Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons as 2 co- workers who are ""not sure"" of these ladies and the always dependable Kevin Costner as the boss of all of these people.  Joining in are Oscar Nominee (for Moonlight) Mahershala Ali and Aldis Hodge as spouses of Johnson and Jackson.  These two are on too little to make a difference, but you can see something more simmering under there.And that is where this film suffers, a bit.  It glosses over the racial and sexual tensions of the time to focus on ""a disparate group of people coming together for the common good.""  This film ended up pulling it's punches and it would have been interesting to see what would have happened had it not.But, in the end, Director Melfi ends up with a film that can be called ""feel good"" and that is good enough, indeed, to bring these HIDDEN FIGURES into the light.Letter Grade:  A-/B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (OfMarquis)",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Mission Accomplished, I guess","I am ready to set off some not-so hidden puns in my review of the space drama ""Hidden Figures"". The movie has received major figures at the box office, and is nominated for several Oscar nominations including Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Motion Picture. ""Hidden Figures"" is based on the true story of three African- American women who provided some major mathematical data needed for NASA to help launch off America's first successful space missions in the early 60's. However, the main figure of this flick is the math wiz Katherine Johnson, admirably played by Taraji P. Henson. Octavia Spencer does provide some help here as Dorothy Vaughn, who was very instrumental in NASA's IBM management. Uprising star Janelle Monae plays Mary Jackson, the lively NASA engineer-to-be who fights the court in order to be enrolled in a all-white school. These were the 60's so Director Theodore Melfi does incorporate the themes of civil rights, segregation, and gender differences within his filmmaking mission of ""Hidden Figures"". Kevin Costner dazzles as the NASA Supervisor Al Harrison. Did not get much of a thespian big bang from Jim Parson's performance as the bullyish NASA engineer Paul Stafford. And ""Moonlight"" star Mahershala Ali moonlights here also as Johnson's beau Colonel Jim Johnson; but was not in ""Moonlight"" fantastic mode. Spencer did receive a Best Supporting Actress performance for a character that was not much of a blast in this space movie; so yea, I thought it was a fine performance but don't think it warranted a nomination. Don't get me wrong, ""Hidden Figures"" does have feel-good qualities and plays a well-deserved homage to these ladies who were such an addition to NASA's progress. ""Hidden Figures"" does rock it at times, but its not a perfect cinematic mission. **** Good",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Only 3 Oscar Noms?,"An intelligent and well executed look back at a far more racially divided but also a far more ambitious U.S. Congrats to Hollywood for putting aside a small percentage of a what was probably another Spiderman reboot or Transformers sequel to actually tell an original story worthy of being filmed. Thewestchestarian understands this was likely an aberration and that we'll get a $250M Suicide Squad remake for summer 2018 so let's enjoy it while we can. The film features three excellent portrayals of separate but unequal NASA employees trying to contribute their full talents for a nation that treats them pretty shabbily. Also, Kevin Costner puts in an Oscar-worthy performance as a NASA director under enough pressure from the Ruskies to take steps toward providing a more even playing field among the math geniuses under his charge. Apart from an overdone scene where Costner take a crowbar to a sign segregating the women's bathrooms, his character only changes as much as he needs to as shown in scenes when he refers to the now gender and racial integrated group as ""gentlemen"". The movie has some flaws. Katherine G. Johnson's character has 3 children who show up about twice - one is left to wonder how Katherine's long nights at Langley affected them. They movie also succumbs to the Hollywood superstar problem when telling a team story - one that Apollo 13 successfully avoided. Johnson's character is portrayed as the lone person who knows what they are doing while Jim Parsons' character does nothing else but take credit for her work. At one point Costner's character inspires them by pointing out he has assembled the best math geniuses in the country so presumably Parsons' Paul Stafford was making something of a contribution. In short, ultimately, this film is inspirational on several fronts and is the right one for the times and is way better than La La Land.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
pretty good movie,"Overall, this movie was about what I expected. A well-done, feel good movie, that takes a few liberties with the real life experiences of these women. The performances were certainly good and the movie never dragged. My main criticism was it was a bit predictable at times. For example, when Katherine enters into the workroom for the first time, you just knew that someone was going to mistake her for a janitor! In reality, Katherine said in interviews that she was treated very well in her workplace and felt no prejudice. The best thing about the movie is that it will hopefully encourage people to read the book on which it is based.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

It was really wonderful to see a film which has science and mathematics as part of its subject where you actually get a flavour of what the science is. So often (for example in the film about Ramanujan) the makers are so scared that they give no real clue to what the science is about. This film is different: it brings science alive to the general public. A must must see, not just for the stories of these heroic people, but also as an example of the way public engagement in science should be done---not in a patronising or ""spooky"" way, but by giving at least some idea of what the scientists were actually doing, and why it mattered.

"Inspirational, Starchy, and Skewed","""Hidden Figures"" is an inspirational bio-pic about three real black women mathematicians who played a part in NASA. It's relentlessly wholesome and a bit starchy, but worth seeing for the history it presents.Taraji P. Henson plays Katherine Johnson, who calculated the flight trajectories for Project Mercury and the Apollo 11 moon flight. Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughan, the first black woman supervisor at NACA (later NASA). Janelle Monae plays Mary Jackson, a mathematician and aerospace engineer. Kevin Costner plays the fictional Al Harrison, a composite boss figure. Kirsten Dunst is another composite figure, representing the mean white racist. Jim Parsons is, again, a composite figure, playing the mean white racist male version.""Hidden Figures"" shows its leads struggling against white racism. NASA was located in Langley, Virginia, which operated under Jim Crow. Johnson must run between buildings, often in pouring rain, in order to use the ""colored"" restroom. Her coworkers decline to drink coffee from the same pot she uses. White coworkers refer to the black women by their first names, while the black women refer to the whites as Mr or Miss and last name. In spite of all this, the women are able to achieve significant contributions to the space program, using their superior skills at mathematics.The movie's thoroughgoing wholesome preachiness can make it a bit dull. The black people in the film are all perfect – beautiful, perfectly dressed, kind, rational, great parents. Not a single black character ever dresses poorly or loses her temper or swears or is impatient with children or makes a mistake. Such perfect people make for boring drama.In recent years, Hollywood has caught much flak when it produces movies that show whites advancing black civil rights. ""Mississippi Burning"" was widely criticized for telling the true story of white contributions to the Civil Rights movement. Critics demanded films that depicted blacks as heroes and whites as bad guys. The historical reality is, though, that without white allies, Civil Rights would have been dead in the water.As I was watching ""Hidden Figures,"" I thought of the invisible white allies the film erased from its account. Virtually every white person the film's black women encounter is a hostile bigot or merely clueless (as is Costner's composite character). A Polish engineer, the real life Kazimierz Czarnecki, is shown in a seconds-long scene encouraging a black woman, but it is made clear that he is encouraging her because he is a foreigner and not American. In another seconds-long scene, astronaut John Glenn is shown going out of his way to be pleasant to the black women; Harrison pulls him away, as if to say, ""Being nice to black people is not allowed at NASA.""I don't believe that African American women were invited into NASA, encouraged to get advanced degrees, and to spread their wings without white higher-ups deciding that NASA would challenge Jim Crow and play a part in the Civil Rights Movement. Those farsighted heroes, whoever they were, have been erased from this account.Another aspect of the film is ironic. The movie wants the viewer to accept black women as thinkers. And yet it dresses two of its leads in the tightest of dresses and the highest of heels and the lushest of fake eyelashes. Even when at home, putting the kids to bed, the leads are picture perfect. Look at photos of the real Jackson, Vaughan, and Johnson. They were not hot models. They looked like mathematicians often look: a bit rumpled, with average attractiveness.Yes yes we all know movies must have attractive leads. But Russel Crowe was allowed to look rumpled and nerdy in ""A Beautiful Mind,"" about mathematician John Nash. No one forced him to wear a tight shirt that displayed his chest hair or his pecs. Even movies urging equality must resort to old fashioned, sexist objectification of women's bodies in order to bring in viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

'Hidden Figures' is a crowd-pleaser with math and social appeal,"""Hidden Figures"" is about the unheralded group of African-American women who crunched numbers for NASA in the early 1960s, when the space race against the Russians was heating up the Cold War. Skilled mathematicians all, they took the theoretical equations of the white male engineers and turned them into workable data, often on the fly and always subject to last-minute revisions. ""Hidden Figures"" is a paean to black female nerds, a generally overlooked demographic in American media, and the film's major through-line is the heroine's gathering confidence as she struggles to be accepted by the white male analysts of the Space Task Group. Outstanding piece of work by Taraji Henson and Octavian Spencer justifying their performances as Black Negroes. The film's made with more heart than art and more skill than subtlety, and it works primarily because of the women that it portrays and the actresses who portray them. It deserves to make as much money as other big budget movies does. I do admit that it is one of the best films of 2016 and an Oscar Bait for outstanding performances. I go with 4.5/5 for Hidden Figures.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Space Race,"Three female African-American Mathematicians join NASA in the early 60's at a time when segregation was still rife. Despite all of the prejudice that is levied upon them they defy the odds and each in their own way prove pivotal to NASA and their bid to get a man into space....Racial segregation in the US was something that I was aware of and was something that I also had a basic understanding of, however the NASA space race was something I knew little about so on that basis I decided to give this film a shout and I pleased to report that I think I made the right call...Every time I watch a film with racial segregation I feel as though I've been transported into some kind of alternate reality (in that I still find it hard to believe that those times ever existed). Director Theodore Melfi has no quarms in getting this point across and hammers it home at nearly every given opportunity (the heavy-handed approach employed here is my only major criticism that I have with this film).Minor criticisms lie with the imbalanced story arcs with the 3 protagonists; we learn a lot about Katherine (whose brilliant mind and nervous energy make her an interesting and rather fun character to watch), but her friends don't get the same focus which was a bit frustrating to me as I would have liked to have learned more about them. Like a lot of biopics, Melfi plays a lot of the material on the safe side; it's a little fuzzy at times with rather predictable character shifts.However, despite some of the above comments I did enjoy this film ( a special mention goes out to Taraji P Henson who I thought was terrific). The tenacity of these 3 women is beyond question and the breakthroughs in science that they achieved is simply phenomenal. Even with some of its shortcomings, this is an uplifting film about overcoming prejudice, fighting your corner and applying your talents to something that you believe in (regardless of how tough the road ahead may be). I take my hat off to these 3 women and would certainly recommend this film to one and all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A feel-good bio-pic about a remarkable episode in history.,"Before the feminist era, written history was mostly about men while women were by-lines and coloured women non-existent. In the past several decades, women have been reclaiming their place in history and the film Hidden Figures (2016) is part of this cultural change. It is a story that celebrates the achievements of a hitherto un-acknowledged group of women who were called 'coloured computers' before the first mainframe IBM was ready for NASA in the 1960s.Based on real events, the film is set against the Cold War and the frantic race between America and Russia to put the first man on the Moon. More than space science, it was about competing political systems and bragging rights for aeronautical supremacy. The story centres on three gifted coloured women who joined the space program: mathematician Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) audits the calculations of white male scientists and devises new mathematical solutions for trajectory calculations; Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) teaches herself complex Fortran code to become the expert on the IBM computer and NASA's first coloured supervisor; and Mary Johnson (Janelle Monae) wins the right to enrol in a segregated engineering course to become NASA's first coloured female engineer. The trio are part of a scientific group that is under immense political pressure to achieve the successful manned spaceflight which became astronaut John Glenn's space legacy.The historical facts frame the story but it is the treatment of the facts that makes the film interesting. It could have been a tense drama or dry bio-pic but instead it is full of comedic moments and under-stated racial vignettes. For example, on her first day Katherine is mistaken for a janitor and all the coloured women must walk half a mile to use the segregated bathroom. Despite the best available ""white brains"" only a coloured woman can work out the new IBM computer and astronaut John Glenn will not 'lift off' unless Katherine first checks the IBM trajectory calculations. The ironies are not designed to get laughs, but to show how even the nation's finest scientific minds were locked into systemic racial discrimination in a NASA culture that was blind to its own prejudices.This is a great film on many levels. As a bio-pic, it carries the weight of history in telling a story that must be told. The acting is outstanding, with a perfect balance between depicting the ugly side of racial oppression and the women's determination to contribute to aeronautical science. Character development is on the light side as the focus is not on personality but on achievement. The trio of stars all portray dignity under duress and their repressed anger saves the film from turning into a lecture. It achieves what any bio-pic drama can hope for: it offers feel-good entertainment while informing about a remarkable episode in history.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Light for a Movie About Physics,"Hidden Figures is the inspiring true story of the under-appreciated and undervalued heroes of the space race's formative years. Specifically, the film recalls the various trials and tribulations of mathematician Dorothy Vaughan, engineer Mary Jackson and physicist Katherine G. Johnson all of whom were women, black and working on the Mercury missions. When the film begins they're all working among a pool of colored women whom Johnson once sarcastically dubbed ""computers in skirts."" Their job was to calculate launch and landing, which according to history was a task all the women of the West Area Computing Unit took on with vigor. As time neared the first American space flights, Johnson gained the support of her colleagues and helped plot navigational charts and develop launch windows for the likes of Alan Shepard, Virgil Grissom and John Glenn.The accounts of these three women before, during and after Mercury are intrinsically interesting enough to fill up an entire series of movies or at the very least get the three-plus hour Right Stuff (1983) treatment. A cursory look at their lives reveals a parade of stunning accomplishments, a slew of firsts and a treasure trove of women-in-STEM stories that yearn to be told to every young girl with a chemistry set.Sadly for Johnson (Henson), Vaughan (Spencer) and Jackson (Monae), Hidden Figures is comparatively light, rerouting all its energy from the soul, work and math to being just another cliché-ridden crowd-pleaser. Instead of the stories we need told, the script populates the screen with watered-down cliffnotes and gambles on the cast to give the film's bullet points just enough of a unique flavor. The institutional racism spread throughout sends powerful messages (as often happens in these kinds of movies) but far too many times we get the feeling we're being setup for a cathartic change in the wind instead of feeling the full impact of the institutional racism.Nor do we face hard truths of its effects. Each of our heroes responds to their plight in different ways. Vaughan uses every resource to make her indispensable, going so far as to learn programming to get leverage over her boss (Dunst). Her tact in getting what she wants is certainly the most enlightened – she learns how to program then she teaches those in her office. Yet her leadership through service always stops at the water's edge. ""You don't ask for equal rights, you demand it, you take it,"" says Jackson's husband (Hodge) right before he's put in his place. Then as if to prove something, Jackson breaks barriers to become an engineer by asking really, really nicely.Johnson jumps over the pratfalls of institutional racism by simply being smarter than everyone; a distinction Taraji P. Henson wears with quiet dignity until she suddenly doesn't for a brief rain soaked scene that screams Oscar-bait. Because Johnson is so likable a lot is forgiven but at some point I really had to ask myself how many times they were going to compliment her scenes of empowerment with Kevin Costner on autopilot.That in conjunction with the treacly family and romance scenes involving Mahershala Ali sink this film from being anything more than a feel-good, run-of-the-mill, ""boy that racism, so glad that's over"" movie. I kid you not, watching this film in a crowded theater and hearing audiences react to every payoff was like witnessing a Pavlovian experiment on complacency in real time. At least Hidden Figures isn't as bad as The Help (2011). It's more like Remember the Titans (2000) for nerds.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A Simplistic Hero Piece. No depth of character or story in any form. Beyond the stars, it's all flavourless window dressing","I understand that this was to be a hero piece. I understand that the main characters had to be better than everybody else. But what started to grate, and then to annoy, was the fact that not a single other character contributed a single thing. Although it was sometimes talked about, no character apart from the main two actually do any math, or any programming. The 'Big Bag Theory' guy complained some. I think Kevin Costner held a piece of chalk a couple of times, but he spent most of the time telling us how awesome the main character was. Whilst the height of realism is not required, the hard focus on the main character suggested almost that she was doing ALL the work herself, which made the whole thing look weak and unconvincing.(Mini-spoiler: what DID give her the right to insist on attending a classified briefing? Theoretically, other people would have to know data too, but, of course, no one else does anything at all, so her case is different. Seemed like a pretty cushy job to work in that office.) Some other things happened in this movie. They weren't as important as the main characters. (The really motivated and snappy character got left behind about half way through.

Hands down the absolute best movie I have ever seen (and I've seen a lot),"This move is slightly different than the book. But true to the book. The story is absolutely amazing - you think about where we would be (the entire world) if everyone was just allowed to live up to their potential. These women worked in difficult situations, weren't given basic respect, and basically had everything going against them - except for 1 thing. . . their selves. Their belief that they had something to offer and the actors seemed to channel that energy and bring you right into the heart of racism, sexism, and passive hatred. . . and rise above it. Both the story and the actors are so amazing you can't walk away without thinking, ""How will people view us 50 years from now around our thoughts about refugees, mental illness, etc.""I wish I could have met the three women (one is still alive - living in a nursing home in VA). They were amazing. How I wish I could meet the author of the book, the director of the movie, and the actors and tell them how much this movie has changed me. People (no matter their physical or mental abilities) need to be able to use their special skills to make this a better world. I just think of the quote from Albert Einstein, ""Everybody is a Genius. But If You Judge a Fish by Its Ability to Climb a Tree, It Will Live Its Whole Life Believing that It is Stupid""Where would we be if these women hadn't been allowed to use their talents? Where would we be if they had been recognized for their abilities?Again, the story is just amazing itself. . . but the acting just blows me away. . . every person in the movie seems to be doing more than ""acting"". . . they seem to be living it and bringing you into it so you can feel the emotions yourself.THANK YOU for this amazing story!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An incredible film that can't help but move you,"Based on a true story, Hidden figures follows the story of three Negro women who were employed at NASA during the height of the space race. This is the 1960s when racial segregation was still in place and racism was rife. As coloured women, they were considered the lowest of the low, yet in reality that were all geniuses who went on to play a major part in the USA's space program.Hidden figures, is one of the best films I have ever seen. It deals with deep issues such as racism and sexism in a feel-good way that leaves the watcher gunning for the heroes. The film also demonstrates the incredible power of mathematics in a subtle way that does not detract from the awe you feel for the people using it. Until I'd seen the film, I had no idea that black women were even employed at NASA, let alone played a critical part in calculating orbital geometry. I could not recommend this film strongly enough.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fantastic & Historical,"Although I was in the audience watching the movie I felt like I was back there for the sequence of events. I got so into the movie I forgot where I was and what year it really is. I was immediately snapped back to reality when the 3 little girls were in their bedroom and I saw those bedspreads. My mother had the same thing on my bed as a child. The setting was real and I noticed the destination on the old bus. It was so real to see and experience the trials and problems at that time for NASA, society and our culture. Having lived through that time I wonder how we survived. The movie was a big enjoyable and borderlines on a historical documentary. Cast was great! Events were factual and there was an excitement in rooting for the ""home team"" even if history is repeating it self. I would like to have the car. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give the film an 11 but, 10 is as high as I can go. I would recommend the movie to everyone middle school and older. I liked it so much - it is my intention to buy the DVD when available. Great movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Hidden Figures, Hidden Women","A fantastic story told in a fantastic way. The movie is based in real events which is really refreshing as what we know is the final event, launching a man into space, but what we didn't know (probably) was what was behind it, what aspects made it happen, the people who were involved and as it was 1961 there were not only white men involved but also black women.So we find ourselves in a story about discrimination against not only black people but also women. So these black women not only had to fight because they were women but because they were black too. And it is an interesting story because they are really smart women working at the NASA, something that didn't happen every day. So besides the fight of these women to prove what they were capable of, there is also the final destination, which is something that hadn't been done before. So we are taught a bit of history too.All three main actresses do an amazing job portraying these strong women. I specially like Taraji P. Henson who already got our attention in the show Empire. the main characters are supported by a bunch of well-known actors playing the secondary ones, which only supports more the work of the three leading ladies.An interesting movie to learn more about the people that we don't see in the news, about their hard work that make civilization moving forward, about what happens when you are different and don't have the same rights as the others just because of the color of your skin.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

What We Could Use to Keep Running Forward,"Fifty-six years ago, the first Black women came to work at NASA, a milestone during a time that in a way appears similar to our modern- day culture. Maybe there are no more Jim Crow segregation laws, but we still see Civil Rights protests by angry citizens flaunting picket signs, gender discrimination in the workforce, and consistent scientific breakthroughs from widely respected corporations. You might believe me when I say how very little has changed since then, as we are ultimately guilty of repeating the same mistakes, which the newest biopic, Hidden Figures, subtly proves to us. ​ It churns your stomach to remember the function of class relations in 1961: all colored people by law could only touch specially separated computers, bathrooms, and coffee stations labeled, ""colored."" The police also had the privilege to escort a Negro out of the library for setting foot in the ""White"" section. Unbelievably, these rules to living were active not too long ago. Yet these circumstances allow the delivery of an uplifting true story about man's historical progression and future potential.Three ladies of color are seen beside a non-functioning car in the Virginia countryside. So who else would come to ruin their day other than a stubborn police officer? It looks like a deep pit of doom until they suddenly get the car functioning again, and successfully convince the officer to escort them to their jobs at NASA.One is sent to the other ""colored"" workers in a separate room from the rest of the campus, one is left to work in the testing facility where the other men bully her, and one gets the worst of it—she spends day and night working behind a desk, ruthlessly mistreated by everybody else. Her incredible knowledge in analytical geometry makes little difference; she still gets deliberately discriminated by her coworkers, and has no other options other than to race half a mile across campus to the nearest ""colored"" bathroom whenever she needs to relieve herself.The cast and crew's hard work results in a loyal adaptation, both to the true story and to the Margot Lee Shetterly book it's based on. Educational facilities everywhere will benefit from its survey of the cultural influence on NASA during its early efforts of launching man into space. If that's not a landmark event in societal progression worth telling, then I don't know what is.Although beside the meticulous recreation of the Civil Rights era's segregation, the overall period setting offers nothing new to the cinematic experience. Director Theodore Melfi's direction brims in the epitome of generic: creating too squeaky-clean of an atmosphere in order to be the sole ""family-friendly"" Oscar buzz movie. The bright colors and made-for-television sets do not recreate the sickening feel of the era it attempts to establish. Although the period does get needed justice by showing a series of news footage from the time, the slightly-off-focus cinematography fails to craft the feel of immersion.The shifts in tone and character may feel a bit too sudden to produce any further realism in the environment, the overwhelmingly masculine society triggers a series of intriguing tests onto the three women. At home, one of them must act as both mommy and daddy to her three daughters, adding to her already boiling pressure. The challenges on and off the job never seem to quit, and the remarkable chemistry between the three leading ladies: Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe, halt any dull moments. Henson particularly deserves special recognition in her portrayal of an independent woman we want to succeed; her transparent discomfort comes across as all the White workers stop and stare at the color of her skin.While a picture about the Civil Rights era probably didn't need to dwindle its content down to a profitable PG-rating, the job still triumphs based on the difficult subject the cast and crew had to handle. In light of recent memories we have succumbed to throughout 2016, all of us: man and woman, dark or light, millennial and baby boomer, ought to use a high quality feel-good drama to look toward a brighter 2017.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Hidden Figures is a stellar movie about math, space, and the beyond. It transcends this galaxy with the brilliant minds of the three women.","The acting of Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae are the starlets of this movie, and are exceptionally brilliant. They drive the plot, which drags once or twice, and entrance the viewer with convincing acting and sassy remarks. My compadre Mickfleigh and I (I am Biph) went to go see this movie after originally intending to see La La Land for a third time, and were very impressed by the sheer beauty of this motion picture. Mickfleigh and I were on the edge of our gray, cushiony movie seats throughout this entire movie, despite the children that surrounded us and attempted, but failed, to distract us with silly tales of candy and unicorns. As stated before, Henson, Spencer, and Monae were able to hypnotize even the minds of two intellectuals such as ourselves. 9/10, would recommend with popcorn.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Too much sugar-coating to get to the heart of the matter,"HIDDEN FIGURES follows the behind-the-scenes journey of NASA to put a man on the moon. With stiff competition between Russia and the thought of coming in second place in a two-way race, the need for success was palpable. We have seen movies following the journey of astronauts and the science wizards at NASA, but who would have guessed that even as man was shooting for the stars, employees at the head offices still had to use ""colored"" and ""white"" bathrooms?Theodore Melfi directs this picture which has the feel-good attitude of ""The Help,"" a movie that was a box-office success and sugarcoated race relations in the 1960's. Heck, even Octavia Spencer appears in both films. I can't say for sure which film succeeds more at its objective. The story of black female mathematicians surely isn't one that many people had heard of, and perhaps that's where the film's title is rooted (although I would wager that ""Hidden Figures"" is one of the year's worst titles...). It's a good story rooted in strong performances, but I found the overall result to be a wash of clichés and predictability.Three friends - Katherine, Dorothy, and Mary (Taraji Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae respectively) carpool together to the offices of NASA where John Glenn is about to launch into space to become the first American to circle the globe via spaceship. How they are friends we are not sure, but their quick wits and strong minds surely bind them together. Our central character is Katherine, who is called in to assist with the top engineers on flight reentries and landings. Not only is she the only black woman working on these most important calculations, but she is the only woman aside from a secretary who watches her with distain. She reports to Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), built up to be a firm disciplinarian but develops into a man who only wants to see the job done, regardless of race or sex. At NASA, we learn that most of the black mathematicians work in a 'holding room' of sorts, arriving each morning and assigned as 'computers' on various tasks that could result in a couple hours work or a couple weeks... It's all based on assignment. Though they are all employed, the possibility of work is not always guaranteed.Like ""Apollo 13"" did so brilliantly, suspense is built during moments when we know the outcome. Even though we know John Glenn makes it back to earth safely (and only just passed away this year), there are nail-biting moments of drama when the fate of success rests on a pencil, paper, and brains. Mary (Janelle Monae in the film's best performance) is assigned to work on the capsule and heat shield. Though she excels at math, she dreams of becoming an engineer (unheard of at the time. She became the first black female engineer in NASA history as the end credits tell us). She takes no slack and acts as any man in her position would: she is straight-forward and doesn't shy away from confrontation. Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) only wants to become a Supervisor and get an according pay raise, and along the way discovers her knack for computers and electronic programming.I admire the film and it's message, but even yet we suffer from cliché. Whether or not Katherine Johnson was called in within 10 seconds of launch to recalculate a landing formula is beside the point. There are moments in this film where I found myself saying ""I've seen this before"" and ""I bet I know what will happen next."" Ten times out of ten I was right. This isn't to discredit the stories of the real women, but rather dismiss the screenwriter for falling prey to conventionality. I highly doubt Dorothy Vaughan was able to sneak into the massive IBM Computer Room and reprogram the machine for weeks without being caught. I doubt the engineers at NASA were really so dumb as to put astronauts' lives at risk until the their math was proved wrong by the film's hero. For a film, it's exhilarating entertainment. Considering the real-life story was almost guaranteed to be less dramatic, we can cut our losses.I should expect Janelle Monae and perhaps Octavia Spencer to reel in the award nominations for their dedicated and memorable roles. I would consider Taraji P Henson if not for one scene that screams ""I want an Oscar"" in which Katherine explodes about having to use a colored bathroom and face the scorn of her coworkers. Wide-eyed and full of rage, it's a powerful moment yet goes against everything we know this character to be. The film itself feels a lot like that: trying so hard to be an Oscar contender even by putting reality aside. There isn't a whole lot of depth given to these characters, and even less to the white engineers who essentially prove to be the villains (Jim Parsons gives a surprisingly monotone performance). For movies to touch on aspects of historical race relations, they must realize that it isn't all black and white.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Dealing with segregation does not necessarily make a good movie,"For his second feature film, Theodore Melfi tries this time to deal with a more serious topic: the role of black women in the American society in early 60's. This is how we meet Katherine Goble, a gifted woman, working as a ""computer"" in the Langley Research Center and two of her colleagues and friends Mary Jackson, yearning for a engineer position and Dorothy Vaughan an unofficial supervisor. All along the movie, we will see how women had to work hard to establish theirselves and gain recognition in the male-dominated engineering world.This is for the plot, now let's go deeper into this movie. Actually, there is nothing fundamentally wrong in this movie, everything is just OK. But making a film about segregation and misogyny does not make necessarily a good movie. And here is the evidence. During the two hours of this movie we will witness all forms of discrimination but nothing more that we've seen dozens of times. Unlike some other movies, such as Fences for example, where these sensitive topics were dealt with subtlety we are here just talking about discrimination to give substance to the movie.That aside, the story behind the movie aims to show the work of NASA engineers and computers during the 60's star wars between Americans and Russians. Once again, in order to wow the spectators, characters just throw us mathematical formulas and spatial jargon all along the movie. But when you have a better look on it you can just see trivia or nonsense formulas. It is a common way in movies to try to impress spectators with non sense jargon, and this movie is not an exception.Eventually, there are all the same some good things with this movie. It allows us to have a better understanding about these hidden figures who were at the root of American space conquest and it is also a way to acknowledge the value of their work. Besides the acting and the filmmaking are good enough.To conclude, even though the screen writing remains interesting I think that this story would have been a better documentary than a movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A great historical story; could use a bit more history.,"A fascinating story with very good performances, but the movie has a good bit of ""based on a true story"" massaging. Checking on NASA's FAQ about the movie, several of the key characters were composites or 'based on' real people. The good news about this approach is that the film is very accessible and can reach a larger audience. It's not just a 'film buff' movie, but it does round off a lot of the more complicated edges of the true story. All the acting work is superb; really, the only poorly realized characters are the generic composite antagonists played by Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst, which is more the fault of the writing than of the performances.

It's okay,"I really wanted to like this film, but there is just so much wrong with it.1. While I'm not denying that African Americans faced awful situations during the history of this country, as others have pointed out nasa was integrated by this time.

Not to take away from the brilliance of these women, but they literally know IBM computers better than IBM employees and know how the capsule will do better than all the rocket scientists? I'm not buying that.3. Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst absolutely drag this film down. Parsons played the role exactly like Sheldon, and every scene he was in all I see is Sheldon working at nasa. Dunst's attempt at a southern accent was so bad every scene she was in became insufferable.On the positive side, this is an inspiring story and all the African American women do a very good job with their roles.

Superb movie,"I knew very little about this movie before watching and it was a pleasant surprise to me, as the subject matter seemed a little boring. How wrong I was. I couldn't fault any part of the movie. It's only right that these women should gain their proper place in history and they be rightly recognised by everyone, not just their peers. The movie is not just dramatic, it's moving in parts too, and I have to say that more than once, I was ashamed to be white. The very idea of segregation was and is shameful and I felt deeply for them on more than one occasion. The story, without giving too much away, centers on three women, who happen to be black, at a period in history when the small-minded considered black people to be pariahs and inferior; this movie shows there is and was nothing inferior about these brilliant women. They push through the bigotry and make their way into the upper-echelons of NASA. Katherine Goble was nothing less than a genius and without her brilliant mind, man would probably never have made it to the moon when he did. Certainly John Glenn would never have left the launch-pad when he orbited the earth, without her correcting IBM computer coordinates. It's a wonderful movie and I'd recommend it to anyone.

Hidden Treasures,"Hidden Figures was a great film that shed light on some of the not so well known people who helped America make great strides in Space Travel.It is truly a beautiful story that showcases three brilliant and courageous colored women who made their voices heard and improved things for themselves. Katherine, Mary and Dorothy each made progress and subsequently their mark. Dorothy became proficient in the use of IBM machines, Mary got a court order and fought racist rules and traditions to become the first African American engineer. Katherine also fought racist attitudes and got a seat to classified meetings and provided perfect numbers for NASA.The film highlights how NASA was held back from achieving its goals because of racism and not using all its human intelligence. Racism only hinders human progress and the best ideas rising to the top. Three brilliant women overthrew these racist traditions in an organization that is supposed to value intelligence and innovation. How far the human race would have gone if we valued Merit over superficial qualities. A powerful message is delivered that intelligence can be found among us all regardless of color. It is not concentrated but distributed naturally.The only issue with this film was the soundtrack. It did not fit well at all with the time period and did not suit the mood. What's funny is the 60s had some of the greatest music. Understandably many films now use these songs in their films but the soundtrack could have included not so popular tracks of that time. Modern music and mashups undermine the quality and mood of it.We see some stellar performances from the main three cast members who portray Dorothy, Mary and Katherine. This film was appropriately named to illustrate the great contributions made by women who are not given all the credit they deserve due to the time period and so are hidden in history amid other names. Besides being brilliant woman they were also mothers who supported their families, true backbones of American life and society. Their bravery and courage to challenge ignorant racist customs and bring progress perhaps make them the Rosa Parks of NASA.Definitely recommended, 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A movie that is just out of this world,"Where can I even begin with Hidden Figures other than this was the movie of 2016 for sure.We follow three black women who work at NASA, aiming for their dreams and suffering through the oppression that black people went through during the 60s.This really opened my eyes to the oppression black people went through. I've heard of it before but never really knew how bad it was until I watched this movie. It was terrible and the things that people go through in this movie? There are still people alive today that went through this. This really was still quite recent. It's mind blowing to think about, really.Our characters are three strong black women that don't take crap and it's beautiful. They hold their heads up high and do not allow the oppression to get to them. They do what they can in what they're provided and they kick ass. Taraji P.

I can't wait to see what else they bring to film.I actually did a lot of research into Friendship 7 before watching this, and the plot was really true to fact. It's really wonderful to see that the script writers and such did a lot of research into the events that happened.The cinematography in this movie was stunning.

Cheers to the Women Who Sent Man to Space!,"Hidden Figures puts on screen a significant piece of history, where 3 overlooked women pioneers, aka the hidden figures, overcame racial and sexual prejudice within NASA, and played pivotal roles in sending man to space. This 2016 gem just does that, as it showcased the unfair practices of systemic racism, and how through sheer brilliance & courage, these women fought, persevered and cemented their place in history. In fascinating fashion, the film presents these hefty themes in such a light hearted tone. This makes for a uniquely entertaining watch, as there is humor to be found in place of heavy-handed drama. Its triumphs as well offers emotional rewards instead of infuriating turnouts, common for films that tackle racism.As for the performances, stellar across the board! Octavia Spencer, Michal Keaton & Jim
Parsons (what a nice addition) were on point in their respective scenes. Worthy of praise are their consistent reception of our heroes, as the lack of melodrama or sudden warmth adds realistic appeal. Taraji Henson on the other hand, seemed initially out of place for the lead role. However, she absolutely mesmerized in the film's single, powerful scene, cementing her place as the definitive Katherine Goble.Despite its laudable screenplay, there are unfortunate misses to highlight. For one, the film struggled to avoid fictional embellishments that warranted a giggle or two. Also, there are certain story arches that comes off forced and weak such as the Katherine's romantic escapade & Janelle Monae's glossed over & forgettable storyline. These events served as an unneeded distraction to the engaging events within NASA.Overall, Hidden Figures probably won't come up in most Best Films of the Year lists, but it does boast of an undeniable story that features crowd pleasing victories, led by names NOT meant to be forgotten.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hidden,I loved this movie. I don´t know much about NASA or what goes on. This was a cool representation of how NASA dealt with the color separation. They didn't much care for what color you were only to make sure that the person that was getting sent into space was safe and they wouldn't care who did it but they needed someone to calculate the math and they just needed it done no matter the skin color. Also the fact that they were ladies put a bigger problem but NASA just wanted their calculations correct no matter the cost. And even though their was problems with the colored section people accepted the ladies because they could do things no other person could and their math and calculations and brains were better then any white male or white women. It was also really cool how you saw what the difference was in a situation where its an enclosed space compared to the world.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Success Comes a Little Too Easily for These Groundbreaking Ladies,"The true story of three black women in the institutional halls of 1960s NASA, struggling to prove their value in engineering and mathematics while also sending John Glenn into orbit. It's a nice story and a strong moral, if a bit on the safe side. Nothing seems terribly difficult for these women, whether it's theoretical physics or racial equality, which reduces the power of their eventual success. One early scene epitomizes this attitude: broken down on the side of the road, they're approached by a stereotypical southern white policeman. Though internally panicked, they proudly stand their ground and deflect his barbs, and moments later he's giving them a friendly escort to the workplace. Faced with any degree of adversity, they merely hunker down, redouble their efforts and glide to victory. Which is admirable, and possibly truthful, if not especially gripping. The acting is good - Taraji P. Henson is most memorable as a mousey mother of three whose sole public outburst provides the film's only major dash of flavor - but the plot is too interested in lobbing softballs when it could've been pitching something with teeth. A warm, simple tale, appropriate viewing for a Sunday night with the family if not for challenging conventions.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Based on a true story that does ring true,"My past experience with movies based on a true story, is such that I usually stay away from the lot. Hollywood's approach to the truth is all too possessive and commercial, at least as far as I'm concerned. But this story made me curious so I checked its page on IMDb, and found here the horrible goof of making the Mercury spacecraft too spacious, I went in deeper, and found a very long list of even less significant facts, I was actually expecting to find that the color of the NASA employees shoelaces was all wrong, I really developed a distaste to the goofs section of this site. But I kept on reading, moving into the trivia section of the page where I learned that colors were used to set the mood of the film, using cold neon colors for the NASA spaces and warm colors for the personal office of Al Harrison and the ladies' houses. That really caught me by surprise. Next thing they'll tell me night scenes were set in darkness while daytime scenes used actual daylight. As a rule this section is more illuminating than the goofs section but, by now I was convinced that when IMDb dwells on such details the movie might be truer than most.So here goes: this film does have a truthful feeling to it, the actors and actresses justify the ensemble award they got from SAG, they are all super. The leading three ladies do get more opportunities to shine, especially so Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer, who get most of the screen time, but this is definitely an entire cast working together. Apart from this fact, the movie uses a lean approach that suits movies based on a true story - No fancy CGI or camera angles just plain good old story telling. No fireworks are needed when your basic story works so well. I do agree with the reviewers stating that this is a feelgood movie, it is.

Great film,"This is such an important story. It's difficult to separate the quality of the film from the necessity that this story was told, especially in this political climate. Yes, this was a glossy Hollywood movie. That being said, the characters were well developed, the acting superb and the direction really spectacular. I know some people loved the music. I don't understand creating new music for a period in history that already has great music. Otherwise, the story is wonderful and all of the women in the film were excellent. The male characters also did a very good job, but were definitely outshone by the strength of the women.

"Glad to learn these women's remarkable stories, but the problems they confronted persist","It would be hard not to like this inspiring Ted Melfi movie (trailer) based on the true story of three women—three black women—overcoming early 1960s gender and racial stereotypes to make it in the super-white-male environment of NASA, just as Americans are struggling into space. Katherine Johnson (played by Taraji P. Henson), Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe), and Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) were powerful role models for their, or any, age. Despite being relegated to the pool of ""colored computers,"" as the black female mathematicians were called, and despite their superb skills being barely recognized, they showed astonishing levels of patience and tenacity, as the story tells it. At times, the movie feels like a deserved exercise in myth-making. Families are supportive, kids are perfect, home life is smooth. These women are almost too good. Their lives had to be more complicated than that. But those aspects of their stories are secondary to their achievements in the workplace, and that's where the movie focuses. With the recent passing of John Glenn (reportedly every bit as open and truly nice as on screen here), the early days of U.S. space program have disappeared into history. Today's Americans either weren't born yet or may have forgotten the fear that gripped the nation when Russia orbited the first satellite, when rocket after rocket blew up on the Cape Kennedy launch pad. When our education system, at least temporarily, geared up for greater student achievement in math and science. The pressure on NASA to succeed was enormous, and this is the environment in which these women worked and excelled. Despite their significant contributions five decades ago, something essential about the message has been lost. Between 1973 and 2012, 22,172 white men received PhDs in physics, as did only 66 black women. I liked this movie; I think the subject is great, and the broader recognition well deserved and too long delayed. The three women play their roles beautifully, as individuals, not symbols. While the subject was new and surprising, the film stakes no new emotional territory. More disappointing, fifty years on, the movie's ""feel-good"" moment is quickly trumped by awareness of our society's persistent racism and gender inequity. Perhaps the fact that this movie has been a top box office draw several weeks running, will help, but I've seen that movie before. See it for yourself, feel good, and then ask yourself, what next?",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Inspirational feel-good movie,"Hidden Figures is a very good film that depicts the story of three computers who happen to be young black women in the racially charged early 1960's. The computers calculated all of the math required to compete against the Russians in the race to space.The three stars are a super mathematician, an engineer, and a supervisor. Each woman is facing a battle against an immovable object - misogyny, racial prejudice, and a good-old boys network.Taraji Henson is terrific as Kathryn, the mathematical genius. She was outstanding, especially in one scene where she loses it to decry the silent injustices that she's had to deal with at NASA. Kevin Costner plays her crusty boss, the program leader Al, who slowly but surely starts realizing that things need to change if NASA is going to really work like a team, leverage all skills, and succeed.Janelle Monae is Mary, who dreams of being an engineer, but there are no women engineers, much less black women. She too has a mentor who sees her grit and skills, and works to support her efforts.My favorite though was Octavia Spencer as Dorothy, a programmer genius who is the true leader, and she knows it. She dreams of being a supervisor, yet she keeps running into racial prejudice from a white woman supervisor who does not even seem to realize her actions.The story is sometimes a bit uneven. There's a long love interest story going on for Kathryn. There's John Glenn's story too, and Grisham. Sometimes it seems like there was just a bit too much being crammed into the story.In the end, the dramatic finish leaves you hoping that things work out for everyone. Just enough suspense and you have a nicely wrapped up feel good movie. You should enjoy Hidden Figures.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

About time the hidden story of the achievements of these Afro-American women were told,"In the early 1960s, a group of black women who work at NASA's Langley Research Center face racism, discrimination and sexism on a daily basis, despite their high qualifications and denied promotion. They eventually prove themselves worthy of recognition, especially under the task force direction of Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) and prove their skills in helping John Glenn's (Glen Powell) mission to space.Despite being presented in a sometimes over sentimental presentation of history rather than letting the events and discrimination speak for itself, this story set in a pre-Civil Rights America does a first class job in highlighting the story of these three brilliant and outstanding black female contributors to the Space Race. Based off book a by Margot Lee Shetterley, despite its sentimentality, it still manages to evade cartoon type characters of the heroes and villains.

A truly great movie,"This movie brought back bad and good memories.Growing up during this time period I can remember the segregated restrooms, lunch counters, separate entrances for colored people, and seating for colored people at the back of the bus. I can also remember the violence and changes that followed as segregation was slowly coming to an end.I can remember the first attempts by NASA to orbit the earth, the loss of the first space capsule, and the flight of John Glenn even though it was cut short by a problem. The USA was headed to space and President Kennedy wanted to go to the moon, and go to the moon we did! What a day to remember, the first man from earth stepping from his spacecraft and on to the surface of the moon. Our family later visited Cape Canaveral saw the exhibits and the moon rock.

A fine history on NASA and racism,"Based on a true story: In 1961, three black women are friends who work at a research center for NASA in the state of Virginia. All are brilliant mathematicians and have greater qualifications that would exceed those of their current jobs. They include Katherine (Goble) Johnson (played by Taraji P. Henson), a genius mathematician, Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae), an aspiring engineer, and Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), a computer expert and aspiring supervisor. ""Hidden Figures"" is based on the non-fiction book by Margot Lee Shetterley.This movie is an entertaining piece of NASA history (including John Glenn's first launch into space) with a special focus. It is occasionally jingoistic ('we gotta beat those Russians in the space race') and with occasional cheesy music to underline a budding romance which is easily foreseen. But it is ultimately a fine story that very ably highlights the stresses and frustrations of regular working life with the added humiliation of segregation in the workplace.Indeed, some of the people in the film were composite characters from the book and there were some incidents in the film that didn't actually happen. One of the most over-the-top ""Hollywood"" scenes is one where Kevin Costner (as Katherine's boss) is wielding a pick axe (those who've seen the movie will know what I mean). Despite these liberties with the truth, the scenes of segregation still had the right effect of outraging the viewer. The highlight is a scene in which Katherine, who had been timid up to a point, has a perfect meltdown scene (Hanson's best moment in a fine performance). Part of this build-up included the stress of having a very annoying senior peer (played by Jim Parsons) who knows he is less smart than she is and tries to dominate her as much as he can. (Incidentally, ""Loving"", another movie released in late 2016 also highlighted racist laws in Virginia during the same time period.)The directing by Theodore Melfi is rather conventional in a Hollywood way yet the effect worked by the end as I wanted to stand up and cheer during the closing credits. After the film, I pondered the question: how many other hidden histories are waiting to be told?",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Incredible movie on so many levels,"This is a great movie. Run, don't walk, to see it. It's touching, funny, inspirational, infuriating and always captivating.Hidden Figures is the true story of three African American women who worked as ""computers"" in the US space program, and who overcame significant racist and sexist prejudices to succeed and advance in the predominately white male space program. (""Computers"" were human mathematicians employed before the advent of electronic computers. The Space Task Force – a predecessor to NASA – was segregated, and ""colored computers"" worked separately from their white counterparts who were treated much better in terms of job opportunities, offices, restrooms, etc., etc.)The entire cast is excellent. Taraji P.

Kevin Costner plays Kevin Costner playing the head of the Space Task Force. (No one captures the 60s sensibility better than Costner) while Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons play obliviously racist administrators.The movie does an excellent job of recreating the look and feel of the 60s, and appears to have been faithful to the true story of the three women mathematicians. (One glaring error is that Mission Control during John Glenn's flight seems to have moved to Langley, VA.)

Brilliant Direction and Story Execution,"A must-watch. In the backdrop of 1960s USA when the country was trying to catch up with the Soviets in space, Hidden Figures brings to light the stories of three black women who make their mark in a white-male dominated NASA.Story (9/10): Hidden Figures talks about the struggles of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson to make their mark in the world's most respected space organization. As US battles USSR in the race to send the first human in space, there is an internal battle that NASA witnesses against racism+sexism. While the rest of the country is obviously divided between whites and colored, surprisingly, a very scientific organization like NASA is also not very different with colored toilets, colored coffee mugs, and colored buildings - just like in general public life where pretty much everything under the sun had a segregation. It is this discrimination that is stopping the US from achieving the full potential of their human talent - leaving untapped the geniuses in the black community. However, sense prevails eventually as these three ladies stubbornly place their foot through the doors of critical operations in NASA and through persistence, make their way through the white+male dominated work environment. They face their own share of struggles but they never give up and place their work above their egos, which sets them apart from the rest of the crowd. Diving into their personal lives where they interact with other fellow blacks, the conversations conveyed the difference in their perspective and approach towards fighting the segregated society very well. The good part about the story is that they have focused more on building positive characters than negative, which makes it a very ""feel good"" movie as you watch it. However, the best message of the story is that you can only fight oppression by hard work, smart thinking, and persistence - not violence and hatred.Acting (9/10): Taraji Henson (playing Katherine), Octavia Spencer (playing Dorothy) and Janelle Monae (playing Mary) are brilliant in their roles. What I loved was the different shades given to the character of each lady, which may or may not be true in their real life. While Katherine is sincere and hard working, Dorothy is mature and very smart and Mary is playful but passionate about her work. These are the kind of roles that gets sketches into the minds for a very long time and these three ladies scored a perfect home run here. Jim Parsons was distinctively noticeable due to his BBT legacy and did well on a larger screen. The role was pretty much in his comfort zone. However, if the director imagined him in a negative shade in the movie, that didn't come out well. The rest of the supporting cast was good with their limited screen time.Direction (10/10): Theodore Melfi's direction of the movie is great. From Scene 1 itself, he made it clear that this is not going to be a soap opera of oppression but a ""feel good"" story of how intelligence prevails over emotions. The character sketch of the three protagonists was very well thought and it brought the much-needed variety in the story. The brilliant execution of the story ensured that audience attention wasn't lost even for a moment. The mild humor on right occasions added good flavor to the overall movie. On the serious side, the depiction of Dorothy, Mary and Katherine's struggles against racial and gender discrimination is done beautifully. Theodore very intelligently used the part of the protagonists' personal lives to convey from where their strengths come and communicate their perspective to life.Overall (9/10): Overall, the movie is very well made and must watch. If you grew up in that era, it will be like reliving the old days. If you weren't, you would get a glimpse of life in those days of segregation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A simple feel-good story that helps shine a light on the pivotal contributions of three overlooked heroes,"Hidden Figures is a historical drama film centred around the events of the space race in the 1960s. One does not need to understand the complex mathematical equations shown in this film to find it enjoyable. It is a simple feel-good story that helps shine a light on the pivotal contributions of three overlooked heroes.The film is based on the true story of female African-American mathematicians Katherine Goble (Taraji P.

Despite the discrimination and racial segregation occurring within this time period, the three African-American women manage to prove to everyone that they are more than capable of helping put astronauts into outer space.Despite its predictable outcome and some moments of sensationalism, Hidden Figures still feels nice to watch mainly because of the positive message it portrays; that no matter what opposition you may face, keep working hard to prove yourself and you will eventually earn the respect you deserve. The three African-American actresses all gave great performances.

African-American Women Making A Difference At The Dawn Of The Space Age,"One would think that NASA would be a government institution that would be immune from the social upheavals of the early 1960s. But in that period of time, three distinguished African American women from Hampton, Virginia named Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson, all of whom were incredible geniuses at crunching complex math problems, did indeed shake things up there, fighting not only institutionalized racism but also a touch of misogyny as well. At the same time, it was what these three women did that helped America's manned space program take flight by 1962, and set us on a course towards the Apollo 11 manned landing on the Moon in 1969. Their story is brilliantly told in the film HIDDEN FIGURES, based on the book of the same name by Margot Lee Sheterly.Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janaelle Monae portray, respectively, Johnson, Vaughn, and Jackson, three women who, as young girls in a much more ultra-segregated South of the mid-1920s, displayed such an extreme aptitude for complex algebra and calculus that got them jobs at NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia in 1961. Being incredibly quick at complex math problems that are involved in getting the space program in a position where it could challenge the achievements of the Soviet Union, however, doesn't count for much when they are still made painfully aware of their ""place"" (separate bathrooms and coffee pots) in a profession that, though becoming a technological juggernaut, is still stuck in an unsavory past. This is what they face from co-workers like those portrayed by Kirstin Dunst and Jim Parsons, though Kevin Costner (portraying NASA station chief Al Harrison) is duly impressed with their skill in calculating all the complexities of launches, orbits, and splashdown angles. The work of the three women takes on added urgency when, on April 17, 1961, Yuri Gagarin becomes the first human being to venture beyond Earth's atmosphere, putting the Soviets well ahead of America, while NASA's Atlas and Redstone rockets either keep going off course or blowing up on the launch pad. For Costner, this means that their work is essential, because he himself must take a lot of the heat from the powers-that-be in Washington for the enormous expenditures that NASA is incurring in such a risky proposition.The moment of truth comes on February 20, 1962 when, through Henson's lightning calculations, astronaut John Glenn is launched into space in the Friendship 7 space capsule. He manages to get through three orbits; but then, he and the ground crew receive indications that his heat shield may fail upon re-entry. Once more, Henson is put in charge of coming up with a quick solution to hopefully stop Glenn from burning up in the atmosphere, while the entire world holds its collective breath.What HIDDEN FIGURES tells is a story that only a handful of Americans, if any at all, have ever known about because of all the political and social tumult that went on during the 1960s. Henson, Spencer, and Monae have the tough jobs of portraying the three women's personality quirks, while trying gamely to hide their rage at being so slowly accepted by the white and (with the exception of Dunst) male NASA hierarchy because of being African-American women with sky-high IQ's. They give incredible performances in their roles, as does Costner in what, for any other actor, would seem to be a relatively minor role of the NASA director who is oblivious to his workplace's antiquated caste system until it interferes with America's ability to catch up with the Soviets.Theodore Melfi, who directed the quirky 2014 comedy drama ST. VINCENT, handles the proceedings quite well, getting solid performances from his cast, including Parsons (best known as the head ""geek"" on TV's ""The Big Bang Theory""); and the film does a good idea at not only taking a pointed look at institutionalized racism, but also mocking it (especially in the ironic and funny opening sequence of an old white Virginia state trooper escorting the three women to Langley a few minutes in). HIDDEN FIGURES is not only a great film for its true-life story, but also a reminder of how much African Americans have always contributed to the greatness of our nation, a fact we still need to be reminded about in the 21st century.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Think about it, content is all what makes us equal: blood, heart, feelings and in the case of ""Hidden Figures"": mathematical intelligence.It is very fascinating that the words of Dr. King could find their most powerful resonance earlier than the iconic speech, in 1961, when space was the setting of a two-man race with America as the second. The Mercury program, immortalized by one of the 80's greatest movies ""The Right Stuff"", needed brains to expunge the Sputnik affront and allow the seven astronauts (Glenn, Grissom Shepard and all.) to replicate the exploits of Gagarin and beat the Russians in the ultimate challenge: the moon.By translating the confrontation between America and the Soviet Union to its vast, unexplored and neutral area, space cooled down the war. But it's nonetheless out of the Red Scare and the intolerable implications of these devilish satellites, ""sleeping by the light of a Communist moon"" and such, that the US government spent billions of dollars in the program. America needed to counterattack and quick... no bucks, no ""Buck Rogers"", but you didn't get these Buck Rogers without brains either.So you have two situations remarkably juxtaposed: a Space Task Group, directed by Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) pressured to get men in space asap and a Black community fighting for their right to be judged for their competences. Among their most brilliant minds, three women: Dorothy Vaughan, an informal supervisor, Mary Jackson, an aspiring engineer and Katherine G. Johnson, a mathematician, they work in the segregated Computers Division area of a Research Center attached to the NASA. Like Dr. King, they have dreams, collective and individual, and they sure got the 'right stuff' to fulfill them, but maybe not the right color of skin.These three pioneers are in the poster and they're played by Taraji P. Henson (Johnson), Octavia Spencer (Vaughan) and Janelle Monàe (Jackson); the presence of Octavia Spencer, the fact that she got her second Oscar-nomination for her role, and the great chemistry within the trio will exude inevitable ""The Help"" vibes. The kinship with the previous 2011 Best Picture nominee also relies on the intertwining stories of women triumphing over segregation by remaining true to themselves. And last but not least, ""Hidden Figures"" also features a 'bathroom' episode which, beyond a light comedic effect, exposes some of the most infuriating aspect of discrimination... and racism.But ""Hidden Figures"" is more than ""The Help"" with glasses (a comparison that made me chuckle), the film retells the main story of ""The Right Stuff"" with a different focus: the pivotal contribution of African-American women for the NASA space program, its most memorable scene features thirty women being transferred to the Programming Department, assigned to work on the new IBM machine and walking like in a civil right march, but not without making a clever nod to the iconic slow-motion astronaut-walking moment in ""The Right Stuff"". Adapted from Margot Lee Shetterly's novel, I would say about ""Hidden Figures"" what I said for ""Hacksaw Ridge"", the greatest merit is to have brought to the big screen a great story for 2016... and a great film.Yes, I can say I enjoyed every bit of Theodore Melfi's film, it's smartness (one of the year's finest screenplays) and its capability to vulgarize complex math problems, its humor (the three actresses are equally witty and fun to watch), its sweetness and I will say its unpredictability. Indeed, when I expected many scenes to pull a ""Butler"" and get too heavy with the racial material, the film surprised me by showing some genuine moments of sweetness and understanding. I particularly enjoyed the way Mary's husband supported her decision to attend night classes to pursue her dreams of becoming an engineer. For dramatization's sake, they could have injected a conflict to make things harder but the restrained and light-hearted tone was right for the film.And we can see the three women go through their parallel paths, Dorothy Vaughan's ambition to become the supervisor, constantly rejected by her own supervisor Vivian, played by an icy and effective Kirsten Dunst, and we see their relationship warm up with time and gaining more respect and consideration. In a marvelously written speech, Janelle Monàe must convince a judge to let her attend courses in an all-white school, she pleads her case with a catching passion, using the space program as an argument that nothing is impossible, and there's an obvious parallel between the space dreams of America and the dreams of the black community, things seemingly difficult but not impossible, because it is the essence of America to help people achieving them.And there's the core of the film: Katherine, assigned to assist Mr. Harrison and confronted to a manly and white office place without any bathroom, where she can't share coffee, assist meetings or sign her own reports. Everyone who worked in an office knows exactly what Katherine went through and knew at least one petty supervisor like Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) and it's one of the emotional reward of the film to see her skills and talent finally pay off, earning her the respect of her colleagues, who'd see the content before the container.""Hidden Figures"" is not just about women and segregation; it's about work, patience and intelligence and what it takes to fulfill one's ambition whether on a personal or a collective level. It might get a bit conventional here and there and as many users pointed out, the lack of smoking deprived it from a small touch of authenticity, but this is a flaw of 'epsilon' level... sorry I had to end with a math reference.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hidden figures meets hidden substance,"While Hidden Figures is entertaining it's also a fairly atypical Hollywood political statement film which by definition lacks any real weight.Hidden Figures explores segregation with much the same depth as Forrest Gump explored the 60's anti-war movement, the material is safe for white suburbanites who want to be entertained rather than confronted by actual reality so no doubt will clean up at the box office.Watchable but more of a rose colored glass version of a story that goes out of it's way to not upset the audience than a factual biopic of any substance.Personally, this movie made me think of Public Enemy's Burn Hollywood Burn but then I remembered Ice Cube's latest buddy cop travesty and the pitiful state today's revolutionary ideologies have been reduced to.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not a Small Step but a Giant Leap,"I am a huge fan of all things space. It is the final frontier that as humans we are yet to explore. I have had the privilege of going to NASA in Florida and yes, Apollo 13 does bring a tear to my eye. So when I saw the trailer for this movie being advertised it was a film I knew I had to see. The film is based on the true story of three brilliant black females who worked for NASA.The film follows their individual journeys in the company and demonstrates the challenges these young black women faced even though it has been 100 years since slavery was abolished. The movie challenges you into thinking about the impact that so many people have had in history who have been discriminated against for what ever reason. But what is more upsetting is that this film is set in the 60's which in reality wasn't that long ago and people were still being discriminated against.The effects in this film is brilliant. The story is gripping and compelling. The acting is second to none. Which begs the question why this film didn't succeed at the Oscars. The movie does transport you back to the time when NASA was loosing in the space race to the Russians and you can't help but feel that some of the issues that being portrayed then are actually still happening today.I would recommend this film to anyone because there is something there for anyone, unless your into musicals as there isn't much singing in the film. There is high's and low's in this film and I must confess even I had a tear in my eye at various points. I left the cinema feeling so proud for what these three women achieved not only for themselves but also for mankind. I just pray that we soon as a world end up in a situation where no one is discriminated against, but I feel that could be one small step for man that is too far a leap.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Outstanding film (Written Feb 4, 2017)","On the way home from seeing Hidden Figures, I flipped my car radio on to WRKF, the Baton Rouge public radio station my wife and I have listened to and supported since we moved here in August 1982. It came on in the middle of Bob Dylan's Ring them bells, the program being Nick Spitzer's American Routes. Although that song was recorded in 1989 at the end of Bob's Christian period, long after I'd quit paying attention to him for all practical purposes, the music, words and message echo his protest songs of the early 1960s..Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells for all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through
Ring them bells, for the time that flies
For the child that cries
When innocence diesI wouldn't have known or recognized the song had I not bought the Amnesty International Chimes of Freedom 2012 compilation of 72 Bob Dylan covers two years ago. For that collection, Natasha Beddington, a popular young British singer whom I'd never heard of prior to that, performed a lovely cover of Ring them bells in pop R&B style. I was in the process of reviewing all the songs and researching the artists when my Mom became ill and I never finished that project.Next was the Byrds' 1969 psychedelic folk rock cover of Dylan's This wheel's on fire, the version the Zambo Flirts modeled an arrangement on and often performed live back in the '70s (""Please notify my next of kin, this wheel shall explode""), followed by Dylan's completely hilarious after all these years Talking World War 3 Blues from 1961. By the magic of synchronicity, 1961 was the year Alan Shepard piloted the first US manned space launch, an event at the center of the action of Hidden Figures.The relevance of my long prelude: walking from the theater to my car I'd already been transported by the film back to the time of the Space Race, a signature geopolitical contest at the height of the Cold War, when it was the West against the East, the Free World against the Communist Bloc. The old friends I grew up with and other peers will remember seeing PSA's showing Nikita Khrushchev pounding his shoe on the podium at the UN and shouting (according to the subtitles) ""We will bury you!"" We remember John F. Kennedy challenging us to ""Ask not what your country can do for you...""Back then (and long afterwards) anyone who publically questioned the Russians being our mortal enemies risked being the subject of a dossier in J. Edgar Hoover's desk, something that affects my thinking to this day. America was desperate not to be beaten in any venue by the Russians. When their Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space five weeks ahead of our Alan Shepherd, the nation and the much-heralded NASA space program were deeply humiliated.This is the context of Hidden Figures, the fact-based story of a group of highly intelligent, motivated and competent black women performing critically important work for NASA. I'm writing this review instead of my usual practice of doing background research on films based on history (a somewhat endangered discipline as I write this although I still believe it will outlive the current era of alt-facts). Thus, I have not fact-checked the film for accuracy.Be that as it may, Hidden Figures is a beautiful movie. It focuses on three real people, all black women employed at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA who worked on Project Mercury. The goal was to send astronauts into outer space and bring them home safely. Putting humans into space has always been a dicey proposition. The scientists and engineers at Langley had the heavy responsibility of designing, building, testing and approving the rockets, space vehicles and flight plans that had a significant chance of resulting in not just more national humiliation but the horrifying public deaths of our ultimate fly boys, the hand-picked guys who epitomized the Right Stuff. The task required bold mathematical, technological, and ergonomic innovation on a daily basis under intense pressure.The lead actresses, Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and the irrepressible Janelle Monae are uniformly brilliant and engaging, portraying three exemplary patriots and public servants. We follow the women as they maintain their dignity under duress in the classic tradition of the Civil Rights Movement, make essential contributions to the success of Project Mercury, and hold precious private lives together while enduring the unapologetic racism and sexism of this time and place. The indignities they routinely suffer at and away from work are painful to watch, no less so for a viewer who recognizes that the struggle for opportunity, justice and basic human rights they embody is unfinished business even today, some 56 years later. Fine supporting performances are turned in by Kevin Costner as project director Al Harrison, Kirsten Dunst as the chilly supervisor of female NASA's employees, and Glen Powell as rock star astronaut John Glenn, among quite a few others.Hidden Figures is ultimately an uplifting, inspiring, feel good movie. It made me laugh, cry, and feel that pride we all have deep down of being a citizen of the USA, the ongoing experiment in self-government of which each fellow American is a stakeholder. It reminded me of who I am, the path I've traveled to arrive where I am, and, above all, affirmed who our greatest President, at another time of national crisis, once declared we all are:""We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.""

Inspiring True Story,"Hidden Figures is a 2016 film directed by Theodore Melfi that portrays the life of three African American women working for Nasa during the space race. Katherine Johnson, played by Taraji Henson, Dorothy Vaughan, played by Octavia Spencer, and Mary Jackson, played by Janelle Monae, display their mathematical intelligence to help send astronaut John Glenn into orbit. This incredible true story displays the heroism and hardship that these women faced through segregation and oppression. Katherine, Dorothy, and Mary all have the different parts they played in the successful launch and retrieval of Friendship 7, and young astronaut John Glenn.This film demonstrates that with hard work, anything is possible even when the world is against you. These three courageous women did not let racism and subjection control their future, but instead worked hard and made history with their accomplishments. This film brought tears to my eyes as I could feel the oppression that these women were facing. When Katherine was criticized and ridiculed for taking too long to use the restroom, it felt as if I was right there watching her finally stand up to her colleagues (Melfi, 2016). As soon as Kevin Costner's Al Harrison broke down the ""colored ladies restroom sign"", I felt a sense of pride and true tone change in the movie (Melfi, 2016).Motifs are used many times throughout the film to support the thematic elements of the story. Katherine's colleagues do not easily warm up to her and will not drink from the same pot of coffee she touches (Melfi, 2016). When she exemplifies her extreme intelligence and hard work her co-workers finally respect her. As for Mary, she does not give up and becomes the first African American woman to take night classes at an all-white school (Melfi, 2016). These scenes demonstrate the effort and hardship these women faced. The editor in this film was able to tie together Katherine, Dorothy, and Mary's positions and the part they played during their jobs at Nasa, even though they were completely different departments.This feel-good movie shares a thematic story like The Help, directed by Tate Taylor, of the hardship African American women faced during the civil rights movement. The sacrifices these women made helped shape the progression of African American women in America. Their hard work and dedication single-handedly played a part in the launch and retrieval of the world's most famous astronaut.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A great film about historical events most of us were unaware of,"Last year, the Academy was boycotted by thousands for its lack of diversity. A lot of people expressed their disappointment for the absence of coloured actors from the Oscars nominations. It seems that the Academy have learned their lesson. This year all four acting categories feature coloured actors/actresses names and three films featuring colored main characters are among the Best Picture contenders. One of them, Hidden Figures, showcases perfectly what discrimination and racism feels like by presenting the struggles that coloured women had to face in a white-men-driven America during the early 60s.Three brilliant coloured women - Katherine (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) and Mary (Janelle Monáe) - manage to get a job in NASA. Shamefully enough, almost one century after the end of Civil War, segregation hasn't ceased. The situation for these three women and every other woman of their ethnic group is, at the very least, derogatory. They are not allowed to go to white people's toilets, they get much fewer opportunities and Katherine cannot even use the same coffee pot as her colleagues. As these weren't enough, the pressure and work load they have to face in NASA is huge. The year is 1961 and the space race between the Soviet Union and the United States is more intense than ever. Things get even worse when news of Russia sending the first man into space reach the world. However, we're not talking about any women. Katherine, Dorothy and Mary are determined to overcome any difficulties and show the world what they are made of.The film tells a story that most of us were unaware of. We've seen dozens of American films that take place in the early 60s. There are films about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Vietnam War, Elvis Presley, the British Invasion bands, and so many other topics. However, we rarely see a film that focuses on people of those days and especially the racial minorities. Among all that technological advancement, humanity was cast aside. It was 1961 and people of colour were still treated as lesser beings. Hidden Figures recounts the events in a particularly touching way. While speaking of the huge achievements of NASA in the space race, it subtly emphasizes on the effort of the people who were responsible for them and particularly the three women who set an example for thousands of others. The cast delivered an amazing performance and the result was an emotional and didactic story that pays true homage to the real people.Of course, the film has its drawbacks. It suffers from a defect found in many biographical films. They tend to glamorize their characters to the extent of portraying them as infallible supporting them with minor characters who by now have become too cliché. Katherine, Mary and Dorothy have absolutely no faults whereas Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parson's characters are unlikable from the very first moment. By the time the happy ending comes, everyone's problems seem to have disappeared and the main characters are now loved by everyone. This is the reason I rarely find a biographical film to amaze me. Apart from that though, every aspect of the film was masterfully dealt with. In general, it makes for a great and quite informative viewing.More reviews on https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Bravo!A hint of how reference, inspiration and self-felt-pride matters, and (possibly) can transcend even the deepest of painfully-rooted biases.The set-design and wardrobe have already expressed prime expertise, and still the quality holds tight and strong at the introduction of the primary location of the story.The first (main) line of Costner's Harrison character is all of complex, authoritative and surprisingly shakespearesque; a great way to establish the man's skills and frame of mind.I'll shhh... now because a little voice inside is saying, ""please Oscar, please Oscar best picture please.."" :0)'That' means my objectivity is gone, so I'll not say more.

It's also interesting to see an older Kevin Costner doing a different type of role well, and his scene with a toilet sign is a stand-out.

Hidden Figures ShowMeTheMovies Review,"The inspiring tale of three extraordinary women who, despite all the odds stacked against them, made a dent in history by heavily contributing to NASA's space programme when it mattered most.The never-before told stories of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson; three coloured women living and working in Virginia, USA during the 60's who stopped at nothing to show a world full of generalisations that they were highly underestimated.The movie follows Katherine G. Johnson, an exceptional mathematician who is given the opportunity to work as 'computer' at NASA for the 1961-62 missions in the all-important 'space-race'. Alongside her were friends Dorothy Vaughn (computer-turned-supervisor with a knack for programming) and Mary Jackson (a wannabe aeronautics-engineer).The standard of acting throughout was fantastic; not only did Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae provide us with wonderfully powerful, and terribly funny, depictions of the leads, but a surprise role from Mahershala Ali and an unrecognisable Kevin Costner made for a praise-worthy ensemble (all bar Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst, who I felt could have added more to their respective roles).From cinematography to costume, the entire movie was fairly good - I wouldn't say flawless, but certainly to a decent standard. The plot itself was interesting, and the overtly 'Hollywood' glamorisation was combated with live-footage of the real-life events - which added a nice touch.A Pharrell-Williams-saturated soundtrack (and, of course, a musical number for Janelle Monae), the music was fun and fit in well with Hidden Figures as a whole, though I can't help thinking more of a variation (instead of one all-too-often-repeated song) of songs could have been sampled. Either way, Pharrell was probably just happy to be involved.Slightly (though slightly-understandably) agenda-pushing, I can't help but refer to similarities to Apollo 13 (the Friendship 7 landing scene reeked of Tom Hanks' blackout) and Octavia Spencer's earlier character in The Help - slightly unoriginal is the point here too.Nostalgia-inducing - even for those not of the time - and portrayed almost expertly - but arguably too reminiscent of already-done pictures.https://showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Powerful reminder about what life was like for Black people in 1961,"Hidden Figures (2016) was co-written and directed by Theodore Melfi. It's a drama, based on real people and real events. The time is 1961, at the height of the Cold War. The U.S. and Russia are competing in almost every way, including the race against each other for priority in space.NASA was headquartered at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Virginia. Even though this was federal property, discrimination against Blacks was routine. As I watched the film, I thought about the levels of discrimination that we see. Of course, there's always the threat of physical violence. (We get a short glimpse of police violence against Blacks in the movie.) Hampton, Virginia, was, indeed, the site of physical violence against Blacks in the 1960's. (In fact, it still is.)However, there were other levels of discrimination. Some were petty, but still humiliating, such as making a Black woman use a ""Colored"" coffee pot. Others were far more severe-- keeping Blacks from being promoted to positions of authority within NASA. Some were even worse--telling a Black woman that she could only apply for engineering school if she took some pre-engineering courses at a nearby school. The only problem was that the school was still Whites only.Three highly talented Black women set out to overcome the discrimination and provide NASA with mathematical help that the organization desperately needs. These women--all of whom did, indeed, work for NASA--were Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson. (Portrayed by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe.) Henson, Spencer, and Monáe are fine actors, and they do well as individuals, and as a group. The plot of the movie revolves around their attempts to get treated fairly at their work site.Kevin Costner does a good-enough job as Al Harrison, the NASA Director. Kirsten Dunst does an excellent job as Vivian Mitchell, who is in middle management. She's officious, uncaring, and very White. When the women complain to her, she just gives them a false smile and says, ""Well, that's NASA."" She doesn't make the rules, but she doesn't try to change them either.People have called Hidden Figures a ""feel-good movie,"" which in some respects it is. On the other hand, who can feel good about the racism in our society, then and now?This is an important movie, but not because it makes you feel good. I think the message is that some highly talented people can break through prejudice and prove just how good they are at what they do. That opens the way for other highly talented--and less talented--people to follow them.We saw this film on the large screen, but it will work well on DVD. It's a worthwhile movie and definitely worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hidden Figures,"Hidden FiguresThe real reason NASA never employed female astronauts was because there were no kitchens on-board.Furthermore, as this drama documents, the 1960s space program was also racist.When Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), NASA head engineer, is perplexed by a geometry problem, he brings African-American mathematician Katherine Goble Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) up from Langley to help solve it.Unfortunately, the segregation and sexism of the Sixties keeps her from fitting in with her white, middle-aged male contemporaries.Meanwhile, Katherine's equally brilliant friends (Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monáe) experience their own discrimination at the hands of their bigoted superior (Kirsten Dunst).A well-acted and aptly written account of the unpublicized contributions that African- American women made to the space race, this biography is inspiring on a number of fronts, specifically the social inequalities that continue to plague society.Incidentally, NASA also made the first black astronaut sit in the back of the shuttle.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Tackles Racism and Sexism While Never Losing its Optimism,"This is definitely a feel-good movie.

It's held down by that innate darkness, but it's a film about overcoming those odds and difficulties in order to prove your self-worth. There are a couple moments where it does feel like it's hammering in its messages too hard, but for the most part, Hidden Figures allows the reality of what it's telling to send its own message, rather than forcing a message down the audience's throat. And that absolutely works best for this movie. Director Theodore Melfi does a great job making this film, and balancing all those different elements of the story. It works to elevate characters, while at the same time understanding the bigger picture of not just what these events meant for African Americans and the Glass Ceiling, but also for space research and exploration.

History Lesson,"Hidden Figures is, as the title states exactly that. Three black women math geniuses, along with several others, were used as human computers to calculate intricate formulas necessary for the first manned space shots in 1961.

This was the time of separate but equal schools, bathrooms, drinking fountains, and every other facet of life that we now take for granted in a supposed post racial country.

"Multiple really good scenes, and no bad ones!","'HIDDEN FIGURES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed biographical comedy-drama, from director Theodore Melfi (who also helmed 2014's 'ST. VINCENT'). Melfi also co-wrote the screenplay, with first time feature screenwriter Allison Schroeder, and it's based on the book (of the same name) by Margot Lee Shetterly. The film stars Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae, Octavia Spencer, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Mahershala Ali and Glen Powell. It tells the true story of the brilliant African- American mathematician Katherine Johnson, and her two colleagues, who helped John Glenn become the first American to completely orbit the Earth (while they worked segregated at Langley). The movie has received almost unanimously rave reviews from critics, and it's a hit at the Box Office. I really enjoyed it as well.The film takes places in the 1960s; at a time when America was desperately trying to get ahead in the 'Space Race' with the Soviet Union. Katherine Johnson (Henson), and her two friends, Mary Jackson (Monae) and Dorothy Vaughan (Spencer), worked at Langley; in the segregated West Area Computers division. Despite dealing with heavy racism, and the lack of true credit for their work, the three women helped John Glenn (Powell) become the first American astronaut to make a complete orbit of Earth. This movie passionately tells their little known story.The film has multiple really good scenes in it; that are extremely emotional, inspiring and quite moving. The performances are all really good; especially Henson, Monae and Costner (Costner is a great actor, he should be getting a lot more work). While the movie is really well made, and very touching, it's still just a little too Hollywood manufactured for me. Melfi is a very talented filmmaker though ('ST. VINCENT' is a really good movie as well), he just needs the studios to let him have complete creative freedom of his work. It's almost a truly great film, but not quite.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

From the D&I perspective, it occurs to me that the outcome for NASA could have turned out much differently or perhaps the orbit could have been delayed or not happened if Kevin Costner, the boss, had excluded them from the NASA launch preparation activities or allowed them to showcase their skills because they were black. There is also mild gender bias scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Always A Favorite,"I love this movie so much! I only saw it a little while ago, but I fell in love with it the moment I saw it. I knew before I watched it that there were women at NASA that did a lot of the hard work and never got the credit for it, but I had never heard any individual stories of these women. Watching this movie, I was able to get a taste of what it was like for them and what things they did at NASA.
This story is about three African American women: Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan. They all worked at NASA in the 1960's. This movie is featured around the launch and orbit of John Glenn and shows the amazing work that these three women did to help with his launch.
I never really knew much about this part of history. I didn't know much about the space race, the Cold War, and I didn't know about the hidden figures helping out in the space race. It was amazing to see how smart these women were and how brave they were to fight against unequal treatment of women and African Americans. I don't know if this movie was completely accurate or not, but it did give a shout out to these women and really helped to reveal what they did for NASA.
The director of this movie is Theodore Melfi. I have never seen any of his other movies, but he did an amazing job with this movie. The set, the music, the atmosphere of the movie, the character development, helping us to get to know the characters and see their bravery. It was a very well put together movie. The three main actors in this movie are Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae. They are amazing actresses! They did a great job acting in that time period and they really brought out the good qualities of the women they portrayed. One of my favorite scenes in this movie is when Mary Jackson goes to court to get permission to go to classes at an all white school to become an engineer. She is just amazing.
This movie, again, is one of my favorite of all time. It really makes me proud to be a woman when I watch it and it just amazes me what these women went through. It also amazes me how smart they were. This movie is a great history movie, but it is also a very entertaining movie. I definitely recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

I Highly Recommend This Movie,"A friend who is a part of the entertainment industry once told me that when the audience applauds after a movie is over, that's a really good sign that a movie is good. And that's what happened when ""Hidden Figures"" ended--the audience applauded.""Hidden Figures"" is based on the true story of, principally, three African-American women (in the 1960s, when the story takes place, they were known as Negroes or coloreds) who worked for NASA, just at the beginning of the space race.Taraji P. Henson, of ""Empire"" fame, plays the leading character, Katherine G. Johnson, a math genius; Octavia Spencer (nominated for a supporting actress in any motion picture Golden Globe for her role in this movie) portrays Dorothy Vaughn, who ends up becoming proficient in computer coding languages such as FORTRAN; and Mary Jackson, NASA's first black female engineer, is portrayed by Janelle Monae.All the main characters and all the supporting cast of characters face discrimination (the movie does take place in the 1960s), but they plod on with their lives and their mission to prove themselves and the worthiness of their race. White co-workers. of course, look down on them--not only are they women, they're also Negroes. It might be hard for some to accept that this was the ""normal"" back in the '60s, and it grates on us that this was allowed to happen, but it was and did.Kevin Costner, who plays Al Harrison, a fictional composite of NACA (the precursor to NASA) and NASA directors, is intended to be the reasonable and unprejudiced head honcho, and I would like to think that he truthfully portrays how these men thought and behaved, but I'm doubtful because that's just not the way things were back then.There is lots of good dialogue in this movie, which provided many a giggle, but the story is not intended to be a comedy, nor is it. And the archival footage reminds those, who lived during this time and experienced first hand the space race, what a magical and marvelous time it was.It is a movie I highly recommend seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Review,"""You are the boss sir, you just have to start actin' like one. *clears throat* sir."" -KatherineThis movie is about NASA and the story of how 3 African american women contributed to NASA's successes. During this part in history it was also the civil right movements. During this movie this women breakdown the gender and race barriers that were built in NASA. Alabama being a segregated state and all.
The director of this movie is Theodore Melfi.The main characters are TaraJi Henson ,Jannelle Monae,Octivia Spencer, and Kevin Costner. My favorite scene from the movie was when Kevin Costner ripped apart the colored bathroom sign. I think that it was a powerful message to all the people. I liked the entire movie. I liked how it gave a powerful message to girls and women and the impact that we can make in this world. It also put in many years into a one period timeline.

A Film That Respects Intellect,"Quick, how many movies are there about mathematicians? Not many...equations usually don't make for great drama or comedy. We did have ""A Beautiful Mind"" in 2001 which used about one minute of film time on John Nash's game theory, and we did see the development of an aerodynamic equation to help the boys find their rocket in the woods in ""October Sky"" (1999). Accordingly, kudos go to the filmmakers of ""Hidden Figures"" for bringing the story of these NASA mathematicians, who happened to be young black women, to our attention, and highlighting their computational skills. And of course it helps, as far as the viewer's interest is concerned, that the math was employed at NASA during the initial critical years of the space race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and where the Soviet Union had the early lead from Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin (first human in space).These three black women mathematicians / engineers are indeed remarkable for their time when educational opportunities were much less available for women and for blacks, particularly in technical fields where suspicion reigned. We see in the film some of the social impediments they faced from unhelpful colleagues and organizational barriers. There's some doubt in my mind from what I've read of these women's experiences that the filmmakers have accurately portrayed the social and physical handicaps confronting these women. It seems that overdid these handicaps to (understandably) provide more drama to what otherwise might have been just a technical story. I don't have a problem with a degree of dramatic license if it adds a degree of dramatic tension to a story that might otherwise be too bland for non-technical-minded folks, but ""Hidden Figures"" overdid it a bit. NASA was a technical organization, and while it may have harbored individuals with personal prejudices, institutionally it was more of a meritocratic organization. After all, it relied on a ex-Nazi, Werner Von Braun, to help build the fabulous Saturn 5 Rocket.Perceptions and personal perspective are everything it seems. I'm amazed of how many reviews on this site decry the portrayal of white people in this film. There wasn't a lot of overt, hostile racism (if any) and suspicious and recalcitrant co-workers are redeemed in the end by their emerging respect for the black women mathematicians. On the other side some critics have written very unfavorably about the ""white savior"" complexion of the film, e.g., the white supervisor (Kevin Costner) comes to the rescue by chopping down the ""Whites Only"" sign over the nearest ladies room; a sign that in real life the woman mathematician simply ignored with no apparent consequences. Perhaps the filmmakers struck a happy balance, and there's no doubt that, commercially at least, they were ""redeemed"" by a box office of $236 M on a budget of $25 M!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""Hidden Figires"": huge potential, only nice results","I start with saying that ""Hidden Figures"" is a nice film, I liked it and it is a good time. But I want to underline the defects because I fell like this movie had so much potential but it has been wasted quite a bit. The real problem is that there are too many storylines and so few time to explore properly all of them. The result is not confusing, there are no rushed parts or plot points hardly comprehensible. The real problem of this is that the movie lose a lot of tension or emotional weight and stays pretty much superficial, with character construction that was simple and basic, nothing more. Also the beautiful messages about racial and gender equity feels superficial because of the poor time to explore them.
On the other end the direction and the photography are functional, all the acting performances were great and the music is suited.

"Ladies, Welcome to NASA","""Hidden Figures"" is the NASA version of ""The Help,"" in which a bunch of white moviegoers watch a palatable civil rights tale with a happy ending and then get to congratulate themselves for being so open- minded about watching a movie about black people in the first place.Actually, ""Hidden Figures"" is a much better movie than ""The Help,"" and it tries much harder to create three dimensional characters rather than the cartoonish caricatures that populated the other film. Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae, and Octavia Spencer are the three ladies at the film's center, black women who had to fight tooth and nail to get themselves taken seriously at NASA, while Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, and Jim Parsons get the thankless roles of playing the characters who represent WHITE PEOPLE and their varying degrees of racist bullsh*t. Though it isn't exactly subtle, it could have hit its emotional buttons much harder than it does, and it's a quite enjoyable film.Lost the 2016 Best Picture Oscar to ""Moonlight,"" which is as it should have been.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Every time Katherine walked into a room, the movie basically stopped for 30 seconds to let the point sink in. It got really tedious.Additionally, if they were trying to create an atmosphere similar to the 60s, why was there modern music? It was really distracting and unfitting. The casting here was rough. I can't take Parsons seriously, same with Powell who I just see as the idiot from Scream Queens. They really didn't sell that they were brilliant scientists. Other than that, the acting was pretty good, namely Henson, and it's disappointing she wasn't nominated instead of Davis.The movie really suffered anytime it cut to Katherine's personal life. Those scenes really dragged on and didn't seem to have any affect on her professional life, which was what the movie was about.

A fairly good movie...,"I was recommended to sit down and watch ""Hidden Figures"", and I was told that it was a very emotional movie. So I tracked down a copy of this 2016 movie from writers Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi and sat down to watch it. Initially I hadn't even heard about this movie.And I will say that ""Hidden Figures"" definitely is a good movie, but it wasn't as spectacular as I was led to believe it to be. Now, don't get me wrong here, because this is definitely a good and entertaining movie, while at the same time it is a historical movie that definitely is a big part of the history of our world. But the movie just didn't blow me away.I was really impressed with the cast ensemble they had managed to get together for this movie, and there were some really good acting performances being delivered here. I mean, the movie had the likes of Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monáe, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons and Mahershala Ali on the cast list.It should be said that the three lead actresses - Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe - really carried the movie quite phenomenally. And while Jim Parsons is by no means a poor actor, then it was just difficult to put his role as Sheldon from ""Big Bang Theory"" aside and see him in a new light. Just like Daniel Radcliff is always stuck as being Harry Potter, then Jim Parsons will always be stuck as Sheldon.The story told in ""Hidden Figures"" is a good story, especially because of the historical importance that there was to the stories of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson and all the other ladies in the same situation back in the 1960s. So there on that account alone, then ""Hidden Figures"" is actually a movie that is well worth watching.One can't help but shake one's head in disbelief because of the racial segregation that were taking place in the USA back in the 1960s. It is just so far out there that people could have been so narrowminded. But that is how it was back then, and it is portrayed with impact in the movie, thanks to director Theodore Melfi.My rating of ""Hidden Figures"" lands on a six out of ten stars. What was holding the movie back from getting a higher rating from me, was the fact that the contents and events in the storyline just weren't all that appealing to me, the movie lacked momentum and drive.

Just be prepared to eat someone else's dust...,"Hidden Figures is the kind of film that will endure nonetheless. It has a charismatic ensemble cast and a story that comes across so right in a time when everything seems so wrong.It celebrates the unsung, or at least largely unknown outside of their field; it calls out prejudice and denounces the marginalising of communities and genders; it makes mind-numbing mathematics appear accessible (proof, if you still needed it, of how movies are a grand illusion); and it appeals to those who are always looking to the stars – if not to dream about getting there, then at least to wonder about our place among them.The three central figures here, all winningly portrayed, are also trying to find their place in life while constantly being told what and where that place should be.They work in a colour-segregated building (this is the American South, after all, at a time when the Civil Rights Movement is only just gathering steam) as human ""computers"", assigned to perform complex calculations on flight and space data by hand. Even washrooms are segregated, a point the movie stresses several times to (unfortunately) near-caricature levels which, to me, tended to diminish the impact of that particular aspect.Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) is a capable administrator long denied a supervisory role; Katherine Goble (Taraji P. Henson) is a mathematics prodigy who gets a big break when she is assigned as a computer to the all-white Space Task Group, only to face indifference – at best – from her colleagues; and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) dreams of becoming an engineer in a state where engineers are (a) male and (b) white, and the only option for her is to be allowed to attend classes at a whites- only school.The film collapses their respective struggles – which took place years apart – into one heady period in 1961 when the United States and Soviet Union were involved in a desperate space race, and the US was lagging behind.Now that sort of conflating is OK for the purposes of telling a dramatic story on screen, one that does not have the luxury of being read slowly over time like a book or historical record.While the three women and their families as depicted are real characters, most of the white folks (save for the astronauts) are not. Kevin Costner's Nasa boss Al Harrison is a composite figure, as are Jim Parsons' uptight statistician/theorist Paul Stafford and Kirsten Dunst's strict and aloof administrative supervisor Vivian Mitchell.Stafford and Mitchell are meant to reflect certain attitudes prevalent among white men and women in those times but this sort of conflating, on the other hand, renders them intentionally unsympathetic characters who might as well be cardboard standees with embedded voice chips.The same almost goes for Costner's Harrison, who comes perilously close to achieving escape velocity into the wild blue yonder of ""white saviour"".""That's a very nice rocket, honey. Now you get to sleep so Mommy can run off to her night job of running a hip-hop empire."" - Moments of genuinely felt triumph, quiet suffering, and ebullient celebration (Mahershala Ali's proposal scene is surprisingly affecting in spite of its supreme corniness) will hold your attention between the absolutely riveting test flight scenes that culminate in John Glenn's (Glen Powell) attempt to become the first American to orbit the Earth.And although it is set over half a century ago in a distant part of the world, the film's core lessons still resonate and apply to any place and any situation today.If you've got a problem, and you choose to let prejudice, ego or other types of personal maladjustment blind you to parties that can contribute towards a solution...

The right stuff,"Hidden Figures is a starchy film based on true facts of the role three black women who were mathematicians played in getting the first American, John Glenn into space.Taraji P Henson plays Katherine Johnson, brilliant at calculations regarding flight trajectories. Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughan who quickly learns to program the new IBM computers, yet she is not allowed to borrow advanced books from the local library and Janelle Monae plays Mary Jackson who strives to be accepted at an accredited all white college so she can become an aerospace engineer.The women just encounter indifference at NASA given various tasks but thing come to a head when Katherine is promoted to work with a core group of scientists and mathematicians who want to send the first man to space until they are beaten to it by the Soviets. They work under fair but firm disciplinarian Al Harrison (Kevin Costner.)However even amongst this elite group she encounters prejudice, she is not regarded to be up to the task, belittled and even ignored. She even has to use her own separate kettle as the main one is for whites only and of course she has walk half a mile to use the blacks only toilet which is in another section of NASA.So here is an example of why I found this film to be infuriatingly hokey. Harrison would constantly come out of his office and asks for Katherine but she is never there and no one answers him where she is. The reason for her whereabouts is that she has gone to the blacks only toilet. This seemingly goes on for months until one day Harrison summons Katherine and asks her why she is never at her post and she lets loose of how she cannot use the toilet in the building and her colleagues watch in silence.The whole thing was just so bluntly done. So Harrison never noticed the blacks only kettle in the office or that the only black person in the team might encounter prejudice or wait weeks to find out why she needs to pop out for so long and also did not admonish other staff for being so insensitive or team leaders such as Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) for being prejudiced.Despite being entertaining and even inspirational I just thought Hidden Figures was so poorly written and structured.

Did EVERYONE have to drive a car that looked like it came from an auto show? I was a kid when the events of this movie were taking place, and I don't remember any cars looking that good, unless they just left the dealership.
I kept thinking they got all the vehicles from someone like Jay Leno, and they told him, we only want the best of your collection, and make sure they are all waxed and polished.
As an electronics person, I was insulted by the lack of research. Computer programmers are not electrical engineers or vice versa. For a movie about woman in a technical field, I felt embarrassed for the actresses who had to portray some of the nonsense. It was not their fault, as I suspect they didn't realize the mistakes the writer made. People hired to program complex equations into a computer do not also fix the computers.
Some of the story regarding racism felt a little pushy as well. Instead of focusing on the accomplishments of these woman, they seemed to focus more on the racial problems they faced.
Black woman of that era had a tough go of things, whether they were rocket surgeons, house wives, or race car drivers. I think the movie would have been better if they focused more on the accomplishments of these talented people, inspite of their hardships.
Dispite my critsisms, I would recommend watching this movie, if only as a starting point into researching some amazing, mostly forgotten, people.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A memorable drama based on history,"I've watched this movie three times, and three is the magic number! These three incredible actresses are what make this movie so engrossing and moving. I'm aware while I'm watching that I'm being just a little bit manipulated, but it's done in a way that does not pander, and you WANT to see these people to succeed, to have recognition for their abilities and accomplishments.

Movie of hidden reality that changes life,"Hidden Figures an entertaining method to get across a historical reality in all the good bad and ugly. My focus is on Paul Stafford played by Jim Parsons. You can tell he is prejudice towards women and Black race or black woman. But then if you were an engineer with his experience, would you like someone you don't know checking your work? I believe this is where problems have there root.-Lack of understanding of the whole issue. Was it Mary Johnson who petitioned the court to lt attend class to advance her degree. There was no ugliness their just fact! Fact that had to be overcome, and she did so with fact. Pointing out to the Judge his 1st, were he 'overcame'. The era that the movie was based on was full of Hate and misunderstanding. In my house I had a family member who was a member of a southern club called Kue Klux Klan. He had some strange Ideas and concepts, misunderstandings all of which could have been cleared up had he asked questions, read the correct resource materiel, but he didn't. And life was strange because of it. Paul Stafford overcame his issue due to a common goal issue. Get man to space. At first he had a difficult time realizing there was someone smarter than him, not just someone, but a woman who was black! At times he demanded his role as an educated white male be recognized-worshiped. But when put in his place (when Kathryn out shined him in the board room-his place, his domain)he reluctantly accepted! The move hits us with the urgency of the space age, informs us that in the Ivy towers there was misunderstandings about race and mankind's place in life. However know this, knowledge makes us equal! Gear-heads get together and no mater color of skin or accent they speak with they are all talking motors cars and how to do this and that with a wrench. Hidden Figures point this out! It takes a day or two. But for the sake of the mission Let us realize our differences, recognize similarity and get the Mission finished! Paul Stafford eventually figured it out.

Well told story of the three main women characters and not only the problems they had to solve to help the U.S. put a person in space, but the ongoing problems of segregation in the 1960s. The ladies portrayed in the movie (and many more not shown) had to be special to perform as they did despite all the obstacles of race thrown up at them.

Black Women Who Make Us Proud to be American,"When we see black people in movies, most of the time the women are loose and the men carry guns. How refreshing to see Hidden Figures, a story of women who happen to be black reaching their potentials. The three main characters suffer double prejudice as both black and women. They are wives and mothers, the products of black families who fought to get them educated. The results helped put John Glenn in space. One of the daughters wrote the book. This is a story about more than three women. It's a success story that belongs to their families as well.I remember my father, who was an aerodynamical and thermodynamical engineer in this same era. He would come home and brag that he had reserved an hour with his companies IBM mainframe. Other Dads brought their sons toys and sweets. He'd bring me home those IBM punch cards. The movie got that part right. The advanced technology that was so amazing then is only fit for museums. We possess more calculating power in our cell phones than the entire NASA system that put a man in space. It was all done by people using math, engineers and mathematicians like these 3 amazing women.Like classic movies, Hidden Figures doesn't have any CGI. Not a shot is fired. Not a punch was thrown. It's simply a great story, well- researched with great characters. Props to everyone involved. If you have a collection of movies, this one is a keeper.

True pioneering pilots,"'Hidden Figures' demonstrates not only struggle against & triumph over social prejudice but also three smartass females adapting to and preparing for future. Melfi depicts 1960s as the period on the verge, from separation to integration, from human computer to digital computer, and from Earth to space. The movie keeps asking who will be the first on the new side of the world. In that aspect, three women were brave enough to step into the new frontier like NASA.Not only characters but also the ambiance of the movie is vibrant and energetic (not easy considering most of events happen in NASA). Of course all the characters take initiative, never been passive; when moving from one place to another, shots show the whole journey rather than changing the place in a flickering second; various camera angle and the colors. I especially love the ending credits, actors resolving into the real models and credit of actors accompanying characters' pictures.

History is written by the victors. The rest we have to look for.,"Together with Fences and Moonlighting, it seems the Academy is showing some major love to the Black community after drawing some flak for how White last year's nominees were. Or is this in quiet defiance of the current administration, showing how great America has become because of these three hidden figures?The movie is about the story of three African-American Women instrumental to the US space program working as ""human computers"" in the 1960s. Imagine being Black, a Woman and can do ""on any given day, analyze the binomial levels air displacement, friction and velocity. And compute over ten thousand calculations by cosine, square root and lately analytic geometry. By hand."" At the same time, be subjected to use a ""Colored"" restroom, be limited to use books found only in the ""Colored"" section and be forced to fight for your right as a ""Colored"" student to study in a white school just because you want to better your life.While the movie took some liberty at changing some of the things that happened in order to make for a better story (comparable to last year's nominee 'Bridges of Spies' starring Tom Hanks), such as the apparent hostility of the white, male-dominated division Katherine Jackson was assigned to or the recalculation of the Go/No Go reentry of John Glenn from outer space, it all makes for a good story and is forgivable because sometimes some people just try to live their life the best way they know how: acting right, doing right and living right. And often, those are the kind that live boring lives.The three leads were effective even if the roles were derivative, Janelle Monae as the feisty third player, Octavia Spencer as the glue that holds everyone together (and notching a Best Supporting Actress in the process) and Taraji P. Henson as the reserved wallflower that will explode in the middle of the movie. Although there were times I questioned the choice of Taraji because sometimes you can see she's struggling with the acting. Of note also are the three major support, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An Inspiring and Overdue Story,"This film truly moved me. I never knew about the incredible contributions Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson made to NASA's space program. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe delivered outstanding performances; they portrayed these pioneering women so realistically and deeply that it was easy to feel their struggles and triumphs.It was truly impressive to see a film depicting the early 1960s so vividly and poignantly. This film does not shy away from the harsh realities of segregation and racism, which makes these women's achievements even more remarkable. Witnessing how these women, who were labeled ""colored,"" overcame immense barriers and proved their worth in the face of such a blind and discriminatory era was incredibly powerful and inspiring.Director Theodore Melfi's touch, combined with a strong script, ensures that themes like perseverance, equality, and the pursuit of excellence shine through. Yes, some moments might feel slightly dramatized, but it never detracts from the film's impact.This film sheds light on an important but often overlooked part of history and is a must-watch. Whether you're interested in history or just looking for an uplifting story, this film is definitely worth your time. Watch it, you won't regret it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Or the persistence of biases when greater goals are on the horizon,"@garcwritesAt first glance this film sounds like a civil right's movie, by this I mean, it can seem like it's a movie solely about race and discrimination. These two topics are reason enough to see a well mode movie but Hidden Figures is much more than that.It's actually a fascinating work-place drama set in the early days of the space race. It's a more grounded depiction of that time in history because usually movies about the space race are about the achievement itself, the rocket taking off with the wife or girlfriend with a tear in her eye. Little to no mind giving to the grind, the trial and error, and the tense conditions they were working in at a time when technology wasn't as evolved as it is today.This movie is clearly dramatized, it's not a documentary, but there is a lot to learn here. I had no idea that they were people, women, who's job was to do complex math. The surprising thing is not that women were doing math - well giving the time period it kind of is. It's the the inner workings of N.A.S.A.The sheer importance and scale of the whole opperation is not lost on the viewer, they make sure of that. Which makes it is all the more mind-boggling that given the importance of what they were trying to achieve that they had time to discriminate. I know that racism and discrimination is systemic, particularly, in this era but come the F'k on how was it not a meritocracy?I could stress on that point for so long but that would be like shouting at the wind at this point. Don't get it wrong, the biaises are not just based on race but on women in general, there's a clear hierachy of discrimination showed in this film but the silver lining though, is that these women are also depicted striving for more, overcoming obsticles, leading the way.The cast is quite big and yet memorable, they all make an impression. I saw this movie when it came out in 2016 and even before rewatching it - because it's worth repeat viewings - I could list the cast by name or remember faces, if not the names. It's a testament to the level of talent there's in this film. The smallest roles have space to shine and the actors knew how to seize their opportunities.Henson is front and center in this movie and yet Spencer and Monae are true stand outs. Kristen Dunst, opperates masterfully in a grey area as both an ""oppressed"" and pottential oppressor, Glen Powell is charismatic and a source of hope, and Kevin Costner does a fabulous job but Seth Meyer's sketch does sour a bit aspects of his character.Hidden Figures is a compelling learning experience that will hit you in the feels and worth the viewings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A middle of the road drama,"A perfectly fine and inoffensive middle of the road experience that inexplicitly got nominated for a Best Picture Oscar at this year's Academy Awards, Hidden Figures ends up being a workmanlike telling of an extraordinary feel good true story, that would serve up far more emotion and resonance in a documentary format.From the films beginnings right through to the story's end, Theodore Melfi's film never does anything to distinguish itself from the usual Hollywood fare that delves into race issues and trials over adversity stories that made themselves apparent in the American era of rampant racism and lack of social acceptance.Not every film dealing with such heavy topics needs to be dour and downtrodden and while Hidden Figures poppy qualities such as Pharrell William's often intrusive soundtrack and the almost comical scenes of Taraji P. Henson's maths genius Katherine G. Johnson racing to the bathroom across what seems like an entire complex or Kevin Costner's kind hearted white boss Al Harrison smashing down a coloured bathroom sign with an audience watching on, feel more light-hearted than occurrences of much meaning and fail to distinguish themselves from the pack. Which means there really isn't much of substance to be found in a true life tale that has an abundance of it at its core.Focussing largely on Henson's Katherine (who often steers into an overacting zone) and her racially tense appointment to an important computer office tasked with sending America's first manned spacecraft into space, those expecting the trio that includes Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae to get amongst the action will be disappointed as they are relegated to caring friend side characters that ad very little to proceedings at all.Taking nothing away from what Johnson achieved in her time at the NASA complex, it would've been great for Melfi to pay more screen time to Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson's plights as black American woman that to achieved great things under duress and racism as it feels as though we've been short changed from their plights as Johnson gets the bulk of the important scenes.The relegation of these characters in Hidden Figures displays a glaringly obvious fault with a film that is clearly looking to be a crowd pleaser over a real memorable and moving one, which is a real shame for a story that deserves a lot more than this unfairly praised event.Final Say –Hidden Figures will make you feel good but it isn't the sum of its parts when all the critical and commercial success is bought into the equation.While this perfectly average film has its heart in a good place and has a nice glossy sheen, you can't help but feel that this Hollywoodized experience is far less heartfelt and moving than it should've been and ends up being the year's worst Best Picture entrant by a country mile.2 ½ bashed down bathroom signs out of 5",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great entertainment - Not a documentary,"It's clear from many reviews here that there's considerable discontent with some of the facts in Hidden Figures but rather like Braveheart some people just miss the point of movies for entertainment and think because it's a factual story it should be steadfastly accurate with its narrative. I realise that in order to make an entertaing picture it's necessary to change some facts for fantasy to avoid it being boring and this film delivers entertainment by the bucket load. I was aware of John Glenn back when I was a teenager, believe it not, by a record by Walter Brennan called The Epic Ride of John H Glenn and after two hours, this is what we get. The lead up tells how a team of black women are used as human computers, to help enable progress in the space race between Russia and the States. This failure to treat these women as fellow human beings looks shocking today and growing up in England I was not really that aware of the prejudice that pervaded society and would have been disgusted by it even then. The film does rather hit you over the head as propaganda but it is such fun to watch, particularly when the NASSA boss shows sympathy with Kathryn, the genius mathmetician assigned to him and overrules those snubbing her. Tarraji P Henson plays Kathryn and Kevin Costner her boss and i'm surprised only Octavia Spencer in a more minor role was the only actress to get an Oscar nomination as I felt Kevin and Tarraji were perfectly cast. Nice to see Jim Parsons in a role too, albeit type cast as a scientist after spoofing it up for so long in The Big Bang Theory. I loved this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Space Race and Racism,"Employed by NASA in the 1960s, three African American women overcome racial prejudice to excel in their respective areas in this film from 'St. Vincent' director Theodore Melfi. As per 'St. Vincent', Melfi blends comedy and drama together to tell his tale, though this is a more sobering affair with several scenes that highlight how prevalent racial prejudice was back then. Unfortunately, most of the best moments dealing with this made in into the film's theatrical trailer, and while there is something curious in how NASA has to overcome backwards prejudices to advance forward in the space race, it is hard not to wish for the film to focus more on the space race and less on racism. The film additionally feels rather unbalanced by giving Taraji P. Henson twice as much screen time as both her co-stars. Henson admittedly has the best character and delivers the most rounded performance, but the achievements of her peers are diminished by making her such a prominent figure. And yet, if hardly the most amazing true-story drama of recent time, the film is very watchable throughout thanks to solid performances by all concerned and an excellent mix of music with input from Pharrell Williams. Sure, the music is not true to the era but it adds a lot of bounce to what is otherwise fairly routine stuff as far as feel-good biographical dramas go.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A decent Oscar movie,"When it comes to Best Picture nominated/winning movies, I always feel they fall into 3 categories for me.1. Great-brilliant movies that deserved their nomination, let alone actually winning.2. Decent-okay movies that while not bad, it only felt like they were nominated/won due to their subject matter.3. Really boring-bad movies that while they suck as a movie, it make total sense for the Oscars to give it such praise.Fortunately, Hidden Figures doesn't fall into number 3 on this list but it's not reaching number 1 for me anytime soon.It is a very important historical piece of a film I'm glad was made at least. It's really well-acted, the characters are enjoyable and have good chemistry with each other, it's surprisingly really well-shot, the movie has good or sweet moments in it, and I really liked in particular how the clothing the main female characters wore fitted into some of the movie's theming. However, the creativity liberties taken with this movie really show off in not a very good way. Mainly the fact this is the one of the most predictable movie's I've ever watched.Being predictable isn't always a sign of being a bad movie, but this is one of those movies where every scene and setup is so obvious that by the time the play off happens, it's not that satisfying since it was very easy to see it coming in the first place. There were expectations to the rule and I get the fact making it unpredictable would cause some issues due to this film being based off a true story, but there's already creative freedom taken with this movie like basing off Kevin Costner's character in the movie off of three different NASA directors instead of one real life person so I don't see the harm of making the movie a little less predictable if it doesn't erase the actual real story of the movie and is done well.That's not the only issue I have however, there's way too many sub plots in this movie leading to some parts of the movie being a structural mess, 90% of the music used in the movie were either forgettable typical Oscar music you've most likely already heard in another movie or just felt out of place of the scene happening, and the film focuses on Katherine a bit too much in that, leading to Dorothy and Mary's arc of the story feeling not as fleshed out as they could have been.Overall, I did enjoy the movie more than hating it but I doubt I'll be re-watching this anytime soon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Black Women exist and have Chutzpah,"Hidden Figures is an explosive, ironic, daring film. It is a film that does justice to Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson with mathematical sweetness, giving every detail, nuance, fact, the visibility necessary to make us learn that the right to count is the representation of man's race. On the Moon, but from the point of view of those who have never gone beyond the stratosphere; from the perspective of those who have remained anchored on a land that they could not even feel their own, in a segregationist country like America in the 1960s (and today).Based on the book Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race by Margot Lee Shetterly, it is the story of a race for progress and emancipation.At school they teach us the name of those who first set foot on the Moon and perhaps the names of those who assisted the mission, but no one has ever given importance to human calculators, or those women who carried out the task now performed by modern technologies ; who worked in oblivion, detached from the rest of the NASA staff, earning lower salaries because they were women and because they were black.The focus is on the figure of African-American mathematics, scientist and physicist Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), of her immense talent in mathematical art, which in filmic representation acquires a real personification, bordering on art.But the beauty of Katherine Johnson's character is that it transcends her story - that of a very gifted child who is directed to do more by the teachers themselves - to escape beyond the boundaries of self-centeredness and selfishness.So, despite having a hypothetical bull's-eye fixed on Katherine, her aura would be meager without the support of Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe (Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson, respectively).

Three inspirational stories brought to life in 'Hidden Figures',"This year's crop of Academy Award-nominated films for 'Best Picture' was a crowded one that saw three films starring predominantly African-American casts. In 'Hidden Figures,' we get to see stories that have not previously been widely told about the important roles African-American women had in America's space race against the Soviet Union.In 'Figures,' we follow the challenges faced by three ""human computers"" at NASA who fight their own personal battles for advancement amid the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement. Specifically, Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) are profiled, as the exceptionally talented women make incremental strides toward better lives for their families. The film most notably revolves around the life of Johnson, who is a former prodigy-turned-math superstar. Johnson is called upon to become the first African-American to serve in NASA's Flight Research Division, which is monumental accomplishment in and of itself. But she joins at a time when the US is in the throes of the space race, which means it is constantly a high-pressure environment.There are a few things about 'Figures' that work well. In addition to the script itself and the acting performances, the film is based on a true story - and not in a loose way. Additionally, the relationship between the NASA department head (played by Kevin Costner) and Johnson is touching and shows how when the stakes are high in a situation, people can look past differences that might otherwise cloud their view of someone else. It helps that there are more stereotypical characters cast in 'Figures' as shown in performances from Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons, both of whom do respectable jobs. But what 'Figures' really does well is it does not take itself too seriously. Sure, there are plenty of tense and emotional scenes, but there are also a number of laughs that lighthearted moments that keep things from getting too dark and depressing.'Hidden Figures' is one of the most heartfelt underdog stories that hearkens back to films like 'Remember the Titans,' and is an example of how quality films based on powerful true stories can still find audiences in this day and age.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hidden Figures,"I really didn't think I was going to like this movie. Maybe I've just seen the wrong ones but generally speaking movies with this kind of buzz annoy me with overly biased representations and a distinctive preaching tone to the message that just grates on me.Hidden Figures is not that movie.Yes, it has something to say and it says it but the story here is more than just that one note. There's heart, comedy and a quirkinesses to the characters that humanizes them and makes them enjoyable.There are one or two overly ignorant characters, but they feel like a minority and the cast at large is allowed to be natural, flawed and real.Definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hidden Figures intelligently uses racial and gender segregation to convey equality in an intellectual environment.,"I'm sure many of you didn't know who Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan or Mary Jackson were before watching this. And now that you have watched it, you've come out fully informed right? Thus, this historically significant event during the space race of the 60s has done its job, with excellence might I add. The three coloured women mentioned above were all working for NASA in different departments. Using their intellect and self-determination, they must overcome the obstacles of Virginia's enforced segregation policy in order to achieve their maximum potential in their careers. Immediately I was drawn in by the chemistry of our three leading ladies. Henson, Spencer and Monáe did not succumb to the typical role of playing a minority. No no, they embraced the chance to showcase the power, confidence and, most importantly, sass that coloured women took pride in. It's about standing up to the conformities of 60s America, not just laying down on your back because a white man told you to! It gives me great pleasure to see films like this that present equality and the requirement of teamwork regardless of gender, race etc. still being produced today. The narrative beautifully blends the intellectual assignments of NASA with petty racial segregating amenities. One coloured women's bathroom? A kettle just for coloured folk? It's outrageous that disgusting actions like those actually happened. This is why we need films like this, to ensure we never regress to such a primal state of mind in society. For that, this film succeeds. Always brought a smug smile to my face when any of these characters show off and solve a fiendishly difficult calculation that the other employees could not answer. The script allows these characters to be developed by portraying their personal lives as well. It is a bloated subject where certain areas are underdeveloped like the family lives and the new flourishing romance. However, an important and well crafted film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) played in the space program was an eye opener.

Kevin Costner (Al Harrison) is well suited for his role as both the leader of NASA's mathematics team and the champion of racial equality but Jim Parsons (Paul Stafford) and Kirsten Dunst (Vivian Michell) add little more than star power to their middle management characters.

The level of research applied is beyond impressive from the math to the norms of that time. To remind youth of today about life before electronic computers and desegregation, is imperative.

"A Flawless, Feel-Good Tribute to Unsung Heroes","Let's cut to the chase: Hidden Figures is a dreamlike ensemble biopic. The film boasts an incredibly star-studded cast, and while having too many talented actors can sometimes lead to a ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" situation, this gem of a movie avoids that pitfall entirely. The performances are restrained yet nuanced, with each actor bringing out the unique brilliance of their character in subtle, impactful ways. It's a joy to watch.On top of that, the film's pacing is smooth as butter, the storytelling is well-organized, and the soundtrack complements the narrative perfectly without ever feeling overbearing. It's one of those rare movies where you'd be hard-pressed to find a flaw. If I really had to nitpick, the only issue might be that, with such a stellar cast and seamless execution, the film doesn't take many risks or deliver any groundbreaking surprises. It plays it safe, sticking to a tried-and-true formula, which means you won't find any wild, out-of-the-box moments here.That said, Hidden Figures is still a triumph in its own right. It's a feel-good story that shines a light on an often-overlooked part of history, celebrating the brilliance and resilience of its protagonists without ever feeling preachy or heavy-handed. It's the kind of movie that leaves you inspired and uplifted, even if it doesn't necessarily blow your mind.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Segregation And Racism Nearly Affected The Space Race,"I grew up hearing about American astronauts as a child in England in the 1980's. I did not hear about the female mathematics of colour who created the ability for the missions to reach their goal.It's almost impossible to say what kind of a world it would be had Russia won the space war.It's a hugely educational movie and should be shown at all Maths' classes yet the story isn't in the curriculum.It's a great movie for black history and the BLM movement. I feel privileged to have watched it. The score is sensational too. Loads of cool jazz, Ray Charles and blues.I love the concept and it's been executed perfectly.

Equivocal,"""Hidden Figures,"" I must first say, is a perfect title; the double meaning encapsulates the two main thrusts of the picture: first, revealing the figures of African-American women whose importance to the space program at NASA has been hidden by historical racial and sexual marginalization and, second, discovering the figures of mathematics and engineering needed for the success of the Space Race. Ultimately, the equation proposed here is that the STEM disciplines are an equalizing and vital force societally. It's similar to the statement in ""Lincoln"" (2012) using Euclid to elaborate on equality and truth, except here that proof is derived from differential equations, including Euler's method. Indeed, that's a laudatory message, but the title is not the only factor in this movie to be an equivocality. ""Hidden Figures"" also reveals some of the same unfortunate tropes and mischaracterizations seen time and again by Hollywood in dealing with racial and societal issues. Although excellent in theory, many but not every number in this picture adds up.I don't necessarily care about simplifying history with composite characters, fictions to illustrate items of historical relevance and jiggering the timelines to make for a cohesive cinematic narrative, but I detest tropes such as the white male savior and noble bigot--employed to assuage the audience of any fears that their society might not be so much more enlightened now or, perish the thought, they themselves might not be. Such avoidance of challenging the spectator solves nothing. ""Hidden Figures"" is certainly not the worst offender in this respect; the last Best Picture winner, ""Green Book"" (2018), for instance, is almost entirely comprised of this rubbish and from the perspective of its white protagonist, to boot. Nevertheless, we get ahistorical scenes such as Kevin Costner--the same white savior from ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990) no less--integrating bathrooms by knocking down the sign designating one of them for ""colored"" women. Other characters who display personal and institutional racism are likewise inevitably redeemed as they help to further promote the well-being of the black women, from the police officer escorting them to work to a workplace gesture of kindness as simple as bringing one a cup of coffee. Outside of a brief library scene, there doesn't appear to be one irredeemable bigot here, which is remarkable for a movie about overcoming prejudice set in 1960s Virginia.Related to this comforting cinematic hand holding is the modern-day aversion to depicting smoking even for authenticity. If you've seen documentary footage of employees of NASA in the '60s and afore, or experienced that era first hand, it becomes apparent that the hidden figures within this picture are smoke and cigarette-filled ashtrays. Instead, we get Costner chewing gum. It takes some oblivious sanctimony to rid one dangerous habit, which in the grand scheme of things has only become proscribed recently, for concerns of their bad influence, only to continue the dissemination of dangerous tropes privileging white characters, which are older than film itself.On the other hand, movies have likewise long assumed that scribbling nonsense could be passed off as real mathematics, but ""Hidden Figures"" reportedly hired mathematician Rudy Horne to consult on the equations pictured here, so that even though the specific computations here aren't exact to history, they're arguably more faithful than the depictions of race and sex, let alone cancer sticks. Moreover, some of the best visuals here involve the repetition of the women displaying their STEM-related talents. The picture begins with a scene of a young Katherine Goble solving a problem on the chalkboard at school that is later referenced when Costner hands Taraji P. Henson a piece of chalk at a meeting concerning John Glenn's upcoming mission to orbit the planet. Another introductory scene establishes Octavia Spencer's Dorothy Vaughan as mechanically gifted in fixing a broken-down car, a skill set she later employs to supervise the new IBM mainframe computers at Langley. Some fine acting led by Henson also helps with the intended feel-good entertainment.More impressively, however, this is a nice compliment picture to the white-dominant and overtly-masculine ""The Right Stuff"" (1983), and one of the best shots here is of Spencer leading her fellow human computers down the corridor--referencing a similar shot of the Mercury Seven in the Philip Kaufman film. Even the score adds a new facet to the usual trumpeting in space films. The fact that ""Hidden Figures"" adds to the representation and the general cosmos of the Space Race picture alone makes it worthwhile. Indeed, despite its faults, it also has the right stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"A great story, a weak direction","""Hidden Figures"" is a film about racism, and the best thing about it is that it does not overreact or exaggerate, it is extremely accurate in dealing with the subject, speaks subtly when it has to be and explodes when it is Accurate, always full of much comic relief, for even when dealing with such a heavy subject, ""Stars Beyond Time"" is a lightweight film. We have a completely linear script that tells a true story, the story of 3 black maths that work in the nasa in the time of the space race, all their way are fundamental in the search to send the man to the space, and has that besides proving its value Like mathematics, has to fight against the discrimination of the time. Racism is always an important theme in a movie, and it exposes it in a legal way and without exaggeration, it does not have a great critical story and everything, but it is a relevant film, it gains a lot of attention by the time in which we live, because if it were In another decade, maybe it would go blank. With a photo of problems, a good soundtrack - even sometimes playing at the wrong time - showing all the pop of the time and a good edition and excellent rhythm, technically ""Stars Beyond Time"" fulfills its role with many resalvas. We do not have any featured acting in the film, all 3 perform their role and have a dramatic charge and comic reliefs the way they have to have, each protagonist has her personality, and her actresses are good at highlighting this, director Theodore Melfi - Que Does not have great works in its filmography - they do well to adapt this incredible story the screens of the cinema.

Hidden Figures (2016),"Here comes a film about three women who were crucial to the American space race and not many know about this story. I certainly did not. I'd say these types of biopics are necessary as awareness for people who have contributed so much in the past and shaped our lives in a better way. The film is about three black women who try to overcome segregation and unequal work rights in the workplace. One of these women (a mathematician), calculates the trajectory for Project Mercury and the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the Moon.This film is one that's built on its performances, especially a typically strong one from Taraji P. Henson. She's almost always great in her roles. Hidden Figures required to be a sort of mousy, quiet worker. However, the prejudice against her because of her race/gender get to her and then she becomes impassioned. Katherine Goble Johnson (who is played by Henson) is a brilliant person and is able to snide it in a few situations to people who doubted her. I also liked Janelle Monae in this and hope to see her in more in the future.As I stated earlier this is a story that not many people know about. I know of John Glenn and his accomplishments but not of the women behind what he did. The film is powerful in the fact that it shows how unexpected people can be responsible for great things. The film also carries a message of moving on from segregation and moving towards something great (as a result of being united). The messages are very important and the film is very safe in its exploration of discrimination, which should please general moviegoers.I wasn't a big fan of Theodore Melfi's St. Vincent. The film had a remarkable performance from Bill Murray but really failed to be memorable as a whole. With Hidden Figures I think there is an improvement in presenting a story and staying in a successful storytelling structure. Its a pleasant film that does not do a whole lot wrong.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Enlightening and enjoyable,This enlightening and enjoyable movie pulls out all the stops to show the contribution of African American women in NASA in the 60s and their battles against racial discrimination. There are many scenes showing segregation like colored toilets buses coffee. Some scenes seemed exaggerated and if you look up the real story online it turns out they were but who cares it makes for a very dramatically successful story. Really root for her as she gets the recognition she deserves.Taraji P Henson plays Katherine Johnson a brilliant mathematician who made a significant contribution to calculations for the launches and reentries of several flights. She is the main character. Octavia Spencer plays a supervisor and programmer. And Janelle Monae plays a woman who becomes the first African American engineer in NASA. Kevin Costner is the big boss. Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst who looks a little older here plays white NASA people with racist attitudes of the time.Worth watching.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Engaging and emotionally uplifting biopic.,"Hidden Figures tells an important and largely unheard chapter in modern scientific achievement and social history. Melfi's aim is clearly to tell this story to the masses, keeping Hidden Figures unashamedly mainstream. The trio of central performances are well balanced delivering humour and pathos. The plot flows from A to B with ease, character arcs are far from complex and the result is a pleasant, undemanding watch. But this is not intended as a criticism. After all you don't need to torture the audience to produce a memorable cinematic experience.

Pretty good.,"I saw this movie in theaters twice. My mom dragged me to the first viewing and the second one was for a school trip.Characters - The acting is great all around. The characters are all interesting and well-developed.Plot - The plot is pretty solid. No complaints here. This movie, though long and not the type of movie I'd go out of my way to watch, is fairly entertaining and well done.Stupid - There are a few scenes that kinda bugged me, but I'm just going to mention 2. In one scene someone at NASA misjudged the size of a door and they had to knock in the wall with a sledgehammer to move some equipment. It was played as a joke, but it wasn't that funny and it annoyed me that they were so uncoordinated and they just wrecked the wall. Second, there is a scene later in the movie where a guy is knocking down the sign for the ""colored bathroom"" with a crowbar and wrecks the wall. There is a massive gash in the wall after it finally falls. What the dude should've done is carefully remove the sign (which would've been faster) and then took the sign outside to burn it or something. Wrecking walls may seem convenient in the short time, but what about when you have to go hire someone to fix the wall? Doesn't seem so convenient now does it?Sights and Sounds - The cinematography for this movie is fantastic.

Hidden figures are all around us...,"Even after laws change in courts or congress, it takes a while for public habits, social rules and workplace policies to adapt. Hidden Figures chronicles the achievements of three intelligent ladies who were courageous to challenge the social order while also making long lasting contributions to science and technology.Segregation was deemed unconstitutional as early as 1957, at least in schools, but it is baffling to believe that while United States was trying to put a man on the moon, had separate bathrooms, bus benches and dining areas for colored people well into the 1960s. Hidden Figures wonderfully captures the hardships of three colored women in those days, while proving how a common goal can help people set-aside differences, break down barriers and achieve the impossible – something we all strongly need right now.It was cheerful to hear punchlines like ""At NASA, we all pee the same color"" by Kevin Costner or ""Every time we have a chance to get ahead, they move the finish line."" by Janelle Monae; dialogues certainly being one of the best features of this film. Mahershala Ali beautifully portrays a military colonel who falls in love with a widow. Jim Parsons fits the mold of a math genius but it will take some time for audiences to not expect humor from him, his impeccable gift of timing remains unexploited in the movie. Octavia Spencer, Taraji Henson and Janelle Monae pay a tribute to Dorothy Vaughn, Katherine Johnson and Mary Jackson through their authentic and sincere performances.While the movie provides these ladies their due credit, and the audiences a happy ending, our reality today is far from it. Unfortunately, over forty years after the civil rights movement and numerous laws passed, large parts of our society still openly deny a woman her right to choose, working parents their right to maternity leave, immigrants a wage they deserve, gay couples their right to get married, and a black person his right to a fair trial. We don't want our future generation to say, 'how were they OK with this?' There are hidden figures all around us, let's not wait to appreciate them until the next movie is made.

Hidden Figures Film Review,"The new drama film Hidden Figures based on a true story about NASA and black women who revolutionised things for space astronauts starring Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monáe, Taraji P. Henson. In Hidden Figures an uplifting true-life drama about the African-American women who played a key role in US space missions. It's 1962 and the space race is on. NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is determined to beat the Russians in putting a man into orbit around the Earth. But behind the scenes, a trio of pioneering African-American women are responsible for the calculations that will launch John Glenn (American actor Glen Powell - The Expendables 3, Ride Along 2) into space. These ""human computers"" have to battle against deeply engrained racism and sexism to secure their place in history. Katherine G. Johnson (American actress Taraji P. Henson - The Karate Kid 2010, Date Night) is a brilliant maths prodigy. Team supervisor Dorothy Vaughn (American actress Octavia Spencer - Get On Up: The James Brown Story, Divergent films) is kept in her place by a condescending boss Mrs Vivian Mitchell (American actress Kirsten Dunst - Spider-Man films, Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles). And Mary Jackson (American actress Janelle Monáe - Moonlight) endures an uphill struggle to train as NASA's first black female engineer. From the director of 'St. Vincent', this is an inspirational, feelgood true story of unsung heroes who dared to dream big and refused to be intimidated by the obstacles placed in their way. Amongst the other actors / actresses in Hidden Figures include American actor Kevin Costner (Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves, The Untouchables) as Al Harrison who works at NASA, American actor Jim Parsons (US TV Series The Big Bang Theory, Garden State) as Paul Stafford who works at NASA, American actor Mahershala Ali (The Place Beyond The Pines, The Hunger Games films) as Colonel Jim Johnson, American actor Aldis Hodge (Die Hard films, Straight Outta Compton) as Levi Jackson, Kimberly Quinn (St. Vincent, A Little Game and who is married to the director of Hidden Figures Theodore Melfi in real life) as Ruth Al's PA at NASA, Polish actor Olek Krupa (Thirteen Days, Eraser) as Karl Zielinski, American actor Kurt Krause (Devil's Due, The Last Of Robin Hood) as Sam Turner who works as NASA, Ken Strunk (Take Shelter, Promised Land) as Jim Webb, Lidya Jewett as Young Katherine Coleman, American actress Donna Biscoe (Red All Over, The Sacrament) as Mrs. Joylette Coleman, Ariana Neal (Get Hard, Fruitvale Station) as Joylette Johnson, Saniyya Sidney (Fences) as Constance Johnson, Zani Jones Mbayise (How To Be Single) as Kathy Johnson, American actor Tre Stokes as Levi Jr., Selah Kimbro Jones as Carolyn Marie Jackson, Corey Mendell Parker (Dead Still, Forbidden Attraction) as Howard Vaughan, Ashton Tyler as Leonard Vaughan, American actor Alkoya Brunson (The Birth Of A Nation, Vacation) as Kenneth Vaughan, Karan Kendrick (The Hunger Games, Parental Guidance) as Younger Joylette Coleman, Jaiden Kaine (US TV Series Luke Cage, Mr. Right) as Joshua Coleman, American actor Gregory Alan Williams (Terminator Genisys, In The Line Of Fire) as Marion Smithson, Maria Howell (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Mississippi Damned) as Ms. Sumner, Arnell Powell (Hindsight, The Honeymooners) as Professor Graves, American actress Crystal Lee Brown as Bernie, German actor Tequilla Whitfield as Eleanor, American actor Dane Davenport (The Birth Of A Nation, Flight) as Alan Shepard, Evan Holtzman (Dominion) as Deke Slayton, Travis Smith (The Good Lie, Shotgun Stories) as Scott Carpenter, American actor Scott Michael Morgan (The Descendants, Lovesick) as Bill Calhoun, Robert McKay (Brilliant Mistakes, Three Long Years) as Pastor Ayres, American actor Wilbur Fitzgerald (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, The Founder) as Senator Patrick and Joe Hardy Jr. (Mystic Rising, Zombie Tag) as Gordon Cooper. Filming locations in Hidden Figures include US States like West Virginia and Virginia but according to the IMDb website Hidden Figures was filmed in the US State of Georgia. Overall Hidden Figures is a good drama film filled with drama, science, space, astranauts, NASA employees, space shuttles, white and black people working at NASA, discrimination and racism in the work place, team work, togetherness, loyalty, a good insight in to the good work that the three African-American women mathematicians did good work at NASA back in the 1960's, breaking down barriers, old footage of the things that happened, maths sums, formulas, graphs, diagrams, family, genius people, outstanding performances from all the main actors / actresses and many other things throughout the film. So I will give Hidden Figures an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say Hidden Figures is worth seeing if you like drama films based on true stories or about NASA like Apollo 13, The Martian, Space Cowboys amongst others. So if you get the chance to see Hidden Figures in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The movie tells us that in America anyone with right abilities can succeed, being at the right place at the right time with the right skills. Now, that's smoke and mirrors. How else do you explain Trump or Bush Jr.? Putting that aside (as a possible theme for another, more critical movie), this is an excellent entertainment ""for the whole family"".

Making It All Count,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A trio of fine performances empower an uplifting tale of tolerance and strength.GRADE: B+SYNOPSIS: Three African-American women overcome prejudice and use their talents working at NASA during the early 60's.JIM'S REVIEW: Hidden Figures, a docudrama solidly directed by Theodore Melfi, tells the true story of three African-American women whose talents with numbers brought them together to work on the space program at NASA. Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) became the brains behind one of America's greatest achievements in history: the successful orbit of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell). Dealing with Jim Crow laws and discrimination due to their race and gender, these pioneers contributed to the Civil Rights movement. The film tells their untold story with much understated power.There are some intriguing unknown facts at play in the literate screenplay by the director and Allison Schroeder (humans called computers / outdated technology like the massive IBM machines / segregated book sections in public libraries, many African-American secretaries working at NASA, etc.) The script shows the racial inequities in the subtlest of ways.￼Still, there is a bit of whitewashing over the more brutal aspects that occurred during the early 1960's era against the ""colored"" race. None of the violence is shown in gut-wrenching honesty. It's all a little too sanitized. and the lead characters come off a tad saintly. There also seems to be a large degree of fictitious composites with some of the supporting characters in order to create dramatic conflict for our trio of crusaders. These bigoted ""white folk"" come off more plot devices than as actual people. However, the story itself is always involving and handled extremely well. The end result may be more crowd-pleasing than realistic, but as entertainment goes, historical accuracy is second place to real enjoyment.The lead actresses are superb. Ms. Henson, Ms. Spencer, and a beguiling Ms. Monáe create vivid characters and their chemistry is electric. One immediately roots for their inevitable success throughout the film. Kevin Costner, Jim Parsons, Kirsten Dunst, and Mahershala Ali co- star, and they all bring great nuance to their stock characters.Mr. Melfi re-creates the turbulent times with a restrained vision. He never overdoes the injustice angle, although a little more anger may have more impact for this reviewer. That said, Hidden Figures is a film that finally recognizes the talents and determination of these African-American women who overcame obstacles in their everyday lives. The film deserves your attention. This is one of the most important feel-good movies of the year, with more uplift in their stories than the customary lift-off of a NASA launch itself. Go see it.NOTE: The film score by Hans Zimmer, Pharrell Williams, and Benjamin Wallfisch added a nice R & B flavored vibe to the film. Especially strong was the theme use of the song Runnin' and closing credit song, Mirage, with Mary J. Bilge's powerful vocals. Very impressive.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Makes ya think!,"Born in 1957, I was too young to know in any detail what black people at the time were going through. I know what history tells us about slave plantations and the like, but this was the 20th Century and to me people have always been just.. well.. people.Even at the time when modern man was leaving the planet for the moon, they remained quagmired in petty prejudices and felt they were somehow superior or at least different.The three women of this film, who might themselves have modern day stories to tell, paid homage to those pioneering and brave women they were depicting. You can't help but watch something like this and feel tainted by the values and actions of white people of the time. Some will say nothing has changed, but I disagree - there are far few bigots around and it is thanks to these six ladies.I'm not going to review the film in any more detail because many others have done that really rather well.

She's just really memorable.And Taraji is amazing in all her scenes. One scene in particular stands out and pretty much slapped me in the face with her emotions so kudos to her for that! I'm actually gonna go back and re-watch that scene in particular.Kevin Costner's character was also one of my favorites.

Just as relevant today.,"I really enjoyed this movie an interesting entertaining story based on fact and a story that needed to be told of the struggle that Afro American women have had to further their careers and education at NASA in the 1960's and at last acknowledge their great contribution..

Powerful,"Hidden Figures is an incredibly well shot, directed, and edited movie, with great cinematography, acting and soundtrack. It is always great to learn about names who helped to deliver outstanding human feats, and to recognize them for their contribution.Right from the beginning of the film, it establishes the tone of the movie, one in which people of color must be wary of authoritative figures. The opening scene set the theme of the film, and forebode the prejudice and discrimination these women would face throughout their career. I have to say, I am very impressed by this movie. The way in which it tells the story, and by the screenplay: self-deprecating and blunt, yet truthful, is very effective. The screenwriters did an excellent job at finding that balance between humor, passion, and suffering. I'd also like to note, that the story is based on the book by Margot Lee Shetterly.Cinematography and directing are major contributors to the success of this film, with the use of well thought out shots to create maximum effect. The use of long shots are well positioned, and enhances the effect of individuals being empowered, or of isolation. For example, there's a shot where all the African-American computers are walking to another building, and the scene shows them walking into a hallway using a long shot from some distance away, depicting a sense of power in numbers. However, in another instance, Katherine has just had a door shut in her face, and when she turns around, a long shot is used to emphasize the empty space around her - this time, depicting desolation. The cast as well is simply amazing in the film, and pretty much everyone fully embraces their characters. Henson, Spencer, and Monae, depict an easy bond between their characters, and their banter is seemingly effortless. They deliver their lines with appropriate amounts of sass, wit, and intelligence in respect to each of their individual characters. Monae, in particular has a very strong headed character, and she pulls it off perfectly. Costner does well in his role as project leader too. However, Dunst and Parsons give more of an average performance. Dunst's accent is quite weird to hear, and Parsons might just be better of sticking with being a comedic physicist. Also, it would have been better if more information was given as to what these two characters actually did. They are in positions of relative power, but don't really seem to be doing much except sit around and give orders.I also have to say, that the soundtrack greatly complements the theme of the movie. Apparently, Pharrell Williams, a producer, oversaw all musical elements of the movie, including the soundtrack. Kudos to him, the music was enjoyable and added character to the scenes.One of the main things that may or may not be an issue, but which I consider important in noting, is that John Glenn, the astronaut, is seen and preserved as a hero. When he is introduced on screen, he shakes hands and chats with the three women - showing that he harbors no prejudice towards their gender or skin color. While this may have happened, I have an inkling that it probably didn't, and that Glenn would more than likely have had the same prejudices as the others. However, to preserve his hero status, filmmakers/ screenwriters made sure to keep him on the 'good' side.Overall though, a very powerfully themed movie with great acting, music, and cinematography.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Incredible Story, Blase Film","Three black women, who happened to be good friends, played pivotal roles in America's first manned-trip to outer space. It's a piece of American history that has been all but completely missing from our collective conscience. Their incredible story deserves to be told as an inspirational message of intuitiveness and perseverance, one that will touch women, minorities & anyone else with a soul. If only the filmmakers were as courageous and smart as these trailblazing women. Hidden Figures gets by solely on its being based in reality; otherwise, it's predictable biopic filmmaking with no faith in its story or audience to connect without pandering. It's far from a complete disaster. It presents some interesting parallels between science and racial inequality, specifically how progress in each can look one way in the numbers & facts but then a completely different way in action. The performances are good, with Monae and Ali specifically standing out, continuing their breakout years after their gentle turns in (the much superior) Moonlight. Individual scenes work in a vacuum, specifically a particularly sweet engagement dinner. Unfortunately, it's all covered in unbearably corny, Blindside-like dialogue and on-the-nose emotional beats. Above all, the music is incessant and awful. A manipulative hodge-podge of modern pop, classic soul, and generically emotional scoring, it's begging us to find the film charming. At times it is, like a late 20th-century Oscar nominee. Mostly though, its pandering emotions and generic filmmaking can't allow it to soar to the heights it should. Hidden Figures isn't a ""bad"" film; it's just a blasé film about a decidedly un-blasé story.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Still, it doesn't really excite or challenge the viewer. Maybe its light note and the feel-good vibe don't allow it to show anything edgy, such as the real, ugly face of racism or maybe it's the simple and straightforward nature of the characters (the three women feel more like heroines or symbols rather than real people) and the story (the concept of the underdog that defies the odds isn't that original and has been done countless times before) or maybe space race isn't that interesting of a subject, especially if one hasn't experienced it first hand.The cast did a fine job with the exception of Jim Parsons who went over the top as a villain and felt out of place.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The fact that these African-American women played such a critical role in shaping the entire space program and getting people into space, and to the moon, is finally a matter of acknowledged history. The film does a very good job of presenting the context and ambient feel of the times, as NASA is racing to get ahead of the curve before the Russians dominate space, while at the same time, the civil rights movement to eliminate racial discrimination in America is also reaching epic proportions. There is a nice balance of technology and ethnicity presented, and one also feels not only the passion of these women to succeed in both a man's world and a racially discriminate one, but the passion to rise above the black-white threshold imposed by an ignorant and prejudicial culture.

Race and the space race,"So soon after JACKIE we're back to the Kennedy era again, with this uplifting tale that puts a shaded meaning on the 'race' element of the Space Race. HIDDEN FIGURES – the title is a clever pun – is the story of three African-American women whose mathematical brilliance made a vital contribution to the effort to catch up with the Russians who'd rocketed the first man out of Earth's atmosphere.The women were called 'human computers' – we later see the installation of the clunky great IBM machine that would take over much of the laborious number-crunching these workers performed. The movie goes out of its way to show how tough black women's lives were in the workplace: 'colored' toilets, restricted prospects for advancement and constant daily humiliations from white co-workers (one of them is given her own coffee dispenser next to the one the white staff use). Writer/director Theodore Melfi shows us their home lives too, which are surprisingly similar to the lives of white folk. The number-crunching sequences are executed crisply enough not to overwhelm the audience with mathematics.The script perhaps slightly over-eggs the three women's vicissitudes to heighten the drama, but the three actresses (Taraji Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe) give rock-solid performances with very few moments of 'grandstanding'. Kevin Costner is similarly 'solid' as the head of the Space Research Division.This is another film, like last month's LION, that's bursting with the 'feel-good factor'. The feel-good factor is something HIDDEN FIGURES (if you'll excuse another very un-PC pun) delivers in spades.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

It also showed empowerment, not just for women but also for every people of color and I think this was the most inspiring part. The three main protagonists showed that even if they have different skin color and they are women, they can still do jobs that men can do. This really inspired me because they have done incredible things to make history and they proved that everyone can do what they want to do or be who they want to be, if they just do everything, they can.

When we all work together, and help each other over the finish line, we all win! Maybe things in this movie took creative liberties and didn't accurately depict some of the prejudices experienced accurately - meaning maybe these women were given more of a fair shake at NASA than depicted in this movie, but you can guarantee the sort of discriminations presented did go on in many other places. Now imagine if Alexander Grahm Bell, the Wright brothers, Thomas Edison, or Albert Einstein, were held back... imagine all the greatest achievers in human history were held back because of their gender, or race.

Good,"Hidden Figures In the racist year of 1961, three African-American women will be crucial for the first man to reach space. But given the racism produced in these years they do not believe them much, even if they are brilliant women.First let's talk about the actors. The protagonist for me is Khaterine G. Johnson, played by Taraji P. Hensen, who tries to be more useful than the little that brings his brilliant mind. Like Janelle Monáe interpreting to Mary Jackson, that in the film looks for its title of university to be Engineer. But the one that I liked more was Octavia Spencer interpreting to Dorothy Vaughan, that looks for that its black companions are more the center of attention. And Kevin Costner plays Al Harrison, who after the results for space are not the necessary to advance.Personal information. The character played by ... Sheldon (Jim Parson) is good, which annoys the protagonist throughout the movie but interesting. The music in this movie is very good, very much the style that blacks listen to at that time, until it reaches the credits and the editor of the music was Pharrel Williams and Hans Zimmers there I realized the Why?The few effects you see are very good, you feel the atmosphere of the Aussies.

Hidden Fences,"Sorry I couldn't help myself with the title to this review. honestly though the fences are not so hidden... unless you choose to not see them that is.The movie is based on a true story from 1961, where segregation was still a thing so NASA being the progressive unit it is was ahead of it's time, in that it separated black women into a fact and number checking temp agency within it's walls with zero chance of advancement.unlike most movies that deal with this issue however, this one follows three smart, well educated and dignified ladies from that division showing them not as victims of the times but fighters that quietly and very slyly climb up the ladder (or scale the wall that built in front of the ladder to be fair!) and make something of themselves using their heads and adapting to the ever changing times.Katherine G. Johnson (played by the adorable Taraji P. Henson) was quirky and showed a lot of dedication. Dorothy Vaughan (played by Octavia Spencer) was simply amazing! She was sassy in a way done right! and of course my personal fav. the flirty Mary Jackson (played the beautiful Janelle Monáe) put a smile on my face whenever she was on screen.The movie gets your attention from the opening scene (and it's a good one!) and once you're hooked your in for the long haul as it'll keep you interested from beginning to end. You are show the ugly face of segregation as a fact of life that these women don't fight but rather try to work around and how people can be cruel without even realizing it. I would recommend this to everyone, it was a lovely and (oddly enough given the subject it deals with) inspiring!an easy 10/10 and I'm glad a movie like this was made to shine the light on those that have worked so hard behind the curtain.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

We know it was a great achievement - IF the landings actually happened (haha) but Hollywood just does its usual by overdoing it. Making it so dramatic. The music was very annoying, silly and loud.

Like how they threw in Katherine Johnson personal life just the right splash.

The story of incredible women in an awful era,"""Based on a true story"". When I see that line at the beginning of a movie I'm already getting excited. It just gives the movie a little bit more punch when you know it's based on real life events. And here it's about segregation in the sixties or how the majority of the white Americans were racists, or at least acted like it was normal for a colored human being to not have the same rights as anyone else. A real disgrace, and if you think about it it's not even that long ago. I would have hated living in that era. Human beings can be such disgusting parasites. But Hidden Figures isn't all about hatred towards other colored human beings, it's mostly an homage to those who helped writing history without getting credit for it, except when they were of old age. A secret well kept, because an Afro-American couldn't be smarter than a Caucasian in that era. So it's not all bad in the movie, you also get a couple of feelgood moments. Moments when I surprised myself cheering loudly for the oppressed. The cast is phenomenal. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monáe and Kevin Costner are just sublime in their roles. The only one I didn't like was Jim Parsons. To me he will always be the irritating nerd from the highly overrated show The Big Bang Theory. It's just one of those actors I can't stand. I don't know why, it's just like that. But for the rest Hidden Figures is a must watch movie. A movie that tells a story about segregation, women rights and Nasa history.

The Devil in the Details,"First I want to say nice movie. But with Biblical movies I am often upset when they deviate from the Bible, I mean what's the point? Why not just use the Bible story? To a lesser extent I feel the same way here. I felt right from the get go that this story about three really smart black women working for NASA in the days of the segregated South was being overplayed Hollywood-style. If you're going to show me discrimination, show me discrimination to these persons like it really happened, not the way it presents most effectively in a Hollywood production with an anti-discrimination agenda. The way this played was so obvious and almost cartoon style that I felt suspicious about the whole deal even where much of the story was absolutely true. So take out the manufactured racial and sexual misinformation because I'd like the real scoop on these wonderful, talented and courageous folks.As I understand it, Katherine Johnson was accepted as a peer by the other persons she worked with - so please tell me THAT story (which to me is much more interesting than the movie contrivances)? Show Katherine being a true educational and workplace genius accepted by her white male co-workers when outside the KKK has meetings and blacks are directed to the back of the bus. All you do by distorting the facts for the subjects of this movie is to give the detractors something to work with. I would have preferred, and appreciated more, a straight movie about what these women achieved along the lines of Race, which didn't seem contrived in the least. For me, dishonestly presenting the details (on which the movie focuses way too much) just denigrates the amazing true story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

But they did not give up and we also had some brilliant one liners and funny moments to and even a touch of romance thrown in. But this movie is all about the ability of these women and what they achieved against all odds and it should be a real inspiration for all women out there.

"Overcoming adversity, these women were integral to NASA's success","Hidden FiguresHidden Figures is a biographical account of the African American mathematicians (computers) at NASA during the Space Race, featuring 3 of them, Katherine (Goble) Johnson, Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan. The film highlights the mathematical puzzle that needs to be solved to prevent an orbiting astronaut from burning up on reentry; the hidden figures in the calculation. But it also reminds the audience that the 1960s still featured segregation and prejudice, thus naming the mathematicians as hidden figures whose offices are kept far away.Victories in solving the orbital equations, convincing a judge to lift segregation for the purpose of education, and getting a jump start on programming IBM mainframes, are uncomfortable to watch, but ultimately satisfying. Without the efforts of these three accomplished scientists, the US might have ultimately come in second to the USSR. Their accomplishments deserve commendation, but it is still disappointing to see that racial bias nearly prevented the success.I cannot imagine the pressure that Katherine, specifically, endured. In the film, she is a widow with three kids. To her daughters' chagrin, she is shown working extremely long hours, though they seem to be the best behaved children in history to be so supportive. She also still finds time to meet a man and get married.These are remarkable people, showing the best parts of the American dream, even in the face of extreme adversity.

Bringing equal rights and eliminating racial differentiation.,When you belong to a colored category or being someone from lower category and a film gives you a story where the society lifts you up.

"Oscar bait about racism in the '60s, based on real people","The movie is based on a book, but both were released in about the same time, so who can know for sure. It is the story of three very smart African-American women who got ahead at NASA, despite habitual and wide spread racism. It's not about the Moon shot, but the period right before, when Russians were still beating Americans in space and they were all frustrated about it, so the working conditions were tough.The actors played very well and the story is based on real people at NASA. I doubt that they could have gotten away with too much dramatization when real people are involved, right? Yet considering the only of the three women who is still alive is 98 and that they went with the ole Oscar bait formula, I have my doubts. You know, take well known but faded actors and make them do character play, use foreshadowing for the most impactful moments in the movie, link the storyline not only to the American dream (both in space and in terms of getting out from under racism), but also with short jabs at ""the American soul"" and short references to Jews in Nazi Germany (but not on using Wernher von Braun for their rockets, of course).It was a good movie, but the feel of it was off. It felt like the black women in this film had a modern mentality and reactions, rather than what I imagine would have been the negro state of mind in a country where toilets and bus seats were separated by color. But I haven't lived there and then and I may be wrong. Also the knight in shining armor that was played by Kevin Costner was so over the top that it just felt fake. Poor Jim Parsons was stuck playing a nasty racist bureaucrat, Kirsten Dunst was the nice but conservative lady... it was just too cardboard.Bottom line: with less agenda and more science and inspiration it could have been great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A well made biography/historical film about very important figures in American history,"Hidden Figures was a well told biography/historical film. A story set during a time of segregation and racial prejudice. It was a very impactful film that depicted a glorious feat in American history during an inglorious period in American history.This film is great in depicting this struggle of African-Americans during this time period in which there were these indifferences in the ways that they were treated, it is about how these women stood up for themselves and made a difference rather than put up with such prejudices. This film thrives the most at doing things very simply and down to earth, no big moments were necessary, it was just a steady telling of this story which fitted very well with the plot of the film. This is probably the most down to earth space film out there.Another field in which makes Hidden figures so great is its excellent cast, every single cast member played so brilliantly. The transformation that Taraji P. Henson underwent in terms of her posture and approach were done so well to fit into the character of Katherine G. Johnson. Compared to some of her other roles you could very clearly see a distinct difference/transformation. From her semi-awkward speech to her constantly pushing up her glasses, all of these attention to detail make this a fantastic performance. The two female supporting casts, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae were great also. It was also quite hilarious seeing Jim Persons essentially playing his role of Sheldon Cooper here along sides Taraji P. Henson.Overall I believe the the film does a good job depicting this story and the fact that these are figures that many Americans never read about in the history books it really is true to the title of ""Hidden figures"". This surprising detail makes the events of the story all the more important and impactful to modern day audiences as they get to unravel and understand many 'hidden figures' that contributed so much to the United States and were such an important part of American history.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

It balances upon a combination of a witty script both humorous and dramatic, veteran actors giving likable performances and a true story that really hits on the realities of a certain place in time in history.That time and place is not only NASA headquarters in 1961 in the height of the space race, but more generally, a racially segregated Virginia. ""Hidden Figures"" tells the story of three women caught in the intersection of both. Some of the nation's most bright and well-educated black women worked as ""computers"" for NASA, helping to verify and compute the complex math equations required to launch rockets into space. When Katherine (Taraji P. Henson) gets an opportunity to compute for the head of the Space Task Group (Kevin Costner), a position in which no one lasts long, she's the first black woman to have the opportunity, and it comes at a crucial time — right after the Russians have successfully launched the Sputnik satellite, upping the stakes of the space race.The other women are Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), the unofficial acting supervisor of the black women in the computing division who isn't being given the title or the pay despite doing the work, and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) an aspiring engineer who decides to fight for her opportunity to actually become one. The film follows each of these women as they fight against oppression both sanctioned and unsanctioned, all while supporting one another and contributing to one of the biggest scientific advances of the 20th century.Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi's sharp screenplay (based on the book by Margot Lee Shetterly) really sets the tone for ""Hidden Figures,"" starting with a terrific introductory scene in which Katherine, Dorothy and Mary's car has broken down on the way to NASA headquarters and a police officer stops to examine the situation. Schroeder and Melfi (who also directs) address racial tension head on, but they're able to approach it from the black perspective, in the sense that these women know this is how things are and have a sense of humor about it. Throughout the whole film, we're reminded how unfortunate and wrong segregation was, but the discomfort of these issues comes at the expense of the white characters who are made (and rightfully so) to seem ridiculous for their thoughts and behavior.This set up gives these lead female actors a major advantage and they all deliver. Spencer and Monae have it easy as they both have a lot of natural presence and their characters get all kinds of permission to stand up and use it. Henson's role is trickier. Katherine is as bright as her friends and a strong independent woman in her own right, but she pushes back on the oppression she faces in her own quiet way. That makes her one dramatic outburst in the film a rather big moment, even if it's maybe a tad out of character.Much of ""Hidden Figures"" plays out in traditional, exposition-heavy based-on-a-true- story fashion of fighting resistance and overcoming the odds, but it works because the story is good and the writing provides ample moments to ""fall for"" the characters. Melfi's ""St. Vincent"" was also a film that played out in somewhat cliché fashion, but he has a way of really endearing the audience to the characters in his movies. There are so many moments when the lead characters get to game and shame the system and there's nothing more satisfying than when characters we like put the characters we don't like in their place.That's what a feel-good movie does, and that's what ""Hidden Figures"" is, and it does it better than most. Part of that is writing, but part of that is also the unique components of this particular true story. On a few occasions, white characters tell these women that they can't do something because no one ever has or there's no precedent, but the backdrop of the space race gives them a powerful example of how hard we as a country were working to do something that had never been done before. These characters were uniquely situated in the divide between America's obsession with scientific progress and its failures in social progress. They helped to catalyze both. And that's not even bringing up the issue of women in fields of science and mathematics.To say the story makes the film in this case would be unfair to the talents behind and in front of the camera, but it's the combination of the right story and the right storytellers that make ""Hidden Figures"" one of those important feel-good movies that school teachers will play in classrooms for a long time to come.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Great Movie,"I recently saw this movie and enjoyed it very much. However, as an ex IBM Customer Engineer who serviced a lot of IBM System 360 and System 370 main frames I get picky about computer scenes and was rather amused when Dorothy Vaughan walked into the computer room where the IBM 7090 had just been installed, looked around, walked over to an exposed circuit panel that had a probe from an oscilloscope attached. There was only a flat line on the scope screen, studies the panel for maybe two seconds, then moves the probe to another one of the hundreds of points on the panel, the scope then registers a signal and she says, ""There, it was in the wrong place"". Not being trained on the machine circuity and not even looking at a logic book, (the ""schematic"" of the circuitry) she could not possibly know where to put the scope probe or even know what the signal represented. The probe had nothing to do if the machine was going to work or not. I also noticed that when the computer was operating, there were no flashing light on the console panel as normally would be.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
'Hidden Figures' Is Pure Goodness Featuring a Stellar Cast,"There's much to admire in Theodore Melfi's newest uplifting venture ""Hidden Figures."" His ability to tap into the human condition and spirit has been proved with efforts like ""St. Vincent."" Boasting an all-star cast that includes the talents of Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae and Octavia Spencer, the 20th Century Fox feature emerges as one of the feel good films of the holiday season. Just one year after #OscarSoWhite dominated the internet, pointing out the Academy's lack of diversity, the timely themes explored here resonate more than ever.""Hidden Figures"" tells the story of a team of African-American women who provide NASA with important mathematical data needed to launch the program's first successful space missions.Melfi is a competent and distinguished filmmaker, and despite only two features under his belt, he really knows how to tell a story and tell it well. He invites the audience into the tale, allowing his sensibilities to take hold of the viewer. The top-notch direction in which he leads his actors are some of the finest of the year. Taraji P. Henson's Katherine Johnson, one of the brightest minds to ever walk through NASA, delivers her best film performance since ""Hustle & Flow."" She is finally given an opportunity to play something different than her ever-popular Cookie from FOX's ""Empire."" While she overplays her hand slightly in key moments, her natural charisma is on full display for the audience to behold.The professional and stoic presence of Octavia Spencer tends to be overlooked in film because she's always so great without even really trying. As Dorothy Vaughan, Spencer delivers some of her same ticks that won her an Academy Award for ""The Help"" and that could be too familiar for some on the surface. When seen on multiple viewings, you can see Spencer's interpretation of her character really evolve throughout the film's runtime.The highlights of ""Hidden Figures"" are in the two show-stopping performances of musical artist turned actress Janelle Monae and Academy Award winner Kevin Costner. Monae taps into the fight and spunk of Mary Jackson, showcasing the determination and frustration of a brilliant mind, desperate to finally explore her full academic and professional potential. While Monae's external beauty is front and center, she bares her soul to the viewer, virtually giving us a warm nuzzle and allowing us to get peeks into her sophisticated and heartbreaking aura.In recent years, Costner has found it difficult for audiences to remember how great of an actor he really is. We've received brief glimpses in films like ""The Upside of Anger,"" but rest assured, Costner magnifies his abilities here, likely delivering his finest performance yet. His Al Harrison's leadership is a comfort for the film, acting like cinematic scissors to cut through the barrier between movie and person.The film is a major threat for the Cast Ensemble award at the upcoming Screen Actors Guild awards, with supporting players like Mahershala Ali (charming as ever), Jim Parsons (playing an against- type), Kirsten Dunst (feverishly addictive in her mean woman role), and Glen Powell (playing the late John Glenn) all crucial to the film's inevitable success.Brimming and refreshing, Melfi's technical team truly shines with slick production and costume design, and a soundtrack that is sure to go down as one of the year's best. Producer and songwriter Pharrell Williams' two numbers – ""I See Victory"" and ""Runnin'"" – are just two more examples of the Original Song Oscar being the most competitive in the history of the category. In terms of the film itself, it does the job and does it well. Not necessarily pushing the boundaries of filmmaking, it's just pleasant and wonderful in every sense of the word.Precisely marketed as terrific adult entertainment for the Christmas season, ""Hidden Figures"" is a faithful and truly beautiful portrait of our country's consistent gloss over the racial tensions that have divided and continue to plague the fabric our existence. Lavishly engaging from start to finish, ""Hidden Figures"" may be able to catch the most inopportune movie-goer off guard and cause them to fall for its undeniable and classic storytelling. The film is not to be missed.GRADE: (★★★½)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amazing story.  Makes me want to read more about the characters,"This was an excellent movie which needed to be made, as these 3 women made a big impact in our history and yet I doubt many of us knew that.

you do not often see an underprivileged group shatter multiple glass ceilings,"In the arc of history you do not often see an underprivileged group shatter multiple glass ceilings. The incredibly brave women of Hidden Figures do exactly this. As African Americans, they shatter the barrier of entry to the hallowed halls of NASA, one of the crown jewels of the military industrial complex. As women they shatter the boys club of aerospace and rockets, where females were generally relegated to secretarial or clerical roles. Again as women, they shatter the upper echelons of scientific cliques, where many advanced subjects and challenges were deemed too difficult for females to undertake. This story needs to be told and retold.I literally cringed at the harsh treatment that these women faced in the bigoted time circa 1961. It seems the white establishment went out of their way to insult and humiliate their fellow African Americans, who showed amazing restraint and grace. It is quite alarming that a vast segment of America wants to return to this era, to put 'minorities in their place', but thankfully that clock will not be rolled back any time soon.It takes incredible courage to be the first, the pioneer and the vanguard, to pierce the veil of discrimination and shove your way into the room. The bravery of these women is exemplary and admirable through the ages. A must see movie to understand the cruelty of the past, and the possibilities born from courage and ambition. To me the historic space missions were a side story, the real subject was the journey of these strong, brave ladies of NASA.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Inspirational stuff!,"The Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union remains as one of the most fascinating events in human history, mainly due to the technological aspect of it all. As the title Hidden Figures suggests, there's much more to the whole story than just the technological aspect and I was unaware of it all.Hidden Figures tells the fascinating true story of a group of female African-American mathematicians, Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae), who played a major part in calculating vital data for NASA during the early years of the US space program.The feel-good factor of Hidden Figures is what makes it such an entertaining film, whether it be down to the performances or the screenplay, or even the music which features some original tracks by Pharrell Williams. The film focuses around the struggle three African-American women had in having their voices heard in a profession where the majority of workers were white males and the feel-good side of the film makes the film falter a bit in trying to get this struggle across. It's still quite hard to believe just how bad things were back then and I have to say the film feels a little guilty of glossing over these issues. With that in mind, the approach taken by Theodore Melfi makes for an infectious film that becomes incredibly hard to resist.The screenplay from Melfi and Allison Schroeder is one of the film's highlights, surprisingly funny and pacey enough to stop the film from dragging, serving both the inspirational story and the defiant characters incredibly well.Coming to the performances, Hidden Figures possesses a talented cast who all play their part in telling this story. Taraji P. Henson leads the main trio with a steely performance as Katherine Johnson, the woman with a brilliant calculator-like mind that helped NASA make giant leaps towards their goal. Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae complete the trio and they both deliver wonderful performances in such different ways. Spencer has been getting all the award nominations but I couldn't help but feel Monae deserved them more as she has one of the best scenes of the film.It sounds odd to say but Hidden Figures played out like an educational film for me as I had no idea about the behind the scenes of the Space Race. Hidden Figures can stand proud as an important and inspirational film that teaches you must decide who you want to be and never let anybody tell you any different.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent movie.  I was pleasantly surprised even though it was not 100% accurate,I thought it was an excellent movie... definitely a feel good story that gives you an insight into what it was like to be part of that initial space program. My only disappointment was it was heavy in politics... and painted NASA in a poor and inaccurate light... as a racist workplace and that she was heavily oppressed workplace... which according to the real Katherine Johnson... never happened. It still could have been a great movie without having to overexaggerate what she went through to achieve what she did.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Powerful well told story with an important message,"Hidden Figures (2016) is a very moving/powerful story about three African-American females working for NASA in the early 1960s. First of all, the acting and the performances from the three leads are fantastic, very award worthy, Octavia's Oscar nomination was very deserved, I just really wish that taraji p Henson's performance would have been recognized by the academy, because she truly did shine here. The script is masterfully written and the dialogue is fitting. I liked Kirsten Dunst, Kevin Costner, and Jim Parsons too, they fit their respective roles and portrayed them very well. The movie teaches a message of the importance of diversity and it also shows the immense harms that racial segregation back in the 1960s brought to society. And the movie is entertaining as well, it has its light and funny moments amongst the very dramatic and sometimes tense scenes. I highly encourage everyone to see this movie, especially families with children. Messages of diversity and the mistakes that we've made in past history is so important to teach kids. And Hidden Figures does that wonderfully! 8/10 for Hidden Figures.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Hidden Figures Review-Cast,opinion,music,etc","Main Cast: Kevin Costner(Al Harrison) Jim Parsons(Paul Stafford) Taraji P Henson(Katherine G Johnson) Octavia Spencer(Dorothy Vaughn) Janelle Monae(Mary Jackson) Glenn Powell(John Glenn) Made by 20th century foxHidden Figures is an amazing movie, mainly because of it's cast, plot and historical accuracy. It is about three African-American women working for NASA in the early 1960s. They have to overcome many obstacles from that time period, such as: sexism, racism and discrimination. They are very smart mathematicians, with their IQ underrated by colleagues on a daily basis, due to their skin colour and sometimes, their gender. It shows it's high detail of historical accuracy by an interview on television by Martin Luther King Jr, a news broadcast about an attack on a bus full of coloured people protesting and the police being forced to stop a group of coloured, also protesting. At one part of the movie, Dorothy and her two sons are kicked out of a library, due to them not being in the coloured section. Before she is kicked out however, she manages to steal a book about coding; her job at NASA is working with computers. Historical accuracy is also shown by the names being correct, instead of the creators having no knowledge of this.I knew that the movie was going to enjoyable for me, due to one of the cast members: Jim Parsons. He played the role of Paul Stafford in the movie, and in a television show my brother and I enjoy watching: The Big Bang Theory, he plays the memorable role of Professor Sheldon Cooper. I was correct, making the film all the more enjoyable for me; I knew one of the actors would have been good and would not have failed in delivering his role. I said the same about Tom Hiddleston in my war horse review.The music was made by Pharrell Williams, who is known for his role of making the music for Despicable Me Two. His song 'Happy' reached number one in the music charts in The US, UK, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and nineteen other countries. In the United States, it reached 6.45 million copies sold in 2014.Overall, I would rate Hidden Figures an 8/10, due to the reasons stated above. I would recommend watching it if you are into civil rights, equality, America in the 1960s or NASA in the 1960s. It has a very high rating of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes.Thank you for reading this review of the movie: Hidden Figures by Joshua Naish.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Relevant despite the time period,"I love intelligence, resilient women, and astronauts. I also am a woman working for a tech company, so I knew going into this that I would enjoy it. I had to actively tell myself to not let me love for Taraji P Henson blur my opinion of this movie, but in the end, it was just a joy to watch. It was a classic, I laughed, I cried, I found myself fearing for John Glenn's life even though I knew how that would work out (history, obviously). I worried the idea of Kevin Costner in ANOTHER ""coach"" type role would bore me, but it didn't. I worried that Jim Parson's only has one tone, and he does. But that was fine, because it all just worked, and was a true feel good film that felt perfectly relevant, even despite the time period. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Hidden Figures is an uplifting, inspiring movie with the struggle of being a black female working in a male dominated industry in the early 60's - drawing parallels with NASA's own struggle of trying to put a man into orbit.Everything about this film is first rate, the acting is outstanding (particularly Kevin Costner & Taraji P.

A reminder of the racial prejudices that existed in the US only 50 years ago, many of which was statute- enshrined.

"Self Identity, Nihilism and Collectiivism","The film is manipulated by the event the film shows, which makes the film has no theme, only telling a past event. Characters have no soul but serve the central plot, meanwhile, the main characters' life is manipulated by the progress of the plot. Katherine's emotional life is likely to be the subplot for the core event of this story- she and her team succeed in the job. For instance, Katherine encounters her new love precisely at the moment she has difficulty in her job and her wedding is precisely at the moment she has success in her job.Everyone leans on those things bringing them a self-identity in life, some live in their fame, some live in their wealth, etc. Under such material life satisfied the contemporary era, people are likely to stick to their identity and living on an aimless, nonsense life. The endless self-identity must lead to nihilism, moreover, nihilism is gradually expanding as national nihilism. The tendency of nihilism is leading to segregation, racism, gender inequality, and all the social issues revealed right now. This past history acting in the film just shows us an alternate solution for the nihilism tendency: collectivist culture. In particular, the solution shows NASA aligns all races of people together to fight for their common interest. It is also necessary for collectivism is to clarify the common enemy to make sure everyone is running in the same direction, the same dish.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Rocketing to the stars,"This review of Hidden Figures is spoiler free**** (4/5)THERE IS A LOT we know or may know about NASA, especially the moon landing of 1969, but what happened before that pinnacle moment in American history? Surprising as it may be NASA has a hidden story. Hidden Figures sets that story for the big screen, set in Virginia, 1961 a time when people never expected women to amount to anything, especially women of colour who were still used for help around houses in that time, this well-crafted film sets the tale of how a trio of African-American boffins changed the face of not just America but NASA too. We open with Katherine Johnson (Henson) as a child and how she succeeded as a mathematician, it's not much of an origin story but it's well-crafted nonetheless. Then the film shifts to when she is grown up surrounded by her two best friends Dorothy (Spencer) a computer programmer and Mary (Janelle Monáe) an engineer these three have a dream to change the world, but when they get to their destination at NASA they are bombarded by racism, sexism, that doesn't stop them from achieving their dream.Writer/director Theodore Melfi makes us wait a while for these women to achieve big however he uses this time well, crafting these women to become big historic figures takes time, Katherine is a brilliant mathematician when she is assigned to another part of the building it is her job to look up some numbers, there is one member of her new team who doesn't like her straightaway, but she is determined to show these men exactly what she can do. Granted she may be the subject of bullying at her job but she is strong-willed and doesn't let these bullies get the best of her.But not only is she a hard-worker, she's also a mother having to take care of her three children after the death of her husband. She's shy of meeting a new man until she meets the one of her dreams, who changes her life for the better. Until, the building decides to bring in faster super-computers she starts to feel scared about her job so she is keen to keep her job going until the computers start to work. This is when we see what soft-talking Dorothy can do when she starts to work her magic on the computers. At this point Mary finds out that she can't be an engineer without any specific qualifications she flips out and decides to go back to school.In the third act when their lives start to get better, suddenly the computers start to work so Katherine is not needed any more, this is when the film loses its momentum it spends a lot of time trying to get it back by coming with various equations for the Earth landing which need to be confirmed, it struggles to get the momentum back. Granted the story loses its momentum, but Hidden Figures hits almost every beat with perfect execution, it's an empowering story of inspirational women who changed the world of space travel forever; it has a lot of detail, a lot of technical speech it's very funny in places, there is plenty here to enjoy and is just a another addition to the already huge list of inspirational stories.VERDICT: A warmhearted, witty and truly inspirational story. Hidden Figures hits many beats big or small with almost perfect execution that propels the film forward with non-stop motion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A feel-good movie about three women who never gave up.,"Hidden Figures is a biopic about three African-American mathematicians namely, Katherine G. Johnson(Taraji P.

Katherine, Dorothy & Mary played a crucial part in sending American astronauts to space, during the initial years of the NASA space program.Hidden Figures is an outstanding film. It is incredible how these three women defied all odds to help NASA put a man in space, at a time when things for African-American women & men, were not particularly easy. Director Theodore Melfi beautifully brings to life the astonishing story of Katherine, Dorothy & Mary so that, the whole world will finally know who they are. Hidden figures no more.

Hidden Figures – Inspirational film which depicts a difficult time in American history,"This is the little known true story of three women who worked behind the scenes for NASA at a time in the early 1960's when Russia and USA were in the midst of a space race.This is a biographical drama starring three strong Afro-American women, who were employed to calculate the mathematical risks related to sending an astronaut into orbit. These women were either engineers or effectively human computers. Each were obviously being held back in their careers because of the institutional racism that existed at NASA at the time. Each of the women presented solid characters, who had their own individual challenges, but also had great collective chemistry.The film demonstrated racism, sexism and segregation themes while we see the girls very effectively overcome their diversity and maintain their dignity. It was interesting to notice how Kevin Costner's character was obviously blind to the racism around him at NASA until he is directly confronted with it, but we also see that he deals with the situations admirably.So in summary, this is an inspirational film which depicts a difficult time in history if you were a woman and especially black, and proves that women can do maths if they wear glasses.

"Both serious and fun, Theodore Melfi's feel-good drama is a blast.","Hidden Figures is written & directed by Theodore Melfi and stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monáe, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons and Mahershala Ali.The story of a team of African-American women mathematicians who served a vital role in NASA during the early years of the US space program.In Theodore Melfi's Hidden Figures, three heroic women who were a vital part of NASAs early years, are strongly portrayed by three wonderful actresses; Tarija P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, thankfully bringing the remarkable true story into the limelight.A smart, refreshing script is blissfully aided by cinematographer Mandy Walker's ""Kodachrome"" direction, capturing each scene with two distinct tones; warm and cold. Though a simple story, it's told with care and although slightly dramatised, it's hugely investing.Henson, Spencer and Monáe are all perfect performers, becoming very likable mere minutes into the picture. Henson takes the lead, however, with a showcase of pure strength and drive.The 1950s/60s are always interesting to see brought to the big screen, especially in the costume and production design. Both departments have delivered in every sense, alongside the art director and set decorator to achieve the utmost detail, in doing so, creating a working environment the actors can connect with and the audience can adhere to.If I had to say anything I disliked about Hidden Figures, it would be the decision to cast Dunst and Parsons. The two felt inapposite and while both gave satisfying performances, I never once clicked with their characters. Costner executed his character with skill and ease, yet the two aforementioned lacked any unique traits in their rather substantial roles.The original soundtrack by Pharrell Williams is overflowing with energy, featuring tracks written specifically for the picture, including feel-good cues composed by Hans Zimmer & Benjamin Wallfisch. Each track feels largely appropriate not only for the imagery but for the time period, also.There's a lot to like in Hidden Figures, and for all of the right reasons it ticks all of the right boxes.Verdict; Vibrant characters, stylish writing and a funky soundtrack ignite a flourishing work of brilliance in Theodore Melfi's historical drama.Hidden Figures, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A great film from back when anti-racism wasn't a marketing strategy,"If you liked:
Green Book
The Help
The Imitation Game""Hidden Figures"" is a story of a team of female African-American mathematicians who served a vital role in NASA during the early years of the U. S. space program. This may sound like some politically correct forced anti-racism equality film at first, but this one is actually a rare gem, like Green Book, where that is not the case. It isn't propagandistic or ""preachy"" in any sense of the word; it's a real story that people collaborated on to share with the rest of us, and, in my opinion, The Example, along with visceral ""The Help"" and ""Green Book"", of how a film about discrimination, racism and equality should look like. What makes this film stand out from similar films is that there really are two parallel main plotlines unfolding at the same time and both of them would have been interesting by themselves alone; the space race with the Russians being the second one.We follow these three women, an early computer scientist, an engineer and a brilliant mathematician as they work their backs off trying to do what they love and what they are good at, despite the stone walls that are being put up in front of them for the mere fact that their skin is of other color AND their gender doesn't suit the labels of a ""NASA employee"". This was one of the first films which back in 2016 introduced me to how bad the racism situation in America was; growing up in Russia where the only black person I've ever seen was a TV-celebrity Pierre Narcisse, a one-song phenomena with his ""Chocolate Hare"" (yes, really), racism was always some distant, barely real theoretical concept. We never learned about segregation in school, the mass separation of people based on their race where people were literally forced to always only sit at the back of the bus, go to black-only schools and use black-only restrooms (which may sound trivial at the first ignorant glance, but, as it is brilliantly portrayed in the film, is actually a huge problem). All the things we take for granted as basic human rights were just taken away from them and there was nothing you could do about it, because you were born into the ""wrong kind of body"". No matter how well you served and loved your country, it just didn't love you back. Through the most subtle, intelligent little scenes this film gives us a clear picture of the burning, unbearable injustice these poor women had to deal with. But despite the harsh topic the film is surprisingly easy to watch: it is funny, it is interesting and it fills you with hope and determination that such things must never come to be in any form ever again. A truly great picture.Available on Dysney+.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fun drama which intertwines race and science,"""Hidden Figures"" proved to be a sleeper hit in the US and then went on to gain three Oscar nominations including Best Picture. That a film where the primary characters are black women who also are mathematicians for NASA should be a surprise force at the box office is a massive understatement. It is a testimony to Theodore Melfi as director and co-writer with Allison Schroeder as to the skill to inject what could have been a run of the mill drama with warmth and enough racial history to elevate the material and allow it to be a safe vehicle for examining where the US has come from and ironically where it is in 2017. The film has the luxury of three incredible women to showcase, who each individually made great strides for women and African Americans though the film makes Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) the lead story ably supported by the portrayals of Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae). All three started out as 'computers', that is human computers who helped calculate the immense amount of math needed to establish the NASA space program. Soon all three are pushing the boundaries of an institution still wrestling with how to leave behind WWII era thinking both scientifically and socially. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of that era knows what happens in terms of putting the first American into space and the pressure to beat the Russians in technological expertise. The story comes alive in the nuances of living in a Virginia, still segregated under state law, where daily tasks prove so much more difficult and in some case almost impossible. To be clear the film is nothing resembling a documentary. The events are pitched for effect, characters mixed with others as the time frames were much longer but the essence of kicking doors down which had long been closed to minorities is true to the spirit of the times and a film much needed right now where the value of both science and a diverse population are both openly questioned by the Trump administration. The leads are all very good in charismatically holding the lens. The roles are showy to liven up the subject matter and only Butler seems especially grounded and so it is not surprising that she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Kevin Costner reminds you why he is still a movie star, dominating every scene he is in. Jim Parsons (unrecognisable in manner from his TV work) and Kirsten Dunst are very good in unlikeable roles. The whole ensemble is very good across the board and really allows the film to hold your attention despite a two hour running time. It is rare that a film can be recommended as great family viewing and simultaneously be a salve to the daily news. I hope that the White House plays this film, many might learn why the US was once respected and revered across the globe despite any failings because it was seen as a place which recognised the constraints of reality and then tried to improve on them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
a high achievement of orthodox entertainment from Hollywood,"Soaring as the highest grosser among 2016's Oscar BEST PICTURE nominees in North America (edging $170 million), HIDDEN FIGURES is a biographical treatment of 3 black female mathematicians working at NASA during the Space Race, whose unassailable contribution is glaringly juxtaposed with harsh working-place discrimination in a segregated America barely 55 years ago (the fact still stings).The film's impeccable triumvirate are Katherine Goble (Henson), who is still with us today at the age of 98, a genius in mathematics plays a consequentially key part in astronaut John Glenn's (Powell) launch and return from the orbit; Mary Jackson (Monáe), who is aspiring to become the first Black female engineer in America and Dorothy Vaughan (Spencer), an under-appreciated supervisor-to-be, hampered by her skin color. All three are spirited, honest-to-God gals who would eventually satisfyingly win their overdue respect for their competence in the cutting-edge sphere, flags up the quintessential American spirit - winner takes the all. On paper, the story would easily fall into the pigeonhole of a hagiography with all the crevices papered over in pursuit of the straight-forward political correctness, but miraculously under the able hands of director and co- screenwriter Theodore Melfi (his second feature film), the final product is immensely enthralling and rewarding, although a deeper probing of characterization is skated over, but by dint of its tub- thumping milieu and the mounting injustice (both racism and sexism in the rarefied high-tech rung) these three women take in their dignified stride, everyone can find a congenital connection with them and involuntarily roots for them because if there is any justice in this world, this is it!Shy of expository screed on technicality, and juicy in its confrontational sparkling and homely felicity, HIDDEN FIGURES is a high achievement of orthodox entertainment from Hollywood, gives access to the lowest common denominator without being fluffy or patronizing, ambidextrously balances its innately rousing source material with glistening performances: Taraji P. Henson is a formidable force to be reckoned with and particularly eloquent in her big moment of outpourings good and proper; Octavia Spencer, exudes incredible panache against her stock appearance, reaps the token nomination for the Oscar glory; but it is high time to give a backslapping to Janelle Monáe, only her second film credit (after MOONLIGHT 2016) for the famed chanteuse, her Mary is a firebrand but not scanty with humor and sobriety, that scene facing off a judge in the court is in my druthers, the single best delivery of the entire film, which she nails with unbelievable confidence and earnestness. Meantime, let's not begrudge our thumbs-up to the lighter-skinned counter-performers, Kevin Costner, channels his ""white face"" proponent with a heartfelt vibe in measured sagacity, and two ""black face"" antagonists, played by Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst, might not be as one-note as they let on, the modulation in their attitude shows up inviting subtlety in the script-writing.HIDDEN FIGURES, a film encourages, inspires and galvanizes its audience with a cogent message about real-life encountering with the ever-present benightedness, surprisingly not so long time ago, its timing couldn't be more opportune if we must firmly believe the world is changing into a better place, it does give us some spark of hope, doesn't it?",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"A gripping, forgotten true story with great performances and direction","'Hidden Figures' is a biopic detailing the untold stories of three inspirational African-American women who served a vital role in NASA during the early space programs. At the beginning of the film, they are working in a segregated environment where their full talents are being under- utilised despite all being clearly very intelligent. The film details their work for NASA and their plight into getting their desired role in helping the early space missions. The film is directed by Theodore Melfi who directed 'St Vincent', a 2014 comedy with Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy which received positive reviews. The film boasts an impressive cast comprised of Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe as the titular figures and the cast is rounded out by Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons and Mahershala Ali to name a few so the performances should be very strong. 'Hidden Figures' has received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress for Octavia Spencer and Adapted Screenplay and although it ultimately didn't win anything, many anticipated it as a dark horse in the Oscar race.'Hidden Figures' is an extremely easy film to like and barely puts a foot wrong; I was utterly charmed by it the whole way through. It is competently directed by Melfi and has just the right blend of comedy and factual drama in it to prevent it from being too laborious or too comedic. Not only are the performances are great in this film, but the characters are all really well- developed and the screenplay by Melfi and Allison Schroeder is wonderfully written. What stops this film from being perfect is it is fairly conventional in parts and there are a couple of story arcs that are a little underwritten. But these are very small nitpicks in an otherwise near-perfect film.I really admire the respect that Melfi seems to have for these characters and it's refreshing to not only see a film that is not only led by women, but women of colour. It sets itself very confidently in time, establishing a well-developed context which helps the audience to further empathise with the film's characters and their struggle in a racially segregated society. The film manages to earn a lot of its moments that it tries to go for in sympathising with the characters and although I wasn't aware of anything to do with this true story before seeing the film, I was fascinated with the narrative it portrays, a story of these hidden figures.The performances of the entire cast in this film are round-the-board very likable. Taraji P. Henson is very respectful and faithful as Katherine Goble Johnson, a mathematician who becomes the first African-American working in the Space Task Group. Octavia Spencer, who has received an Oscar nomination for her performance as Dorothy Vaughan is wonderful and is equally comedic yet all-knowing, who works the job of a Supervisor without being credited for it. Janelle Monáe plays Mary Jackson who aspires to be an engineer and I've been really impressed with Monáe who manages to give a second fantastic performance after her wonderful turn in 'Moonlight'. The rest of the cast are all very strong too and it's great to see Jim Parsons in a serious role who proves he isn't just limited to comedic roles. What propels these performances is the wonderful character development in the script and I really felt and understand for most of these characters by the end of the film. The only exception is Mahershala Ali as Jim Johnson, a military officer who romances with Henson's character. Ali's performance is great, as to be expected, but I thought the role was quite underwritten and a bit po-faced and there is a moment late in the film that I don't think the film manages to earn.The score which is scored by Hans Zimmer, Pharrell Williams and Benjamin Wallfisch is subtle and fits into the film well whilst being fairly memorable at the same time. The cinematography by Mandy Walker is competent and economical and the film is very well-edited by Peter Teschner.Overall, 'Hidden Figures' is one of the stronger entries in the crop of Best Picture nominees for this year. It is a timely and important film and has just the right amount of respect for these individuals without overdoing it and feeling like a history lesson. It deserves all the Awards attention that it has received – Melfi has done a very good job in pacing this film perfectly and a strong, cine-literate script manages to bring out some excellent performances in the well- developed characters played by the cast. I really liked it and the film was completely gripping in its opening moments and never lost me throughout its entire run time.Read this and other reviews on thefilmmeister.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
True story about conquering racism by working together.,"The Americans wanted to be the first to put a man on the moon in the sixties. In those days when toilets and buses still had separate places for people of color, lots of very smart African-American ladies were DECISIVE in helping to put the first man on the moon. 3 African-American ladies in particular were absolute geniuses, who outsmarted any Nasa mathematician of that time. Incredible true story.Mind you, racism against African-Americans in those days was really violent and widespread. Martin Luther King got shot late in the sixties, a year before the actual moonlanding took place. Amidst that chaos in American civil rights history, these 3 African-American ladies helped out with mathematical calculations that were absolutely necessary to successfully put the first man on the moon. Fascinating story, that is really well acted too, by relatively unknown actresses! Terrific feel good, fighting spirit with some good jokes as well!Any bad? It's a bit too much sugarcoated at times, some might take offense by that, but fortunately it never becomes cheesy or overly sentimental.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Of coffee, buses, and firsts","The story of three mathematicians at NASA.This is competently made from a filmmaking perspective. It is the typical kind of inspirational based on a true story Hollywood movie, with an adherence to cliches. Inventing stuff that didn't actually happen. Most of them are there to underline how gifted and important this trio of black women were, when there was still segregation. Unfortunately, It feels the need to provide a white saviour narrative, to address white fragility.It is a movie that you could show to children, as it can start them on a path to understanding Jim Crow, as well as inspire an interest in STEM in members of minorities.I recommend this to anyone that wants to appreciate how important African Americans have been to American prosperity. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The women on Hidden figures,"The movie Hidden Figures is about three women that stood up for their rights through their capability to change the way the world views life: sending a man to outer space. This movie shows us a reality of women through 1935. The fight against segregation, and the social and civil rights of every woman in the country. It may seem that the movie talks about a racial profile, when we may be missing the point; it is about women fighting for their rights and stepping up in the study of exact mathematical sciences that are very much needed in the world, specially at NASA. Women's rights and segregation were fought for at the same time. NASA held women as assistants, secretaries and secondary help in the great enterprise of sending a man to space and back. This step in humankind united all kinds of people with all their talents to make the impossible, possible. To reach for the stars is a dream they conquered. At that time it was something crazy, literally, out of this world. When the world gathers without disctinction, we are able to achieve so much more in the meaning of life, than when we are all alone. https://pensarparaserfeliz.wordpress.com/2017/03/28/the-women-on- hidden-figures/",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Inspiring and heavy handed.,"There's a lot of wooden characters in this movie. Most were just put into the story to tell an narrative of racism and sexism. The film doesn't lighten up on this and that's why it didn't get a higher score.Now for the good.Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae, Taraji G. Henson, and Kevin Costner are good in this movie. Taraji Henson has a lot of talent and she's wonderful to watch. Octavia Spencer could have been featured more. She's done a lot of different and fun roles in the past and she's delightful. This is the first time I've seen Janelle Monae and she was solid. Kevin Costner delivers a solid role as Kevin Costner again (that's what he does best).The historical story of these women is interesting enough without all the pandering. If the film makers had a little subtlety, it would have been a much better movie.On a side note: If anyone is claiming the film is bad because of revisionist history, put that label on every biographical film made.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
These Women Definitely Had The Right Stuff,"I couldn't help but think of this movie in relation to the 1983 movie ""The Right Stuff."" That film honoured the first seven American astronauts in the Mercury program. This movie honours the vital contributions to that program of African American women - largely behind the scenes and often not getting the credit they deserved. The movie focuses on three women in particular: Katherine Gobel/Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae). All three are brilliant in their respective fields: Katherine as a mathematician, Dorothy as a programmer and Mary as an engineer. All three work for NASA in the early days of the space program as the Mercury program is just beginning, and all three are involved in the vital calculations necessary to launch, orbit and re-enter capsules. In the midst of the work, the women are forced to deal with things such as riding at the back of the bus, segregated bathrooms and the prejudices of their co-workers. Henson and Spencer seemed somewhat more central to the story and offered good performances. Monae - better known as a singer than an actress - seems to fade away a bit compared to those two, but still does a fine job with the role.Truthfully, race was really as central a theme to this movie as was the space race. While it was all set in the context of the space race between the USA and the USSR, it was also set in the early 1960's at the NASA facility that was located in Virginia - a state where segregation was still an accepted and every day fact of life. And, of course, the women are not just African Americans - they're women, and they have to deal with sexism as well - even from some African American males, who don't seem to know what to make of them working in such important jobs. The scenes depicting the reality of life in the south in the era are sobering, and once the Mercury astronauts are introduced there's a lot of tension involved - although much of that is mitigated by the fact that we've seen the astronauts' stories and the basic story of the space flights in ""The Right Stuff."" But it was inspiring to see the contributions of Katherine and Dorothy and Mary and others like them.It's a well done movie. Some of the characters are composite characters. That isn't really a big deal and was probably necessary to give some focus to the movie. Actually, two of the most important NASA figures - Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) and Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) were composites. There were some scenes that were very dramatic but that were created for the movie. Harrison (and since he didn't exist - no one else) never smashed down a ""Coloured Women"" restroom sign, for example. It was a powerful scene, but completely made up. I want to suggest that Parsons was a superb choice for the role of Stafford. His role as Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory makes it easy to relate to him as a jealous and arrogant scientist who seems to look down on everyone else's work - and he proved here that he can handle such a character in a dramatic role as well - although if I were Parsons, I might be concerned a bit with the possibility of type casting.It's also a bit jarring in the year 2017 to see the state of technology in the era. I'm a child of the 1960's and grew up without computers, but even so I'm so steeped in today's culture that when I saw the sign ""Coloured Computers"" for the first time, I thought how ridiculous it was that even the computers that African Americans used were segregated. It took me a few minutes to realize that the African American women WERE the computers, doing the necessary calculations. NASA was just in the process of having a huge and primitive IBM computing machine built to take over the job of doing their calculations. Seeing people working frantically on all of the complex equations in the movie was a bit disorienting.This is a very deliberately paced movie. It's interesting all the way through. I wouldn't say it's an intense movie very often, but it's a very watchable movie that pays deserved tribute to a largely forgotten but courageous and determined group of African American women who played a vital role in the beginning of America's space program.

Hidden Figures Exposed,"This well acted, very good looking based on fact movie, offers high entertainment and information value. It's just a pity the screenplay writer/director Theodore Mefti, felt the need to exaggerate some elements of the truth.

It tells the employment experiences of each Woman (3 Afro American friends) Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson in a parallel time frame. Set during the turbulent late 50's with its racially ugly segregationist laws, this script tends to give these women's situations more of a 'Them and Us' scenario than perhaps was actually called for.While I abhor racial hatred, and agree it should be shown for the nastiness it was (and often sadly remains) exaggerating the extent of certain situations can only add the unnecessary element of 'separationist' attitudes.

A truly remarkable story! 8/10,"Review: What an amazing true story, which I found quite shocking, and entertaining at the same time. I can't believe that there was a group black ladies, known as the ""human computers"", working for Nasa, and that they were responsible for some of the most important missions of all time. The fact that there story has never been told, is what I found quite shocking, and there unique mathematical skills were truly remarkable. During racial times, and with there gender against them, Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae), swiftly move up the ranks in different departments at Nasa. With the Russians being the first to put a man on the moon, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), is under a lot of pressure to complete a successful launch into space but all of there missions have failed because they haven't been able to put together the numbers correctly. Katherine is promoted to try and help to sort out there formulas but it takes some time for her to be taken seriously, as she is the only black woman in that department. Mary Jackson is also promoted but she really wants to be an engineer, which is unheard of for a black woman in Nasa. After reading the rules for becoming an engineer, she decides to attend night school so she can apply for the job. Dorothy Vaughan battles to get a promotion in her job, even though she plays more of an supervisor type role, and when the new IBM computer arrives at Nasa, she makes it her goal to teach the women how to use it, knowing that she might finally get the promotion that she deserves. With there determination, and there brilliant skills, these 3 African American women manage to achieve there goals, with the odds stacked up against them. That's what made this inspirational story so great, because they were all treated with disrespect, because of there race and gender but they played a huge part into getting an astronaut into space. The acting from the whole cast, was spot on and the whole look and feel of the film, made it emotional and very believable. I would have liked to have seen how the ladies progressed in time but apart from that, it's a great watch and it was good to see something great come out of a bad situation. Great Watch!Round-Up: With such a small budget, and an amazing profit at the box office, director Theodore Melfi done a great job with such an remarkable story. He also directed St. Vincent, starring Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy, back in 2014, so with only 1 project in his filmography, the studio took a gamble with this director, which definitely paid off. With Pharrell Williams in the producers chair, who supplied a great soundtrack throughout the movie, and 3 Oscar nominations, I'm just glad that this movie got the respect that it truly deserved.Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $230.7millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/history/dramas, starring Taraji P.

Touching story,"Another weekend evening immersed with a truly touching and inspirational movie. To be honest I was kind of struggling to make a decision between this movie 🎥 or another equally highly rated action one.However, I somehow felt instead of viewing those fighting, shooting, bombing and killing perhaps it was more worthwhile to watch some thought-provoking and soul-inspiring artwork. I somehow heard of this art piece sometime ago but didn't get to watch it. And I'm glad to find out that this highly accoladed 7.7/10 rating didn't disappoint me.It is touching because it paints a very real picture of the ethic division or apartheid in the United States 🇺🇸 in the 1960s where colored races notably African Americans were required to use separate bathrooms 🚽 and attend separate schools 🏫 from those white Americans. Such thing is only hard to imagine in today's world 🌎 and even harder to believe in one of the most purportedly inclusive and welcoming cultures. African Americans faced so many discriminations at the time and they still do nowadays to a lesser extent.It is inspirational in that it took black Americans a lot of fights to claim their rights, be it Martin Luther King, Jr. at the time or President Barack Obama most recently. As is said nothing comes to you unless you fight for it. As Hillary Clinton said in her 2016 presidential election concession speech, ""This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it."" All those three African American characters in the show fought fearlessly and tirelessly for their own rights and I'm sure their actions had inspired a whole African American generation.What reaches me too is that we live in such a better and safer world 🌎 nowadays where egalitarianism is much better preserved especially in Australia 🇦🇺. I was talking to my former manager who is American and she also agreed that racism is much less of a problem although not perfect in Australia 🇦🇺 compared to the United States. To me this is the beauty of living in a migrant country where multiculturalism is the centerpiece. I honestly don't think 🤔 many countries can do a better job in reconciliation between different ethnicities, cultures and religions than Australia 🇦🇺. As a country we benefit both economically and culturally from migration and multiculturalism that ensues.Thank you 🙏 Hollywood for presenting another wonderful movie 🎥 that quenches my spiritual thirst. Burst of laughter😆, gasp 😦 of breath, , or shed of tears 😭 - that's what you brings to me. Always get a box 📦 of tissues ready before watching any movie 🎥 - that's my advice, as you never know where you will end up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Good 'Ole Days Weren't So Good,"If you didn't live as an adult during the fifties and sixties, this a is a must see film. It is a biographical look into the lives of those who worked at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia in 1961 and were instrumental in NASA's race to space. It is a time before before computers, civil rights, Title VII, and a time before very little was fair or equal for women or people of color.Mathematician, Katherine Johnson (Taraji Henson); aspiring engineer, Mary Jackson(Janelle Monae); Acting Supervisor, Dorothy Vaughan, (Octavia Spencer); Supervisor, Vivian Mitchell, (Kirsten Dunst); and Head Engineer, Paul Stafford, (Jim Parsons); all take us back to a time the last two generations will not recognized, and for the rest of us a reminder of how commonplace injustice was.Be sure to save time for the ""after movie conversations,"" there will be plenty to talk about.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Inspiring movie,"The '60s was a time when the U.S.A was in a race with Russia to be the first to the moon. It was also a time when the U.S.A was strife with change regarding human rights and the fight for equality for black people and women. The movie is set during the Seven Orbit Flight and looks at the story from the point of view of three brilliant, strong black women who worked at NASA. (True story, by the way!)To anyone who thinks that this movie might be ""heavy handed"" by portraying the majority of the white characters as racist, would be wrong. It's not ""heavy handed"" when it's based on truth. In the background of such an uplifting story are reminders of segregated bathrooms, bus seating and schools, and police discrimination - which is unfortunately an issue to this day. Among these strong reminders of racial discrimination,there are also subtle reminders such as when Mrs. Mitchel's character uses Dorothy's given name while Dorothy must call her ""Mrs. Mitchel"".Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) is a gifted math genius, mother of three, and widow who must cross colour and gender roles. She is promoted to the task force that does the math for the launch and re- entry for the space shuttle mission.Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) works in the computing section of NASA as an ""unofficial"" supervisor. She learns that with the installment of the IBM computer she and her coworkers may be replaced, and endeavors to make sure that doesn't happen by educating herself and the computing staff on how to use the IBM. She was considered to be one of the most brilliant people at NASA at that time.Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) also works in the computing department, with dreams of becoming an engineer at NASA, but must jump racial hurdles in order to move forward with that goal. She is by far the sassiest of the three ladies. Mary Jackson became NASA's and The U.S.A's first female African-American aeronautical engineer.The take away message is, of course, that no matter your skin colour or gender we are all equal; we should be given equal opportunities and everyone deserves respect. The linked take away is that if people set aside their perceived prejudices they will achieve great things.My favourite quote: ""Three negro women are chasing a white police officer down the highway in Hampton, Virginia, 1961. Ladies, that there is a God-ordained miracle.""My second favourite quote: ""You sir. You are the boss. You just have to act like one.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent. Perfect school movie afternoon material,"Just great, made me laugh a bit, cry a bit more, embarrassed for white supremacists, horror at the torment and aguish people of non white colour/ pure american/english experienced. Overall felt great for the depictation of achievment people can make when freedom to apply. This should be shown in schools on movie afternoon when they happen. Break down the ignorant predjuicial stereotypes and encourage the best out of people.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A movie that is very inspiring for me.,"Although this movie discusses the current fierce discrimination, it is not depressed or dull, and the dialogue between the characters is also very interesting. This is also what makes this film unique: there is no fierce resistance or march. Instead, they use strength and hard work to prove their worth in the face of denial and rebuke.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great movie!,"This is a really good movie, it has everything, it's a true story about genius minds, it has some suspense, nice romance and could be a lesson for many people! We grow up with to many prejudices, it's the time to let them go!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Transcends the ""true story"" genre","There's basically an entire genre called ""based on a true story""...those movies that inspire (and emotionally manipulate) you to cheer for things that already happened. This film may not transcend the genre, but it sure as hell nails it. The story flows, the characters work and the rhythms are not entirely predictable. I found myself misty at points, and watching with my daughter is a moment I will not soon forget. It may not win best picture, but I'm so grateful it is winning the box office.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good movie but lack of accuracy,"This is a good movie to watch. The 3 main characters existed and from them we now know that it was not like that.
That's the only regrets I have, lack of accuracy... like usual with hollywood we get false cry and wrong event...
I would have preferred they do something more realistic/true
Anyway we can say that this movie speak about these extraordinary women, and it was nice to watch",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A necessary story that moves and entertains,"Some stories take too long to be told, but when they are done right, they stay with us. Hidden Figures is one of them. For years, the story of these three women was forgotten, despite their crucial work at NASA in the space race. Finally, Hidden Figures gives these women the recognition they deserve, and it does so wisely: without excessive dramatization or forced emotion, letting the story speak for itself. It knows how to move us at the right moment, allowing humor and energy to flow naturally, so the message resonates without feeling imposed.Much of the credit goes to the leading trio: Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe. Their chemistry is impeccable, and each brings a unique personality to her character, making the story feel alive. Although it follows the classic biopic structure, its pace is dynamic, the dialogues feel natural, and the balance between drama and lighter moments makes it feel fresh and engaging.It doesn't rely on unexpected twists or aim to reinvent the genre, but it knows exactly how to tell its story effectively. Some scenes are designed to be emotional and may seem predictable, but the message is solid and delivered with the honesty needed to work without unnecessary embellishments.Ultimately, Hidden Figures is a film that inspires and leaves a mark. It doesn't stand out for being innovative, but for the story it rescues and how it presents it. With a brilliant cast and a powerful message, it's one of those films worth remembering and sharing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Great movie for all to watch, inspired by a true story","A true story worth being told and watched. Great performances from all but at times the over-dramatization makes segregation a bit too theatrical, which takes away some of its harshness rather than emphasize its injustice as it was undoubtedly intended. Still, a great movie for all audiences.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Inspiring...,"I'm disgusted its taken me over 2 years too see this.Hidden Figures is quite simply heart warming and full of joy. It isn't one of those feel good films which is bitter sweet with its message - it is pure happiness and relief in the point it is trying to convey.The inspiration women portrayed in this historical drama are played perfection by the leading ladies. Taraji P Henson's best performance, without a doubt
Out of the main three, her story is executed brilliantly and fully carried by Henson. Certainly Oscar winning deserving!It feels almost unnecessary to make any comments on either Octavia Spencer or Janelle Moane as they as both always captivating, of course, neither are any different here. A special mention must go to Kirsten Dunst, her screen time is limited, but her role is pivatol, Dunst manages to make an outstanding impression in the time she had, making an impression against the remarkable leads is certainly a win for her.Unlike many films similar to this, the story focuses on the central woman and their achievements, instead of focussing on the people who knocked them back. Solid script work allows some focus on those people but does not allow it to outshine the true meaning behind it. This is what gives it such an incredibly heart warming feel.As this is a film centering around NASA, it was inevitable space scenes would be featured, however, this high of quality effects was not expected. Firmly impressed on this front.It isn't perfect though, it is unfornante but on many occasions I found Jim Parson's to be utterly infuriating. I cannot conclude whether this was intentional or whether the matter of the fact is, Parson's is suited to the smaller screen, but it just did not work.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The other side story of the historic event!,"This film did not just represented the black people, but the women as well. Today we talk about discrimination against women, though this film is an example that it all had started way long ago, yet the struggle has not ended. Anyway, this is a biopic, a biopic of three women and their struggle not just being a black, but being women. When the nation was eager to send its first man to the space, there was some trouble within the team who are behind it to work together as one. Lots of inspiring events reveal how the history was made and the working culture was changed forever inside the NASA.The film was nominated for the Oscars in the three slots, but did not win any. That's fine, because I would prefer those real women to be recognised over what this film had achieved. All the three actresses were good. Their roles were unique from one another. Really a wonder film about three real persons in one film. Something rare in films to highlight their achievements equally. The personal life, as well as their professional was well briefed.The others like Kevin and Dunst in small part were also good. Directed by just a one film old filmmaker. He did good. The screenplay was adapted from the book of the same name. Deserved all the awards and praises it had received. After seeing how it had ended, a sequel could be possible. Mission Moon. I hope they would consider it! Seems a nice idea!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
