Why is this in two parts?,"The Hunger Games story continues with the third installation, Mockingjay. And it's about as padded and needlessly long as every other two-parter we've had since the studio executives came up with this money-grabbing monstrosity of an idea.Not to say you shouldn't see this one if you've liked the previous Hunger Games films. This continues the story just fine. Jennifer Lawrence still shines as Katniss Everdeen. Her presence and talent hold us through even through scenes you instantly recognize as needless padding and waste of our money. The returning cast is also as talented as they've always been and most of the new characters are also casted without hitches. Julianne Moore is perhaps a bit too... Julianne Moore to play President Coin 100 percent convincingly, but she has certain presence as well, that cannot be denied.What bugs me is the story. The book itself was the weakest of the trilogy, though not by much, and it seems that its faults bleed into the film. Especially because the iron tight pace of the previous installations is thrown straight out of the window and we spent most of our time building up atmosphere. And building. And building. And... You get the point. There's very little bang for your buck here and even when something substantial happens, it simply lacks that edge.Plus, they had the perfect closing scene, and for some reason they decided to keep going for about five minutes. Trust me, you know where they should have ended it when you've seen the movie.This is a good movie. It still looks great, the main actors are brilliant and it has enough depth to impress through its story alone. I just wish they had had the integrity to go with one movie. It very well might have been the best Hunger Games movie of the three. It would have had two movies before it to build up momentum and steam. Instead it lifts up the pedal from the gas and decides to stroll over the finish line. Poor form, extremely poor form.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
My least favourite installment.,"Having put an end to The Hunger Games forever, President Alma Coin uses Katniss as a beacon for hope. A reluctant Katniss has only one thing on her mind, to save Peeta.I have to be honest, I have always struggled with this movie, it isn't bad, I just wish they could have got the story done in one go, I like the second part, I find this first half too fleshed out, it lacks any real content. It does get going, but later on, it's all build up for the second.The visuals are great, there are plenty of action sequences and explosions, and of course sets and costumes look great. Lawrence is very good once again, but the script doesn't offer her the range that Catching Fire did.Julianne Moore was excellent as President Coin I thought, very strong performance.I did enjoy that scene where Peeta turned, having been absent for most of the movie, it was good to see him put to good use.I liked that there was a message at the end for Philip Seymour Hoffman, RIP.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Dull as dull can be,"Like watching paint dry. Boring to a mind-numbing degree. How many times can we see Katniss be horrified and/or emotionally distraught? Maybe the filmmakers thought they were adding depth to their characters. Well, they were wrong. Instead we, the audience, sit through one scene after another in which really nothing happens at all. This whole thing could have easily been compressed down to 40 minutes and then we could have had the rest of the book as the rest of the film. This felt very much like they were stretching it out so they could make two movies - which is the new thing to do in Hollywood with these franchises. Not good storytelling.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sprint to a dull crawl,"Quickie Review:After the events of 75th Hunger Games, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is rescued and brought to District 13 where the rebellion is brewing. Now she must become the face of the rebellion as both sides use propaganda against each other. Meanwhile, Katniss is overwhelmed by balancing her responsibility to the people of Panem with her desire to save Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Mockingjay Part 1 is strong when it comes to the acting talent involved and showing the behinds the scenes propaganda of war. However, the decision to split the story into two parts has really hurt this movie by making it feel incomplete and filled with overstretched melodrama. While it is not a complete failure, it may be better to hold off watching this movie till Part 2 is released.Full Review:I never read the books but I enjoyed the last two movies in the franchise, especially Catching Fire. While I can't say I was aching to go see Mockingjay Part 1, I was interested to know how the story progressed after the cliff-hanger of the last movie. I was concerned that splitting the story into two parts may have been a detrimental choice, unfortunately my concerns were legitimate.I know I'm coming off really negative but there are definitely some gems in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss and Donald Sutherland as President Snow, were the best part of the movie. Watching them clash and play strategic moves against each other was intriguing. The rest of the cast do a good job in showing how they have been affected and changed by this war. This is the first time we see the world outside of the actual Hunger Games and District 12, which helped enrich this movie's universe. Uniquely we get see how propaganda plays an important role in the war. I can't remember the last war movie that delved into that aspect. On top of that, these propaganda pieces were very moving thanks to the rage fueled words of Katniss and the fear mongering of Snow.A lot of the problems for this movie stem from the fact we are spending 2hrs on half a story. This led to us having an entire movie where Katniss keeps crying and moping about either Peeta or the people of District 12 being dead. The feeling that the movie is overstretched is only compounded by how several scenes are just a rehash of a previous scene, for example the recording of a propaganda (3 times) and multiple scenes per character sulking about the people suffering. Look I'm not heartless, I understand those are devastating things to happen to a person, but we want to see the story move forward. I can honestly say that apart from Katniss becoming the face of the rebellion, there is no significant plot development since Catching Fire. There is all this slow build up but that's all it is, a build up to an end that is unsatisfying. Essentially this is a 2hr preview ad for Mockingjay Part 2, and quite frankly I felt mad about this when I left the cinema, and that doesn't happen often.The pathetic cash-grab moves by studios to split the movie into two parts is the root of all the problems for Mockingjay Part 1. To fill the run time the movie is stuffed full with melodrama without much weight to make you care for long. All the momentum that the previous two movies had built has now come to a dull crawl. I'd recommend skipping this movie till Part 2 is released and hopefully enjoy a more complete story.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A realistic drama in dystopia,"This is not the mediocre first two movies that were a fun-filled joy ride in the spirit of Running Man, Battle Royale or Blood of Heroes. This is a realistic version instead, with a character-motive driven plot. Unlike the first two films this one actually matters. I hope the creators of this film are proud of their accomplishment. Instead of a cheesy thrill ride we have been introduced to the realities of war and rebellion and we were given good acting, good screen writing and characters we can identify with and care about. After watching hundreds of movies in the post apocalyptic genre this one stands out as significantly better than the others, especially the first two films. Thank you for making the Hunger Games series into something meaningful.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Two Hour Preview of What to Expect in the Final Movie.,"You may want to save your money and time seeing this movie and wait for the last installment to come out next year, instead. Aside from Jennifer Lawrence, this movie offers nothing more than just a long and tiring tale of preparation for an impending rebellion.Readers shouldn't get surprised: Mockingjay's first half chronicles District 13's efforts to groom Katniss as their heroine against the ruthless ruling Capitol. The process of transforming her into what they call the 'Mockingjay', a symbol of revolution, is engaging enough to ignite interest, but only up to a point, when long speeches and depictions of what the Hunger Games' downfall has caused, have almost become the only few things eating up the biggest slice of the movie's airtime pie. There is nothing much to see here, and while its refreshing to finally see the landscapes to have finally shifted away from the arenas, lack of action eventually makes the scenes that are almost only showing the events in the confinements, hard to appreciate, not to mention difficult to extract sense from.Fortunately, it has Jennifer Lawrence, and that alone, is enough to pull the entire movie away whenever it leans toward making the audience fall to sleep. Jennifer's charm proves to be the biggest asset of this movie, and she alone, singularly saves the film from being a total nonsense. Toward the end, it isn't clear whether the makers of the film have made their point (aside from making more money of course) in splitting the book into two movies. This first half only presents a preview of what to happen next in the other half, only stretched into two hours of tiring sameness and boring exchanges of bland dialogues. The new characters are interesting yeah, but I'm not sure if anyone of them has offered something more than Lawrence, to spark further interest. Well, at least we can take comfort from the fact that the last movie next year will certainly offer a lot more, gripping action and drama, and that's really something to look forward to.Mockingjay Pt.1 falls below the heights reached by the previous two films. Minus Lawrence, this film is a real bore, and its hard to seek something more than her to recommend. I give this film 6 of my 10 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mockingjay would've been a rushed mess as one movie,"When it was first announced that Mockingjay was going to be split into  two movies, I gawked. It's one book. How can there possibly be enough  to fill two movies? It didn't help that my sister also found it weird,  having read the book. She couldn't see any obvious place for the split.  Despite what feels like everyone else on the internet is saying, I  actually support the split now. Mockingjay marks a massive tonal shift  in the franchise, so it would have been a bit jarring introducing this  tonal shift for the final movie, leaving you no time to settle into the  new status quo left from Catching Fire. The biggest reason for my  support though is how rushed everything would have been.  When a book is adapted into a movie, there are certain time constraints  to be taken into account. That inevitably means things are cut, which  leaves many fans unhappy with the final product. With Mockingjay they  decided to give it time to flesh out the characters; give everyone a  bit of limelight, expand on various elements in the book, and just  generally make sure it doesn't frenetically jump from scene to scene or  cut out important plot points. Having now scene Mockingjay Part 1, I  can't imagine it being compressed into half the running time without  sacrificing the emotional resonance or rushing through everything.  The emotional resonance is the big selling point of Mockingjay. For  some it might be seen as boring, drawn-out melodrama, but for me it  made Mockingjay a darker, more harrowing movie than the previous two,  which says a lot about a franchise hinging on a fight-to-the-death  between children in order to keep the tyrannical dictatorship in place.  Katniss has lost her district, lost Peeta, and now lives in hiding with  a group of rebels intent on overthrowing the Capitol. To not dwell on  how that affects her and the people around her would have been a  massive misstep. The franchise needed to slow down and focus on the  characters.  To say it's only half a movie is misinformation as well. It feels like  a complete movie, at least more complete than Catching Fire ever did.  As I mentioned, Peeta is kept prisoner by the Capitol, and he's being  used as a propaganda weapon in response to Katniss' propaganda by the  rebels. The whole plot of the movie is about this cat and mouse of  propaganda as the two opposing sides try to get an upper hand on the  people of Panem. The big final climax feels like the big final climax  of a story, bringing this cat and mouse to an end. It's final moments  are a resolution to the beginning and middle, and in that respect it  absolutely has all three acts. Of course it has a cliffhanger moment  right before the credits to segue into the next movie, but so did  Catching Fire (and Desolation of Smaug, and Fast & Furious 6, and every  Marvel movie etc. etc.)  Everything else ticks all the right boxes as well; the acting is  top-notch, especially from Jennifer Lawrence and Philip Seymour Hoffman  (with a little memoriam for him in the credits). The visuals are on the  nail. District 12 is now depicted in ruins, the CGI of the various  ships and futuristic cityscape of the Capitol is flawless. There was  also some fantastic use of CGI on Josh Hutcherson to make him look  progressively thinner and beaten up as the movie goes along, showing  the torture he must have been enduring. The musical score is fantastic,  with the Mockingjay theme coming well and truly into it's element, as  well as a fully fledged song that brings the rebellion to full strength  in the propaganda war.  Mockingjay proves that milking extra movies out of a franchise doesn't  necessarily have to be a bad thing (looking at you, Desolation of  Smaug). It slows the franchise down and gives you time to breathe  before the big conclusion next year, injecting plenty of heartfelt  emotion to the whole situation, fleshing out the world, developing the  characters etc. However it's not without it's higher-octane moments.  There's a number of action scenes despite it's calmer narrative, which  expand what was in the book to blistering effect (the fantastically  suspenseful climax is apparently just a few lines in the book, largely  glossed over). It's tense, unpredictable, emotional, yet has it's  light-hearted moments. I give Mockingjay Part 1 a very good 8/10. It's  made me very excited for next year when I can marathon the whole  franchise in one go.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I don't care actually, I'm here to watch (enjoy) the movie(s) not read why these decisions were made. And waiting a full year to release the next part made it sort of necessary to rewatch it..It simply feels like you watched the trailer for the second part, filler. Or to make a dramatic opening to the second movie. MockingJay could have easily be one movie. The first one could have been an hour and the second one two hours (both can be less).There is nothing really special I can remember like there is in the other movies. Even back when I was a HUGE Hunger Games fan..!This movie is even skippable if you want to do a marathon or just watch them again! It's like nothing remarkable happens.But yet again we were used to half of the film in the arena, this just showed the other side of the dystopia,

Boring but not bad,"In general, the drama part of the story is the movie. It is off by the action. Again new characters were included. The film is not able to spend permanent staff.

Decent but it needed to be completed.,"While still a good movie, Mockingjay Part 1 was clearly only a portion of a story and the actual film suffered for it. Everything about the movie was done really well. The special effects and action sequences were top notch and the continually increased budget is evident here especially. The acting was fantastic and the setting was detailed and felt incredibly real. Even all of the little emotional elements delivered perfectly. The real problem is that, as I previously mentioned, it's only half of a story. The movie builds to something that never really occurs and the void in action will be even more obvious when the extreme action in the next film comes to fruition. Yes, I understand that the Lord of the Rings films do something similar. The difference is that those films manage to build towards their individual climax without actually failing to develop the overall story arc. I think Francis Lawrence tried to accomplish that with this film but the source material wasn't made for that to be done, where as the Lord of the Rings movies were. Mockingjay Part 1 is still a good film and ultimately will be incredibly important in setting the stage for what should be the best film of the franchise but it is still incomplete.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Transition Episode,"This episode serves to move the story along - and does it well. It is served by a great cast : we're happy to see the now familiar faces and some new characters are introduced with good casting. The high point of the movie is the usage of propaganda from both sides of the conflict - this will what one will remember from this installment of the series While it is a good episode for the Hunger Games saga, it is not as exciting as the first two - the action that gripped us is simply not there. Also, definitely do not start Hunger Games with this movie; I imagine it would be virtually impossible to enjoy if you don't know the characters and context. Not a disappointment but definitely can't wait to have a stronger episode next!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Is there such thing as a set-up movie?,"I had never heard the term ""set-up movie"" before today. There has definitely been a trend of splitting up a story into multiple movies. These movies don't have a beginning-middle-end the same way other movies do but at the very least there's some progress.The problem with the Mockingjay Pt 1 is not that it's boring or poorly made. In fact, there is a lot of excitement in this movie. The problem is that from beginning to end there is hardly anything that changes. If you look at where the characters are in the beginning and where they are in the end there isn't much that's changed except for what happens in the very end. Katniss has been doing things but we haven't seen much of the effects of her actions.I didn't dislike this movie that much despite it's slow beginning. I just can't give this my seal of approval when I left the theater feeling like I saw half a movie. By the time the story gets its payoff my memory of this movie will be worn-off.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I don't understand the bad reviews. The movie was good and different than the first 2.,I honestly do not understand the bad reviews. I thought that the movie was really good. The acting was perfect. Everyone did a wonderful job. Jennifer Lawrence is very convincing. I loved Julianne Moore as President Alma Coin - she did a great job representing this cold and manipulative character. I think the first part was a great built-up. There was tension and some action enough to prepare you for the 2nd part. I think people are expecting Hunger Games 1 and 2 and this is why they get disappointed. This part was more about building up the tension and the frustration.

Greed Hollywood,"The Huger Games has clearly grown up in Mockingjay. Social criticism is much stronger than previous movies. Films theme is much more brooding and ominous than before. But that doesn't save this picture totally. Dividing the movie in two parts is clearly a huge mistake. Many scene are way too long and some of them are clearly just vain. Topmost feeling is just making more money. It would be much better to make only one movie instead of two. One three hour long movie is much easier to keep together, than two over length movies. It is clearly Hollywood's greed to capitalize on movie (and book) series fans. How many times more the audience will accept that? Jennifer Lawrece is great at her role as Katniss, but somehow Josh Hutcherson as Peeta's role as brainwashed puppet doesn't convince. There is a lot of good elements in this movie so it is a shame that Hollywood want just get few more money from the fans. Mockingjay part 1 is despite that quite eligible movie that end up in green money making. Good movie ends up to mediocre action flick and that is shame.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Too Long and Disappointing,"After the bombing of District 13, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) finally accepts the request of President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and her adviser Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and becomes the symbol of the rebellion, the Mockingjay. However, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the Capitol broadcasts a message of Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) live contradicting Katniss. She believes that his life is in danger and convinces President Coin to rescue Peeta and the others Victors. But she has a surprise with his reaction.""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" is a disappointing movie too long for a short story with a lead character hysterical and too sentimental. In the other two movies, the plot was tense and full of action. Katniss is irritating with her reactions and despite the destruction of the Districts by Snow's army, her major concern is with Peeta. Prim's attitude leaving the bunker to save her cat is ridiculous and why Peeta's broadcasting is live is hard to understand.

Propped artifice,"This is the third time I'm going to note about one of these that they're a product of the most blatant cynicism where Hollywood ""sponsors"" pretend to educate about things they don't believe in and have consigned beyond the sphere of having any relevance.This is obvious here in a revolution against oppressive authority that can only happen with a video crew tagging along and turning it into film, with spontaneous speeches and reactions because the heroine is being paced through scenes where she can be filmed in them.Underneath it all of course we're supposed to see real destruction, pain, oppression, but in context of this cartoony world what is it but more unreal and distanced? No contrast escapes the mawkishness; nature is pure, democracy a drab necessity, oppression a blatant evil.And however much value it purports to place on the power of image, the truth of spontaneity and so on, it ends up doing the opposite, image that has no real power, spontaneity that has been staged, the real thing beyond anyone's grasp and care; it's enough for images to be stickied on a narrative that justifies the means.In this sense it's disastrous work that closes portals in the imagination, but then again I'm not fussed; teens and preteens will outgrow it like we did the inanities of our time and grow to find value in something that chronicles the hardships of making sense without the contrivance.If I could nudge them in that direction it would be Harmony Korine, a film like Spring Breakers; a film without pretense of an important message, whose truly radical importance is a balancing it demands of the viewer between the colorful urge to revel and truth of its value.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A decent finale that struggles to maintain the momentum,"The hunger games: mockingjay attempts to wrap up the dystopian saga, but it doesn't quite match the intensity and excitement of the first two films. The decision to split the final book into two movies seems to have affected the pacing, making parts of the story feel stretched out and less engaging. While there are still some suspenseful moments and emotional beats, the film lacks the action and intrigue that made the hunger games and catching fire so compelling. The darker tone and focus on political maneuvering might appeal to some fans, but it often feels like it's dragging. It's a decent film for those invested in the series, but it doesn't have the same energy or thrill as its predecessors, making it a somewhat lackluster conclusion.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Character driven to an extreme,"Mockingjay is a study in charisma and political leadership, and a text-film on acting.Donald Sutherland, Julliane Moore and Jennifer Lawrence present three clear variations on the theme of ""How Leaders Lead."" This, along with a somewhat heavy handed study on propaganda are the movies primary attractions.This is not the kind of action film audiences of the first two ""Hunger Games"" movies enjoyed. There is a fair amount of fighting, but this movie is about charisma: Who has it, how its used and what it means. At this, ""Mockingjay Part 1"" is brilliant, primarily because Jennifer Lawrence HAS charisma. At several points in the movie, watching Lawrence draw me into her Katniss Everdean, I thought of politicians who were able to evoke passion in the populace. Lawrence has that ability in large quantities.I also found the direction of the film to be outstanding. A particularly well-crafted scene occurs early when the Rebel's leadership are asked to suggest moments when Katniss was most effective at touching the spirits of the populace. This scene not only approaches a breach of the fourth wall, it could have caused viewers to suspend their ""suspension of disbelief."" But through precise timing and a brilliant performance by Woody Harrelson this scene succeeds in getting the audience involved interactively as we are invited to think of those moments from previous movies and nod our heads as we sub-vocalize our ""Uh-Huh's.""This movie is about the why and the how of making of ""The Mockingjay-the symbol of the revolution.""

"Sad, Pathetic & Lame - Corporate Kleptocracy Money Grab","Boring to point I got up and went to back of theater to check IMDb on my Tablet to see what was I missing. Obviously I was lacking somehow and must be missing something I figured with all the rage around this movie.What I found was it was not me but the movie just does not connect, has no draw and feels like just a corporate money scheme. I feel cheated, dirty, like a stupefied sucker and want to take a shower. I get better vibes from used car sales lots than this movie as well the industry of late.There were some good movies this year; but all that has come out pre- Holidays have been lame to terrible and I see a lot of movies. Maybe the ""Interview"" had real potential compared to this tripe I have seen here and in other recent releases of movies.I watch a wide genre of movies and am open to diverse visual and story arts but this and the recent movies are so terrible literally. I am finding better more engaging shows on TV than what the theaters offer nowadays. Heck they can not be original and rehash same old stories; well okay that might be fine if the surpassed the originals and yet even special effects seem at best B movie compared to the epics of the 60's and such.Dang maybe they just need to go back to Spaghetti Westerns; at least they were entertaining somewhat....All I feel is fleeced; again by the movie industry and it is getting old. But all they seem to care about is cha-ching, cha-ching, cha- ching. Guess the 4th Quarter is more important than their long term outlook as a industry. More people are catching on and just say screw it and why theaters are more and more empty.We know the technology, actor resources and financial might of these studios more than ever and how they are refusing to do the real work it takes to put something out that is worthy out dollars. No wonder so many people seek other media sources over theater these days; with ticket cost outrageous, $2 in snacks costing $20 for stale muck, floors your feet stick to when walking and seating that needs a biohazard warning label.

I don't really like the fact that she - Katniss - is not decided whom she loves or not, or at least if she would be capable of making a difference as in love and caring about one of the boys.

A Snooze Fest..,I don't know where to start. Being a fan of this franchisee i had so many expectations but the movie is so slow that even if you go out and grab a cup of coffee you will come back to see that the movie has not gone anywhere. I admire Jennifer Lawrence but this is probably her weakest performance till date. She has sounded screechy and devoid of emotions for most parts which is a surprise considering what a fine actress she is.The movie is unbelievably stretched out that it gets to ridiculous proportions as you start praying for the movie to end.The Mockingjay should have been a one part movie but as we all know for commercial interests a 45 minutes plot has been dragged out for two painful hours. Only Jennifer Lawrence has hogged the lion share of screen time while other actors like Woody Harrelson are criminally wasted. The direction lack vision. The editing is probably the weakest part of the movie. The story of the movie can be told in 5 lines and they have made a two hours movie out of this. The high rating for this movie is surprising to see.,,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Emotionally and Socially Powerful...The Best One Yet,"Since taking on Hunger Games, Lawrence has arguably become Hollywood's most successful and revered performer, blowing up box-offices and frequenting award stages. As MjP1's Katniss, a character burdened with being the hope AND the cause of Panem's war, she carries the responsibility placed on her with complexity, strength, fear and heartbreak. Add in the film's exploration of faith and fear, and its criticizing political spins of all kinds, and it becomes clear: the Hunger Games franchise is a cinematic force to be reckoned with. To shove this aside with the other YA films is grossly inaccurate; MjP1 proves that this is among the premiere SciFi franchises of this era. We catch up with Katniss in underground District 13, reluctantly leading the rebellion against President Snow and the Capitol. The story is skillfully told, with the power of fear palpable in the oppressed 99%, and the fear of power creeping up in the 1%. It's a solemn affair, to be sure, but not without its moments of levity, solidly exhibited in the high-caliber actors that are the strength of the series. Lawrence, Banks, Sutherland, and Hoffman are all standouts, with the nice addition of Moore as a political player with dubious motives. Like Harry Potter's second-to-last film, MjP1 is essentially a glorified first act to a two-part story. This will leave some wanting, especially in the areas of action and closure. However, with the amount of passion, scenery-chewing, and complex commentary within, it left me more than satisfied, while excited about the next one. Emotionally powerful and socially conscious, MjP1 is a massive step up in the zeitgeist-y franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It worked for me,"I read all the books and there were changes in the movie, but I think all were good changes. Some less necessary characters are missing and others, like Effie and Snow are expanded upon from what was in the book. The set up appears perfect for what comes next and the sets and action scenes looked really good. I think the slower pacing of the characters is very important in this movie, because of all the changes that are happening with every one of them. I like what this movie did to fill in the gaps of what we could know in the book, because we could only see what Katniss saw in the book. It gives me more to look forward to in each movie. I wonder how much Plutarch will need to change in the last sequel because Philip Seymour Hoffman didn't finish filming his parts before he died?

"No more games, no more story. Tedious and boring.","Unfortunately it seems that without the Games there is just no longer any point to this franchise and it just sinks into tedious bloodletting mediocrity. Katniss now comes over as mentally unstable and President Snow is simply an over-the-top homicidal lunatic. There is no way that even the pampered poseurs of Capitol (or whatever it is called I have now lost interest in the names) would put up with their leader's carrying out such murderous activities in their name. Yet, even with all of the bloodletting going on, none of it visualised of course, this movie is a bore from start to finish. It is an illogical bore too. Snow has gone from being a cold but efficiently ruthless ruler to a parody of a dictator deliberately setting up his own downfall. Instead of taking the opportunity to destroy the mockingjay, he decides to play into her hands by wasting a hospital (no spoiler needed as this is clearly shown in the trailer). Don't waste your money going to see this movie as there is nothing to learn about the events that will end in the second Mockingjay. You will be able to go and see MJ2 and pick up the storyline immediately. The feeling of 'something is missing' are all in this movie. How did all of this suddenly come about?

The film picks up after the events of Catching Fire, where the story continued with Katniss, our reluctant heroine from District 12 finally becomes the titular head of a growing rebellion against the Capitol through a series of propaganda videos. This time, the film is lesser on the action, explosions or heavy violence and chooses to focus on being a political drama that takes the themes of war and revolution to the next level instead.The Hunger Games has always been a character-driven story filled with meaningful themes by exploring real-world issues about rebellion, politics, conflicts, war, survival that ultimately stands out among the other Young Adult franchises. Katniss' several acts of defiance against the fascist Capitol government during the Hunger Games in the first two films have finally fan the flames of rebellion among the districts of Panem to take back their nation. While the country is on the verge of war, Katniss must also try to find a way to rescue Peeta and the rest of the tributes, who have been taken hostages, tortured and imprisoned by the Capitol.Throughout the years, the franchise has done a great job in showing us that Katniss is truly the Mockingjay - the symbol of hope and rebellion in Panem. The books are written in Katniss' point of view, but the movies have made the effort of showing us other events largely unseen by her to allow us to gain a better understanding of the events that are happening in the film, such as the political meetings or discussions of President Snow or the control room of the games in past films. Mockingjay Part 1 takes time to give us a closer look at the beginnings of war by showing us some details about the uprisings that are taking place in other districts. From the brutal public executions, aerial bombing of cities and threatening speeches by President Snow himself, people are suffering and dying. The film also shows how easily people can be manipulated by media, by showing us that the people of Panem (Capitol and all the other districts) are easily influenced by what they see and hear, especially on TV. However, the ways the Capitol uses media to control all of Panem, it also shows that the rebels can use the same strategy to fight back as well. Both sides is using propaganda as a form of psychological warfare.The film essentially tries to tell the audience that there are no perfect governments or political systems. Political ideologies always fail in reality because of the greed of men who only seek wealth or power. In Mockingjay Part 1, we see how Katniss is being used by the rebel leaders to fight the war. There's even one particular scene where Peeta asks Katniss whether she truly knows the people she's working for, letting us in doubt whether the rebels of District 13 are fighting for the right cause or it's just another Capitol in the making. Once again, Jennifer Lawrence pulls another strong performance as Katniss as she's the one who gets the most character development in this film. With Peeta captured by the Capitol for the entire film, Liam Hemsworth gets more screen time this time for his character, Gale after being left out of the story in the first two films. The film also introduces new characters, especially District 13's rebel leader, President Coin who will soon becomes one of the antagonist that Katniss need to face in Part 2. Elizabeth Banks' character, Effie serves as comic relief this time around, but her character also shows that not all people in the Capitol are vain and oppressive as we think they are.However, Mockingjay Part 1 doesn't feel like a complete movie and fails to reach the heights of its predecessors. It's the first half of the final book adapted to film, which doesn't really provide any conclusions, it doesn't feel like it has a self-contained plot as none of the character arcs are fully resolved. The film keeps on setting the necessary pieces for the final epic showdown between the districts and Capitol but there's nothing significant happening throughout the film as all the relevant plot twists, the actual fight is in part 2. The film spends most of its time to show us the beginnings of war but couldn't provide further details on why the rebels in District 13 have so many resources and doesn't look malnourished compared with people from other districts. In my opinion, it felt unnecessary to split the final chapter into two parts as many of the scenes actually hurts the pace of the movie. It could be a far better film with a run time of probably 3 hours or so. We are all excited for the story's conclusion and yet we were asked to be patient and wait for next year's Part 2 instead.

Minor Stuff goes on in a bunker for 2 hours: The Movie,"I came out of the movie theater annoyed, and I felt like I wasted my time. The acting wasn't very good, and the plot felt like it was moving at an extremely slow pace. The action scenes were cheesy, and nothing actually happened besides rescuing the captured tributes. This being shortened into a one hour movie in my opinion would have been much better.The movie should be renamed, 'Minor Stuff goes on in a bunker for 2 hours: The Movie'I really hope the next HG movie makes up for this one.

Exists To Only Set The Stage For The Finale,"While the splitting of the final novel in the Harry Potter film series was more than justified by the adaptations that followed, it also gave these major Hollywood studios another idea of how to milk any franchise for all its worth, thus resulting in few unnecessary expansions of final chapters of many other franchises into two films & The Hunger Games series is the latest to join this particular league.While I wasn't completely won over by the first two films in this franchise & watched them with half-hearted interest, the films weren't as terrible as I expected. Both instalments did make up for some nice lightweight entertainment & fabulously exhibited the screen power of Jennifer Lawrence but the only reason why The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 exists is to set up the stage for the upcoming finale.Set after the events of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Mockingjay - Part 1 continues the story of Katniss Everdeen who finds herself in District 13 after being rescued from the 75th Hunger Games arena which she destroyed in the last chapter. Very much aware of the mass riots that has risen against the Capitol, Everdeen reluctantly agrees to become the symbol of rebellion in order to unite all districts against one enemy & also tries to rescue Peeta from his captivity.Directed by Francis Lawrence, Mockingjay - Part 1 lacks many elements that made the first two instalments click so well. The action is very much missing here, the story feels longer than its actual runtime, nothing much happens in the movie plot-wise & it's pretty evident that the idea of splitting it into two parts was indeed a stupid move. Jennifer Lawrence still delivers another fine performance while the contribution from both Julianne Moore & Philip Seymour Hoffman is a welcome one.On an overall scale, there isn't much to talk about The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 for it's a definite downgrade in almost all aspects when compared to its predecessors, carries over the usual political themes of the series but never does anything with it, is predictable from start to finish, is stretched beyond its threshold point & even has Lawrence exhibiting signs of weariness in her given role. Easily the weakest of the three instalments so far, Mockingjay - Part 1 may not be a worthy sequel but it nonetheless succeeds in setting the stage for the grand finale.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It should have been only one film,"There seems to be a fashion for splitting final movies of a film series into two parts. I understand some of the reasons for this. Often in a book series, the earlier books include a lot of thoughts and internal conflict in the protagonist, which has to be portrayed by a few carefully selected images in a film. Whereas the last book is often full of actions and it is difficult in a film to decide how to cut any of them. Nevertheless, the film makers should take these hard decisions. The problem with splitting to two movies is that they are inevitably splitting what is in essence a single story. Stories have an important structure. Splitting them destroys this. The first part becomes an introduction and some of the middle. The second part has the rest of the middle and the conclusion. Basically neither have a proper structure. The result is a loss of impact. I have read the books and Mockingjay is a great and thought-provoking finale to the series. The film Mockingjay Part 1 worries me. It wasn't impactful. It didn't even work as a great trailer to part 2. To split this story into two parts has been I think a grave mistake.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wary of a split film?,"""Nothing happens!!!""""2-Hour Exposition!!!""""SET-UP!!!""If you're hesitant to see Mockingjay because of these claims, understand that they're both reasonable and misleading. Misleading because, if you're not expecting an action-fest, the plot is actually full. There's nothing wrong with the story itself, and the ""poor pacing"" claim is false. Although there are fewer developments here than there are in Catching Fire, they all definitely require the length of time it took them to develop. There are many scenes in this film that are similar to scenes in other good films of the same genre, and most of them elapse the same amount of time.But the claims of uneventfulness are reasonable because its execution is lacking. The movie is actually composed of equal parts subtext, exposition, and action. Meaning that the screenplay routinely cycles a scene that portrays a strong conflict, followed by characters verbally exploring that conflict, and concluding that conflict by taking an action. If the movie was perfect, these parts would have equal weight, because, since the story is less action- oriented than the previous films, the subtext and exposition are more important to creating the story. Unfortunately, the action is shot much better than the exposition is, and the exposition is shot so similarly to the subtext that they swallow one another up.As a small example, in one scene, Katniss attempts to engage in conversation with a character only to learn that he is a mute. You understand why he is a mute immediately, and its significant, and the story immediately becomes weightier and more intense because of this revelation, but the film treats the revelation as though nothing happened. Where other films would have a change in music or lighting or tone or direction to highlight significance, Mockingjay simply continues. Then, a little while later, dialogue is spoken that elaborates on this revelation. The line is delivered well, but because the audience has already picked up on the meaning, the mood that should have been created by this line is dulled.There are a disappointingly large number of sequences like this: a small, signicant development happens, in plot, or character, or overall implication, and it should change the audience's understanding and appreciation for the story - but the film treats it as though everything is progressing, as though it's just another step toward something big happening in an action sequence. The best way to fix this would have been to adapt a more Gary Ross- esque direction style to the non-action scenes - give them a different look, give them their own mood, and leave them room to breathe. Overall, Mockingjay is still a good film, and a very good story. But unfortunately, many of the things that make the story good are buried.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A 2 Hour Trailer.,"I'm going to keep this review short and simple. A lot of the other reviews I've been reading says that this film was disappointing and not really all that good. I thought is was pretty good for what it was meant to do. It didn't have all of the edge of your seat thrills and action I like in a movie, but to me it really didn't need it. I think this movie was just preparing fans for the ""Mockingjay - Part 2"". Now, I've never read any of the books, I'm just going off of what I have seen in theaters and so far I'm impressed. I can say I like this film because I have seen the first two and I know what is going on so I wasn't at all disappointed.One thing I don't like what people are doing with the ""Hunger Games"" films is comparing it with ""Divergent"". I've never seen ""Divergent"", but I know ""The Hunger Games"" isn't like ""Divergent"". I know both of them take place in a post apocalyptic era, but I don't think they are the same. For one, Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence) didn't need some played out clichéd macho man helping and guiding her through out the film. Katniss was always able to hold her own. That's one of the things I like about Jennifer Lawrence's character.Now, I know a lot of people saw the first two ""Hunger Games"" films and didn't like this third one, but if you haven't seen the first two films do so before you watch this one and judge it for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If we burn, you burn!","The Hunger Games has now entered into its penultimate instalment with Mockingjay Part 1, splitting the final novel into two films and shaking up the formula of the series. It has been met with some negative reception, but hell, I liked it and see it on par with the first Hunger Games film, continuing the story while keeping it themes about the media. Mockingjay changes up The Hunger Games into a sci-fi war film as Katniss has to be for the face of the revolution against the Capital and President Snow. The themes of media image, personality and manipulation are still present and this time worked in the context of war propaganda and media warfare, playing a big part in the fight for hearts and minds. The cast is for the most part is excellent, particularly Jennifer Lawrence as the traumatised victim forced to become the face of the rebellion, as her actions in the previous films have had unintended consequences. But Liam Hemsworth as Gale was very stiff compared to the rest of the cast, not being able to match their standards.There are changes from the novel, some are simply cutting out the fat like the hunting and the daily regimen of living and showing some scenes that we did not get to see in the novel. There are a few moments added to intense tension to scenes and a few characters replace other ones: but on the whole Part 1 is mostly faithful adaptation of the first half of the novel.Director Francis Lawrence continue to be a solid director with the exploring of the ruins of District 12 being very haunting and the big action sequence, showing the war. But the portrayal of President Coin (Julianne Moore) was not shown to be as a cold or hostile to Katniss as she was in the novel, saving it for the fourth film. This is a minor issue but I pictured Coin wearing her hair in the bun. James Newton Howard raises his game and gives us the best music score in the series so far.Mockingjay Part 1 is a solid film that fans of the series will be pleased with.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

However, you will walk out of the movie eagerly awaiting the fourth installment.Most of the actors that made the first two movies great made it in this installment.

I am disappointed,"I am so disappointed of the movie. And that's because there happens close to nothing. At nearly every point you notice it's stretched for making out of one book two movies. At the beginning I liked it, because many parts of the book found their way into the movie. But I realised transferring the story of a book 1:1 into a movie isn't that good.(NO SPOILER) As an example they need about 5-10 minutes just to go down a staircase, back upwards because ""missing"" something and down again. And nothing really happens. All the time absolutely no excitement rose in me and I just got bored. And I am pretty sure this should be a part where your heartbeat is meant to been rising.Sure there are some nice and decent scenes but most of the stuff is just lame. In the book it works but clearly not in the Movie (plus the showdown of the book is missing because of the split).But at least I enjoyed the screenplay of Josh Hutcherson and Philip Seymour Hoffman, which lifted the Movie ""up"" to 3 Stars. I hope the last one gets back on the level of the first two movies.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Most Daring, Rawest, Thought-Provoking and Darkest Installment of 'The Hunger Games' Yet","When Lionsgate announced back in 2012 that they were splitting the final book in the Hunger Games trilogy into two parts, people were skeptical at how they were going to make them a cohesive and alluring final two films. Considering the lukewarm reaction to the final novel 'Mockingjay' by Suzanne Collins and the less than encouraging history of film adaptions being split into more than one film (Harry Potter, Twilight and The Hobbit), the odds weren't exactly in this penultimate chapter's favour. However, two years on, it looks like director Francis Lawrence defied the odds and Lionsgate has another winner. 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1′ is the most daring, thought-provoking, rawest, darkest yet humorous film in the Hunger Games franchise filled with powerful performances from its new and returning cast members as well as an intelligently and beautifully written screenplay by Peter Craig and Danny Strong.The film immediately opens to a powerful and haunting scene, mainly due to Jennifer Lawrence's stunning portrayal of our heroine Katniss Everdeen, that sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Katniss is no longer forcing smiles in flaming dresses or dropped into a televised reality game show wearing latex wet suits all designed to appeal and appease the Capitol audiences, she's now hidden underground in the bleak and gray District 13, a district that months prior, none of the characters even knew had still existed since its 'alleged' obliteration during 'The Dark Days'.One of the biggest surprises is that 'Mockingjay – Part 1′ doesn't feel like a 'Hunger Games' film that we've come to know in the previous two installments, more so than how many felt about the third book to the previous two books before it. It almost feels like a complete reboot of the entire franchise. The film is almost entirely set in District 13; besides the short but poignant visits to District 12, 8 and little cutaways to scenes outside of Katniss's perspective in the Capitol, 5, 7 and 11. There are no more ""games"" – which means no more reapings, no more chariots, or any of that lead up. Mockingjay has well and truly reinvented the franchise to reveal what 'The Hunger Games' series at its core is really all about and gives us a shocking and horrifying portrayal of war in Panem and how media manipulation is used through the use of propaganda videos (""propos"") in battle to control the populous.The film's split was not a problem at all. Out of the three novels in the Hunger Games series, 'Mockingjay' was easily the novel that required a split to fully flesh out the characters and to give justice to their arcs. There is a clear objective at the beginning of the film, laid out by our heroine and by the end, that objective is solved but also sets up another plot line that will most definitely be followed up on in next year's final chapter 'Mockingjay – Part 2′. The way the creative team are handling the split feels slightly like a television show – you get 24 episodes in a season, and that is usually split into two with a mid season break in between. Part 1 ends with a bang, it has a conclusion and resolution, but you know the story isn't over just yet.Overall, 'Mockingjay – Part 1′ manage to overcomes its obstacles to become another dark, epic and very chapter in the unstoppable 'Hunger Games' franchise. The film will surely make back its entire budget for both films alone within the first week of release alone. If 'Mockingjay – Part 1′ is anything to go by, than next year's 'Mockingjay – Part 2′ will be an absolute treat as we follow Katniss and her squad in their final journey to stop the Capitol. And I can't freaking wait.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
As expected,"Considering the fact that this movie is obviously a stepping stone bridging the gap between the first two movies and the last, I find it hard to understand why some are so disappointed that it's a bit of a cliffhanger. Then again, maybe I don't mind because I've already read the books and know how the story will end. For the record: I have yet to watch a movie based on a book I've read and found it better. None have even come close to being almost as good, except for The Hunger Games trilogy. And since Suzanne Collins' writing is simply amazing, a film adaptation that's almost as good is definitely a great achievement. (Note: I have to exclude the first movie from this praise because I found it a bit disappointing.) For fear of turning this into a book review, I'll be brief. the author of this trilogy is no doubt talented. she covered the subject matter beautifully and managed to make it exciting and appealing to both teens and adults. The character development in her books makes them believable, and makes you feel like you personally know them. I'd definitely advise everyone to read the books, and to watch the movies by extension.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"When Katniss destroys the games, she goes to district 13 after District 12 is destroyed. She meets President Coin who convinces her to be the symbol of rebellion, while trying to save Peeta from the Capitol.Producers are making money with the saga so why not split one book into two movies? Twilight did it, Harry Potter did it and The Hunger Games is doing it as well. I am not a huge fan of the first Hunger Games movie, but I loved Catching Fire. It was a very smooth and well directed movie by Francis Lawrence; who is taking over once again for MockingJay. At the end of Catching Fire you were literally burning to see Katniss and everyone go against the Capitol and kill them all. Actually I was pumped to see what will happen. Unfortunately, MockingJay Part 1 is just an extended trailer for Part 2, nothing interesting and relevant happen until the last 20 minutes of the movie. They are trying to stretch the events of one book into several movies but the thing is that even the tiny details are not that interesting and exciting to watch. This film deals with how you run a rebellion against an evil empire, giving endless political and motivational speeches, this on purpose to be filmed for propaganda. It's not enough to keep the viewers check in through the whole run time of the film. However, I liked the fact that this film takes The Hunger Games to another level as you have to think things through all this propaganda and point of views, the political intrigue is good. It approaches the story and The Hunger Games world from another angle, different from the first two movies. Nonetheless, the shaky cam is back from the first movie and there is not much action aside this trailer scene where Katniss is shooting an arrow to a jet. Jennifer Lawrence is obviously a fantastic actress and gives a great performance once again but coming back to the first movie I don't see how Katniss' character grows, matures and learns anything. She is the exact same character she was in the last one and the one before. Consequently you don't get to catch the interest of the viewers with a main character, this added to a movie where nothing really happen, the viewers are checked out pretty quickly. In fact, all the performances are very good, the drama is very well done but the characters who are actually interesting don't get to do anything beside sitting around, talking and give speeches. For instance there is a really tense scene in which Gale, starring Liam Hemsworth, explains how District 12 has been destroyed and how he could have done something more to help people to survive. This scene is also dealing with his relationship with Katniss, and you get to see that Gale's character is really deep and interesting but in reality you don't care about him that much. Finally, in the last 20 minutes of the film I was relieved to watch the proper movie beginning and building tension for the big finale, but then, it ends.Overall, MockingJay Part 1 is a well directed and good looking movie filled with potentially awesome things that never really reach the proper core of the film, nothing really mesmerising happen throughout the run time.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"More deliberately-paced than its predecessors, this penultimate chapter is still tense and gripping as an intimate character study and a smart political allegory on revolution","With the shot of an arrow, Katniss Everdeen demolished the annual Hunger Games and set in motion a rebellion that may very well overthrow the totalitarian rule of the Capitol which has held sway over the people in twelve Districts for the past 75 years. But to get to that point of the struggle, Katniss needs to be transformed from a survivor into an icon, a symbol that would come to represent what the revolution stands for in order to rally the people from the Districts to come forth from fear and join in the armed struggle.Opinion will certainly be divided whether the concluding book in Suzanne Collins' 'Hunger Games' trilogy should have been split into two movies, but unlike other similarly cleaved YA-franchises, the verdict is very much clearer in this case whether 'Mockingjay' merits that split. By leaving the inevitable showdown between the rebels and the Capitol for another film, this prelude instead leaves enough breathing room for itself to be an intimately sombre character study of Katniss, the reluctant heroine from District 12 who over the course of two years of her life and two iterations of the to-the-death bloodsport found herself in a position to become a leader of a cause, but at a tremendous price not just personally but also collaterally.Even though the Games are done, Katniss remains the traumatised centre of this penultimate chapter. Her rescuer, Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman), and the leader of the rebel cause, District 13's President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), want Katniss to be the star of a series of propaganda videos (or ""propos""), but as her former mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) shrewdly observes, Katniss has never done well following orders. Instead, her transformation would have to come from within, and this is in fact her two-hour coming-of-age story.Wisely choosing not to antagonise rabid fans of Collins' books, screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong (both newcomers to the franchise) remain thoroughly faithful to the book. From a solo visit to District 12 to see firsthand what is left of it to another tour of the equally ravaged District 8 where the dead, the dying and the starving are crammed in the same makeshift hospital, Katniss' witness of the extent of Snow's brutality and her empathy for its victims will eventually fuel her fire to rage defiance against the Capitol's President Snow (Donald Sutherland). But Snow has his own spokesman – Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), her fellow tribute from District 12 and no less than her lover; Peeta is Snow's weapon against Katniss, 'hijacked' by Snow and put on Capitol TV to plead with Katniss to back down.Not like in the Games, Katniss' trials here are more psychological than physical, so those expecting the same straightforward page- turning thrills of 'Catching Fire' will probably be quite disappointed. Gone is the colourful world of the Games, and in its place an austere subterranean environment where everyone dresses in boiler suits and even the formerly flamboyant Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) has to forgo her wigs and make-up. That change of pace and place isn't however a bad thing at all, for it does allow us the space and time to fully appreciate the emotional depth of Jennifer Lawrence's acting.More than in the other two films, Lawrence is simply tremendous here, conveying so many different shades within the same character – vulnerability as evidenced by how quickly she is seized by helplessness when she sees Peeta on TV, doubt in the her wariness towards President Coin and her spin doctor Plutarch, but most importantly her fierce determination when she turns towards the camera and delivers a personal message to Snow: ""if we burn, you burn with us"". Lawrence has always been the beating heart of this dystopian saga, and by letting Katniss' bow and arrow take a backseat to her emotional struggles, this chapter sees Lawrence deliver her most soulful, stirring and storm-raging performance yet.She finds plenty of support in similar acting heavyweights Moore, Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Sutherland. Such an ensemble may seem out of place in a YA- franchise, but their participation also indicates their confidence in the material. There is rich political subtext here about waging a revolution, not simply in military strategy but also in a more significant battle of the minds, wills and hearts. It was an inspired choice for Strong to be chosen as screenwriter – his previous work on HBO's 'Recount and 'Game Change' as well as last year's 'Lee Daniels' The Butler' certainly reveals his proclivities – and thankfully, returning director Francis Lawrence grasps the nuances in Strong's adaptation acutely and assuredly.He may not be the Lawrence in front of the camera, but this Lawrence behind it guides the proceedings with poise and élan, confidently balancing the action and politics while finding just the right tone that never comes across too heavy-handed on either tragedy or melodrama, managing to even insert some moments of levity (courtesy of Effie and Haymitch). The opening half hour could be tighter, but once the film gets into its stride, you'll find it just as gripping as the earlier films, in particular a daring raid under the cover of darkness into the heart of the Capitol's Tribute Centre to rescue the victors of the Games – most prominently Peeta.It does necessarily end on a cliffhanger, but this mid-sentence pause feels much more organic than say that of the 'Harry Potter' or 'Twilight' series. If you've just wanted a wham-bang thriller, then we say go re-watch 'Catching Fire'; indeed, Collins' trilogy was never meant to be just that. Without resorting to any voiceovers, this deliberately-paced but no less engrossing chapter retains the book's first-person, present-tense perspective of Katniss while losing none of the political allegory that Collins had intended from the very start. It may not catch fire, but it is a slow-burner that nonetheless captivates, enthralls and thrills.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A good third instalment, albeit a slow burner","This last outing by Francis Lawrence, the third instalment in a film series of four, is set in the war-torn districts of Panem left shattered by the Capitol's armed forces in an attempt to strangle the rebellion caused by Katniss' latest Games. The film takes off where the last one ended and works as a build-up for what is to come in Part 2. Though the film works as a ""bridge"" it is quite engaging with its 2- hour runtime and does enough to keep the audience entertained.The film works great as an adaptation because I felt the imagery of the film was almost identical to those I had made myself reading the book. This is something of a rarity, though I believe it is recurrent in the previous two instalments as well. As to potential errors with the transition from book to film, none were worth noting as far as I am concerned. The avid book fans will not be disappointed in other words.Probably the single strongest selling point in ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" is Jennifer Lawrence. She gives an overall good performance and though it is worth noting that this is not her best role till date, there are moments wherein she shines. Had Ms Lawrence been given more material with which to work, I am sure she would have taken opportune advantage of it. Additionally Liam Hemsworth in the role as Gale Hawthorne struck me as heartfelt and believable. The only casting choice I draw in question is Julianne Moore as President Alma Coin. I thought she gave a bland performance and I think the film would have benefited from another actress in her stead.Although I liked the film, and thought Francis Lawrence did a decent job, I definitely believe that this is the weakest link in the series. The film does suffer from a lack of content that could have been averted by merging parts 1 & 2 in a longer cut. Some of the ""propos""- scenes were quite awkward at times although I grant they felt awkward reading too. Also, to my annoyance Ms Lawrence had a scene or two where her acting felt very forced and where I thought low credibility was being conveyed. This left me slightly less impressed by her acting in this particular film, but I thought she did a great job overall notwithstanding the flaws as aforementioned.""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" is an entertaining teen film that will provide readers of the books with an accurate and satisfying rendering, and others that have not with a slight sense of disappointment perhaps. I enjoyed ""Mockingjay"" quite a lot, and although I acknowledge that it has its flaws, I would still recommend it.

The Best Hunger Games So Far,"Although this installment of the final chapter of the Hunger Games movie did not entirely pick up where it left off and just gave an idea of what happened instead, I think this is by far the best of all the previous installment of the film. There were some dead moments and although I still can't get over the Big Brother scenes where serious moments would have to be captured on tape for the Capitol and other districts to watch, I still think, Jennifer's reputation in Hollywood helped pull more audience than before. Julianne Moore as Madam president is so beautiful she is distracting in a good way.The story on how a heroic heart of an ordinary girl with compassion to her fellowmen and how it inspires many to stand up against abuse of power and dictatorship is inspiring in itself. The effects were better than the previous ones, the characters are more engaged and the story just kept getting better. The cut towards the final installment of the film is a bit of a cliffhanger but was cut just right..",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Franchise That Continues To Get Better And Better,"The first Hunger Games completely surprised me. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. And then Catching Fire really surprised me with where it took the series, ending with perhaps one of the best twists from last year. And the cycle continues to repeat itself, in the very best of ways, with Mockingjay - Part 1.What I love about this entry to The Hunger Games franchise, and what might turn some people off about this movie, is that it takes us out of the games and into the resistance. And I thought it was really cool what they gave us, and how they explored the build-up of this rebellion against the Capitol. I also enjoyed seeing what they've done with Katniss' character, showing how she is losing grip of her mental state and could lose it at any moment. It was nice to see her vulnerability in those moments, but it was also sweet to see her become a member a symbol of the resistance and take on that responsibility. She has her motivational moments and they are really effective, even to the point where you would want to fight with her. And I felt that Jennifer Lawrence gave an incredible performance (as per usual).One thing I noticed also is that this movie wasn't the most action- packed of the franchise, but it never bothered me because the intensity was so high. This had me on the edge my seat from beginning to end, and really took the franchise to what I think is at its best so far. Of course don't take that as there is no action in here. There's plenty to keep you going and there are some pretty sweet moments found here.There are also some noteworthy performances from Julianna Moore, Elizabeth Banks, and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman (they put a tribute to him at the end credits of the movie, which was nice to see). It was also nice to see where they took the character of Peeta, which I won't spoil here but let's just say it will definitely be a shock. And I was surprised at the fact that the ending felt like it had some sort of resolution while still pumping you up for the next installment, which I'm sure is going to be one heck of a finale.Overall, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part I continues to lead The Hunger Games down the path that has made it so successful so far. It's intense, engaging, has some really great performances that I wasn't expecting, and I liked how it was able to keep us invested without having to rely on the anxiety of the games. It sucks that we have to wait another year to see the next one, but for now The Hunger Games continues to get better and better, and it shows no signs of stopping.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good, I can fast forward the whole movie.","I am not going to go into details. I will try to keep it short.It was as expected, a totally dull movie.Looks like it was made for a TV release.I can understand that it is a formula movie, where the producers and directors are cashing on the market for certain type of viewers that are really suckers for these Teenage, rebellion, Ohh I am so special, will do things on my own terms type stuff.But it was sad to see that they didn't even bothered to make some effort and make it more interesting and viewable.Saw the whole movie in like 30 min and was still bored to death.Good going guys, cant wait to see the next garbage(actual word removed) sequel of this franchise.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"From someone who finds the books overrated and hates the tween fandom, this movie is an astonishing surprise","I have a love hate relationship with the Hunger Games series. I thought the first book was overrated and the first movie was a piece of garbage. I thought the second book was surprisingly well written and the movie was excellent. I thought the last book was fine and the ending was just awful. Although I like things about the Hunger Games, I was also very reluctant (and still kind of am in a way) to buy into the whole series. Although I liked the second movie, I was really reluctant to see the new Hunger Games movie. For some reason I just do not like the legions of fans and the hype it generates. I kind of feel like a hypocrite here, but I really cannot deny the excellence of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part One.There is all this dreck geared towards teens likes Divergent and Vampire Academy, etc. If you are one of those people (you know who you are) who always says all of these movies are terrible (as they are) and wish that teens and audiences alike were treated with more respect by Hollywood, here is your movie.This movie depends on not much action action and virtually no dumb relationships but on human interaction, startlingly mature and graphic content, and the surprisingly realistic depiction of revolution through quiet and subtle direction from Francis Lawrence. Whereas the Hunger Games themselves were the driving force of the other movies, this movie takes a lot time and has a more adult approach to material and it is hardly boring, in fact it is engrossing. I was hooked from beginning to end. Talk about a chilling ending brrrrr.It delivers on every level. Media goddess Jennifer Lawerence does not ham it up with a freakout scene and does a great job. Phillip Seymour Hoffman (sadly in his last role) gives a really solid performance along as does the usually annoying Julianne Moore. In fact, everyone in the film is in top form. Also, how could you not love how intensely over-the-top evil Donald Sutherland is?Screenplay is great, directing is great, special effects is great, cinematography is great, shall I go on? This movie is just a great surprise.This movie is thought provoking, disturbing, and not completely crowd pleasing and that is part of why it is really great. Regardless of my liking of the second movie, the first and second Hunger Game movies were still seen by tweens saying, ""Is it Peeta or Gale? Who does she love. oooooooo!!!!!"", yet this is just a great film on it's own. I cannot say it enough times. I applaud this movie for blowing my expectations out of the water and delivering what may be one of this year's best film's.Movies like this and Dawn of The Planet of The Apes are proof that Hollywood is able to produce well-made and intelligent films. Please explain Transformers 4 then?Sadly, this film is like Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows and Part Two is just a bloodbath. Will not be as well made and emotional (maybe I am getting to pretentious here), but whatever, but I am glad I saw this and I absolutely recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not as good as the first two, but still decent.","As has become normal with Hollywood franchises adapted from a book series, the final Hunger Games novel has been split into two movies, thus the first half of Mockingjay has to deal with the usual pitfalls of part-one-itis. Considering their YA roots, the previous cinematic incarnations had wowed due to their success in delivering exhilarating action alongside, rather than in place of, narrative smarts and maturity. Unfortunately, with the bulk of the action seemingly saved for the second entry (out next November), Mockingjay Part 1 is all work and no play, making it slightly dull compared to the excellent pair of films it has followed. It's also tonally darker and dramatically heavier, with the story venturing into super- serious territory and focussing on themes of death, loss and guilt. Returning director Francis Lawrence has a firm grip on this world though and, together with cinematographer Jo Willems, continues to craft an interesting look and feel to PanAm – both the gloriously pompous Capitol and the grubby, downtrodden districts aligning for an uprising. The whole cast is exceptional yet again: Jennifer Lawrence is a force to be reckoned with as the fiery Katniss, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore bring their usual gravitas as high- ranking members of the rebellion, Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson draw out some humour among the grimness, and Josh Hutcherson makes the most of his relatively limited screen time as Capitol puppet Peeta. There's just not enough pulse-rising adventure to elevate this to the high standards already established in the series, an especially disappointing flaw when taking into account some of the awesome set pieces concocted in the preceding instalments. It's a shame it can't truly excel as its own movie, however Mockingjay Part 1 is still a solid flick that succeeds in tiding over fans until the big finale next year.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I've never been so much bored from a movie and at some point I really considered leaving the theater. The pace is slow, the acting terribly poor and every single scene predictable. Jennifer Lawrence's character has been stretched to the maximum. All she does is crying and pretending all movie long.I will not watch the part 2 in theater nor on TV as we all already know what will happen.

Propaganda and more propaganda,"""I have a message for President Snow: If we burn, you burn with us!""When Francis Lawrence took over director duty for the second film in the Hunger Games franchise we got a much more serious YA adaptation from Collins's novel. The film had a great sense of pacing and storytelling while introducing us to the Capitol and the other districts and not just focusing on the actual Hunger Games. I thought it was a much better film than the first, but I still loved them both. They ended up in my list of the best films for the year in which they were released, so my expectations for this third film were huge considering Lawrence was back in the director's chair. I still had some concerns about adapting the final book in two parts because the first parts didn't work too well with the Twilight and Harry Potter franchises. My concerns turned out to be true because I did have a similar issue with Mockingjay Part 1. The entire film felt stretched, focusing on small details that didn't do much to build the tension of the story. It actually hurt the pacing of the film that the director had worked so well with in the previous installment. This first part felt like a slow build-up and a giant filler to what will come next in the grand finale, so I couldn't help but feel let down by what Francis Lawrence had to offer. I still enjoyed Mockingjay, but it doesn't live up to its predecessors.Mockingjay is a huge departure from the previous films. There are no Hunger Games and very little action scenes here, while there is a lot of exposition and preparation for what is to come. The previous films worked as a social commentary on reality TV, while this one focuses more on advertising. Catching Fire allowed us into the Capitol where we got a glimpse of who the real enemy was, but in Mockingjay we don't see what is actually going on in the Capitol and everything takes place mostly in District 13 where a big revolution is uprising. What all three films do have in common is the strong lead performance from Jennifer Lawrence who holds everything in place and keeps us engaged with this dystopian world Collins has introduced us to. When certain scenes in Mockingjay began to feel tedious or drag out a bit too long, Lawrence's Katniss reminded us why we are tagging along with this franchise. She literally is the symbol of hope for the rebellion as much as she is for the franchise. This film is more political than the previous ones and we are introduced to a lot of propaganda (not just as a build-up for the next film, but actual propaganda as the Capital and District 13 try to smear each other's credibility). The political intrigue plays out as a sort of chess game where one side tries to outdo the other. This was done really well here, but the problem was that it became repetitive, and that is where I felt the story was incredibly stretched out.Jennifer Lawrence has some great scenes in this film, and others that felt a bit cheesy (the nightmares for example), but during a scene where she sends a message to President Snow she gave me goose- bumps. I also enjoyed the scene where she sings ""the hanging tree"" lullaby. Those were the moments that drew me back to the film and reminded me why I loved this franchise in the first place. I am sure the second part of this film will work better, but the slow build-up didn't do much for me here. I missed some of the characters that I had learned to love and that only got a few minutes of screen time here. Haymitch and Caesar provided some of the much needed comic relief in the previous films, but here everything becomes political and serious and there is little room for them. Effie is perhaps the character who comes out better this time around and Elizabeth Banks nails the role once again. The new characters didn't do much for me and despite the fact that Liam Hemsworth gets much more screen time as Gale he doesn't do much either. Claflin's role as Finnick is nowhere as nearly interesting as it was in Catching Fire. Phillip Seymour Hoffman brings class once again to his role and he also stood out for me, while Josh Hutcherson shows much more range as Peeta here despite the very little screen time he's given. So despite having a lot of interesting characters in the franchise, they really don't get to do anything interesting in Mockingjay. Of course, the film ends with a teaser and we will all return for the grand finale despite the slow build-up because enough time has been spent on these characters and we care for them.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What a way of insisting in making a 2 part movie.,"I know the tendency initiated by the Harry Potter saga is a way of (1) making the movie more faithful to the book and (2) the production company to make more money. I assume that when Harry Potter did it, they were struggling with a way of resuming too many important details in 2 hours. 3 tops. From then on, screenwriters have done the opposite, which is focusing in the not so important details of the book to make a 6 hour script and 《then》being able to make two separate movies.In this case it was fairly evident. The scenes were slow at many points, too many longer than necessary dialogs and sequences. (Like Katniss repeatedly singing her symbol song, Katniss and Gale going hunting, and Katniss repeating at least 10 times ""President Snow, can you hear me?"").The movie can be resumed in the capitol being a bunch of corrupt mother f***ers and the districts rising against them with Katniss as their symbol.Most of the most exciting action sequences in the movie didn't even occur around the main characters and the ones that did, were not ones that put them in a difficult enough situation to keep the audience rooting for them on the edge of their seat.Basically, it becomes just a transition movie, unlike many other movies made out of extracts of a book, it doesn't count with a strong beginning, middle and end. It turns out pretty much flat and the inflection points throughout the film could have come out a lot stronger to keep the audience interested.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Love it!,"I wasn't that excited for Mockingjay at first, with all of the new movies-from-books coming out. Also, it didn't sound that great, since it was only HALF of the third movie.

The movie seemed quite long though, but it's not like I ever wanted it to end. The movie had a lot of exciting action, even though the games did not take place in this movie. I was so happy seeing the characters that I had imagined in my head come to life in this movie.

The franchise continues to grow...,"Are you anxiously awaiting the coming of the ""Mockingjay?""The YA (Young Adult) universe has been taking over cinema screens for years now. ""Twilight"" dominated the box office for its run while ""Harry Potter"" brought in more money than they knew what to do with. ""The Hunger Games"" took on a new phase of the genre, appealing to not only the young people it so desperately needed for box office results, but keeping the older viewers/parents of these movie-goers interested. The next installment of the franchise, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1,"" is a purely entertaining set piece for what will likely be a most intriguing finale.The obvious quarrel with the film is the splitting into two separate movies. ""Harry Potter"" coined this tactic with ""The Deathly Hallows,"" breaking them into two films to maximize box office potential. ""Twilight"" soon followed with ""Breaking Dawn."" This installment is probably the least bloated out of any of the franchises seen yet. It feels legitimately focused on the development of the characters and the surroundings they are now inhabiting.Jennifer Lawrence reprises her role as Katniss from a whole new perspective. The film takes place just a short time after the events of ""Catching Fire."" Katniss is living in District 13, angry and in despair after losing Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) in Quarter Quell. To add, Gale (Liam Hemsworth) has revealed that District 12 has been destroyed. Only 950 of 10,000 survived the raid and Katniss is asked to be the face of the revolution that is now rising against the Capitol and President Snow (Donald Sutherland). When Peeta is revealed to be alive and being held in the Capitol, Katniss must wage war against Snow, with the rebels, and try desperately to save Peeta.Lawrence continues to develop Katniss and bring us on her journey with a believable and authentic nature. Katniss is very broken in this installment, weakened by the events that preceded her, and Lawrence executes it just about flawlessly. The real surprise, is how effective Hutcherson and Hemsworth are this time around. Their roles are expanded, and they are offered an opportunity to showcase some very real and heartbreaking moments. Especially Hutcherson, who sheds all the annoyance he embodied in the first film, and brings a new life and lust to his eyes. I was quite taken by what he was doing and where's going.the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-sliceDonald Sutherland is a fantastic villain. The ying to Katniss' yang, the two are practically in an abusive love affair and it works tremendously. They're the two opposite spectrums of this new world where war rages on and the dead are not necessarily the unlikely ones. Julianne Moore, Woody Harrelson and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman are equally amazing in good measure of their respective roles. The pinnacle of the performers, and has been for this entire franchise is Elizabeth Banks. As Effie, she's embodied a soul plucked from her normal environment and thrust into the battle grounds of something she doesn't fully understand. Her appearances are both funny but impeccably warm. I hope people notice how vital and important she's been to the franchise, which should lead her to more vital and vivacious roles in the future.Francis Lawrence makes artistic choices that keep the audience at arm's length. Some of it is deliberate to hide things I'm sure we will know in the next installment. Some of it, is deathly obvious, bringing suspicion and tension to characters we know are going to be forces to be reckoned with. For the most part, everything is standard filmmaking. Something as massively popular as this needs to be to get the widest audience possible. I do wonder if that wasn't the focus on Lionsgate, and if they attempted to be more gritty with the material, show the destruction and blood of the people, and go up to an 'R' rating, if this isn't elevated significantly? Can only wonder.Overall, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" is very satisfying. Setting the chess pieces of what is destined to be an epic finale, it's one of the best things you can bring your family these upcoming weeks leading to the holiday season. I took my 14-year-old niece to see it, and she emphatically expressed ""Oh my God! It was amazing!"" You can't beat that.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mocking Moviegoers -  What a  Horrible Movie,"The screenwriter team for this movie was obviously under pressure to extend beyond reason the simplistic narrative of this movie. The result: over two hours of acting without substance. I cannot complain about the actors, for they did what they were paid to do, but COME ON, did it have to be so melodramatic and empty? Emotions are simply not credible, and only inspire scorn.I want my money back. I want my time back. What a waste of effort to extend this film beyond one installment. Had they compacted the movie in 1 hour, then probably all the bad cinematography would have been eliminated.Sure producers will make a profit at the expense of unsuspected viewers and several (perhaps demolishing) hits on actors careers. I will NOT view the last installment. I refuse to give my money away for nothing.The saddest part is that this movie could have been great. The acting talent was there. Technical resources were available. But he most inexpensive part of the production was neglected beyond belief: storytelling. The screenwriters in this movie are not idiots. It is obvious that artificial constraints were placed to extend the story to two parts.SAVE YOUR TIME, SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT WATCH THIS BAD, BAD MOVIE.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A change of tone from the first two, but gripping and engaging nonetheless","It's a tough gig adapting much-loved books for the screen, especially if the one you're dealing with is generally seen as the weakest in an overwhelmingly popular series. That's the ground we are on with this, the third of the Hunger Games movies. The third and final book in the trilogy seems to be the least regarded by fans (I haven't read them myself); and with the now almost inevitable decision having been taken to split the final story into two films, one could argue that the film-makers have made a rod for their own backs.I really liked both of the first films. They were witty, exciting, disturbing and though treading similar ground managed to deal with sufficiently different narrative and thematic material to suggest to effect a meaningful progression between the two. This third film marks a narrative departure: there's no central motif of gladiator-style combat-as-entertainment to build central action sequences around. Instead, we're in the territory where a Katniss-fronted revolution is being plotted whilst Peeta remains behind in the Captiol, apparently manipulated into being a spokesperson for the Big Brother style-regime. Instead of intense action thriller we have what amounts to an intense and involving political thriller, this time taking the politicising of the media into its satirical and thematic spotlight. There's good action sequences as well, but this isn't an action movie in the sense of the other two.That's where disappointment may kick in for some viewers. It's a big call for a major franchise like this one to change its tone so drastically mid-stream; I can't think of another major series of films that makes such an obvious leap. Without emotional investment in the source, I was utterly compelled by it – I remained swept up in the dystopian wold of the film; Jennifer Lawrence's central performance remains a strong, engaging and layered one; the supporting players are all decent, with a special poignant mention for the characteristically studied depth of Philip Seymour Hoffman.When the film does need to move into action sequences, it does so very well – the last major such passage being a standout, effectively inter-cut with dialogue and character. Therein lies these films' consistent strengths; these are blockbusters aimed at the vaunted young adult market which prove a timeless truth – that if a film (or book, or music, or) is constructed with enough intelligence and substance, there's no limiting the market. If this has lost the shock value of the first two films' central ideas, it's gained space to breathe and worm into the consciousness. We'll only be able to really judge if splitting the last instalment in two has worked this time next year; for now this may be the least immediately powerful of the three so far, but it's by no means a dip in the quality of the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good set-up to the impending action.,"I will admit, I was one among the many of the skeptics who, upon hearing that the third installment of the trilogy had been split into two multiplex sized chunks, heard the tell-tale ka-ching of the cash register going off in my head. It is not an unwarranted fear; there have been prior offenders, Peter Jackson and David Yates coming directly to mind. The same charge could have been leveled at Francis Lawrence had he wasted all the extra sand in his hourglass on maudlin handholding scenes shamelessly geared toward the film's core young female demographic.As it happens, there is indeed plenty of maudlin to go around in Mockinjay, Part 1, though nothing that left as bad a taste as those five surreal minutes Daniel Radcliff and Emma Watson spent alone in that tent dancing awkwardly to music six decades their senior. That said, there are also just enough scenes to redeem the movie and perhaps even justify the extra hour and half of story, which veers uninhibitedly towards its dystopian roots. We find Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence, who has expanded her repertoire from glowering teenager to shivering, emotional wreck) recently rescued from the wreckage of the Quarter Quell to serve Panem's revolution, which in spite of whatever Gill Scott-Heron once said will almost certainly be televised, and with Katniss front and center. Propaganda and its malfeasant uses, after all, are sort of the main underlying themes of Suzanne Collin's books. In the first two installments, we followed in the footsteps of Katniss and fellow tribute Peeta Malark (Josh Hutcherson), as they were trotted out as show ponies in the Capitol's increasingly desperate attempts to control the masses under their boot heel. Mockingjay finds Katniss handed off to the other team like a football and treated with much the same callow disregard for her underlying humanity. One can forgive Lawrence's character for not noticing; she spends much of the film in what appears to be a permanent state of shell-shock, albeit mostly over the fate of Peeta rather than the horrific genocide of most of her friends and neighbors, which lets face it, starts to get grating rather quickly, especially as the bodies begin to pile up around her fashionably sensible boots.The emotional claustrophobia is enhanced by the fact that much of the film takes place underground and centers around the propaganda war that has taken nearly as much importance as the actual fighting. Such a story you'd think would set the stage for some spectacular outbursts and tension between Katniss and her new handlers, but instead Lawrence seems content to sleepwalk through the usual motions and pine after her former teammate.Thankfully, there are points in the film when she and her camera crew are forced to go outside and witness the horrors full hand, and it is in these moments that the story goes from being typical opera to becoming dangerously relevant. In Collin's dyspeptic worldview, the sickening realities of the modern battlefield become yet another theatre production, though whereas the Capitol used our instinct for bloody voyeurism to keep us entertained and compliant, District 13 uses it much the same way Syrian insurgents use YouTube to whip up their supporters and with much the same outcome. The rebels, far from following the heroic cliché of the peasant soldier throwing off an oppressor, quickly become objects of pity in their all-too-willingness to throw themselves lemming-like at forces far better armed simply after watching one of Katniss' videotaped tirades.The film is good in that sense, but there are still plenty of things that keep it from being really good or great. Despite two installments in which to grow his character, Gale (played by Liam Hemsworth) has not yet progressed beyond having the personality of an AXE commercial, and Josh Hutchison does little better as Peeta, though his character's woodiness can be subscribed too having been held at gunpoint for most of the film. Many of the series' veterans, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Jeffrey Wright, and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, retain a respectable but subdued screen presence. They are joined by Julianne Moore playing President Coin, who doesn't quite ooze the same villainy as Donald Sutherland's President Snow (or much of anything else for that matter), though this could simply be because she has yet to take off her mask. For now, she's resigned to holding daily pep rallies and uttering such messianic phrases as ""democracy"" and ""sharing the fruits of our labor"" in front of a giant screen, all the while sitting atop a stockpile of missiles, bullets, and thousands of fighting age youths who all dress in the same olive-gray jumpsuits.Should get interesting, but for now, the film leaves us waiting patiently in the bunker for the real showdown to begin.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
They actually made the first half of the book action packed and an emotional roller-coaster...,To all my Bookies and Movie fends. Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 was awesome!!! They actually made the first half of the book action packed and an emotional roller-coaster that will give you the information needed to understand the situation! But at the same time keep simple minded people entertained while doing it! Honestly they followed the book while adding events that simulated the plot in ways that I bet the author Suzanne Collins wished she would have thought of it. Maybe she did b/c she was a part of the screen writing! I truly loved how Jennifer was able to express Katniss' thoughts and feelings without uttering a word. She is the perfect Katniss!

It was just plain stupidity in every scene. Same old revenge drama with half side shaved heads, war torn buildings and desperate attempts to sell its viewers the idea that its a master class. At least should have shown some respect to the book from which its taken. This movie should be shown at some fashion shows during couture week may be it can get some applause there.

"Moving, dark, morose and fantastic story telling","I have been truly taken by surprise with The Hunger Games movie series. When the first one came out I knew nothing about it except that the books were quite popular. Needless to say my first viewing of the first one I enjoyed it a lot but also was disturbed that it was considered a story for young adults. Now skip ahead and I loved Catching Fire and for me Mockingjay part 1 is every bit as good as Catching Fire in its own ways. It may not have the action that made the first 2 such good movies but where it lacks in action it makes up for with excellent acting and a compelling story. The war is beginning and the finale looks to be glorious. This is a dark and morose movie. You wont find hardly any smiles and very few laughs but thats not a bad thing.We are being thrust into a world where the Government is corrupt and a civil war is brewing, it would seem odd if it wasn't occasionally if not mostly depressing. But its not the kind of depressing that is going to make you leave the theater sad, no its going to make you leave the theater hungry for more. I care so much for these characters that I am finding myself heavily invested in their struggle. Katniss is in a dark place in this movie as she finds herself the reluctant symbol of the rebellion against the Capital. Its odd that after all she's done she doesn't realize her importance or at least doesn't seem to want the importance. She's the reluctant hero and Im starting to get a martyr vibe. It was a treat once again to see Phillip Seymore Hoffman grace the screen in what is his last fully completed movie. He filmed all but one scene for the second part. Julianne Moore joins the cast as the leader of the rebellion, President Coin and she is a welcome treat. It's nice this franchise was able to lock in such powerhouse actors, just shows that they believe in the material.This movie isn't going to satisfy action junkies and some may feel that overall not much happens to move the story forward but I believe there is enough going on here to keep you entertained from start to finish. I didn't want it to end and am not looking forward to the long months of counting the days until I get to see the finale to this brilliant series.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Series Stripped of Its Power,"After walking out of the theater having just seen The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, my initial reactions were a bit conflicted. My first thoughts towards it were quite negative. Then I had to think of the film coming from the standpoint that it is, after all, a lead up to the grand finale, hence the Part 1. But then I came to the conclusion that whether viewed as a standalone or set-up film, Mockingjay - Part 1 fails to meet the high expectations set by its predecessors, leaving a juggernaut series deprived of its power.As a lead up to the (hopefully) bigger and better Part 2, Mockingjay - Part 1's job is simple: deliver an exciting film that builds the series' current momentum forward and creates mass anticipation for the eventual finale. At the end of the day, Part 1 doesn't meet that goal. Not only was it borderline boring but more importantly, my high anticipation for the final chapter of this series has been heavily damaged. I was far and away more excited to see Part 1 following Catching Fire than I am for Part 2 following Part 1, and in a two part film finale, that's exactly what you don't want.Let's talk about the actual movie a bit. We pick up right where Catching Fire left off. Lead character Katniss Everdeen as been chosen to be the face of a revolution against the tyrant Capitol and the movie makes it seem like all Hell is going to break lose. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the film suffers from being slow, shallow and uneventful. Too often does the movie trap itself in sluggish scenes while trying to make the audience care about the mass conflict between the Capitol and Rebellion. Any momentum the movie picks up is almost immediately shot down by another slow, heart-felt seen about being sad or angry at the past or at the present situation. The pacing of the film is that of a disjointed sloth, leaving little to zero space for the viewer to become eager for the next scene. All of this makes the movie seem like it's stretching itself way too thin, making you wonder if a two part film was even necessary in the first place.Action is scarce, something that is undeniably critical to create success for The Hunger Games name. I mean, Katniss fired ONE arrow the entire movie. Not exactly the idea of exhilarating. There are a few intense action scenes, but they're often too quick to get excited about. One clear downfall of Part 1 is it's lack of an actual Hunger Games. While I understand that the story bases from the book and may not exactly be the fault of the writers, what sets the series apart from others is The Hunger Games themselves. Now that you take that away, it just becomes another action film which happens to use past Hunger Games as a background. In terms of overall story arc, it doesn't hurt as badly because of the continuing development of the franchises's story. But in terms of the immediate story and the film's enjoy-ability, the absence of the franchise's most dynamic feature hurts. When it comes to action and intensity, Part 1 talks the talk, but certainly doesn't walk the walk.Jennifer Lawrence is now the glue holding this once great cast together. After having such words of praise for the film's cast in Catching Fire, most of the major players didn't seem to bring their A game for Part 1. Outside of Lawrence, I still deeply enjoyed the performances of Donald Sutherland as antagonist President Snow and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, whom the film was dedicated to. But unlike the earlier entries in the series, they same cannot be said for Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson and especially newcomer Julianne Moore as President Coin, who never captures the essence of her character's power and influence. For most of the cast, it was almost as if they were just dragging through the movie, like they were saying ""get on to Part 2 all ready"". This seems to be partially due to a poorly written script. Luckily Lawrence saves the day with another wonderful performance and stops the entire cast from completely nose-diving.The positives are still there, if minimal. Along with the acting of Lawrence, Sutherland and Hoffman, as a set-up film Part 1 does get some things right. Although dull, the character development and charisma between the characters grows deeper so when Part 2 comes along, we'll all ready known who everyone is and what they stand for. Some new characters are welcome additions, and though unexplored in Part 1, the background was set up nicely for Part 2 to blow people's minds.Some people say it was all for the second half and that you have to look past the minimal action and slow pacing. But my mind has been set. The painfully sluggish pacing, dismal scenes of unexciting dialogue, lack of hardly any action and overall poor acting puts the fire right out for this massive franchise. It may be blowing up the box office, but make no mistake, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is like a joke with no punch line; it's half-hearted and leaves you wanting more.5.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The worst so far, as i expected huge","Firstly, i gotta point out that seeing ""Part 1"" in the title is already an upfront (and somewhat prejudgment) letdown. I rarely see and fond of the sequels except for Godfather, animated features AND The Hunger Games as the books are so good. Although, i didn't expect they could bring the whole book into the screen, i expected it to be AT LEAST able to keep it up with the first two. But no, every single scene is stretched out to meet the requirement of minimum length for a feature film. The film is darker than prequels so imagining it's just getting longer and longer without a purpose, its very frustrating.3 stars rating is for the acting as the cast has fulfilled their roles beautifully as always. Yet, due to the unnecessary length, somehow it gets downgraded. Also, the music is good and getting along very well with the content.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Lack of suspense, poor action...","Well, was suprise by the quality of the first 2 Hunger games. Not 10/10, but still respectable flicks.

John Wick's making us remember it every Time. But, no, in this case the action is poor, no imagination, failed cgi. Damn it made me think of 90' TV shows where they did not have budget. I assume they kept it for the finale, if not, franchise really did go down .Oh, there's an animal to save. But does not work as good as for Indépendance day.Actors are average. Lawrence seems off.

Followed the book to a tee,"I loved that they followed the book once again to a tee, but for a movie, it made it boring and slow. The last film had so much excitement to it with all the action.

"Not as great as the previous 2, but still a great movie.","It definitely doesn't have the novelty factor of the first two movies, but it's still very well done. While it's a logical continuation of the story, it takes the entire premise in a very different direction. It does make sense from a story perspective but the result is more of a movie about revolutionaries than a survival game. It is very powerful but it does feel like it's been done many times before, especially around real events/revolutions that have happened and make for much more meaningful stories. That said, everything is top notch, from directing to storyline and acting so I still highly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Really bad,"I enjoyed the first two parts and was completely surprise by this one. The script is bad, the rhythm of the story is very slow and I didn't understand some of the things that happen there. Why is she not in love with her boyfriend anymore and suddenly she loves Peeta? It doesn't make sense. Also, her performance is really bad and the other actors are not doing better either. Almost nothing is credible anymore. And since the script does not have a clear continuance, I almost forgot what happened in the first two parts. Really bad, I watched it hoping till the end that at some point it will get back to its 'original' rhythm and to a better performance of the actors.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not bad but for sure felt different.,"This one had less actual action than the previous installments and felt much slower. However, it still had very suspenseful scenes and emotional/triumphant scenes with good acting from Jennifer Lawrence. This movie felt and looked darker which I enjoyed as well and handled the character of Peeta very well. RIP Philip Seymour Hoffman, what a talented individual who will be continued to be missed! It's amazing that he completed the filming of pretty much all of his scenes right before he died. Maybe this has a lower rating because of things that it has left out from the book or that it's a two-part movie, but I personally don't mind that at all.

Another Clumsy Ripoff From Lion$gate,"Not surprisingly, Francis Lawrence makes yet another rip-off (the Japanese movie 'Battle Royale II') and, of course, with the added recycled Twilight material (romantic triangle -as evident in 'Divergent' and 'the Huntsman'), clumsy sex scenes and the Hollywood ingredients (PG-13 violence and family friendly, offscreen gore, including the required item number). It may not be among the most expensive films but it's quite apparent that a lot of money has been spent. However, 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' still looks and feels like a B-movie. Camera-work is overdone. Editing is shoddy. Too many subplots that aren't fleshed out, lots of plot holes. The use of light is ineffective especially in the nocturnal sequences. Most of the performances are average at best. Donald Pleasance does go overboard in several scenes. Jennifer Lawrence seems to only have been required as the directors daughter. Philip Kaufman does a confident job and... if there is one reason to watch 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' at all then that's Josh Huckman who easily steals the show as the male love interest. One good that came from the box office success of this forgettable, rather lacklustre thriller is the appreciation of this actor, most of whose memorable works received little recognition.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
No attempt to hide the padding out,First of all it's a continuation of a decent saga which I have enjoyed more than I thought I would. The 3rd installment is a little darker and that is not unwelcome. I won't waste time commenting on the fact that it has been stretched thin to make it into 2 movies. Enough reviews have rightly pointed that out. The story is gritty and uncomfortable and we see more of the harsh reality of war against an unforgiving oppressor which is done well. The main cast are again capable. With the character of Peeta developing nicely. I found Julianne Moore to be pretty wooden and uninspiring. In fact the whole new society of District 13 had shades of the 3rd Matrix film for me. A little over egged and an extra facet of the story that was not really essential to the plot. Again this may be to thin it out a bit more. Hoping the last installment brings it back up. Drop to a 6 for this one.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Little Boring,"I had high expectations from this one but this quickly fizzled out. Honestly, the last Hunger Games book did not need two separate movies, so this one didn't really have a lot of progression. There wasn't much character development and not a lot happened really. It seemed like filler material and was incredibly slow. The actors were okay in their respective roles but I really thought it would be better since I had enjoyed the other movies in this series.

There Needs to Be a Better Transition from the Earlier Films,"I did see the previous movies and will be there to find out how it all plays out. Is it fair to criticize a film when one's memories of those first two films are a little fuzzy. I guess I am empathetic because the totalitarian government is so awful that I'm going to pull for these guys. Kateniss is the hero, but I'm not sure how she connects to the evils that are being perpetrated. Donald Sutherland's character is utterly rotten. But what is it he wants. I mean, is he getting any enjoyment out of his power other than to have it. I know history is dotted with megalomaniacs like this, but what will the world be. This part is filled with self- doubt and uncertainty. I fear that the power shift is like most (like the French Revolution) when evil trumps evil and we end up with evil. I've not read the books so I'm at a loss. There is so much unexplained stuff going on here that I hope gets explained in the future.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If we burn, you burn with us!","This was one of the best movies I have ever seen, the second movie that I have ever rated 10/10! It feels like the story was taken right from the pages and onto the screen, characters were portrayed perfectly and the on screen chemistry was top notch. With a stunning soundtrack that gives the movie the feeling of the elegance of battle with the bitter hardships of a rebellion. Some movies merely take phrases from the source material but this film lifted entire paragraphs perfectly and dramatized them with utter brilliance. Some have called this movie filler but considering the significance of some of the events in this movie it can hardly be described as anything less than one of the best installments in a saga that could be described as a modern marvel of cinematic brilliance. It makes you truly believe that you are truly in the districts surrounded by the tension and unrest from a rebellion.

Purely for Profit Unnecessary division of 3rd novel yields droning Part 1,"Lionsgate chooses to break up the final film of the Hunger Games series, and in the process produces a rather droning Mockingjay Part 1.The film The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 starts where its predecessor ended. Panem is facing a revolt started by Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence, as set up at the end of Catching of Fire. In which previous victors of the games were once forced to fight for their lives knowing there would be but one left alive.After being thrown into the Hunger Games for a second time when Katniss thought she was safe, and having seen her friends die and Peeta held hostage by the Capitol, she is traumatized. Kidnapped and taken by the rebels to District 13, she is once again thrust in the heart of the revolution that she helped to ignite as the symbolic face of the effort.As far as adaptations go, The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 follows the story set forth by Suzanne Collins pretty accurately. Having split the final book of the trilogy into two parts allows the production company some freedom in faithfulness. Having read the books myself I know the third book is the odd narrative of the bunch, focusing more on revolutionary warfare than the cruel realities of the games.While I understand a potential film would have been a behemoth in length had the book Mockingjay not been broken up into parts, it seems that not enough content is in Part 1. It drones on for the first 40minutes at District 13 while Katniss comes to grips with her role as the symbolic mockingjay when this transformation easily could have been abridged substantially. The increased time invested in showing the rebel effort allows a lull to occur by the one hour mark when viewers realize they still have an entire second half of the movie to endure.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is relatively well acted though monotonously toned in the emotions of their characters. None go through any sort of transformation or evolution and by the end of the film all are exactly as they started. Mockingjay Part 1 does divide the book at a very appropriate point, though the film should have ended three minutes earlier, and still leaves audiences excited for the much anticipated conclusion to the series with Mockingjay Part 2.For more FULL reviews of ALL the RECENT releases, please check out our website.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Reflects the quality of the books,"Lets get couple things out of the way for the Hunger Games lovers. I am an avid movie go-er and enjoy great deal of fiction books. I have read all 3 books as well as watch the other 2 movies.If you read the book you would have seen this coming from this series. While first 2 books keep a good balance between inner dialog and the plot, the last book was emotional driven swamp that almost slowed the plot to a stop. (forgive me ladies) It read like the writer was going through her menopause for the entire 3rd book. It was just that bad, the only motivation that had me finish the book was my desire to end the series. The books series was clearly written by a inferior writer than the recent book-to-movie authors. The movie was accordingly was horrendous.Instead of introducing the character's feelings while the plot unfolds, the writer chooses to keep the reader on the character's emotional roller-coaster while giving vague news about the actual plot (revolution). The characters have no depth to them and the plot plays too close to archetypes.The movie was barely not worth watching therefore a 4. There isn't the quality or the quantity of action to be a serviceable action/adventure and the low quality of the actors/actresses doesn't save the terrible writing. The camera work or the directing isn't top shelf by any means, might be one of the worst big budget work I've seen in decades. I tried to like the book, I tried to like this movie but there is just no redeeming quality about either.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mockingjay Part I fundamentally fails to capture the essence of Rebellion.,"Now before the Hunger Games fans try to gut me for this review, bare in mind I am writing this review without having read the books- which may or may not cloud my judgment, depending on different opinions. Firstly, I would like to preface my review by pointing out that compared to the shallow garbage we see nowadays the Hunger Games franchise is considerably better both in its ability to convey emotion and assert compelling themes ( FYI: they are also coherent). It has been a while since we've discovered a tale of tyranny - via the abuse of power, told from the perspective and voice of the people being subjected with violence. The theme of Injustice has been tackled countless times by Hollywood studios over the years and 90% of the time it was misrepresented or wrongly/poorly depicted. The strength of the Hunger Games is that the underlying motive of Revolt drives every character's story-arc and as a consequence universalizes the plight of the 13 Districts. From the very start of the trilogy, Katniss Everdeen brought conflict straight to the Capitol as soon as she won the Games. Her act of defiance not only sparked a series of events but it eventually exposed the autocracy of the Government- all this purely by accident ( Katniss reminds everyone in this third installment that initially, she did not willingly want to cause the uproar in Panem). Ironically, Katniss volunteered to fight in the Games, however she is made a symbol of the Mockingjay Rebellion involuntarily. Most audiences will be moved by the emotional journey Katniss undergoes throughout the film- however it was paramount for Francis Lawrence to capture the rebellion of the districts with the utmost sincerity and power. Unfortunately, he ultimately fails to do so. What works in the Hunger Games is that it explores an enthralling and extremely vivid background/back-story- namely ""The Districts, their diverse terrains and their inhabitants"". For instance, in ""Catching Fire""- we had a glimpse into the lives of the people living in District 12( and some other Districts such as 8)- this made us empathize with the characters at the helm of this blockbuster because it gave the plot a humane cause. The brave and hard-working people of Panem were given a soul and not just Hollywood props to play around with. To be quite frank, I was quite skeptical to watch Catching Fire after I heard Gary Ross was not attached to direct. Fortunately, to my surprise, Francis Lawrence did an outstanding job and kept the series with a fervent sense of conviction and audacity. Francis Lawrence's greatest accomplishment with Catching Fire was that he explored a plausible juxtaposition of sorts, which was: while The Capitol tried to dehumanize the people under its rule they gained the bravery to humanize their cause through the eyes of innocent Katniss Everdeen. This might sound complicated to understand but at its core is the primary motor for the denouement of the story. The political undertones of the Hunger Games have always been present in the shadows- this made it more than interesting for Lionsgate ( the film production company behind the Hunger Games phenomenon), as they had a young adult adaptation, which at the time of release, coincided with the political issues of today's day and age. From the very beginning, Mockingjay Part 1 had a daunting task to extend both visually and spiritually the magnitude of Panem's universe; in order to give us a look into the mind of the Rebellion- both through Katniss' eyes and the individuals who rally behind her. All in all, the essence of the Hunger Games was not entirely there as the movie failed to capture the Mockingjay Rebellion with enough heart and insight. That being said, I still think the first 2 installments deserve all the praise they get for defying the Hollywood ""status-quo"" and I'm glad The Hunger Games trilogy was acquired by Lionsgate-( a smaller independent studio compared to the normal typical ""powerhouses"") as they kept the movies relatively in-sync with the books and allowed both Gary Ross and Francis Lawrence to portray Panem without any influence from higher-ups( to a certain extent of course ). I certainly hope that when Mockingjay Part II hits theaters at the same time next year, we will dive back into a truthful and honest representation of the people of Panem and their fight against injustice. Finally, although Katniss singing ""Hanging Tree"" evoked the main ideas behind the revolution- the rest of the film falls short trying to do so.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The inevitable calm before the storm,"The Games may be over, but the revolution is just beginning. ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" repeats the same formula present in many of these current two-part adaptations of popular literary works: a slow-paced, exposition-laden first half that will be undoubtedly contrasted with its fiery, action-driven conclusion due to be released next year. Although the decision to do this makes ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" so far the weakest in the Hunger Games quadrilogy, solid performances and an overbearing sense of dread still make ""Part 1"" a worthy installment in the dystopian series.As the twelve districts amass against the oppressive Capitol, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) finds herself being used as a propaganda tool to garner support for the revolutionaries. She also finds her loyalties divided between those she is being encouraged to inspire, and those who are held captive in the Capitol, including friend/love interest Peeta (Josh Hutcherson).Like with the previous two productions, much of the film's success rests on Lawrence's more-than-capable shoulders. Her character shifts effortlessly back and forth from a reluctant victim of circumstance to a full-fledged freedom fighter. The actress can be just as dedicated in roles such as these as to those for which she has been Oscar-nominated (Winter's Bone, Silver Linings Playbook). Many of the other previously prominent characters, such as Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Peeta, are relegated largely to the sidelines in this installment, though they surely will receive their fair share of moments in the concluding entry.By taking a much slower, introspective approach, the film is perhaps able to reach a much deeper form of social and political commentary, as well as further insight into Katniss' now even more flawed psyche. Clear comparisons can be drawn between the turbulent climate Katniss is thrust into and the current relationships between first and third-world civilizations. Though this setting already provides an unnerving cinematic experience, the similarities displayed in real life make it all the more closer to home.The decision to split the final book adaptation into two films inevitably deprives ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" of a sufficient third act. We get a great build-up, but no pay-off, something which will unfortunately have to wait until next year. However, as far as build-ups go, ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" does the job well, refamiliarizing its audience with the chaotic world of Panem, its pivotal characters, as well as effectively raising the stakes for 2015's even-more-anticipated climax.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Read the book,"Six, an appropriate score for a B action movie with no significance, plot or character development. I'm sorry if you liked Finnick Odair, because don't expect to see much of him, or Peeta Mellark, but the major problem with this movie is that it's telling the opposite story of the one the book told. All the foreshadowing is removed and there are newly invented scenes that directly contradict the subtext of the book and lead me to suspect that a radical change of ending at the end of movie two.It's not Mockingjay, the book, made into a movie. It's like Coin made a propo of Mockingjay from her point of view and released it as a campaign ad for her upcoming presidential run.Mockingjay wasn't a completely original story, it was Watership Down, but it was a wonderful end to the series, and just the sort of triple play that was needed. Now they've taken that away from me and handed me a star wars in its place. That's like taking away my swordfish steak and giving me a McFillet.It's a chopped assortment of action scenes, with all of the darkness removed, and absurd scenes added that generated actual mocking laughter from the theater audience when I saw it on the second night. That's never a good sign.Still, if you're just seeing it as a movie, it's not terrible, it's not like inception or some of the garbage they have at top of IMDb's list; meaning, it's not blatantly bad, it's just blatantly not mockingjay. Maybe if they called it mockingmockingjay, or maybe if it was a youtube fan video attempt it wouldn't have annoyed me so much.There are a couple of well done scenes taken from the book that actually appear in the movie. I think there are actually five scenes in this movie that are actually in the book, and maybe two of them are the same as the book. What's more difficult to forgive is the creation of scenes that aren't in the book to add in when there is clearly so much that was hacked out.So, if you didn't read the book, you'll be mildly annoyed, if you did read the book, just brace yourself with really low expectations and then you can still enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Disappointment to Movie-watchers and Book-readers Alike,"Acknowledge: as a book-reader who did not like the third installment in the first place, you may find my review a bit biased.""The Hunger Games"" series has failed to grab my attention on both the big screen and on paper. However, due to the vast improvements made between the first and second installments of the film series, I was rather excited to see how the writers would continue to improve upon Suzanne Collins' disappointing finale to the book series. Unfortunately, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay (Part 1)"" delivers no such improvements and is just as slow and frustrating as the first half of the third book. If you go to see this, when you walk out of the theater, please seriously ask yourself, ""what was accomplished in this movie?"". The answer you give yourself should have one, maybe two, bullet points despite the 123 minute running time. This movie made it painfully obvious that producers only want to squeeze as much money out of fans as possible; there is absolutely no reason to have a two part film adaptation of Collins' ""Mockingjay"".I do not believe screenplay writers should keep true to books they base their screenplays off of, that is totally up to the original author and the writer. That being said, book-readers should be happy with any changes that were made, and mad that more were not implemented. This was a BORING movie. It also makes you hate the characters we are meant to love by making them seem like the most selfish and naive people despite the experiences they have lived through. While the acting is not bad (quite the opposite really, the actors are excellent with what little they have to work with), I was relieved when the main characters were taken off the screen in order to show what was happening outside of their ""bubble"". I found myself much more interested in the stories of the extras rather than the boring and almost irrelevant plot that follows the main characters. It makes you want to slap them and scream ""stop throwing a pity-party for yourself and do something useful for a change"".I gave this film a 4 because, while there is no doubt in my mind that I will see the final installment in theaters as well, I urge movie- watchers to wait. Wait until you have the chance to watch the first and second parts together, otherwise you will be mad and anxious until it is released. Hopefully by doing this, you will have a better impression of the film(s) than I have.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
emotional and intense,"I have been a Hunger Games fan for as long as I can remember and this movie was a perfect book to movie adaptation. It included every important aspect and detail, and even went more in depth than the book did.I was amazed with Jennifer Lawrence's acting, it was convincing and real seeing that she has gone through 2 hunger games and now is suffering with PTSD. People need to remember that Katniss is not supposed to be this strong, fearless leader, she is a 17 year old girl suffering with PTSD and only wants to save her love from torture.I thought all the action scenes were intense and visually stunning, everything looked real and made you want to sit on the edge of your seat. I was very impressed by the CGI effects.As for Peeta, I think that Josh Hutcherson did a phenomenal job capturing his character. He's so different from the Peeta we saw before, and to see him deteriorate slowly through out the movie made my heart ache. The last scenes of the movie were well acted, and I think that Josh captured Peeta perfectly as a victim of the capitols hijacking.Everything about this movie was so well done, the acting, the characters, the visuals, I could go on and on.For those who are disappointed that there wasn't enough action, that's not what it was mainly about. There's more to this movie than that. Katniss' character is severely depressed and has PTSD, so to expect her to be this incredibly strong heroine is unrealistic. There's so much more to this movie than the action scenes, and if you fail to see that then this is not the movie for you.I cannot wait for Part 2, I think it might even be better than part 1, but it's hard to top.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mockingjay part 1 a build up for finale,"The Mockingjay is out of the Hunger Games arena but she is not done fighting. The third installment of the Hunger Games series diverges from the first two in that things have gotten a lot more serious. No longer is Katniss Everdeen simply trying to stay alive, she is now leading a cause, a revolution.This is one of the main reasons I didn't like this movie as much. The root of it all is the book of course, which I read; so the book is a lot to blame. To be fair, I didn't really like book three as much as the first two, so it is quite possible that I was biased going into the movie. Be that as it is, Katniss was more likable as the girl on fire just trying to survive. Now she is the Mockingjay trying to incite and invigorate the people to action. Along with this character shift the movie was slow.Mockingjay Part 1 was a build up movie in my opinion. The entire movie is setting the stage for the eventual battle between the rebels and the Capital. Not that they haven't been fighting already, but the stage is being set for an all out offensive. So, as a build up movie it was slow as to be expected. There were some exciting and active moments sprinkled in here and there, but the majority of the movie was very chess like. Like President Snow said, ""Moves and counter-moves.""",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A strong but slightly disappointing lead up to the finale,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay suffered heavily from being Part 1 in a two part film. It was given the task of setting up all of the action to come and that hurt the film both in terms of runtime and overall content. The movie is littered with lots of dialogue between the characters that although is somewhat interesting, but does get a little tiring by the end. On the plus side Jennifer Lawrence's character does get a lot of development throughout the film, but that did create a negative by taking away many chances to have other character develop. In the end the film was very well acted by all involved, but let itself down by having to setup all of the events in Part 2 of the final film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Overlong, but Decent without much of Actions","Perhaps melancholy and silence are the two most precise words to describe what is actually happening in this first half of the final chapter. The action sequences are drastically lesser as compared to the first two installments, but it works well as a bridge to connect what has already happened previously and to expect what is yet to come. It is clear to see the main intention behind to separate this adventure into two parts, which might look necessary providing that it has just covered a quarter of the last book, but unfortunately rather than presenting further details, it keeps on dragging certain unnecessary parts even though the political satire seems to be quite smart, if audiences are patient enough to follow the dialogues. As the core of the story line, Academy Award winner - Jennifer Lawrence undoubtedly performs extremely well physically, mentally and emotionally once again as Katniss Everdeen, it also presents a stunning ending compared to Catching Fire; not to say boring but overall this chapter appears to be a little bit overlong and weak, causing the lack of powerful revolution and rebellion spirits.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 - It is the things we love most that destroy us - 3.5 stars,"Katniss, Peeta, Gale... A love triangle spun into a four part series.Walking into the cinema... Part One: This is like walking into a fine restaurant and knowing that you will only get the appetiser. We are just supposed to be satisfied with part of the Mockingjay story.Overall rating: 3.5 stars Cinematic value: 3.5 stars Family value: 2.5 stars*For those who have not been keeping up with the district drama of The Hunger Games narrative. Katniss and the rebellion destroyed the Hunger Games and the nation of Panem is set on is on a disastrous course towards civil war. The districts have begun to rebel against the Capital and all they need is a catalyst to begin an attack. The rescued tributes, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), Gale (Liam Hemsworth), Finnick and Beetee, have been taken to District 13. The district that was rumoured to be destroyed, but has flourished undetected and underground by the watchful eye of the Capital's peacekeepers. Katniss is asked to push past her personal horrors of the Hunger Games, the assumed loss of Peeta and take on the role of the people's symbol for the rebellion, the ""Mockingjay"". President Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) devise a plan that will weigh against the propaganda of the President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the Capital. Katniss must weigh out how she will be utilised for the role and the eventual knowledge of Peeta's (Josh Hutcherson) survival and his perceived betrayal within the capital. Peeta seems to have become the puppet of the capital and she must find a way to save him and still fight the power of Snow's army. After visiting the destruction of District 12 and seeing the devastation throughout the other districts, Katniss is motivated to become the central figure in the fight. She must wrestle with the responsibilities of being the face of the rebellion and determining what do with her potential love for Peeta and Gale.The Hunger Games series has become another teen dystopian drama phenomenon. The book series and the movie series have set new records and developed stars of its characters. Regardless of opinions of the series, it's theme or the genre, this film is destined to be a hit and affably serves as the bridge to the conclusion of the story. The challenge for director, Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend), is to make us willing to wait another year for the final instalment. Lawrence took over the film series for the second instalment, which is arguably the best of the series. With Mockingjay: Part 1 Lawrence does a masterful job of keeping the keeping the story on the front burner at a low boil and draws us slowly into the drama. The story moves seamlessly from the last film and manages to keep the audiences attention. The performances by Jennifer Lawrence, Hoffman and Sutherland felt comfortable and familiar, keeping the relational tension intact for the final instalment. It is difficult to watch Philip Seymour Hoffman in his final performance. An unfortunate loss to the industry, but a welcome addition to this film. Julianne Moore and Liam Hemsworth perform well, but seem like bit players in this portion of the tale. All the other characters are merely window dressing for the set up for the final battle. This leaves them one-dimensional and lacking depth, but serviceable as building blocks for the building storyline. Thankfully, Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) are allowed to flourish and add the needed humour to a relatively somber tale. There is action in this film, but it seems minimal in comparison to previous two chapters of The Hunger Games. This all adds to the needed tension to serve up Part 2. Interestingly, the direction does not play up the love triangle portion between the three lead characters. The story weighs in on psychological tension of the battle between good and evil.For the fans of the book series, the filmmakers have honoured the characters and storyline. For the fans of the movie series, this portion of the story successfully sets up the final chapter. As a film it is good, but merely gets the story to the boiling point . Mockingjay: Part 1 succeeds in moving the storyline along, but is not satisfying on its own. We will sit at the table waiting for the main course... next year.Leaving the cinema... This film was a test of patience. It was not a bad film and did the work that it was supposed to do, set up the last film and make millions of dollars in the process. You will need to see this portion of the series to understand the conclusion. So, go, enjoy the film and then wait until next year for resolution.*This is a film for pre-teens and older due to mature themes and violence.Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 was a good teaser for what to expect in the next part,"I have to admit that when I watched the beginning of this one, I had to fight some sleep. But when Peeta realizes how much in danger Katniss is in, that's when I managed to really stay awake! Julianne Moore is a fine addition to the cast this time. There was a great sequence of Katniss trying to get her sister and her cat back in the building before the doors closed for good. And what happens at the end, wow! Let me also say that what I've seen of Philip Seymour Hoffman is fine. I hope his death didn't affect his scenes too much in both this and the second part due next year. It should be a very interesting ride, that's for sure! So on that note, I very much recommend The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
First hour was really bad but then it started to improve,"This film starts out with some simple drama that is not very interesting. The entire first hour of the film could have easily been consolidated to 20 minutes without effecting anything. On top of this the acting in the first half was horrific. I'm not sure if the actors are to blame or the director. If I had to do it over, I would wait and watch this on Blu Ray right before the final movie releases next year. Save your money and the frustration of sitting through the first half of this film.The second half picked up nicely and we got some story. The acting improved and things started to seem OK. The problem is that I was already half asleep by the time anything happened so I really didn't get absorbed into the movie. I think this is a clear example of how not to break up a story and it is obvious they were simply trying to stretch things out to accommodate an extra box office release.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A huge letdown from a high bar set by predecessors,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it folks, this one is not worth seeing on the big screen. I came in expecting a good experience that I had received from its predecessors, but was left with an utter mess of a film and a disappointment to the name. From watching the previous movies, I know these films aren't exactly 10/10 material, but they are quite entertaining and have some emotional high points. The ones here were few and far between, and Katniss's many emotional breakdowns were not any of them. You know it's bad when the main character becomes a drag and isn't nearly as inspiring (nothing against J-Law). While Haymitch and Effie were awesome once again, they could not salvage everything else. Torrid acting and drawn out sequences that were re-played over and over helped make the story so predictable that even those who don't know the books could figure it outOverall: If you're a fan of the books, you might enjoy this, but if you're looking for a quality work that entertains you, moves you, and gives you the chills you got in the previous entries, skip this one.

Another young adult film that falls short because of the 2 part finale formula,"""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" tells an intriguing tale of how one girl fulfills and becomes the ultimate symbol that changed the world and ignited a rebellion against the Capitol. Although as interesting as it may sound, the film falls short because of the 2 part cash grabbing finale formula that has become a recent trend.If you are planning on going into the theaters to see a satisfying movie that will end on a high note then you are completely wrong. Having read the books a thought kept circling through my mind before watching: ""This movie will surely end in an unsatisfying manner."" having read and realized how short and quite mediocre the book was, and as predicted it ended at the climax and will force you to give more of your money for next year. The movie started well and was faithful to the source material. However, when the climax was nearing it all just fell apart. You have scenes which will bore you and just doesn't get you engaged well enough. JLaw and the veteran actors did well and gave their best, but they do little to save the movie. Visuals improved way better than previous films and were one of the most notable improvements. Shaky cams return and ruin the experience for the most part when there is a tense moment. As for the action, if you've seen the trailers then you've seen most of it. The only high point of the film is the propaganda between the Capitol and the rebellion. It was clever the way the two parties threw their propagandas at each other. Without the propaganda there would be no plot whatsoever rather than the annoying goal of saving Peeta and the love triangle.The film also spends too much time on the bunker rather than showing more of the rebellion and interesting stuff out there. The reason for this is because it's a two part film, of course they'll show more of the interesting parts in the finale. This is the result of a clever excuse for a money grabbing two parter in which you will have to wait for another year to see the next one and for them to steal more of your cash. If this was just 1 whole film, then it could have been better on it's own right judging by the length and simple narrative of the book. But since studios are hungry for money, the movie feels like a long long trailer for next year's finaleTells an intriguing story but falls short because of the 2 part finale formula - Flat and boring scenes +JLaw and the other veteran actors' performance +Visuals -Shaky camera and unwatchable scenes +Propagandas-Less interesting stuff shown6.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Disappointed,"The Hunger Games: Mocking jay-Part 1! The long awaited squeal to the best selling dystopian book series, The Hunger Games. After the success of Harry Potter and Twilight, it seemed like a nice idea to break the final movie of the hunger game series into 2 parts too. But the book isn't that long. Because of that the movie started to drag at moments and the pace of it was slow. But with the amazing cast and widely loved Jennifer Lawrence in it, it's hard not to like. The movie addresses the problem of a stronger government torturing their subjects. Many countries could relate to this today. Overall a good movie. Brilliant acting, well written and really good Cinematography. I personally liked Catching Fire a lot more. The movie primarily set the stage for the final part set to release 20th November next year, kinda like a 2 hour long trailer.The soundtrack by lorde was stunning and perfectly suited the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
How Not To Split a Book into Two,"I am very disappointed in 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1'. So angry, frustrated and furious that in fact I wanted to forget I had ever taken the time to see it. Which is why this review is four months late. I've always considered myself an avid fan of the series and I still do. When I saw the first film I felt the need to read all of the books. Then came the film adaptation of 'Catching Fire'. I loved it and will continue to watch it throughout the rest of my life. But I remained split in two about whether I would like 'Mockingjay' in the weeks leading up to its release. Francis Lawrence directed the previous instalment, but I do not consider myself to be a fan of the last book. Would splitting it in half detract its flaws or add to them. Unfortunately, it piles them on and there was me thinking the book had its fair share of problems, wait until you see the film.This time around Katniss Everdeen having survived two rounds of the fatal Hunger Games is to lead a revolution. The Capitol and President Snow have Peeta and Johanna captive and are seemingly brainwashing Peeta for their cause. However, things are going to be anything but easy, except easy money for Hollywood that is. Katniss initially refuses to join the Rebel's cause and become the Mockingjay. A decision the President of District 13, Alma Coin takes with anger. Coin is portrayed by Julianne Moore who gives a worthwhile performance. She shares plenty of screen time with Plutarch Heavensbee played (in one of his last roles) by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The two provide perhaps the only bearable element of 'Mockingjay', believable and interesting performances from the both of them.Eventually, Katniss leads a rescue mission to bring back the captives and take revenge on the Capitol; except the last part does not even happen. Instead Francis Lawrence gives us the cinematic equivalent to watching grass grow. For all of its 123 minutes, make no mistake, this Hunger Games is one dull, dreary dragged out affair. With no real beginning, middle and end. It feels like a botched job. We watch and wait restless in our seats with bated breath, waiting for something, anything in fact of consequence to happen. All this build up and nothing. No tension, no real drama and no emotional heft or pay off. I would rather fight to the death in the arena than watch Part 1 again.The problem does not squarely rest on the Director's shoulders though. The writing, cinematography, music, most of the acting and the plot all contribute to give audiences one of the worst major releases from Hollywood in 2014. Save for 'Transformers: Age of Extinction'.'Mockingjay' is written in such a way that it drags out scenes for far too long just to pass the two hour mark. There is a scene, I am not kidding that lasts for a good minute or more, where Katniss inexplicably shines a torch at a cat and watches as it tries to attack it. She laughs. We don't. Hollywood does. This is clearly for the cutting room floor and any great Director would know this. Lawrence does not have a clue. Even the cinematography is as bland as they come. The whole film is bathed in shades of grey and any colour is washed out in favour of murky blues and dull blacks. It is a very depressing experience to watch 'Mockingjay'. Especially when you realise that Katniss only fires one arrow, which is the films only legitimate action.James Newton Howard phones it in using his music cues from the previous instalments, he should think of himself as a disgrace. Sadly, Jennifer Lawrence is no good moping, crying and whinging; wherever the old Lawrence is I want her back now! To cap it all off, the film could have been finished in twenty minutes. I am worn out now and I know you don't need me to tell you to avoid this film and to not be fooled by cynical marketing strategies from Hollywood and its hack Directors.In 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1' Francis Lawrence provides the fans with everything that they do not want; a disengaging story, mainly awful performances, dreary cinematography, repetitive music and plodding directing. It is in my eyes time for a revolution against bad film making and bloated runtimes. I have a message for Francis Lawrence if you direct another film we will boycott it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Setting aside the ""Overrated"" and ""Plagiarized"" bias, you'll see a good movie.","Looking at the surrounding reviews you will see how this thinking apparently interferes with people's objective criticism of a perfectly good and technically superior film. They ignore so much.Some fans of Japanese cinema have still been unable to forgive The Hunger Games' resemblance to Battle Royal. They miss out on the bevy of differences and the depth of the setting within The Hunger Games. However tantalizing the world within the movie may be, most reviewers are prone ignore Mockingjay Part 1's greatest strength: Lawrence.No, not Jennifer Lawrence, though she still plays the part well (albiet a tad too heavy handed). The director Francis Lawrence does a grand job of utilizing visual storytelling and cleverly grafting it in with the plot. Also, this is one of the best edited movies this year, next to Interstellar and Edge of Tomorrow. The soundtrack is notable and Lawrence expertly uses and properly represents the power of music in Mockingjay Part 1.Addressing the other common complaint - splitting the source material into two movies: Many condemning Part 1 as a shameless cash grab, they wearily buy a ticket and pout while maligning the talent, time, and money (yes, movies COST money) online by engaging in an aggressive campaign against this ""overrated"" and ""plagiarized"" series. This sort of pessimism will surely prevent anyone from enjoying the emotional effect of this story.In conclusion, this middle movie will be viewed more fondly once it is part of a box set.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Half of a very good blockbuster.,"This movie is basically what you expect before you see it. Without getting too technical, and strange plot devices aside, the directing is good with just a few miscues, much like catching fire. The acting is incredible, though some of the dialogue is cheesy. They didn't take the Harry Potter road of making part one more art driven, nor did they use the extra time to more fully explain the world outside of district 13, which would have been a better choice. Instead they chose to focus more on katniss' inner turmoil. That proved to be a bad choice as the peaks of this movie were actually all events that took place away from her (there is a particularly effective dam scene dealing with members of outside districts). Basically my recommendation would be to wait until part two comes out and watch this right before so you can pretend it was one big movie because this film constantly reminds you that it is only half a story (especially the huge let down at the end of the climax.)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Can't believe I have to wait a whole year for Mockingjay - Part 2.,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 continues with the story of Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence). After Katniss destroys the games forever in the previous film, she is now in District 13. President Alma Coin(Julianne Moore) tells Katniss that she should lead the rebellion against the Capitol. Katniss also finds out that Peeta Mellark(Josh Hutcherson) is in the Capitol. So, Katniss reluctantly becomes the face of the rebellion to overthrow the Capitol & wants to save Peeta at the earliest.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a great film. However, it's not as action packed as the previous two movies in the series. Unlike in The Hunger Games(2012) & The Hunger Games: Catching Fire(2013) there are no actual Hunger Games in this movie. There are just three or four action set pieces in the movie. There is a lot of character development in this movie. Despite the limited action in the movie, it managed to hold my interest throughout. Should they have split the movie into two parts? I don't know. The ending of the film, though an amazing cliffhanger, leaves the viewer wanting more. I know for sure that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2(2015) is going to be epic! Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant as Katniss Everdeen. Lawrence portrays the varying emotions of Katniss with ease. Josh Hutcherson is outstanding as Peeta Mellark. Hutcherson portrays Peeta's vulnerability & fear, effortlessly. Liam Hemsworth is awesome as Gale Hawthorne. I liked the fact that Hemsworth is given more screen time, this time around. Woody Harrelson is amazing as Haymitch Abernathy. Donald Sutherland is menacing as President Snow. Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as Plutarch Heavensbee. Julianne Moore is mind blowing as President Alma Coin. Willow Shields, Sam Claflin, Elizabeth Banks, Mahershala Ali, Jeffrey Wright, Paul Malcomson, Stanley Tucci & Natalie Dormer are spectacular as Primrose Everdeen, Finnick Odair, Effie Trinket, Boggs, Beetee, Katniss' Mother, Caesar Flickerman & Cressida respectively.

Where are the Hunger Games?,"A Hunger Games movie with no Hunger Games? If that was the only problem with this movie.I have no problem with splitting a book into two movies - it worked well with the final Harry Potter book/movies. It has not worked so well with this movie.Why? The movie didn't work on it's own as a movie. It might work just fine as a ""3rd of 4th"" movie, but we won't know that until next year. At this point in time, all I can do is judge it as a movie on it's own - and how it builds on the movies before it.And it just doesn't work.Besides one scene in the middle in District 8, this movie is basically locked inside a bunker in District 13 and we watch Jennifer Lawrence looking angsty over Peeta for 2 hours. The climax isn't really a climax, but will have to serve for a bridge to the next movie.The stellar cast is pretty much wasted - Woody Harrelson, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Stanly Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Julieanne Moore and Jeffrey Wright don't really have much to do. Add on top of that some terrific young actors - Sam Caflin, Natalie Dormer, Jena Malone, Willow Shields - who also don't have anything to do.Only Elizabeth Banks' Effie Trinket shines in this movie in a twist on a character that I have grown to love over the course of these 3 movies.Ultimately, this movie focuses on the ""love triangle"" between Lawrence's Katniss, Liam Hemsworth's Gale and Josh Hutcherson's Peeta.

"Yeah, I don't think this needed to be two films.","I really appreciate the way this series grows from the first entry, and the story in these final two films (I've watched the second part at the time of this review) is actually quite fantastic and bold. It's the execution that's lacking. The film is slow, too slow, and repetitive, too repetitive. Gone is the kinetic energy and sense of urgency that was so prevalent in Catching Fire. The script here isn't balanced nearly as well. I get that the final book is plot heavy, but sacrifices are natural to adaptations. This feels stretched out.Fortunately the film has a great cast, and pretty solid cinematography, even if it's less vibrant than before. The character work is mostly fun, Sad Gale actually does some stuff (but is still a very boring character of a very boring, tedious love triangle). The cast are all excellent of course and the exploration of using propaganda was a great direction for the franchise.Still, it feels greedy splitting the film. It could have been a great, concise trilogy but instead people watching the first two will always have a slog ahead of them.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Better than Catching Fire, But Still Not Great By Any Stretch!","It's so great that they've gotten beyond the arena and are now telling the story of a real war in progress! The best part of this film by far are the action sequences, such as the great lumberjack revolt and the assault on the Hoover Dam. And the ""Hanging Tree"" song and sequence was really moving and gave you a brief glimpse of what this series is always trying to pull off but never actually delivers.The problem is, Katniss is still too passive to carry a story that involves nonstop action. In fact the name of this movie might as well be ""Hunger Games: Pining for Peeta"" because that's all she ever really does. And the love triangle remains really awkward and absent any real sexual tension, probably because the target audience is twelve years old. (""You kissed me because I'm in pain."" You're not the only one, pal. You're not the only one!)At the heart of this series is a fundamental flaw. The film makers want to have it both ways, sending a vaguely populist message while sneering at the great unwashed. In the story, we're told that when Our Girl talks, the common people listen, and that once they get on their hind legs there's no stopping them. Yet we're also told, in a very smug, nudge-nudge, wink-wink sort of way, that the people will never really listen to Our Girl UNLESS she has the right gown, the right hair, the right makeup, etc. etc. It's patronizing and it really grates on you after the fifth or sixth time. The old Hollywood did this kind of thing with much more class, without the condescension.Speaking of the old Hollywood, I must really be getting old, because all through this film I kept closing my eyes and pretending I was watching ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" with Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland (heroic outlaws in the woods bring down a tyrant) or else ""Casablanca"" with Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid. (Steaming hot love triangle set against the backdrop of a fight against unspeakable evil.)And then I opened my eyes, and found out I was out of luck.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good but inconsequential.,"I need to start by stating that I am not a great fan of the Hunger Games Franchise. I have not read the books and so the films have been my only exposure to the series. That obviously coloring my opinion of the films; I quite enjoyed Mockingjay Part I albeit for a relatively singular reason. The story and content of the plot is rich, engaging and enticing.Mockingjay Part I feels like the (partial) culmination of the first two films that come before it. This should be an obvious statement but important as each following film seems to be less independent from the greater whole. The previous films build into the effectiveness of this offering and with your audience primed for hating 'The Man' and baring witness to the difficulties of an essential uprising in the name of freedom which starts Mockingjay on a high and thankfully, it stays there. There are impeccable story moments that Director Francis Lawrence use incredibly well, as well as a few of the expected but emotion provoking 'moments of grandeur' and even the predictable moments similar story arches tend to enjoy. My criticism on this film is that it is too connected and depended on what came before and what will come after. The film is powerful but much of the content is assumed straight from Catching Fire which left me trying to remember exactly where certain characters fit in and which also left me with ample anticipation for Part II of the series resolution, but what does that say of this film? The greater story feels lost while we wait for the conclusion though soaking up such effective story telling while you wait definitely scores some points.I find it a little hard to pin down an opinion on much of the performance of the film. The acting is definitely effective and there is a moment where Jennifer Lawrence really impressed me (I won't spoil beyond mentioning that having an actor in character act badly and keep character is not always that easy and is something I hold commendable). Beyond that the characters do what you expect them to. They react to what you expect in the way you expect, which is a little disappointing. The plot throws a lot of curve balls (in various degrees) at the characters and diversifying their responses would have enriched the whole film to me, but I'm not complaining on what is presented on screen. The style of filming drew my attention a bit, which I always consider a bad thing – unless it is very deliberate. It bothered me the most in the exposition of the film where the change from hand held to stabilized shots felt messy. Some of the editing cuts also felt abrupt (early in the film) which made me aware of 'the line', continuity and other film making concepts I expect film makers to know but which I would like to forget when enjoying a film. The plot didn't really allow for too much use of music to enhance the visuals though I expect we'll be seeing more of that when (if?) the war finally breaks out in the final part of the series.In closing, I enjoyed sitting in the cinema and watching this film. I took some food for thought from it (the main and overly perpetuated theme of the series) and I'm looking forward to the next one. Beyond that, I fear Mockingjay Part I will fade into insignificance.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Mockingjay Part 1 is still The Hunger Games movie that we know and love but by cutting it to 2 Part hurts the movie more than just another year of waiting""","The Hunger Games is an undeniably successful franchise right now whatever you maybe like it or hate it , so here we are having a third movie already.Mockingjay is suppose to be the last final movie of the franchise like the book but the movie just can't help but to follow the hype train about cutting the last final part to 2 parts like Harry Potter or Twilight Saga and this time it's actually hurt the movie more than another year of waiting the Part 2 .First of all i have to say that Mockingjay Part 1 is not a bad movie at all it's still pretty decent but it's probably the worst part of all the three movie in the franchise , and i think because by cutting the movie to 2 parts it's hurt the movie by 1. the director Francis Lawrence can't tell the story freely because he have to spare a lot of stuff to the part 2 which makes his storytelling feels boring and too slow even though the script in this part 1 is not actually that interesting it's talk about the same thing we have been heard like hundred times like love , war , peace and it's not interesting at all .The second reason why cutting the movie to 2 parts hurt the movie is it's lack of moment that represent the unique story about the hunger games franchise , personally i think it is ""the game"" yes the game about people goes to a play ground and start killing each other while the danger is all around and you can trust no one that part i think is the best thing about The Hunger Games especially in Catching Fire which director Francis Lawrence does a wonderful job but this time none of these emotion is in the movie because the movie have to spare that part to part 2 and force that story about war , love and rebel to us which makes it predictable and boring.In the end The Hunger Games : Mockingjay Part 1 is still a decent movie it's not bad at any means but when you compare it to others 2 movie in the franchise it is undeniable worst of all it's seems that by cutting it to 2 parts really hurt the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not worth the theater ticket!,"I have read this series and the 3rd book was a let down, seemed the author was rushed to write it in a week - so disappointing ant Mockingjay 1 is the same. Any part that could have been exciting they didn't show. So many errors that I could not even believe would happen in real life - wont spoil it but anyone intelligent can see the HUGE mistake done by the army. This would never happen in true life!

Warming Up,"The funny fact about Mockingjay - Part 1 is it's a setup for a bigger installment, even though the franchise has already done that with Catching Fire. Predictably, the studio wants to make the same strategy of any successful YA finale have done recently. But after this film, I feel like there should be a rule that not every successful franchise must have a ""split"" conclusion, but this is the part that will definitely be ignored. But seriously, the movie is already good as itself; the storyline is nicely constructed, there's tension even without the noise. This isn't probably the most showy blockbuster you'll see, but there is a terrific quality to be found in any of its scenes, even if the movie itself isn't so satisfying.There are movies exist that has an opened ending and yet satisfies as an experience as a whole. We can point out a number of titles, but one of them is Catching Fire. Although there was a cliffhanger, there is a meaty story embedded within the piece. This one is nothing more than a half part, preparing the audience for the real revolution. To those who haven't read the book and expecting for tons of action, regarding this as a blockbuster hit, would definitely be disappointed. However there is still a fight going on, this is basically a battle where both sides are using the power of media, convincing people to stand along with them. This is an intriguing portrayal of how modern society reach out through politics and other concerns, the movie excitingly rises up tension of bringing unpredictable consequences at every campaign they release.The film put these scenes together with an excellent pace. It just simply gives necessary details at their campaigning precision and concerns what affects would appear outside their district. Overall, even at the scenes of talking in rooms, the movie is totally gripping. The action of the franchise was never about the spectacles, and once again, it's the quiet and grim suspense that make the set piece work. It just keeps showing the unpleasant results of their supposedly glorious revolution. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is engaging, as usual, backed up with also great Julianne Moore and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Donald Sutherland also gives some compelling threat even when his villain character is at the distance. The rest just did what they usual do.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 feels rewarding until it literally stops. This is the major complain one would clamor. What's wrong with an extra hour or more of runtime? But again, we are wasting our breath, the answer is at the corner of obviousness. The movie, again, does a good job at telling its own story, it would have been a way better movie if it just continues without waiting for another year. If we are going to take the series's revolutionary metaphor in our own terms, then: if the first movie is the spark, and the second is (duh) the ""catching fire"", then this one is basically the slow burn. It's not a bad thing, neither is a great one. I mean it's fun leaving the theater with questions scattered around your head and those thrills still looping on your memories, but they could have been wiser by just finishing it. There is hardly any reason for us to wait, in fact, leaving the storyline intact might possibly make it a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very Slow,"This movie was very slow and draw out...not as good as the others. It took forever to explain what they were doing and to get to anything of excitement/the action in this movie.If this movie had been the 1st hunger games, the entire series would be in trouble. With the success of the previous movies, maybe this one had just too much to live up to & that didn't happen.Nothing about this movie will leave you talking or craving the next one. Katniss made her name from her survival skills, the movie made us yearn more because of the action and neither of these surfaced for the 1st hour or 2 of this movie.Slow and Disappointing.

too long and boring,"Went to see this latest chapter of the Hunger Games because I hate to leave things unfinished. I saw the last film and was disappointed with the story and I felt the same about this tale. I do believe that the producers pulled together a stellar cast who definitely make the material seem better than it probably is. Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Philip Seymore Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Elizabeth Banks are all great, elevating every scene that they're in. I still don't care for the character of Katniss always having to be prompted to do the right thing.

Jennifer Lawrence is very good as the heroine, she has the amazing quality of being adorable and yet confident. She shows a wide and convincing range of emotions, and the way she speaks to the camera for the people is very passionate and stirs up the fire inside viewers.It's a thrilling film they kept me on edge all the time.

Disappointing Set-up and Boring Exposition Movie,"This is a waste of time if you are looking into watching this film. It is basically 2 hours of boring exposition that does not satisfy or pay off in the end of the movie. The shallow acting from almost all characters certainly does not help its case, when its elapsed time of action is less than the time of JLaw making weird faces on screen. This movie was an obvious cash-grab that had no purpose other than to make money and set up a finale to the Hunger Games movies. In the end(don't worry I'm not giving out spoilers), the movie does not pay off what it was trying to build up for the whole movie. The whole plot kind of repeated and then becomes redundant towards the middle. The climax is not exciting, because we are too busy seeing Katniss crying, while the real action going on is not being showed on screen. I rated this movie so high, because I am excited for Part 2, and hopefully it will not be filled with the boring garbage that made this film inferior.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Politics, politics.","War movies have always been a favourite genre for me, and in Mockingjay we get war in all it's horror and heroism all tied into a comprehensive and intelligent bundle that is carried effortlessly by Jennifer Lawrence. The direction keeps us focused on Lawrence, she is in 95% at least of the scenes and she dominates. Her portrayal of Katniss as a damaged, fragile and very young girl who is also the main prop of a rebellion against horrific oppression is spellbinding.The fact that the script makes no concessions to the action junkie is IMO at least, only to be commended. The rest of the cast seem to have been inspired by her formidable work. Everybody has raised their game to match her, I can't think of a weak link in the rest of the cast's performances. Liam Hemsworth at last make Gale real. There are too many really to list here. Stand outs for were Josh Hutcherson's Peeta, Elizabeth Banks Effie, Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch and of course Donald Sutherland's Corialanus Snow. A great story needs a great villain and his Snow is both fascinating and repellent.And on a final closing note, this film makes the eternal whining of the so-called BR 'fans' look more pathetic than ever and leaves you scratching your head wondering what film they saw.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It was OK,"The movie starts at a slow pace and that pace is kept. There are more actions scenes at a great scale... but the tempo of the movie is slow. There are some powerful scenes and Jennifer Lawrence shines through. Maybe she is not the Katniss Everdeen that you had in mind after you've read The Hunger Games Books. But she is good, she is good indeed. I was curious about Josh Hutcherson. In this third movie, his character is like a new territory, a wild one. I think, the actor was waiting for this new phase to start. This is his opportunity to shine. He has a very shocking scene and he delivers some very intense acting . But we have to wait to Mockingjay Part 2 to see more of Josh and if he can pull it off. There's a lot more of Liam Hemsworth. He is OK. He has the opportunity to show his acting skills. Julianne Moore is a very good Alma Coin, joyless, cunning and intimidating. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson are perfectly cast.

The worst movie of 2014,"I have to admit that probably never looked more boring blockbuster of this. Stretched to the pain, the enforced acting, empty dialogues, in two hours absolutely nothing worth mentioning, aside from the great James Howard's song sung by Jennifer Lawrence (The Hanging Tree). Unfortunately, I was expecting a lot more after the first two episodes, although we all should be clear when they changed the original decision to extend the trilogy in four parts. The horror of this desperately poor screenplay could not be mended nor sound actors. Hollywood seems to run out of steam...

"Excellent film, cannot wait for part 2!","I have loved these films since the first one was released and have been waiting for this film all year. It was definitely worth the wait! Despite a few changes from the book, the adaptation of the film was great and i think it was a good idea to have split the film into two parts as there was so much detail included. If you haven't read the book then i imagine the film would be slow but for readers all around i cant imagine the experience being anything less than enjoyable.Less action than the first two films without the actual Hunger Games involved however its still just as entertaining and enjoyable.

"The slow, steady and profound drama with the right vibes for a big impending finale","""I wish she was dead. I wish they were all dead and we were too. It would be best.""Ushers in another crucial build to the story so gripping that it would leave you waiting for more. Francis Lawrence who brought us amazing movies like I Am Legend and Constantine, also the previous instalment, who is also going to do the next (Whoopie), is still magnificent underneath the direction cap. His frames are slow, the focusing and the feeling kind, and at the same time extremely powerful. The impact that he makes whilst an actor delivers his lines is a beauty to perceive.Words fail to describe the acting prowess of Jennifer Lawrence. She has this grave demeanour that she carries which at once rivets you to the screen. She is still very dramatic and exhumes the right kind of emotional vibes. And boy! the song she sings is just beautiful! The Hanging Tree. Ah! So powerful and just so right! She carries it gorgeously without any music.The Hunger Games might be over but the perversion of President Snow is still extant. He pervades like Poison and delivers the ultimate blow just like it. We see a lot of Gale here and some Finnick in agony. The screenplay puts all the right words in both their mouths. Even the score that goes in the background is captivating.Mockingjay is a brilliant depiction of the amazing Suzanne Collins series and the finest kind of drama you would ever see, and Lawrence, both the actor and the director, do justice to it.

A nice little build up before the ultimate end game,"Why at the moment and for the past few years have film studios, directors and marketing companies decided to turn the one film into the many? Why have they turned those great novels into a two or three part mini-series? You most likely have heard or even created your own theories as to why they keep doing this to us. For me it comes down to the cash income, the money they can not only make but save, it costs so many millions of dollars to make a movie so if you can make two films at once wouldn't it be rather absurd or perhaps even rude not to take that opportunity? I've heard a lot of people get quite aggressive when one film is split into two but just take a second and reflect as to why. Mockingjay Part One begins quite abruptly in fact I will say this, ensure you have seen the two earlier films ""The Hunger Games"" and ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" otherwise you will be left with a WTF is happening face for a good 30mins into this film. It almost feels it needed a ""Previously on the Hunger Games"" voice over just so we can recap what we may have forgotten, after all it's been a good twelve months since Catching Fire. It begins with Katniss Evergreen played by Jennifer Lawrence waking up after being rescued and in an underground bunker in District 13, there she meets President Alma Coin the Rebel leader played by Julianne Moore, she informs Katniss of the uprising against Central City and Panam's President Snow played by Donald Sutherland and how she want's Katniss to become the face behind the revolution. Katniss decides for her to become the face she needs to see for herself what has become of the districts while she has been away. She soon discovers that Peeta played by Josh Hutcherson her partner throughout the games so far is in Captiol City and has become the voice of President Snow and his mounting war against the rebels, in fact he has become the enemy Mockingjay is one of these films where they made two separate films at the one time, Mockingjay Part one and Mockingjay Part two. The tragic story behind this one though is the unexpected death of one very talented actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, I think one of the things a lot of people will go into the film is to see where or more to the point what scenes the late Mr. Hoffman wasn't around to finalise. Without giving anything away, you will not notice, for the simple reason he had one bit of dialogue left for Part One which they gave to another fine actor Elizabeth Banks who plays Effie Trinket one of my favourite characters throughout all the films so far and the very underutilised (in part one anyway) Woody Harrelson who plays Haymitch Abernathy for his one left over scene in part two. Mockingjay part one is very much the buildup needed for the big and what will hopefully be massive conclusion that will come In part two, so in saying that the film itself lacks a lot of the action the previous two films had there is a lot of dialogue and build up in this movie, a little more character development for the main characters but not a lot else. There is a very heavy underlining good vs evil to the film for those who think way too much I'm sure you'll put the current world's crisis into the positions of the two parties rather than just enjoying what the film has to offer. It doesn't hold back though, the atrocities caused and the thousands murdered will only make you think about the ""what ifs."" I loved the way the director Francis Lawrence ( Constantine, I Am Legend, Catching Fire) created his two very separate worlds, when dealing with the citizens of Capitol City the colours where clean, bright, white, the lights the same, the surroundings rich and filled with stuff and things. Then when he is focusing on the districts the colour palate is dark, the people are brooding, they have flickering lights, gray walls, gray clothing, no makeup no hairstyling and nothing of any great importance but what keepsakes the individuals can carry. I thought that was a great way to tell the two different sides of the story. I enjoyed Mockingjay part one and if being completely honest I really wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did knowing there was Part two to come still and would no doubt be left with some silly cliffhanger for the next year. If you're a fan of the series so far I'd say be sure to see it, just watch the previous films sometime before hand. If you're not a fan get the first two films first and watch them before seeing this one, it is a pretty good series so far and you're only missing out.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

There were so many details in the book that you need to understand what is going on before you jump right into the action. I have read so many complaints that the movie was ""just a two hour preview"", but are you going to just jump into a war without knowing the details first?I, personally, am a huge fan of The Hunger Games books and movies. I think all of the movies have followed the books very well and they did a great job picking the actors. Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job portraying the emotions that she needs and she plays Katniss, the character, very well. She especially did a great job portraying the many emotions of a distressed Katniss after two games. It's also nice to have two extremely attractive prominent characters :). They, too, do a great job of portraying the characters from the book.The plot was not super action-packed, but that's how the book was.

Hunger Pains,"This film is not recommended.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is the third installment of this series. And it's getting progressively worse. This Hunger Games 3 is an incomplete complete mess. It should be more accurately called Hunger Games 2½, as it ends abruptly with the sole purpose to rake in more money from its movie-going audience. However, I do agree with the downtrodden in this film: let's start the revolution, but aim it against the Hollywood studios and their greed.The film starts off immediately from where we ended in Part Two. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has be taken by rebel forces and her love interest, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), has been left behind at the Capitol, captured by the evil President Snow while her close friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) pines forlornly for her. Katniss discovers that her hometown, District 12 has been destroyed and a new band of fighters have joined forces to overthrow the corrupt government, led by female president elect Coin (Julianne Moore, speaking in a low monotone voice that is suppose to resemble authority) who wants Katniss to become their spokesperson and leader of the uprising, its Mockingjay.Misdirected by Francis Lawrence, who doesn't build any tension in this part, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is so S-L-O-W that it appears lifeless. While the other previous films had some spark and wit to them, this one is dreary and sanctimonious. Everyone is way too serious or bland or ready to cry a single tear to show that they are really hurting inside. Believe me, it's the audience that should be crying! A feeling of distress felt by these characters overcame me in the same way as I watched this dreadful film.The actors, especially Jennifer Lawrence as our heroine and a smirking self-righteous Donald Sutherland, do a yeoman-like job with a script that is filled with filler and lots of talk, but very little action. The script by Peter Craig and Danny Strong plods along with none of the speechifying being credible or interesting. Many of the more colorful characters established in this series are undervalued and underused. Fleeting moments of pleasure are given by Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, Sam Clafin, Jeffrey Wright, and the aforementioned Josh Hutcherson. They are mere afterthoughts to the dull sluggish plot. Only the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as a controlling empowered publicist Plutarch Heavensbee and Elizabeth Banks as the vain Effie make an impression, giving the film a hint of comic relief it sorely needs.For a sci-fi adventure film, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 has very little of both, and no hunger games at all. This is one of the more disappointing sequels ever made, not deserving of one more chapter, let alone two.

Missed  opportunity,This being a part one I was expecting a lot of build up with no real satisfying end result and as there isn't going to be a lot of action because of the part of the book they chose to focus on I felt that they had an opportunity and missed it to have some good character development between characters like Finnick and Gale and katniss's movie crew instead of fill up time with the cat chasing a light around.

This Series Is Grueling,"Oh good grief this movie series is grueling.Could have done with fewer scenes of Jennifer Lawrence and Liam Hemsworth sitting around staring at each other, but they did I suppose have to fill out the running time with something seeing as they made the cynical cash grab decision to turn the final book into two movies. I think I don't like Jennifer Lawrence? I'm not sure. She's a good actress, but there's something off putting about her. It makes her perfect casting for Katniss, actually, because most everyone else thinks she's off putting too.I know a dystopian future where people in brown jumpsuits have to live in underground tunnels probably wouldn't be the recipe for a super fun time, but could the movies throw us a moment of levity here or there just for the hell of it? I liked the scene where Katniss is making her demands and she had to refer to her notes before telling the president that her sister gets to keep her cat.

Appetizer,"A pretty long appetizer that is. For its length it doesn't feel dragged or anything, but I still wonder if it was necessary. OK, so character motivation, other people can show off a bit of what they have going for them and the is no Hunger Games going on (it'd be really crazy to do the same movie for a third time, not that people wouldn't watch it though). I only read the first book and I thought that was made in a good fashion (especially considering the narration it had). Not sure how the other two books are built up, but this movie feels like a filler, something to keep you on ""hold"" until you get served the real deal/meal.It'll be in a couple of months from now, so let's see how they bring it to an end and if P.S. Hofmann already had done his scene before his premature departure (may he rest in peace). The scenes here seemed to have been shot alright before that.

"Nothing Deep, But Good Entertainment","Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is in District 13 after she shatters the games forever. Under the leadership of President Coin (Julianne Moore) and the advice of her trusted friends, Katniss spreads her wings as she fights to save Peeta and a nation moved by her courage.Some have said this movie is boring and nothing really happens. I can see that. It has relatively little story, and gets a bit repetitive. Others are banging the drum that this is still a ripoff of ""Battle Royale"", and those folks are still totally correct. I managed to enjoy it despite these concerns.My only issue is that I wish there had been more Jena Malone and less Julianne Moore. Don't get me wrong. Moore is a great actress. But she was horribly miscast as President Coin, and it sort of throws the scenes she is in out of balance.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Katniss accepts her role as the Mockingjay!,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is a good movie! It is thought provoking and raw. I am a fan of the books, and this movie is about 80 percent book. In my opinion, it was a little more faithful than the other two due to the last book being split into two films. It is also better than the book.Most people will say that this movie is pointless. That it was boring. That it should not have been split into two films. These people are wrong.This movie is slow, but that is for the buildup leading into part 2. This is all about Katniss accepting the role as the Mockingjay. She has started the revolution. She knows now that she must lead the districts into rebellion against President Snow. In fact, the districts are rebelling now more than ever, and the war has started. She is in district 13, a district thought destroyed long ago. They have been underground this whole time though, and been planning for the war.This movie is different than the other two. it is darker. It is now transitioning into a war movie. Part 2 will be an even bigger war movie.As for Katniss' romantic involvement, we know now who she is mostly in love with. Will he ever be the same though now that he has been hijacked and wants to kill Katniss?Let the takedown of President Snow continue! In Part 2 will be an all-out war and invading the capitol.

Mockingjay Part 1is a beautifully tragic and a visually stunning work of art.,"The highly anticipated sequel to ' The Hunger Games: Catching Fire ' is a beautifully tragic and a visually stunning work of art.The story picks up right where we left off with the previous movie with Katniss being full of regret because she was saved instead of Peeta and the other tributes. It quickly evolves in this movie about a war and what it means with the underlying theme of the consequences of the games over Katniss and what PTSD can do to you.Jennifer Lawrence brings a marvelous performance and successfully portrays this complex character.  One of the most memorable scenes was when she got back to District 12. We also see Josh Hutcherson a.k.a. Peeta go through many transitions and his acting has only improved since the first film. The newcomers,  Julianne Moore and Nataly Dormer are scene-stealers.Many people,  including myself,  we're afraid that 'Part 1' is going to be dull and boring. It was nothing whatsoever. The pacing was on point and the same goes for storytelling.The director,  Francis Lawrence,  has delivered the best experience you could possibly expect from the first half of the book. There is,  in fact,  humor added which was missing in the previous installments. He had also done this remarkable job at expanding the universe with showing us more from the different districts. The CGI work is better than ever before and so are the cinematography and editing.The score is also very fitting and has borrowed a few things from previous installments. The longly awaited 'Hanging Tree' song is very unique and got stuck into my head.In short,  I can easily say this is the best book-to-movie adaptation and even surpassed the book in a few ways.  The acting and storytelling are phenomenal and the ending is sensational.  The film ends on such a high note and cliffhanger which leaves the fans yearning for the fourth and final installment of the series.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not the best...  But still worth the watch for those who like the books.,"One thing I believe people should always do before they go see a movie is to go in there with not much expectation of a movie. Many of the reviewers here went to see this movie expecting it to be awesome and were disappointed or didn't expect it to be that great and thus saw all the faults rather than the strengths that still brought the movie to light. I am a huge fan of both the books and the movies and am always going to see plenty of movies when I can. My review isn't just my thoughts and opinions, but more of an influence on why you should give the movie a chance.First, we should focus on what a lot of movie goers want in a film and how you should approach this movie. If you haven't read the series, it may seem like Jennifer Lawrence is a terrible actor, when in reality that's just her role in the film. Pick up the book and read it and you will understand her part a lot better. The dialogue may come across as weak, but you need to understand what is going on a bit by reading the book. You won't get a full understanding until then, because the book is from Katniss' point of view and you are reading her thoughts and feelings the whole time. Also, a lot of you people may be all about the action, fighting, and explosions. If that's really all you look for in a movie, then you don't know what you're talking about this being a bad movie.When you look at it from the book's perspective, you get your typical book to film movie. Hollywood almost never takes a book word for word and screws something up that people don't like. I'll admit there were definitely parts that they cut out of the book that I think they shouldn't have, but they did add things in for some of you just movie goers so you will understand what's going on a little better. The one thing I liked about the movie when comparing it to the book is that it still grabs the main and general concept of the first half of the book. The book is by far the weakest of the 3 in the trilogy in a sense that it is drawn out a bit and may come across a as boring sometimes, but when you look down deep enough it does have a strong story. The story is definitely still being told in the movie.I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but like the book it had it moments when it was a little boring. All these other reviews are strongly exaggerated with how boring and how stupid and pointless the movie is, but they are all just opinions. Also, there are always trollers who just hate everything so you can't always trust what other people think. Watch the movie for yourself and develop your opinion on the movie.I give this title 7 stars for a decent movie of a decent book.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Even A Non Reader Can Love This One,"I am an avid fan of the book trilogy, so I was not expecting too many surprises with this movie. Especially considering that I hate the last book in the trilogy. Even so, the way Francis, the cast and the gifted production crew managed to astound and emote me throughout.However, what I found most surprising was how the movie affected my husband. He is not a reader, whatsoever, and indulges my obsession with this franchise because it makes me happy. So, I tend to consider his opinion pretty unbiased. He loved Mockingjay Part 1. He found the plot and character development from the last movie fascinating. He even developed a grudging respect and the pity for Peeta (a character he has only shown disdain for over the last 2 movies because his characterization has been so poorly established). Just about the only thing he didn't like was that the movie cut off--ended. He was so unsatisfied. I asked him if he understood why the movie had to be split, if he believed what he had seen could've been accomplished in that kind of detail if everything that was left to be resolved had been crammed into another 30 to 45 minutes of film. He answered that there was no way to do that and get it right. It would feel like whatever the ending would be would be rushed, unpolished. He then said he still did not have to like it. He does not want to wait a year to find out what happens and, believe me, he does not want any hints. He found the movie compelling.If Mockingjay Part 1 can do this for someone complete uninitiated into the world Collins created... and am going to go ahead and call it a triumph.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The First MOCKINGJAY Feels Like a Major Departure for the Franchise,"The saga of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and the growing rebellion against the capitol of the fictional nation Panem continues in THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY – PART I. A franchise aimed to teenaged girls and, here I am, three movies deep and undoubtedly going to watch the grand finale. Movies based on young adult novels generally send me running (I've never seen the Twilight movies or the Divergent movies, and I never intend to), but I can't deny that this series is actually done really, really well. I actually really enjoyed CATCHING FIRE (the second of the series) and it got me excited to see this one. The movie begins immediately after the previous events, where we saw Katniss being airlifted out of the Quarter Quell games after literally blowing the lid off the whole operation with an electrified arrow that shorted out the force field around the game field. We rejoin her in the mythical District 13; thought to be an unlivable wasteland following a previous rebellion, District 13 operates in tight military fashion from underground bunkers. Far from dead, the inhabitants are going strong and planning the next move against the Capitol. Support for the rebellion is growing in the other districts despite President Snow's (Donald Sutherland) declaration that any sign of dissent be eliminated with extreme prejudice. Now the rebellion wants to rally the people together under the symbol of the Mockingjay/Katniss. But Katniss is suffering a bit of post-traumatic stress from the games and she's worried about Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who we know had been left behind following Katniss's rescue. MOCKINGJAY 1 is the beginning of the end, where Katniss must rise up to meet her responsibility as a figurehead for rebellion even if it means earning President Snow's personal vengeance.First impression of MOCKINGJAY 1, it's a major departure in style from the previous two movies. HUNGER GAMES and CATCHING FIRE were vibrant films, with bright colors all over the scenes in the Capitol and then the beautifully shot wilderness in the course of the games. MOCKINGJAY 1 is the depressing opposite. This is a movie about flickering remains of hope and it wants you to feel the same oppressive dread as the inhabitants of District 13. Gone is the bright wilderness in favor of underground concrete bunkers where the population all wears drab blue jumpsuits. Even Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), the series' resident peacock and Katniss's personal attendant from the Games, is neutered, relegated to patchwork jumpsuits and scarves. All of the beautiful imagery of the Capitol's effluence is gone so that the audience can be brought down the reality of their suffering. While the first two films would probably be considered action/adventure with science fiction elements, MOCKINGJAY 1 is a war film (with sci-fi elements). No joke, this is a war film closer in spirit to PLATOON or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (though, of course, toned way down as to be appropriate for a younger audience). We confront the realities of conflict such as refugees, collateral damage, and self-sacrifice for the common good. It's nuts and nothing like I expected. At one point, Snow callously orders the bombing of a refugee hospital in one of the districts and we're right there with Katniss as, after everything she's already been through, she watches the incineration of men, women, and children and can do nothing to stop it. Heavy stuff for a teen movie.These movies have, no doubt, made Jennifer Lawrence's career. She is a talented woman and these movies brought her into the spotlight where she was able to latch on to bigger and better things; yet she still continues to return to the character that brought her to the top of her game and she still gives it her all. Katniss, in MOCKINGJAY 1, is at her worst. She's mentally-broken, she's terrified for Peeta, and she is constantly reminded of the pressure on her shoulders as the one person who can unite the districts against the Capitol. In the previous movies, she's shown the strength and conviction of her character but now she's getting angry. Lawrence handles it all effortlessly and brings the viewer along with her in what serves as her character's big transformation. On these same lines, it's worth mentioning the pedigree of acting talent these movies attract. In addition to the returning cast from previous movies (including Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Jeffrey Wright, and Philip Seymour Hoffman), MOCKINGJAY 1 adds Julianne Moore as President Coin, head of District 13 and the rebellion. She's the no-nonsense sort who oversees operations in 13 with military precision, but her intentions seem pure. She recognizes the importance of Katniss's involvement but she's rightfully hesitant at first to put all her faith into one girl and risk everything she's accomplished so far. Hoffman and Liam Hemsworth get upgraded to larger roles. Hoffman (as Plutarch Heavensbee) has betrayed the Capitol and operates as Coin's head of propaganda, and Hemsworth (as Gale, Katniss's former flame from her time in District 12) is now a militant rebel intent on doing his part in bringing down Snow. Having been out of the picture during Katniss's time in the Games, the two of them reconnect but he's no longer interested in pursuing their relationship as a) he's got more important things to worry about now and b) Katniss has obviously developed feelings for Peeta. This not-quite-love-triangle is mercifully given little screen time whereas other young adult movies would probably make it the focus.MOCKINGJAY 1 is a drastic departure from the tone of the first two movies and I wouldn't be surprised to find out it may've turned off some of the younger viewers. It's a pretty good film but you can tell it's just killing time until MOCKINGJAY 2 for the big final battle. Despite some pacing flaws and the general aura of depression, it's a nice lead-in to the final act and an interesting progression for the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The Plot Thickens, Or Does It?","Just when we thought we had a new complex and interesting female character—a true heroine—this latest entry shows her spending half (or even more) of the time talking about and crying over boys. Her motivations become so muddled by yet another generic YA love triangle (screaming over Peeta and listlessly kissing Gale). This all certainly isn't helped by the fact that Jennifer Lawrence seemingly just doesn't understand the acting technique of subtlety. Her highly hysterical/overreacting character leaves much to be desired in regards to actual nuance—a case that would allow the viewers to look into her eyes and judge for themselves. Lawrence's sheer overacting has dominated most of her work since the Oscar win (actually, including Silver Linings Playbook as well) with this manner becoming even more noticeably cringe-worthy with Mockingjay Part 1. Her loud- mouthed/attention-provoking, apparently ""real"" persona has won many people over and her way of forcing her ""acting"" in audiences' faces (weeping, yelling, or generally acting in aggression in almost every other scene) makes it unsurprising as to why she's still in the public's favor.As for the narrative, the stakes always appear so heightened and forcibly gloom, but the resolutions are always so perfect to the point where it's difficult to seriously believe in the peril of the story's characters. In this addition, Katniss Everdeen has fully assumed the ""Mockingjay"" symbol—a public leader for the final revolution against the Capitol. More and more of the district's citizens have become aware of the atrocities committed by its government and the vileness of the Hunger Games. It's time to courageously fight back! Each one of these films possess very obvious—perhaps, even heavy-handed—analogies to the contemporary climate and the world's current circumstances when it comes to ""radical"" revolutionaries, government control/failure of democracy, media influence, etc.Considering that the series' premise centers on people who're forced to kill each other in order to survive, our primary characters always end up fine by the conclusion. ""Is he dead?"" ""Did they die?"" No, not for a minute am I convinced that anyone is on the brink of death. Maybe they'll make the drama and danger genuine in the finale next year, maybe not. Then again, it's the same annoying issue every expensive blockbuster suffers from these days, especially the Marvel films. (Yes, I know this is a film adaptation of a book series that's following an already-created narrative; it still doesn't change anything about the tale's quality or the right to criticize it.) On the other hand, this time around, we thankfully don't have to deal with the utterly predictable and tedious hunger game sections. Part 1 of this two-part climax reminds me of the first part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in that it focuses more on the set-up and grounded drama rather than the explosive ultimate battles, meaning that I'll likely prefer this one to next year's (yes, I much preferred the first part of Harry Potter's finale to the last half).Moreover, the stunning visuals/cinematography really does improve with every installment. The look of these films always seem to darken and grow starker with every new entry; the style of the franchise is very much its distinctive own. As a matter of fact, the exceptional sound mixing and grand production design drastically help distinguish this franchise from the innumerable cheap YA rip-offs that came after its success.Nonetheless, the overall cast, filled with bland pretty boys and unremarkable veteran performances, makes the entire film (which, keep in mind, is considerably shorter than its predecessors) feel like somewhat of a bore to get through. The objectives for the characters are set into motion fairly quickly, but most of the film is wasted on needless dialogue and repetitious scenes (""I love Peeta,"" and then, ""we have to rescue Peeta!"" about a dozen times throughout). It only makes it that much more obvious that the studio simply separated the films to blatantly cash in on the property—the newest irritating trend in the industry.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Watchable,"The film is more like a 6.5 but I decided to round up. Hollywood could have combined this film and the next Mockingjay (when it comes out) by adding maybe an extra 15-20 minutes in the beginning. There was so much filler in this movie, it was ridiculous. I was however, somewhat entertained throughout the movie even though there wasn't much action. It was probably the fact that the acting was decent. The one thing that will annoy you is Jennifer's whining in this movie.If you can watch it for free, you may as well (currently on Amazon Prime Video) otherwise I would not pay money to see it. You won't walk away amazed. You pretty much have to watch this in order to see the last one anyways, which is supposedly going to have lots of action (according to those who read the book). I refused to pay money so I waited so long to see this one because of the fact they split it up to make more money.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty good job with this one,"I read all three books of this series a few times. The first two were terrific, and no matter how many times I read the third book I just plain didn't like it. I didn't like the direction the story went, it lacked excitement and what made this series so interesting was completely missing.I wasn't crazy about the first movie, the second one was vastly improved and this movie might have been the best adaptation of the book that I've seen yet. I can tell you that this movie was more interesting to me than the first half of the third book. I've been going to the theater with the same group of people for all of these movies and I expected this one to be really bad and it wasn't. It kept my attention, the acting was decent (except for Liam Hemsworth, I still fail to understand why he's allowed to be in movies) and it created some suspense that the book didn't have. Aspects of the book that seemed downright silly didn't appear that way in the movie. It gives the finale some hope, not that I wouldn't go see it anyway.I give it an honest 7 out of 10 and I'm a pretty hard grader. It's worth going to see. It doesn't have the pizazz that Catching Fire did, but they're on the right track with this one. And a big reason it's not higher is because of the lack of material they had to work with. The last book in this series was really bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A Very Good Effort, Best of the Series Thus Far, But it Could've Been Great Without the Jolting One-Year Split","Literally half of a movie in every sense of the word. Mockingjay has all the piece-placing, anticipation-building and scene-setting with none of the payoff, and that can make it feel terribly flat. President Snow is a ruthless dictator. The capital lives in the lap of luxury. The lower districts are ready to revolt. These plot points were already established in the first two films, and here they're only further reinforced and expanded. When its second half arrives, this will probably feel much stronger than it does today, which is an interesting proposition because despite its inherent flaws it's very well-made. The landscape (both physical and political) is startlingly realized, easily the most grimly authentic of the series, and the majority of its star-studded cast carries their roles above and beyond what I'd encountered in print. The exception, strangely, is Philip Seymour Hoffman, who quite clearly doesn't seem himself. It's a very unusual performance, one that instantly reminded me of Orson Welles's presence in the 80s animation Transformers: The Movie. Of course, Welles also passed just before completing his work, and with the benefit of hindsight it's clear that both already had one foot out the door. The film works, often quite well, but it's just not a whole product and that's problematic. Still, it's appropriately weighty, dark and explosive, with more depth than I thought it was capable of: an ultra-rare case of the screen outdoing the book.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A great political thriller,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is the 3rd installment to the very popular 'Hunger Games' Series. Going into this movie you must know, There are no games, There isn't a lot of action but there is killer suspense, and great acting by Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson.The film begins where Catching fire left off, in the opening scenes I thought I was watching a Horror movie, It WAS that dark. In District 13, Katniss Everdeen is very emotionally unstable as she learns that her hometown District 12 is destroyed and no longer exists.District 13 Leader President Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) Try to convince Katniss to become the symbol for the long brewing revolution, but Katniss Isn't down with that, not until Coin agrees to rescue Peeta and the other tributes.This film is very dark and emotional, scene after scene there are people being executed, shot to death or blown up. But there's also a great action sequence in the movie that features ""The Hanging Tree"" sung by Jennifer Lawrence, Which she did a great job of.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a great political thriller, it is mostly a media war consisting of Propaganda video vs Capitol Propaganda video. Towards the end of the film it gets very intense and suspenseful, the ending scenes reminded me of Zero Dark Thirty, so if you enjoy extremely emotional films and War. This is one you want to watch.But if you're expecting tons of action sequences, maybe waiting for Part 2 is something you should consider. I think people have confused themselves into thinking Part 1 will be full of action, it isn't, but It's very good and stays true to the book, in fact the most faithful book to movie adaptation I've ever seen.That's why I give The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 | 8/10 Stars, Roll on Part 2.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

But, despite Katrina agreeing to become The Mockingjay, her main aim is to rescue Peeta, who is being held by the capital in the quaterquell.After slow start, the movie soon kicks into gear and sees Katrina (Jennifer Lawrence.) back to her bow and arrow weal-ding best. The sets are massive and the look and feel of desolation is quite something to behold.

Review For The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014) Movie,"Fortunately, it has Jennifer Lawrence, and that alone, is enough to pull the entire movie away whenever it leans toward making the audience fall to sleep. Jennifer's charm proves to be the biggest asset of this movie, and she alone, singularly saves the film from being a total nonsense. Toward the end, it isn't clear whether the makers of the film have made their point (aside from making more money of course) in splitting the book into two movies. This first half only presents a preview of what to happen next in the other half, only stretched into two hours of tiring sameness and boring exchanges of bland dialogues. The new characters are interesting yeah, but I'm not sure if anyone of them has offered something more than Lawrence, to spark further interest. Well, at least we can take comfort from the fact that the last movie next year will certainly offer a lot more, gripping action and drama, and that's really something to look forward to.Mockingjay Pt.1 falls below the heights reached by the previous two films. Minus Lawrence, this film is a real bore, and its hard to seek something more than her to recommend. I give this film 6 of my 10 stars.

Mockingjay Reminder: The FIRST PART of the THIRD Book...,"After two utterly fantastic films, The Hunger Games returns with the third installment, which is the first part of the third book of the trilogy.Got it? Good.And the film delivers exactly what I expected. And because of this, it is, indeed, the weakest installment thus far.Why? Well, reread my first sentence. It is the first part of the third book....which means that, from the third book, all the good stuff is going to be in the SECOND part and this whole film is all about ramping up to the (what will most assuredly by) the epic conclusion of this series.That being said, this film still has many strengths, including Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence as she continues to shine as Katniss, this time as the woman who needs to rise and lead District 13 into a full on rebellion against The Capital while still trying to overcome the mental stress of all she has been through. And, of course, the very odd inclusion of the always great Julianne Moore as the rebellion leader, President Alma Coin.The groundwork which is set by the film no doubts raises expectations of the final film very high, but I could not also help by feel that there seemed to be things even I missed as I watched this film. As I sat there, taking it all in, I wondered exactly what Effie (Elizabeth Banks) was doing there....it kind of went unexplained. Exactly how much time passed between the last film and this one? And it seemed like a lot of my questions stems from items that were, indeed, somewhat changed from the book. Effie should not be such a prominent character this early on in the final story, but Banks' character proved to simply be too popular to ignore.That would be the only major downfall of this installment, and that is the lack of clarification of key points brought up in the film. But beyond that, everything else was right on par and I am most certainly looking forward to the final installment hitting theatres next November 20th.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Hanging Tree,"Greetings again from the darkness. I'm now even further removed from the target demographics than for the first two Hunger Games movies. Regardless, I have read Suzanne Collins' trilogy and have now seen the 3 movies based on her books. Oh, wait. There will be FOUR movies, not three, from her source material. By definition, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is a warm-up act ... it's setting the stage for the finale which will be released in one year.So for this one we get a Hunger Games movie with no Hunger Games. In fact, there is very little combat action at all. Instead, we are witness to the strategic planning and ""selling"" of a war (think Wag the Dog), replete with short promo videos featuring Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) as the Mockingjay ... the rallying symbol of the rebels. There is a terrific scene featuring four great actors: Jennifer Lawrence, Julianne Moore (as President Coin), Jeffrey Wright (as Beetee) and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Plutarch). Four great actors in harmony elevating a movie based on YA novels. Pretty cool.With no Hunger Games, the color palette of the film is almost entirely grays and browns. Even Julianne Moore's famous red tresses are toned down to a streaked gray. The bleak look reminds of the Metropolis set, and also makes President Snow's (Donald Sutherland) vivid white wardrobe and beard stand in contrast to rest. Mr. Sutherland has another juicy scene flashing his devilish grin and twinkle. He's another example of the perfect casting, which extends to Elizabeth Banks (Effie), Woody Harrelson (Haymitch), Stanley Tucci, and Mahershala Ali (as Boggs). You should expect much less Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) this time, but a little more Gale (Liam Hemsworth).Jennifer Lawrence proves again that her recurring role as Katniss is underrated from an acting perspective. She is now best known as an Oscar winner, but that doesn't affect the sincerity, emotion and tenacity that she exhibits here.This ending of Part 1 feels a bit awkward, but the break comes at the right time considering how the book is written. If you are a fan of the franchise, just accept that you will be buying a ticket for this move as well as next year's finale.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good half of a chapter; it'll be essential viewing come 2015,"I find reviewing ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" to be kind of tricky. I'm literally seeing half the story, which means we have a beginning, a middle and kind of an ending, but not really. I suppose in a way the movie feels somewhat underwhelming, but then again, anytime you go into a movie where a portion of the title is dedicated to ""Part 1"", can you really expect a big action-packed climax and a resolution to all of the plots? It tells you from the get-go that you're only seeing half the movie here. Despite this, on its own, we are just seeing the first half of a bigger story and that makes this easily the weakest of all of the ""Hunger Games"" films. Does that make it bad? Not at all, it just means that it is incomplete. I think it's only fair that we all re-evaluating how good this film is when the whole story is concluded, but I still feel like in the mean time, there's plenty of material here to make it worth your while. If you haven't seen the previous chapters, this is not a good point to suddenly jump in. At the end of the last film, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her new allies escaped from the Hunger Games. Unfortunately, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) has been left behind and captured by President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Learning that her home District has been completely annihilated by military forces as punishment for her rebellion, Katniss prepares herself to become the symbol of the rebellion against the Capitol.While in the first two films there was plenty of action to balance out the character drama, this film is much more focused on the emotions of the characters. There are a lot of things going on here. Peeta has been captured by Snow and he's probably feeling pretty betrayed by the fact that he's waiting on Katniss to come and rescue him. Our heroine feels guilty about leaving her friend (is it OK to call him her boyfriend at this point?) behind and also feels outrage at what happened to her home. She wants to go up to the old tyrant and shoot an arrow right through his forehead. On the other hand, she doesn't want to get manipulated into being a figurehead for a cause she doesn't believe in. Then we've got other angles as the relationship between Katniss and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) is being tested and the strange relationship between Snow and Katniss. Just because you're not going to see nearly as much of Katniss jumping around shooting her trademark bow, doesn't mean this film is lacking in material. Seeing the movie actually really made me appreciate the performances and the characters that we've seen develop throughout these films. If you're planning on seeing ""Mokingjay part 1"", I'd highly recommend that you freshen up on the first two films, particularly if you haven't seen them since they were released in theatres because it will give you a whole new appreciation for the story that's developing here.There is a good mix of big developments and small intimate moments here. As much as I liked seeing the seeds for the rebellion against the Capitol being sown and seeing Katniss debate whether or not she wanted to join up with the fight, I think I actually enjoyed the quieter moments more. I realized that some of the characters that I didn't take seriously when the series started have really started to grow on me. The best example has to be Elizabeth Banks as Effie. I distinctly remember thinking that her character was just a generic, airhead minion for the big bad in the first film, but now more than ever I see her as a truly three-dimensional character. If we have to sacrifice action for more intimate moments with the people of this world, I'm not entirely opposed to it. I'm even less offended at the idea knowing that when the next part of the story comes around, all of the big action and epic conclusions we've been waiting for since 2012, when the first ""Hunger Games"" was released is going to be there. A bit of quiet time before the storm ensures that everyone watching the movie will care about what the outcomes are.I'll admit there were times where I did find myself craving sequences with Katniss going around kicking butt instead of seeing the dominos get set up for the big conclusion. Combine that with the fact that the movie has an ending, but not a big splashy one like you would prefer seeing and yes, that does mean that some people are going to be disappointed with this film. Just keep in mind that there is more coming. This is only Part 1, and they're getting ready to load that one in the firing chamber, it's not like there's any chance whatsoever that we're not going to get a conclusion to this franchise, so just calm down. ""Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" is setting up the high stakes for the final fight, and it will be essential viewing when November 2015 comes around. If you're a fan of these movies, just keep that in mind and I think you'll be more than happy with the movie, even happier when part 2 finally arrives and we get to see how it all comes together.

Moves and countermoves.,"'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014)' is far too slow for its own good. The adaptation of 'Mockingjay' didn't need to be split into two parts; doing so dampens only the effect of both movies. What stops it from being a complete waste of time is the fact that it's actually quite conceptually interesting, ditching the series' customary death games in favour of a propaganda battle which comments on the use of manipulated media in wartime. The hero is transformed into an unwilling mouthpiece for the rebellion, used by the seemingly 'good' District 13 as much as she was used by the more obviously 'evil' capitol. The difference is that here she is weaponised as a means of rebellion, whereas before she was meant as a reinforcement of oppression. Sadly, the film itself is honestly rather dull for most of its runtime. It takes ages to get going and never quite gets out of second gear. It lacks a true finale, principally because its sequel is an extended version of it, and just isn't as compelling as either of its predecessors. It isn't bad, but it's certainly the weakest in its series.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another cheap cash grab with no plot.,"The movie has barely any substance to it at all because new line cinemas had the genius idea to make the slowest, shortest and worst book into 2 parts. The plot consists of Katniss finding a bunch of nothing and talking to people once. She barely does anything at all that genuinely has anything to do with the plot. The movie is abysmal at best and should be avoided so movie companies stop ruining finales by splitting them into 2 parts. The same thing happened with Harry Potter. Part 1 was slow, dull and overall, a horrible experience. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 follows the same pattern. Maybe the second part will be OK, but based on the first two movies, I wouldn't get your hopes up.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I loved every minute of it!,"'THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY - PART 1': Five Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in the blockbuster film series, based on the bestselling young adult book trilogy by Suzanne Collins. This chapter is based on the first half of the final book (titled 'Mockingjay') and deals with Katniss Everdeen (once again played by Jennifer Lawrence) having to become a symbol for the rebellion, in their war against the ruthless Capitol. It was directed by Francis Lawrence (who also directed 'THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE') and written by Peter Craig and Danny Strong. Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland, Sam Claflin, Jeffrey Wright, Stanley Tucci, Willow Shields, Jena Malone and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman all reprise their roles from the other films and Julianne Moore joins the cast. I loved every minute of it and in many ways think it's an improvement over the previous two films!The story picks up right where the last film left off; Katniss (Lawrence) has suffered a mental breakdown and is having a horrendous time adapting to life at District 13, with the other rebels. She also can't get over the fact that Peeta (Hutcherson) was taken by the Capitol and she'll do almost anything to get him back. Plutarch (Hoffman) introduces Katniss to the leader of the rebellion, President Coin (Moore), and they ask her to be their movement's symbol, in propaganda adds, to incite a rebellion. She reluctantly agrees under the condition that they rescue Peeta, and the other captives at the Capitol. The rest of the film deals with Katniss struggling to adapt to her new role, as the face of the revolution; 'The Mockingjay'.There's been some criticism over the fact that the final book was split into two films and that there's not enough action in this installment to make it as worthwhile a filmgoing experience, as the other movies. I strongly disagree. I think this chapter is much better because of it. There's so much character development and believable human drama that any true fan of film should be thoroughly satisfied. We also get some great acting; Lawrence gives the best performance of the series here and it's arguably one of the best of her career. She also has a lot of help from multiple veteran actors, like Hoffman and Moore. Peeta doesn't have nearly as much screen time, as he did in the other movies, but he's always a strong and pivotal part of the plot. Gale (Hemsworth) is in a lot more scenes, this time around, but he's still just as underdeveloped (he has one powerful dialogue moment though; where he's at least given a chance to show some acting ability). The love triangle definitely doesn't feel necessary anymore, it's obvious that Katniss loves Peeta but the certainty of how Peeta's character will end up is certainly still up in the air. I also enjoyed how much more epic this film feels, over the last two, it really feels like the first half to the conclusion of a classic sci-fi trilogy. The directing, cinematography and music are all breathtaking to watch, as well, and we get to hear Jennifer Lawrence sing!

Simply Horrible and Unnecessary,"I like many could not wait for this movie to come out, be of a big fan of the first two. But this two hour snooze fest was utterly worthless and purposeless. God I wish there something good to be said about this movie, because lord knows it's a damn good story and features a great cast. But this is Hollywood greed and short sightedness at it's absolute worst. They took one book and attempted to split it into two films, essentially taking one or two minor plot points and stretching them out over two unenjoyable grueling hours. If you have NOT seen this film yet do yourself a favor and wait for it to show up on cable for free AND for you to be terribly ill and perhaps half out of it on medication, for you'll need to be to be in order to endure this plot less plodding mess of a film. Simply out there is no movie here. Just a lot of better than fine actors walking around doing nothing. It's that bad. Words cannot do justice to what a snoozer piece of crap this waste of good money is. Let us hope they deliver more in Part two.

Money Making Gimmick but the Film is Good,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part 1 (2014)*** (out of 4)The third film in the popular series appears to be getting some heat from fans and critics and for some pretty good reasons but at the end of the day there's no question that the film contains the great acting and compelling characters from the previous two. This time out, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is recruited by President Coin (Julianne Moore) to lead the rebellion against the Capitol but her heart remains with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and makes her question what she should do.I guess I'll start with the controversy. People have complained that not much really happens in this film and I would certain agree with that. It's clear that the studio wanted to make as much money as possible so they broke this final film into two so that people would have to fork over double the money. By doing that they've made part 1 someone laid back, character driven and without too much action. I understand the studio wanting to make money but at the same time I can't help but think that everything covered in this here's two-hour running time could have been done in forty-five minutes and then we could have gotten to the events that are going to be in part 2.WIth that said, it's somewhat hard to really be too critical of the actual part 1 because once the second film is released we can just view them as one and when that happens, I think fans and critics will be a little kinder to this here.I thought for the most part the story was good and I didn't mind too much that they tried to deliver more of a character and emotional drama than just pure action. I thought there was one reason this work and that's because we're given such a terrific cast who are strong enough of actors that they can keep us drawn in. Lawrence, who has obviously became one of the best actresses out there today, has no problem in her role, although I must admit that I wondered if the screenwriter was just wanting to see how many different ways she could cry. Either way, Lawrence was terrific as is Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Moore and of course the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Both Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth are good as well.I will say that visual the film was pretty impressive and I thought the CGI here was much better than in the previous two movies. The music score is top-notch as you'd expect and there's no doubt that the cinematography perfectly captures everything. Again, I understand why people feel ripped off but in the end, the entertainment value is what counts and while this is the weakest of the three films, there's no question that it does its job in making you want to see the next installment.F.T.B.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The series is back on track.,"Rather ironically, the extremely disappointing Catching Fire all but extinguished my interest in The Hunger Games franchise, delivering more of the same, but with less regard for logic. Yesterday, I begrudgingly watched Mockingjay Pt 1 with my son, and was surprised at how much I liked it.What makes this penultimate chapter so much better than its predecessor—despite being rather light in the action department—is the progression in the story, which is now far more epic in scope, following Katniss as she leaves the confines of the Hunger Games arena to become The Mockingjay, the face of District 13's rebellion against President Snow and his dictatorship. What started out as a rather blatant teen version of Battle Royale has developed into a complex, gritty political drama wrought with emotion, its star Jennifer Lawrence now able to deliver a powerful performance worthy of her talent.Having fanned life back into the once dying embers, I hope that Mockingjay part 2 will end the series with a bang, packing in some of the action that this one clearly held back from delivering.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 Review,"Following her rescue from the devastating Quarter Quell, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) awakes in the complex beneath the supposedly destroyed District 13. Her home, District 12, has been reduced to rubble, and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) is now the brainwashed captive of President Snow (Donald Sutherland). At the same time, Katniss also learns about a secret rebellion spreading throughout all of Panem, a rebellion that will place her at the center of a plot to turn the tables on Snow.So I didn't see any of the movies or read any of the books but I am still aware of the series and all of its three (and almost four) films so far. I think I must have been the only one who hasn't yet. It's human nature for things in the second film to not seem as climactic when you've previously known things about films past and future. This review will be based on this.So this is the last one before the next entry comes out. This one picks up right where the last film, Catching Fire, left off with Katniss (Lawrence) being saved from the last Hunger Games. She wakes up within the underground complex comprising the supposedly destroyed District 13. She soon learns of a rebellion developing amongst the other 11 districts. District 12, Katniss and Peeta's (Hutcherson) home, was destroyed by President Snow (Sutherland) and the Capitol. This rebellion, led by President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), hopes to unite the people of the remaining districts against Snow and the Capitol. Seeing that Katniss has gained a following amongst the people of the Districts following her actions in the last few Hunger Games, Coin and Heavensbee aim to court her to be the face behind their rebellion. Initially skeptical of joining, she eventually decides to join. With interference from the Capitol and the brainwashed pleas to stop the war by Peeta who was kidnapped by the Capitol, Katniss must rally the people of Panem to their cause. So the film took a different direction from the previous two films in that it is less about the actual Hunger Games (which I've always found silly) and more about developing the backstory behind the world which I've enjoyed so far. I still don't know how their world came to be but seeing it as it is now was interesting enough. I just wish I had seen more since I didn't get a chance to see the results of their actions just yet which is why I hate it when they split stories into two films. Also because of that (I think), there wasn't as much action as I would have liked but I think they might (I hope) make up for that in the next part. The one thing that has been consistent with the series so far has been the quality of the acting and it is no different here. I found that Lawrence and Hutcherson did the best with what they had which was primarily set up for the next film. I think Hutcherson was good but I did not agree with the use of his character in this film as I found that it did not add much. I also thought the returning supporting characters, Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), and Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) (just to name a few), were good as well. Some may not like the pace of the film since it is a little slower than previous films and the purpose of the film serves as buildup for the next film but I mildly disagree as I thought it could have been better but I wasn't completely disappointed. Overall, this is another decent entry in the series, albeit a buildup to the next film. I'll just say that the next film better be great.Score: 6.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Where did Katniss go? And why I bother...,"First, let me start with saying that I do like a lot of books that has been made into movies. I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter movies/books and loved ""The Golden Compass"" and was so sad that the sequels of ""His dark materials"" where cancelled. So I do understand and generally don't mind that a movie can never capture a book completely, and that sometimes it's necessary to change or remove some scenes. My problem with The Hunger Games movies – and this one especially – is that it's not the scenes that's been altered but the personalities of the characters. When doing so, it becomes a completely different movie. Think of it, what if you put Winne the Pooh and his gang into the Avengers movies or vice versa? Yes, maybe it would have been really interesting movies, but you would never dare to claim that it is a remake of the book.Katniss, but also Johanna, Haymitch, Gale, and several more characters have become something a lot more mainstream. And I'm usually not a feminist, but I can't help but getting really annoyed that Katniss is so weak, bleak and boring in the movie. In the books she has all of these strengths and weaknesses and not to mention free thinking of her own – while in the movie(s) she's just showed around like a pawn and not bothered about it at all. Given that this is a movie with a younger audience I think it's so sad to withhold them a picture of a strong female role model, a young woman who both bleeds and fights. In the books people are afraid of her, admire her, trusts her, loves her. But in this movie she just becomes this boring girl who rarely speaks up and even more rarely are being listened to. Why are we still so afraid to make a movie with a strong, female role model? If you are watching this with your teen daughter, or if you are reading this knowing that she has or will see this movie, give her the books. Show her who Katniss really are.If I try to put this aside, as hard as it is, you end up with a good movie. It's not amazing, but it is your time worth. You have some really strong actors who are really giving their everything to the script. Kudos to both Harrelson (Haymitch) and Hutcherson (Peeta) for trustworthy playing their roles as two of the most important characters next to Katniss. The scenes are most of the times breathtakingly beautiful and Suzanne Collins world of tomorrow has really come alive. One thing I can't help thinking though is; if you haven't read the book to you really get what the fight is about? I'm afraid without more of the questions raised in the background, this just becomes another ""fight the bad guy just because we said he was a bad guy"" movie. And what message does that send to the audience? And as a viewer, if this movie just blends into any other teen action movie, then what's it really worth?Teachers – read the books with your students and especially teachers in higher grades working with media related subjects, bring these thoughts into your classroom. And if you aren't a teacher or a concerned parent, watch this and sit through two hours of good enough action.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
what a bad movie!,"I wasn't a fan of the first 2 Hunger Games movies. I thought that the first one was a bad version of Battle Royal (yes, no matter how the writer denies it, there are too many similarities to the story for it to be a coincidence). The second movie I just found terrible. I didn't plan on going to see this third movie, but my friend convinced me to go anyway. I didn't plan on reviewing this movie, but I was so annoyed by it that I had to. The writing for this movie is just awful. I can't blame the actors for their performances, there is only so much they can do with the material. I think they did okay with what they had, but that didn't make it good. Overall the movie was just boring. The pacing was really slow. Not a lot seemed to be happening. And just when I thought it couldn't get worse, Katniss starts to sing a horrible song. And when I thought it couldn't get worse than that, a choir starts to sing along with her! I would never ever recommend this movie to anyone. I must not be the right audience for it. What I would have liked to have seen in this movie was Katniss and Peeta get together and be forever referred to as either KatPee or PeeNiss. I'd settle for any one of those.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Watching the fate of my own country,"The day I took my mom to see Mockingjay, was the morning we learned that our previous president/dictator Mubarak has been counted innocent after all the youth he's murdered in 2011.

I bet the many fans of this film (who are just obsessed with the love triangle) are not aware of how realistic and relevant it is to events happening in Egypt, and in other corrupted political systems around the world.I will NOT try to refute all the reviews that deemed this film as 'BORING'. I understand their argument, but this film is an indispensable emotional transition between a story about a brutal reality show, to a story about a freaking revolution!! And if you see it that way, it won't be boring!!The military corruption and spirit of rebellion captured in the film, is something all Egyptians like me have lived through. The whole cast rendered this spirit beautifully. Jennifer Lawrence, I was so happy that she pulled off that rage that makes the audience hate brutal regimes (The Capital) as much as Katniss does. Josh Hutcherson gave a powerful heart-breaking performance that reminds me of all the brainwashed people we have in Egyptian media. And last but not least, Mr. Sutherland successfully portrayed our previous AND CURRENT presidents who just enslave their people. Thank you Donald!!I know I'm hailing the film as great because I can relate to its political context. But even if the film is not actually great, it has redefined the YA genre with the importance of its message, which redeems ALL its flaws for me.

"Good, but problematic.","The film was good. Nothing actively bad about it, but at the end of it all, it does seem like while things happened, nothing much of importance really happened. Saying that, it's still well-made and pretty entertainingWhat I did have a problem with was Katniss' characterization. I don't think the first two films and this one really connect in terms of her characterization. I get that she's traumatized, but putting only one person ahead of the whole nation? That selfish? She just never showed this side in the first two films. I'm not okay with her being in love with Peeta, I thought it would've been so much better if it had just remained a strong friendship. But alas, the problem really lies with just how annoying she was. I get that people behave differently in different circumstances, but it just felt like such a wildly different character several times.But really, it's a good film, aside from Katniss' problems.

After having watched it, I can see why the finale was split into two movies.

"It's true, there isn't much action, but still a good movie","If you have already read the books you will enjoy it much more.

"Mockingjay - Part 1 invests on drama, discuss media manipulation, but has a irregular rhythm","In need of an icon to encourage districts to rebel against the Capital, resistance commanders do not think twice about taking advantage of Katniss' popularity. It doesn't matter how it looks, but what it represents - and, for that, nothing better than makeup to sell the product well. The propaganda war between Presidents Snow (Donald Sutherland) and Coin (Julianne Moore) is created, where it is curious to note that both exploit the same tactic. If presenter Caeser Flickerman (Tucci) is biased to the extreme, the resistance film crew also seeks to explore Katniss's emotions in her favor, without the least bit of shame. The end justifies the means, some would say. But if this is true for resistance, wouldn't it also be true for Capital? At least in relation to the method of conduct, there is not that much difference. This similarity deepens even more when he sees the almost tyrannical way in which Coin rules and the fact that, however much she defends democracy, there is not the slightest indication that she has been elected to the position she holds. Once again, good and evil are not that far away in relation to the way of acting, which in itself arouses a series of considerations about the philosophy behind the series.It is precisely this political game behind the scenes that is the most interesting in Mockingjay- Part 1, be it for the manipulative / manipulated duality or for the twists and turns that the script holds. On this board, Katniss and Peeta are mere pawns whose emotions serve the interest of the moment, however much the relationship between them serves as the main line of the script. It is also interesting to note how the other pieces (Haymitch, Effie, Plutarch, Beetee) are relocated in this new reality, each according to their interests: some because of their beliefs, others due to their lack of choice or sense of opportunity.If, on the one hand, it is interesting to see the media manipulation imposed by both the rebels and the Capital with Peeta's interview, on the other hand the hype seems empty. Much expectation is created at all times to make way for nothing. It seems that something is always going to happen, but when it is about to reach a climax, the wait is frustrated. Basically, everything revolves around this small part of the story. Something that could be solved in an hour of film - at most. After all, in the first 60 minutes, the viewer is confronted with a monotonous narrative in which Katniss slowly regains her personality, making visits to territories such as District 8, where an improvised hospital operates and where one of the rare action scenes in this sequence takes place. In fact, this is the film in which explosions and struggles give rise to speeches by social critics. This first part of the adaptation of ""Mockingjay"", has very few action scenes, being more focused on the media war between the rebels of District 13 and the tyrannical Capital.Bearing in mind that the film's narrative is practically all directed towards Katniss (there are rare moments when the character is not on stage), the setting of the story follows its protagonist. There is a contrast between the opulence of the Capital and the poverty of the 12 districts and we began to explore together with the character the besieged environment that is District 13, with quick visits to some other environments touched by the war, especially District 12. Katniss dives in a war environment, where almost everything is plunged into gray practicality. District 13's own scenarios are reminiscent of a war submarine, linear and tight. Seeing the extrovert and hitherto multicolored Effie (Elizabeth Banks) without her extravagant wigs, makeup and strange clothes is the biggest representative of this reality shock for Katniss and the public. Another shock is Peeta's gradual debilitation, portrayed with care by Josh Hutcherson.The Hunger Games arena is left out of this film so that we can get behind the scenes of this revolution. With the action fundamentally taking place at the underground headquarters of the rebellion, in devastated District 13, what we have is darkness and even the beauty of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is hidden, rendered speechless by the demands of a heavy story as it should be. This complete change of tone in relation to The Hunger Games and Catching Fire shows the production's courage in doing something different, which will not necessarily please everyone. For that very reason, it is at least necessary to respect what Lionsgate managed to put on the screens.Just as it happened in the first film in the saga, it is gradually that Katniss accepts the role that destiny has imposed on her. Again showing rare courage in blockbusters aimed at teenagers, Francis Lawrence does not shy away from showing images like burnt bodies and crowds machine-gunned by soldiers from the Capital. Katniss' reactions in those moments collide with the pragmatic coldness of Alma Coin, composed by Julianne Moore as someone who has long since passed the point of allowing herself to feel any passion. In fact, it is palpable that Coin and Snow have more in common than the first lets on (and perhaps doesn't even realize it). The propaganda game played by the intelligent Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) depends on Katniss, and the girl's speeches and actions, in order to work with the public, need to be spontaneous and authentic. Thus, Jennifer Lawrence finds herself quite demanded. Not only because of the character's almost omnipresence in the narrative, but because of the range of emotions it requires from Katniss, which ranges from the traumatized girl to the warrior symbol of the rebellion. And, once again, the young actress is up to the challenge. The confidence in Lawrence is such that the production has the luxury of placing Sutherland, Hoffman and Moore in smaller participations, since we follow the story unfolding basically through the eyes of Katniss. The feature film still uses this to its advantage by placing the young woman away from the most elaborate action scenes, relegating her to the role of spectator and creating greater tension in those moments.To give vent to this strong political tone present in the story, director Francis Lawrence needed to make important changes to the series. In addition to the visual change, there are far fewer action scenes compared to previous episodes, as well as greater psychological development of the heroine. There is also a certain loss of dynamics in the narrative, largely due to overly elongated sequences and the very reflective tone that guides part of the film. It is too early to say whether it is to blame the decision to split a book into two films, but this Part 1 could have a shorter duration if it went through a more rigorous edition. The division, for those who read the books, in fact complies with the much desired fidelity in adapting books for the big screen, taking care to create scenes for the smallest details ever written, but fails to win over viewers who do not know the book and, consequently, they have to deal with a film without major events. The division's decision diminishes the brightness of the work as a cinema, in addition to the high risk of transforming the second half into an endless climax, taking the focus away from the introspective moments, the great dramatic force of the series so far.If Mockingjay escaped the trap of the necessarily more explosive sequel, it failed to escape another, which, in fact, is almost a disease in Hollywood: the division of films into several parts in the name of profit. Harry Potter and The Hobbit suffered from this and Mockingjay is the latest victim. There was not enough material for four hours of projection (each of the final two chapters will have slightly more than two hours) and this is evident with the thematic repetition, with Katniss returning to her old district twice, with the same images, the that kills any impact and excruciating delay in understanding Peeta's painfully obvious situation.As a result, Mockingjay loses its rhythm several times, literally looking like a long and inexplicably extended prelude to action. Action that never comes, by the way. There is only one busy sequence in the projection - that of the hospital in District 8, which fulfills its function of showing who the Thrush is and it is surprisingly short and economical, with the production focusing much more on Coin's eternal speeches and interviews Caesar Flickerman's (Stanley Tucci, underutilized) television shows with Peeta. The problem caused by the lack of cadence in the stretched script ends up erasing characters that could have been better used, such as Finnick (Sam Claflin) and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), in addition to demanding too much of the viewer's patience with slow, contemplative plans and without any kind of reward. Esperança literally looks like what it is: the beginning of an unfinished film.Mockingjay - Part 1 is a good film that points out instigating paths for the series, but, paradoxically, it is also the least impactful. The adaptation is surprisingly faithful to the source material, in addition to having the courage to be a different film compared to the two that came before. The division of Mockingjay prevents a full assessment, but this ""beginning of the end"" certainly validates The Hunger Games as the most courageous and contradictory product of current pop culture. At the same time that it addresses complex issues, condemning social imbalance and the manipulation of the media without fear of showing its own violence. In this part 1, the action drama with political touches manages to give drama to the story and deepen its characters, leaving the action aside (even if it exists and spectacular) to deliver something bigger: a blockbuster with social criticism. However, its narrative claudication, caused by a slow and rhythm less script, prevents the Thrush from taking higher flights.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Does anyone pay attention??,"All I see are people complaining that this movie is 'too slow' or its 'boring' or 'bleak.' Does anyone even pay attention to what it's about? This series is about OPPRESSION. It doesn't take the smartest person in the world to realize this series, books and movies, is about oppression, rebellion, and the consequence of both. It's not supposed to be upbeat. Like do you really need big noises and explosions constantly to keep your attention? It's supposed to make you think. This movie has been advertised as a cute little romance action movie from the start, but that's not even close to what it's about. The movie is a good adaption of the book, its taking the exact route it should. Jennifer Lawrence did a great job portraying the mental instability of Katniss who is so clearly suffering from PTSD.

For the Most Part - MockingJay Soars!,"""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1"" is third installment in the Hunger Games Movie Series, based on the popular young adult trilogy of novels. As per the title, the 3rd novel is being split into 2 movies, ala recent other young adult novel series last installment being split in two movies. As someone who has read the books, I felt there was more than enough material to justify two movies. The movie picks up where the last one – ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" left off, with protagonist Katniss Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence, living in District 13, after being liberated from the Arena by the Rebellion. District 13 President Alma Coin, played by Julianne Moore & former Game Head, revealed as a Rebel at the end of Catching Fire, Plutarch Heavensbee, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, want Katniss to literally be the MockingJay, the face of the revolution. Katniss is still mad over the failure to rescue Peeta, by Josh Hutcherson, from the Arena, but as one would expect, she eventually acquiesces with a couple of conditions. Jennifer Lawrence is once again outstanding as ever playing Katniss. In the last movie, Jena Malone was the scene stealer as Tribute Johann Mason. This movie it would be Natlie Dormer, as Cressida, the Director of filmed propaganda pieces, that Katniss has agreed films to help spur on the rebellion. In her fairly brief scenes, she portrays a power and confidence in her character. Elizabeth Banks, returning as Effie Trinkett is also a stand out, and Woody Harrelson, also returning as Haymitch Abernathy continue his great performance in the series. For the most part I liked it, particularly the mending of scenes in the book in one of the final sequences in the movie, which effectively build tension, and other variations of things in the book. My rating may go up on second viewing, for now - 3 ¼ stars out of 4.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"I feel like I should only add half the title here: Review, part 1","Every story has some elements and they usually are in the same order. You have the hook, you have the set up, the character descriptions, some action, some life changing decisions, the twists and so on. Since part 1 of part 3 is just half a story, you only get the set up! The hook is presumably in the first two movies, but let's say we have a weak one at the beginning of the film, as well. And then it goes something like ""Tomorrow... Panem!"" and the movie ends.One year later, you get the second movie, which starts where this one ended and it's overly long and obviously artificially so. However, Part 1 is not so bad. In fact, I would say it is definitely better than the second part. The characters are described, their motivations laid bare, we only need the action stuff, that doesn't really happen here. However this slowness of pace is also what forces the actors and movie makers to improve on the quality of the exposition.That doesn't make it a great movie, but it is a decent one, and it certainly raises expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A solid foundation for a great conclusion,"Though destined to be the runt of the litter there is plenty to enjoy in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1. It's a solid foundation to what has honestly been for me the best movie adaptation for a young adult book series.There are moments of tension, menace, suspense and rousing inspiration. Propaganda, symbols, strategic discourse these are the elements that further flesh out the world of this series to make it feel grounded in spite of the survivalist set-pieces in the previous two. There was a moment towards the end where I was genuinely quite surprised with how nasty it got. This is what good YA fiction can do, incorporate some tough adult themes with strong characters to allow them to bridge the gap between adolescence and adulthood.It would be hard for me to pick it apart because I would be afraid that the stuff I did like would have been destined to be cut out. Director Francis Lawrence continues to show the sharp and purposeful direction seen in Catching Fire. Jennifer Lawrence keeps pushing herself as Katniss in this third film, her performances grow increasingly informed with every portrayal, in spite of what must be a punishing shoot her register is never one of complacency. The film does seem unsure of where to go at times but the foundation has been more than solidly set, they have taken advantage of the suspect conditions under which the movie was made.People often point to how The Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy or some other Marvel pop fluff piece is the second coming of Star Wars, I must disagree. To me after Catching Fire it became clear if there was ever to be an adequate contemporary equivalent to Star Wars, it would be this. The characters, politics and social equivalences mirror that of Star Wars in tone and structure on more than a few occasions but with the Hunger Games we are firmly in another equally well realized world and Katniss is the perfect protagonist for this adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"It's an okay movie, but the split was really unnecessary.","When I heard they were going to split the last book in two movies, I was really disappointed. They said there is too much story to fit in one movie. Yeah, right, and I'm Lady GaGa. I still tried to look on the bright side and remembered how the book felt rushed at times and maybe the story will have more space to breathe. But here, it kinda seems like the story was forced to breathe very deep. Too deep. This isn't a bad movie at all. It's just too stretched for it's own good and turns out to be a total cashgrab. It's very well done and ""The Hanging Tree"" sequence with the dam scene was one of the best moments in the series. The plot doesn't really go anywhere for the most of the screen time. There's the District 8 part, some rebel scenes and the movie's third act. That's it. But the third act is awesome. That part wasn't really that intense in the book and that's when they showed the potential and some creativity. The book is in first person POV, but the movie isn't and that's the good thing because in the book we hear about some exciting stuff, but in the movie we actually get to see it and that's really good and the third act is mostly what made me like this movie. If you didn't read the book, the twist ending will definitely get you and you will want to watch the next movie immediately. One more problem I have with this film is that Katniss simply isn't an interesting character anymore. Tears, nightmares, traumas... I know she's been through a lot and I can understand that she's stressed and that they should show it in the movie, but they show it way too much. There was this scene when she's dreaming and I was like: ""And this was necessary because..."" In conclusion, this movie is still pretty much okay and will totally make you want to see the next one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The worst movie I've seen in a long time,"Let me qualify my summary: It's not any worse than the movie that launched this series, period. Trapped in a plane in an intercontinental flight, the choice was THG:M1 or movies I had already watched. So I selected it. I had not seen THG, but I had heard good things about it. I was not expecting a life- changing experience, but something entertaining. Boy, was I wrong. This movie is a life-changing experience, in all the wrong ways. Not only was it unable to relieve the intense boredom of a long haul flight - it made it worse. This movie has not plot, makes no sense, is ridiculous from beginning to end. There is no saving grace to it, not even Miss Lawrence, who seems to be lost in the movie herself. As for actors like P.S. Hoffman, J. Moore and D. Sutherland, one wonders why they acquiesced to get involved in this brainless trash - I doubt they need the money (albeit you never know.) In order to make sure that it was not the lack of knowledge of previous films in the series that was spoiling the experience for me, I made a point of watching them, even if cursorily. I watched the first one, and that was enough. The Hunger Games is the most ridiculously hyped and overrated series of movies ever. Addressed to teenage public, this series seems to assume that teenagers are collectively brainless and stupid. This series is an insult to intelligence and discrimination.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Unnecessary but interesting,"Thanks to Harry Potter books are constantly being split on film. This doesn't usually work and one part of the double bill or trilogy is always just a 2 hour (3 hour in the case of The Hobbit) build up. Katniss, after destroying the games, becomes a symbol for the rebellion and tries to save Peeta for the Capitol. This is the weakest of the franchise, but I enjoyed it more than others have. Mockingjay Part 1's main problem is the lack of action, but it manages to get away with it just about. Thankfully it's not another Breaking Dawn Part 1. It can feel like something waiting for happen for 2 hours, but it's a pleasant wait. The acting is excellent, and Jennifer Lawrence is a great heroine aside from an overdone nightmare waking up scene. Donald Sutherland doesn't appear that much, but he's wonderful as President Snow. It's still got politics and emotional depth which is what makes the franchise maybe the best YA adaptation series of them all, and the depth combined with the acting places it far above the Harry Potter films.It certainly comes up short on the action front, but there's enough going on to hold the attention. The trouble is that the film is a blatant cash grab and you can't help but yearn for a 3 hour finale instead of 2 films. Do we really need another hugely anticipated release in 2015? This is well made in many ways, but the endlessly drained colour palette occasionally evokes memories of Twilight and the last few Harry Potter films in a bad way. I still enjoyed this movie and it has plenty of drama which makes it very watchable, but there's too much filming political videos and not enough actually happening. They have a good twist and jump scare at the end though. A decent but disappointing sequel which I enjoyed, but without the acting this would be less bearable. I might go as far as to call this slightly underrated, but the way this is just unnecessary is fairly off putting. Still, it makes us even more eager for the final chapter.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"More great character-centered drama from this franchise, but drags and occasionally forgets to be entertaining","""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" takes a drastic turn from the previous two entries of North America's biggest active movie franchise, but any fan of Suzanne Collins' trilogy could tell you that was coming; what doesn't change is the series' devotion to character-driven drama. In fact, it takes center stage.The games that defined the original ""Hunger Games"" and ""Catching Fire"" are long gone in this entry; Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has been taken to District 13, which exists entirely underground, where it has developed a massive operation aimed at revolting against the Capitol. President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and her trusted adviser Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) try to enlist Katniss as the Mockingjay, the face of the revolution, but she requires some convincing seeing as Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is in the Capitol's clutches.""Mockingjay Part 1"" takes on the tone of a political thriller with 13 and the Capitol engaged in a chess match and Katniss and Peeta serving as their respective pawns. This is dramatically different, almost a 180 from the previous installments — those films were about survival and the main characters' lives were at stake; this film is about psychological warfare with the entire world of Panem at stake. Although ""Catching Fire"" does transition into a larger scale, it still ultimately becomes about the games.Consequently, ""Mockingjay Part 1"" lacks in action and tries to make up for it in intrigue and suspense. At many points that suspense is quite effective, but screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong hope it will serve as a substitute for action sequences. Well, that's not how blockbusters work. Ultimately, the decision to split the book ""Mockingjay"" into two parts feels like the real culprit for the film's flaws. There's a ton of build-up, but very little payoff, probably because the payoff comes in ""Part 2.""Otherwise, director Francis Lawrence really makes the most out of the story. This is a darker, much more introspective film, and seeing as those darker, introspective moments in ""Catching Fire"" worked so well, he doesn't struggle making the jump with to more of them in ""Mockingjay Part 1."" He's careful to give the other Lawrence, Jennifer, the time she needs to communicate what Katniss is struggling with to the audience. The change in this film turns Katniss' motivation from survival to something bigger — to the choice she must make about leading this revolution. Her wants and desires start to get foggy and the film does a pretty good job of making sense of her, honing in on her protective instinct.The film also does really nice things with Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Effie (Elizabeth Banks). Before, they were colorful one-dimensional side characters; now, the way the start of this revolution has shaken them from their previous wants and desires comes through. We see a totally raw, emotional side of Effie, for example, that stands out among the better character components of the film. We also spend more time with Gale (Liam Hemsworth), seeing as Peeta remains rather distant from the plot of this third chapter.All the character development is lovely, but the lack of action really makes ""Mockingjay Part 1"" drag. Toward the end you can really feel the plot stalling and the movie selling us small parts of the book as big climactic sequences. In order to make what was actually half of a story feel like a whole story, certain liberties need to be taken or scene/sub-plots added (take ""The Hobbit"" trilogy for instance). ""Mockingjay Part 1"" doesn't really do that, it just tries to exaggerate what's already there.""The Hunger Games"" franchise continues to deliver multi-dimensional storytelling and character development (in an extremely mature way for a mass-appeal PG-13 blockbuster) with ""Mockingjay Part 1,"" but it's missing the fun, sit-back-and-enjoy factor a movie of its kind ought to have. Even if you disagree that a huge event movie doesn't need to be action-packed, you can't disagree that this one feels longer and more dragged out than it needs to be given the summation of what happens. As slow as it might be, however, it should prove to be a pretty huge set up for a more exciting and satisfying finale.~Steven CThanks for reading!

There is no tension whatsoever, no excitement, no suspense, no life.The storyline is even more boring than the acting and the special effects are like watching paint dry.What a load of drivel the dialogues are and don't start me on the music which is no better.Looking at the 7.5 IMDb user rating I now know for sure that the studios have fake user accounts to cheat the IMDb rating.

The Vidiot Review,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1The best business to be in during a rebellion is guillotine sales and maintenance.Unfortunately, the rabble in this action movie can't afford the extended warranty.In the wake of her annihilation of the Hungry Games arena, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is escorted to District 13 where rebel leaders (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore) persuade her to become the spokesperson for the District-wide revolution her actions inspired.With the Capitol in ruin, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in hiding, and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) imprisoned, Katniss - with help from the resistance (Natalie Dormer, Sam Claflin, Liam Hemsworth) - plots her friend's rescue and her enemy's execution.The first instalment of the final entry in the series based on the novels, Mockingjay is the bleakest chapter to date.While it ultimately feels incomplete, the acting and modern warfare analogies are certainly noteworthy.However, the mascot for social unrest is already Freddy The Firebomb.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Only Good for The first Hour.,"Mockingjay. Because, what else to call it? Have any ideas? No, I didn't think so. It's the same about the third part of The Hunger Games. It missed ideas. It was very good the first hour, with some good plot twists, amazing propaganda talk, dramatical attacks and the revolution of the country they were trying to do here. Everything seemed interesting at first, but in the end, they served everything on the plate, and lost the good ideas. The action was good only the first hour, because later, it became very basic, the action music wasn't convincing, too. Katniss Everdeen is back to strike and make a difference, but the movie ends with her doing nothing then talking, even if she knows nothing is going to help. The action in the end is nothing more than making the movie longer and give it a longer runtime, unnecessary. It could have been at least a half hour shorter. Part three ended on the middle. But before the weak stuff came, it was actually very entertaining. The popular Hunger Games song ""The Hanging Three"" was a good symbol and did the job with the good singing, too. It gave us a brighter idea of the society in district twelve, and I liked it. Good moral about human rights, too, and they introduced us new characters, one of them played by Mahershala Ali, who is a pretty good actor. He didn't play so good in here, unfortunately, mostly because he did almost nothing and didn't have a convincing character. So what to say? The first hour was great, the second was empty, I hope the last part will give something that will change everything, in a good way.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It was good,"I was really excited to see this movie because I read the first book, and I really love the other two films. I thought that the third movie was more talky than the others... I don't like that, but I will accept it because it is just setting up for the grand finale. I think that the cast is awesome, except I don't like that the guy who is playing Peeta is about 5'1 in height. Peeta is supposed to be 6 foot at the least. But, other than that everyone does a good job. I will ask how they are going to do the Phillip Seymore Hoffman thing in the last film. Or they might have already filmed it. I really liked this despite those problems, I think it was really good, so I will give it 7 of 10 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"The first of a two-part adaption of Suzanne Collins' Mockingjay, the concluding entry in The Hunger Games sequence, this movie follows the recent trend of splitting the last of trilogies into two. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem justified in this case. The movies are divided prior to the Mockingjay/District 13 assault on Panem – or, in other words, the good bit. Which makes much of this movie essentially a build-up to its sequel. Lawrence is her usual brilliant self as a conflicted Katniss, who is called upon to portray a full rainbow of emotions and does so effortlessly. Her relationship (broadest sense) with Gale (Hutcherson) is played down, and in his few appearances Peeta (Hemsworth) steals the scene. Haymitch (Harrelson) is criminally underused but magnificent when he is given some screen time. Two major casting decisions affect this film greatly. The first is the inclusion of Effie Trinkett (Banks) who doesn't appear in the first half of the book. She takes the place of Cinna's erstwhile prep team; her stage presence and characterisation is much stronger in the previous movies, and it was a very good move to give the lines to her. By contrast, Julianne Moore is miscast in the role of President Coin. She lacks the commanding gravitas to play the fearsome leader; the ilk of Judi Dench would have been much better suited to the part. Her dialogue with the likes of Katniss and Plutarch (Seymour Hoffman) falls flat. James Newton Howard's score is marvellous, with the haunting mockingjay rift and The Hanging Tree adding an eerie sound. The interspersion of the song with Peeta's address to Panem is one of the few rousing moments. There's every chance Part 2 will be a terrific film as it has brilliant source material and an excellent cast to perform it, but Part 1 is a real disappointment. The action-free instalment did not require the time it was given, and there was no climax or payoff. Collins' novel has not been done justice, so let's hope the odds are very much in Part 2's favour.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
BoRING SeT Up OF THe NeXT Film,"Other reviewers have done well to highlight the obvious in that this movie is a boring prologue to the next Hunger Games film.Jennifer Lawrence looked like she was recovering from a hangover throughout most the movie and seemed overly melodramatic in parts. Her acting skills seemed weak in this movie and at times she looked as bored as I was watching the movie.This movie just does not work in its two part format. The previous two movies has well rounded stories and build up of characters but in this movie the story was jumping all over the place.Although I applaud the directors focus on the different elements of war i.e propaganda, rescue missions, bombing raids I found some of scenes of Katniss with her old flame and friend boring and dead.The movie seemed pretty thin on the use of SFX which I attribute to the saving of the budget for the second part of the movie. So don't expect any action like the other two movies.Ultimately this movie is a slow boil set up for the second and final installment of the series. You could probably watch a 5 min overview of what happens in this movie before watching the second part when it is released and save yourself a boring 2 hours of watching Jennifer Lawrence moaning away.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great Movie, For What It Is","OK, let me start by saying that if you go into this movie thinking ""Ugh, this is stupid. Why are they splitting it into two movies?"" You aren't going to enjoy this movie no matter how good it is. That being said, I was disappointed that they split the movie. I knew it was a ploy to get money, but I figured that I might as well try and enjoy it. After all, Deathly Hollow was pretty good, so why shouldn't this one be? When I got to the theater, I was shocked at how good the movie was. The camera-work was brilliant. Every frame was beautiful. The acting was absolutely superb. Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) proved her acting chops in the first five minutes. Francis Lawrence obviously wanted to make up for the studios decision and had everyone step up their game. Even Josh Hucherson (who, let's be honest, is the weakest actor in the bunch) nailed it. That being said, not much happens in this movie. There are a few scenes (the propo scenes, the water dam scene, the last 15 minutes) where action takes place and it is brilliantly done. But most of the movie is politics and character development. If you are in the theater for an action movie, you're gonna be disappointed. I don't think this movie deserves the backlash it is getting. Get angry at the studio, if you must, but don't take it out on the movie itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fans of the book will still enjoy, but most should wait till Part 2","Mockingjay: To say that I am a fan of the Hunger Games Franchise would be an understatement, I have been eagerly waiting for this film since last year after watching Catching Fire. I am a huge fan of the books, so I had a general idea of what was going to take place in this film and where they would end it. I was a little disappointed with the movie, I still liked it very much but was a little disappointed. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is well thought-out, very well acted, but lacks the action and intensity that made the first and second films so enjoyable.Aside from adding in a few propo(propaganda pieces used in the film) scenes, the director did a pretty good job a keeping it true to the book. That is the problem though, it was one book and this is only half of it. The book was honestly a little boring for the first half compared to the other two, but was still a great book because it picked it up in the second half. The film obviously had scenes that were only there to lengthen the film and were very unnecessary and added little to nothing in terms of the plot. It would have been a much better film if it was closer to three hours and was just one film. That way they could have given the book adaption justice and would have been much better overall. Of course, they would make nearly double the money by splitting the book into two parts which is the only reason why they did it. The director did his best with what he was given and I give him much credit for making it a very enjoyable film.What made this film still incredibly enjoyable to me was the acting ensemble they had. They have so much great actors and actresses across the board that they used tremendously well throughout the movie. Jennifer Lawrence(surprise, surprise) still gave the best performance. She continues to perfectly convey the personality and attitude that is Katniss Everdeen. Liam Hemsworth also did a outstanding job since this is the film that gives the most screen time. He is no Peeta Mellark to me, but he did a nice job at playing the tough, honest guy who you can tell really wants Katniss to love him the say way he loves her. Josh Hutcherson has far less screen time in this film, but was given a much more challenging role. I was curious to see how he would take to it since it is abnormal for a character to have to change his entire personality during a film. He was brilliant. He exceeded everyone's expectations and I have very high hopes for him in the final Hunger Games. The rest of the ensemble did very well. Woody Harrelson continually gave the audience nice laughs throughout the film.It is up to you on this, I think you should see this film in theaters, but you will honestly have a better experience if you just wait to see this a little before you see the final Hunger Games. Still, I think you should see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 at some point, whether it is in theaters or on DVD.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Book readers vs Non-book Readers,"First of all, i've watched all of the Hunger Games movies, and i haven't read the books. The first 2 was really good because of the action, and that there was actually happening something in the movie, that kind of gave a plot to that specific movie. This movie tho, is just a big foreplay for the second part. Don't get me wrong, i couldn't be more excited for the second part, but there isn't really happening something in this movie like the last ones. Ofcource is there some action scenes here and there, but it has nothing compared to the last books. I would like to say, that the actors are doing a REALLY good job. Their acting is really good, and you can clearly feel the emotional part going on their lives, and the directors did a good job making the audience feel the same way. I would like to say tho, that if you have read the books, and you know whats coming and what its like, you will properly like the movie (not giving any guarantees. I've heard that it matched the book pretty well. In my opinion isn't should there be more action, or there should be more excitement. There is a lot of talking and a lot of emotional going on, and for a person who hasn't read the books, that not what you wont to see, not after the 2 before that.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

you can't appeal to your oppressor's morality,"I should note that I saw the first two movies in the Hunger Games franchise not long after they got released, but I never got around to seeing the second two back then. I've finally seen ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"".With the first two, it was obvious how the story represented a stratified society that comes up with ways to keep people from resisting. A particular scene in this one recalls a quote that I once heard: you can't appeal to your oppressor's morality. With the events here, Katniss fully understands what's at stake.As to criticism that the last book in the series got broken up into two movies, I can't comment on that, having not read the books. I will say that I'm eager to see the final movie (and I understand that there's going to be another addition to the franchise).As for Jennifer Lawrence, it's a bit odd to watch the franchise all these years later when she's now more known for serious movies (Don't Look Up, Causeway).

Not up to the mark,"The Hunger Games movies have been amazing till now. The characters, the action and the sets breathtaking. But the only problem is that they don't match the level of the books. The book explains everything in details. I believe one can never actually understand and feel the story from the movie like from the book. The book is pooling with action all over and yet quick and interesting. There are movie franchises like Twilight that do better than books but The Hunger games movies are not that. There is a lot of scope of improvement ant entertainment. This movie seems like a sluggish attempt at picturing half the book. I wouldn't even give it 6 stars if I had watched the movie without reading the book. It wouldn't engage and hook me. All the while I was comparing the movie with the books. And I realized the book was so much better. So if anyone finds the plot of Hunger Games interesting, he'she should give the books a shot.

Very good,"I don't understand why this movie received so many negative reviews. I have read the book and although I agree that Mockingjay shouldn't have been split into 2 movies, this part 1 is still very good.

There were some scenes that were very bitter and made me feel like breaking down.

good set up for finale,"Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is still haunted by the Games. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is holding Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) hostage and using him as a media tool. Katniss does a deal with District 13 President Coin (Julianne Moore) to rescue the Victors in exchange for her being the Mockingjay symbol of the resistance.I like the idea of Wag the Dog. However it has to be executed with precision. Those scenes of trying to handle Katniss could have been funny or foreboding. Woody Harrelson has some fun but there are too many awkward moments with the media idea. The writing needs to be sharper. Katniss indirectly causes the destruction of the hospital and it doesn't even occurs to her.I don't mind limiting the action in this episode. It's trying to set up a lot of things for the finale. Although the rescue ending could have been an exciting sequence. It needs Katniss joining the rescue team. The switching back and forth drains the tension out of the action. It wouldn't cost that much and it would be a great way to end the movie. At the very least, it would silence most of the complainers about the lack of action. This is a good set up for the finale. There are some awkwardness and minor annoyances. Lawrence is able to deliver on a difficult role. There are some good additions to the franchise. I expect a great explosive final chapter.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Plagiarism, plagiarism","War movies have always been a favourite genre for me, and in Mockingjay we get war in all it's horror and heroism all tied into a comprehensive and intelligent bundle that is carried effortlessly by Jennifer Lawrence. The direction keeps us focused on Lawrence, she is in 95% at least of the scenes and she dominates. Her portrayal of Katniss as a damaged, fragile and very young girl who is also the main prop of a rebellion against horrific oppression is spellbinding.The fact that the script makes no concessions to the action junkie is IMO at least, only to be commended. The rest of the cast seem to have been inspired by her formidable work. Everybody has raised their game to match her, I can't think of a weak link in the rest of the cast's performances. Liam Hemsworth at last make Gale real. There are too many really to list here. Stand outs for were Josh Hutcherson's Peeta, Elizabeth Banks Effie, Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch and of course Donald Sutherland's Corialanus Snow. A great story needs a great villain and his Snow is both fascinating and repellent.And on a final closing note, this film makes the eternal whining of the so-called BR2 'fans' look more justified than ever and leaves you scratching your head wondering how entire sequence are shot for shot ripoffs.

"Its okay, will only appeal to fans","Although slow and sometimes just plain boring, The Hunger Games Mockingjay part 1 is clearly a cash grab, with good excuse to split one movie into two. As being an fan of the books, I did enjoy seeing the characters on screen, but reading a book before seeing a movie should never be an excuse for a movie based of a book being bad. For those of you who expected an action thriller, you will be extremely disappointed. I do believe this is the worst film out of the series, and could only see me watching this with a couple of friends at a Hunger Games party.

Slow Going as this is a Setup for Part 2,"Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is now the Mockingjay a symbol for the revolution to defeat President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and his dictatorship. Promos are made to insure that all the Districts fall in line behind Katniss.This movie is a setup for Part 2 when it comes out. Here we will see Katniss brooding for all the people the Capital (refers to Pres Snow's administration) has killed. There is a rescue attempt to free Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) who the Capital is using to help stop the Revolution.Knowing the above, the movie will be slow going with no resolution until Part 2. However, we will see very good acting performances by all the cast to include Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee, Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman the reporter who interviews Peeta, and Julianne Moore as President Coin of District 13 where the revolutionaries are headquartered.For me the important thing was seeing a very good actress in Jennifer Lawrence and I was not disappointed. The wig that she wore was somewhat distracting, but she is a class act nevertheless. I do wish that Woody Harrelson and Phillip Seymour Hoffman had more screen time and dialogues as they provide a comfort zone for me. They are that good.The producers decided to stretch this story out as we saw in that Twilight (Vampire) story and we will have to wait for Part 2 to see how this all ends.

"Not a Set Movie - The 3rd Book is Just Extremely Boring, the 2nd Part Will Be Equally Dull","The movie does as good of a job as it possibly could have, given the material it had to work with from the 3rd book. To break it down to the non book readers, the 2nd part of the 3rd book is even more dull, so get ready. It's just really bad material and it was a painful book to get through. Most people didn't like the 3rd book and those that did are kidding themselves. Prior to the 2nd movie being released, I knew it was going to be a really good movie because the 2nd book had a really entertaining story line. This movie on the other hand had a 0% chance of being good and to score a 6 is actually an awesome achievement...awesome job with the movie! The production crew had a really tough decision. Do you break from the 3rd book since it is soo bad or do you keep the book Nazis happy? They let everyone know after Catching Fire that they would stay true to the book (based on their demeanor and response I say they weren't thrilled about it). The only way this 3rd move stood a chance is if they spent at least 1/3 of the movie going into the back story of Haymitch. It was understandably something that had to be cut out of the 2nd movie, due to both budget and time. Basically, as Katniss and Petah are preparing for the 75th Hunger Games they watch/study several of the previous Hunger Games, including Haymitch's. They watch his interviews and how he won etc. This would require a new Hunger Game Arena etc., but the 3rd book doesn't have a whole lot of entertaining material and they split it into two parts, so the Haymitch idea would have filled half of this first part perfectly. That would still leave 3 hours to cover the 3rd book which is more then enough. I can't even begin to imagine how they are going to fill the time for the 2nd part.

I was a bit scared they would end the movie in a way that it would reveal too much information, but I have never seen an ending this exciting before. A true cliffhanger there! The director Francis Lawrence have done an incredible job and I have to applaud him for that.

Manufactured Tension,"I liked some moments in this movie, but too many of them consisted of forced conflict. It's hard to believe the main character is stupid enough to reject the cause of the rebellion, but she does, repeatedly, because there seems to be a desire to re-create the same formula as the previous in this part of the series. I guess the idea is that she's independent and thinks everyone is trying to use her, but she becomes utterly impossible to sympathize with in this film because she leverages everyone's life for Peeta's. Unfortunately, it doesn't work, and it isn't believable. I have to say, though, all the comparisons to the Japanese film Battle Royale are absurd, as the Japanese film is nothing like Hunger Games, and it also took its story from another, and so on. Rejecting a novel or a film because it has some plot similarity to another film or novel or short story will eliminate all stories ever made. If we want to be precise, we can go back to the original short story by Ralph Ellison and discount all variations, but that's wasted time, and it has nothing to do with the merits of this film. I'm on board with the complaints that this was artificially cut into two parts. Film makers are trying to trick us with this nonsense, and I refuse to pay any time and money to Peter Jackson's absurd over-extension of the one-book classic, when he spent three (admittedly overly long) films on a six book series. This should have been one film, and since it wasn't that great as the half of the film it should have been, I'm going to be reluctant to pay for the next part.

"Though I would have rather gotten one 4 hour movie, Hunger Games: Mockingly Part 1 is satisfying enough to make me want to see the final story next time","Let's face it, at least once in your life, you've fallen into a leader position for which you were either not ready or simply had no interest in. Some people want to be leaders and some would rather follow. I've heard of people wondering why some people don't take greater control of their life and to quit some dead end job that won't make them which. What the asking people don't understand is that while there is certainly a mindset to be your own person, you also need a particular personality. There are people out that simply feel better to taking instruction rather then give them. It's not that they don't want anything better in life, they simply don't feel like they need more; in another word, they're content.This leads to Katness Everdeen's position as a leader in The Hunger Games franchise. This poor teenager had never dreamed of doing anything else besides farming and hunting. She may have the survival skills that helped her win the games the first time, but it spiraled out of control when she was seen as the sign of a revolution. She never wanted to take the spotlight, but she at least does her best with the situation. This is what makes her a great character. We are going into the beginning of the end here with The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 1.The previous movie ended with Katness escaping the Games into a hideout while Peeta was left behind.Living under the ruins of District 13, Katness Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) along with the other tributes that made it out, have been learning more about how a huge group of rebels have been planning an attack on the capital for a while. Katness is reunited with her mother, sister Prim-Rose and even Effie Trinket (played by Elizabeth Banks), but is bitter about leaving Peeta behind. She's introduced to the rebel leader, President Alma Coin (played by Julianne Moore) who asks Katness to be the ""Mockingjay"" for their cause.She says no, but changes her mind once she's shown two horrific sites; her District 12 bombed out and Peeta (played by Josh Hutcherson) now appearing on Capital TV, with his mind brainwashed, asking for the rebels to stop. After staring in a series of propaganda commercial for the rebels, she then travels to District 8 to meet the injured, but only before the capital shows to bomb the place. Still going, Katness vows to continue fighting the Capital as she juggles being a symbol and sticking to her oath of saving Peeta.I've never been a fan of splitting stories. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 1 suffers from really only being half of a story. I would have been willing to sit through a four-hour movie, and I think fans would have done so too. Does only having a little of a story ruin it? Not totally. In fact, I still recommend this movie as a great continuation of this saga.I've warmed up to The Hunger Games more recently as it's manages to get across a grim subject to teenagers and young adults about post traumatic stress and a Soviet-like government (I can't recommend this to anyone under 12 though; too violent). As before, the cast from before takes it's story very seriously and all play the parts well. Julianne Moore is a nice welcome who rarely picks a bad role. My favorite newcomer is Natalie Dormer as the resident director of Katness's propaganda movies. She is passionate about the rebellion, but knows when enough work is enough to allow Katness to be herself.I'll give this seven hanging trees out of ten. What may throw off previous fans is that this is a slower, more political based Hunger Games story. Action fans will probably be pleased, though not as much as before; they just need to really pay attention. I'd see the other movies before checking this out. I'll be checking the final one come next year!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Well the fact is that this movie doesn't have so much action like the next movie. I think this movie is more like meet the character separately, Katniss without Peeta and without the capitol. I think is so cool the fact that we could think about her more like a person that someone just meaning a piece of games to cause fear in a country.

Interesting universe with weak characters,"In the universe defined by the previous films, the story is now more focused on what is true in a system that is based on lies and illusions.

So an atmosphere in all similar to the previous chapters (but with a movement toward the rebellion argument) is at the service of love story between Katniss and Gale or Peeta: the ambiguity of this strange triangle is very bad defined and the decisions of the main characters seem to be taken for contingent choices and can't react positively with the dystopian ambient. As the other films, good entertainment but with weak personalities and in general a movie rated really too much for what it really is: ""alternative"" commercial cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Loved it !!!,"I got in with mild expectations, I expected it to be good but not too good since it is the first part. I found it to be too good. The story although slower than the previous movies is engaging and exciting, at no moment I felt boredom. As the movie progresses, you get in depth view of all the characters and get some back stories which is great news for a hunger games fan. Near the end the excitement rises, I left the theater trembling. I would watch it again for sure, and I can't wait for part 2!! If you are going in expecting an ending, you are going to be disappointing since the ending is in part 2. Other than that, everything was good. Can't believe I have to wait a full year...",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Really good if slow set-up,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 has a lot to say about how certain things become symbols of hope in a revolution and more than any previous instalment is openly about filmmaking itself. However, burdened with being a part 1 of a story that didn't really need to be split in two, it is undeniably hindered by pacing that's just too slow.As Katniss becomes an idea, Jennifer Lawrence makes sure she still feels human. Both in the devastation she portrays in her most gruelling journey yet and the odd bit of self-aware humour such as when Katniss is struggling to act in a fully digital environment. This one also has her sing a beautiful rendition of The Hanging Tree which she nails.Donald Sutherland's President Snow has always been an intimidating presence that looms large over this franchise but it reaches new heights here. With a few characters gone or relegated to smaller parts since it's now out of the games, he gets to be a more consistent presence and delivers his most iconic line in a chilling fashion.Francis Lawrence does a great job of showing the brutality of the Capitol within the confines of a PG-13 rating and the heavy desaturation makes everything feel appropriately bleak. It also has a nice circular structure and a really strong final shot. James Newton Howard outdoes himself yet again. Because of the slow pace his score is even more vital in making sure things stay engrossing.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Hunger Games 2: Ripping Off Battle Royale 2,"Honestly, I wish I could give this movie a zero or less. I have never written a movie review before but the level of disgust and pure ridiculousness of this B movie inspired me. I like both Jennifer Laurence and Josh Hutherson but I'm guessing only financial gain could have got them to star in this movie seeing that the screenplay was an uncredited ripoff of Batoru rowaiaru II: Chinkonka !With that said, I am writing this review for one purpose only: IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE BATTLE ROYALE 2 (2003), PLEASE GET A COPY AND WATCH IT FIRST! PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND CINEMA, WATCH THE ORIGINAL FIRST!Yes, I am caps-lock yelling at you! This is one of the few times where you would truly lose out on a beautifully tragic experience. This isn't the typical foreign language to English port where some things are lost in translation, yet despite a few missing scenes or poor acting the story is still conveyed. This is practically a complete rework, however, it still manages to (almost) come to the same conclusion. Consequently this ruins any chance you have of watching the original and being able see the story unfold the way it's meant to, because the whole time you know how it will end (even as the other 99% will be new to you).Do yourself a favor and watch the original, it's really worth it this time.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A short review,"No I'll give this movie a 4. I'm just so disappointed. The book is something totally different...of course they can't make the book to a movie, it would be 1000 hours long but they missed a few good scenes in my opinion. I think Elisabeth Banks really brought the humor into this movie...Jennifer Lawrence played OK, she was quite absent, she could have done the part much better! Liam and Sam was good but it didn't work all the way for me. It's worth to see if you're a reel Hunger Games fan and have read the books so you know the story behind it and so on...for a real movie lover this is not the one to pay for in your cinema!I'm a fan of Hunger Games so don't judge to much.This gave me a reminder to always read the books before seeing the movies.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The terrors of war and suppression,"Many people misjudge this movie by comparing it with the book. Looking at the movie independently, I don't think of it as a bad movie. In my opinion its a very great movie that portrays amazingly well the gruesomeness and consequences of totalitarian regimen and how people rise up against their evil dominator and how rebellion is stoked. Both sides use clever propaganda to gain more followers or make the enemy loose hope and loose followers. Katniss has emerged as a symbol of hope and resistance against the Capitol. The movie shows us well how in war every decision made, might it be to save your friends or to create hope by broadcasting powerful speeches, will have a response from the enemy that could result in a loss of more supporters and casualties. It brings to the viewer a much a darker and realistic view on civil war, its terror and suppression as some other movies featuring the same thematic. The movie is a bit more reserved when it comes to action and battles, but focuses more on the psychological aspect.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nor as good as the previous 2 but still good to watch.,"I watched this movie like the other two without reading the novel and without knowing anything about its plot. To be honest it was also very entertaining. Of course not as much as the last 2 but still it was very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. As usual Jennifer Lewrance is great and her performance is great, too. Most of supporting characters were good. Although, I didn't like Liam Himthworth tbh. I found a lack of scenes of the Capital. I wanted to see more scenes there. Also there were some plot holes which I found annoying during watching it and I didn't find any explanation for it. Also the ending isn't very saticfing.

dragging on...,"This movie tries hard, and it does what it can, but I agree with the reviewers that this is getting a little retread.

You will need to have seen the previous two movies to get this one. It's an OK film for action film fans and fans of the series.

Just a review,"I really liked it, i haven't been able to stop thinking about it ever since i left the theater. There were some parts that weren't great, but the other parts totally made up for that. Usually i'd rate this movie as a 8/9 but after reading some of the other reviews, i decided to give it a 10, because I really thinks it deserves better. It has a interesting plot and even though there is not a lot of action, it doesn't get boring at all. Most of the characters were very well substantiated, which made it easy to sympathize with them. I heard people saying the acting wasn't good, i totally disagree, Jennifer Lawrence was great, Josh Hutcherson was amazing, I liked Philip Seymour Hoffman a lot as well. I even liked Liam Hemsworth, he's getting better, I didn't like him that much in the first movies. And i'm actually quite happy that they made the book into two movies, it would've just been to much to put in one movie, people who have read the books will know.

The beginning of the end,"I had very little hope for this film, I assumed it would be the worst in the series as possibly the weakest book, therefore I set my expectations very low and was very surprised. Mockingjay part 1 kept me hooked into it from start to finish and I was very entertained. With great acting (especially from Jennifer Lawrence) and a very interesting plot. I might have enjoyed it because I was expecting a dull start to the end of the series, as nothing really seemed to kick off until the second half of the book.The film just seemed to flow by and made good use of the 2 hour runtime and I never found myself sitting there in boredom hoping for things to pick up a bit more. The tension was kept well throughout and finished well; it didn't finish on an appalling cliffhanger such as catching fire where you are left questioning the film but it also didn't drag on and bored everyone. Some scenes in the film were very tense and entertaining and had a few minor twists which kept me on the edge of my seat.Overall, If you like me are a big fan of the series but not as excited for this installment, I highly recommend you lower your expectations and go and see it. You will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"My least-favorite of the Hunger Games movie, but still enjoyable if only for the action and superb acting.","Well, I have done the first two so I decided to go on and review the other two films in the Hunger Games franchise.Here is my review of THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY - PART 1.The story continues to follow Katniss Everdeen; having twice survived the Hunger Games, Katniss finds herself in District 13. Under the leadership of President Coin and the advice of her trusted friends, Katniss reluctantly becomes the symbol of a mass rebellion against the Capitol and fights to save Peeta and a nation moved by her courage.Now, what I think of this movie. The reason why I am so confused is because I don't hate this movie, but I will say that this might be my least-favorite of the HG movies.This movie has gotten some unfair hate from critics and fans for "" lack of action and for splitting the novel into two separate adaptations."", but it has gotten some nice reviews for the acting.The acting is strong here again. You have all of the cast members returning including Jennifer Lawrence, who is still attractive as Katniss Everdeen, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne. The rest of the cast includes Julianne Moore as President Coin, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Evan Ross, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy, Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket, Julianne Moore as President Alma Coin, Donald Sutherland as President Coriolanus Snow, Stanley Tucci, Jeffrey Wright, Sam Claflin and Natalie Dormer, who I think is beautiful and I have recently seen her in the movie ""Rush"".The action is sort of lacking in this film because it's in two parts, but this is only the first part so what do you expect? I can't wait for Part 2, it's gonna be packed with action. The music is composed once again by James Newton Howard and the soundtrack is awesome with songs from Coldplay and Imagine Dragons.The script is not that strong, but it's still okay for this film and I really do like that this film is setting up the epic finale, setting up the end, but I think this movie could have used a lot more action.The costume and production design is really not horrible either and I give credit to the franchise for being awesome, but it's so messed up that this is the lowest-rated film in this series, as it has a rating of 65% on Rotten Tomatoes and the general consensus is: ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 sets up the franchise finale with a penultimate chapter loaded with solid performances and smart political subtext, though it comes up short on the action front."" and in it's own way, it is stupid but it's also really not that bad.The visual effects and action sequences are good as well, so, overall, with The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, I both love it and hate it. I like the acting, script, score, soundtrack, visuals, production techniques, but I hate some of the scenes and the lack of action.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Dark One In The Bunch,"Every franchise has that one film that has a very dark, somber tone to it and that's exactly what ""Mockingjay: Part 1"" became. I personally only had one issue with the film that isn't a huge deal. I thought the film should have been two hours and an extra forty-five minutes. It just seemed like one of those films. As the franchise gets closer to the end I would think that each film would get longer to make sure everything that needs to be in the film is in it. But that didn't affect the rating that I gave it. Solid, good film. It went places that it didn't go in the first two a little which is always nice and fresh for franchises like this. Let's be honest here though. Critics and Metascore can give this whatever color grade or number they want, the film is still gonna bring in big revenue.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good not great,"The biggest reason this movie and the next won't be as good as the first 2 is because of the books. The first 2 books had the games to make it action packed.

So, I give Mockingjay an 8/10 just because it was a good movie- just not the 9/10 I would give to the first 2 HG movies. The cast do their usual great work, in a situation much different than the previous films. Direction was good, and I thought angles of camera shots were well placed.

Jennifer Lawence: A 10 of 10 Star Performance,"As a stand alone movie, Part 1 is a good movie made great by Jennifer Lawrence. HOWEVER, as part of an epic that began when Katniss volunteers to be a tribute, to her ultimate destiny, this is a GREAT MOVIE. If you are a Hunger Games fan, disregard any criticism or shortcomings written by movie critics. Mockingjay 1 is a delicious appetizer that is the bridge to what will be, undoubtedly, the culmination of the greatest, most prescient movie(and books)of the dystopian genre. Kudos and praise to Suzanne Collins. But it is Jennifer Lawrence who transforms Suzanne Collin's Katniss Everdeen into the greatest female leading role in the history of movies. (And, to add, which male leading role surpasses Jennifer Lawrence's stellar performance in what will be 4 movies)""My,oh my"", to use a phrase that Caesar Flickerman once said to Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence may become, blossom into, the greatest American actress in the history of cinema. I've seen the greatest of the greats during my 60+ years: Meryl Strep, Katharine Hepburn, Ingrid Bergman, Betty Davis, Audrey Hepburn, etc.In life, we often look back and only then realize that we witnessed greatness.

I really hate her with no mercy with animals, and acted like she was kindhearted in the movie, such a hypocrite. Jenifer Lawrence's acting was awful, for example, at the beginning when she step on the skull, that is not how a person will act in real life, face expression is more complex than just cover your mouth and shred a tear, for people who are more emotional unstable they would even hold their fists so tight and tremble, but her character does not fit in this category and she has experience of seeing dead, so all she needed to act is complex face expression.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I think it's sad that a movie has to consist solely of explosions and gun fire in order to work for a wide audience.The first two movies of the hunger games series were okay, but this one takes the tale to a whole new level. It has a depth to it its predecessors lacked entirely. It's about the construction of a rebellion. Most positive reviews describe this film as a ""warm up for part 2, the real deal"". No, no, no. Part 2 will have all the action, yes, but this one has the >thought<. It deals with thoughts few films targeting young people ever do, and it does so reasonably well. I'm not saying this is a perfect film - not by far. There are tons of things to complain about, for starters the enforced teen romance bullshit. But gash, please don't complain about it being slow. If so, i guess it's just a bit too intelligent and deep for you.And finally, i really have to take a stand for Lawrence.

Hollywood continues ripping of Asian Cinema without any explanation..,"Is it just me who didn't think this film was better than the first? All the scenes were drawn out and there were so many stupid and unimportant scenes slotted in. ( Despite the fact everything was explained so a twelve year old could understand. Not only did it pretty much copy the first film. It started with Gale and Katniss hunting, like the first. All of it was a cliché and barely anything unpredictable. It's a shame that Jennifer Lawrence is incapable of making her role good. Just plain good. Nope, she's too bad an actress for that. After seeing this film, I doubt I will ever go to see another 'Jennifer Lawrence' film again unless my friends drag me to it. Save your money, do NOT spend your money on this, you will regret it. It's an awful film which contains: Clichés Plot holes the size of the state of Texas Ignored subplots Flat, boring characters Unrealistic ideas (I don't CARE if it's the future, some of the stuff is just plain stupid) Lack of acting skills. Only Phillip (R.I.P) could really do some decent acting. Even then, it was ONLY decent. Phillip was a brilliant actor, he let himself down in this film by not giving the best performance, but oh well. Finally, the most horrible thing of all: Overall. If I could rate this film, it would not even get 6 on IMDb. It'd get less than Disaster Movie, at least 1.2 stars. Do not see this film, unless of the age 12-14. If you're older, it's not a good idea. The film is not suitable for you. Honestly, the plot devices and conveniences are like they've been written by a (profanity removal) 12 year old. I feel as if the director didn't make this or his inner 12 year old allowed the script. I have no clue how Jennifer accepted the stupid childish ramble in her lines. Yes, the lines are all childish ramble. Nothing deep or clever placed into the script. It's effortless, but it is not well written. Jennifer Lawrence seriously needs to learn to pick appropriate roles. She's not a bad actress, but this is making me think she is.I'm not sure if the film is so bad because the books weren't great, but even so, this film should have been written properly to make sure the script made sense.

The Mockingjay Lives,"In the very beginning of ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 1"", 17-year-old Katniss Everdeen has been through a hell of a lot. She went through two Hunger Games, her love Peeta has been taken by the Capitol and as witnessed later, she sees that her home District 12 has been destroyed by no other than the sinisterly wicked President Coriolanus Snow who has kidnapped and brainwashed poor Peeta in order to call off the radical rebellion that's happening against the dystopian world of Panem and to get rid of the cause known as the Mockingjay. So far, it totally seems that we're closer to the end of an amazing series. The tone gets very dark, the political ideas and serious themes are more thought-provoking and it's surprisingly different from the previous two. Gone are the stunning arenas and colorfully bold costumes and it adds in a more darker (or gray-ish) palette and a few key elements that makes the first part of the third and final book of Suzanne Collins' marvelous trilogy a gripping and strong, if not better, addition in the series. The always wonderful Oscar-winning Jennifer Lawrence takes Katniss to new heights. She's broken, haunted, tormented by nightmares and still suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. She's confined in an underground bunker known as District 13, run by President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore in a solid performance). Coin is unsure about Katniss, seeing that she is still suffering after the events in the Third Quarter Quell in ""Catching Fire"". Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman in one of his final roles) insists that she still has to be the Mockingjay. It's a simple logic: Show the rebellion that she is still standing and fighting until the end by filming propaganda (or ""propos"") videos. Take the scene in District 8, after a airstrike sent by Snow (Donald Sutherland), she speaks from the heart knowing that the rebels won't surrender that easy after that event. Still, Katniss is ripped apart by many things. She still cares for Gale (the incredible Liam Hemsworth) who's ready for the revolution to happen, but her heart belongs to Peeta (a heart wrenching and soulful Josh Hutcherson), as mentioned that he is the Capitol's puppet or just saving Katniss from devastation. But she is saved by her mom (Paula Malcomson) and her sister, Prim (the adorable Willow Shields). Also joining in the ranks are another broken victor Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin), Katniss' mentor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) who is now sober and still very helpful, Cressida (a wickedly cool Natalie Dormer from ""The Tudors"" and ""Game of Thrones""), a filmmaker trying to capture as much as she can with Katniss in the middle of all this along with her camera crew, a wheelchair-bound Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) who communicates with transporting video signals and crashing it through the Capitol and Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), a smart deviation from the book, who does not like being in a world full of gray jumpsuits but comes around eventually. Taking apart the final book in a series and turning it into two movies doesn't really seem necessary (it worked out before with ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight""), but returning director Francis Lawrence of ""Catching Fire"" and screenwriters Danny Strong (""The Butler"", ""Game Change"") and Peter Craig (""The Town"") with adaptation by Suzanne Collins herself manages to keep the film moving at a slow but breakneck pace to give us some deep insights in the world of Panem, expands its scope a bit more, and getting us really connected and involved with the world while staying true to Collins's book and changing and fixing some of the weaknesses of the book. There's not much action this time around (there's only two big set pieces), but it's deeply rooted in the story and characters and the human drama behind it works its way though our minds. And again, the movie and this franchise wouldn't work if it weren't for Jennifer Lawrence. She makes Katniss a wounded, vulnerable, but strong and charismatic heroine that's joining in the ranks of strong females such as Lisbeth Salander and Hermione Granger. In a surprisingly sweet moment, she belts out a signature moment from the book, ""The Hanging Tree"", a bluegrass-type of song. When she sings, we immediately feel it and we see that she becomes a beacon of hope for the rebellion. I know it's only one half of a movie but it's only half good when it ends with a thrilling climax involving a rescue mission and a striking cliffhanger that leads our way into the finale. What will the final film bring to the table? I don't know. But if you're thinking with a groan or a relieved sigh for next year, make sure your homework is prepared and you got enough information so that you won't be lost in the system. Since it's the calm before the storm, ""Mockingjay: Part 1"" may not have a whole lot to take it all in, but it refuses to back down and stands up for the revolution and the power of changing the world one day at a time.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Jennifer Lawrence Horrible Acting,"I just got home from watching this movie and had to express my frustration. This had all the foundations of a solid movie. Great production. Good cast. Decent story- although they were working with half a book worth of material so they stretched it out until it was pretty thin sometimes. There was less action in this movie than the other Hunger Games- this one was more of a political intrigue focusing on character portrayals with Katniss at the center; lots of focus on her inner turmoils.So a lot of the movie focused on Katniss. And Jennifer Lawrence's acting was just horrible. She was crying and being hysterical like four out of every five scenes that she was in. Lots of sophisticated actors and actresses in the movie and then there was Jennifer Lawrence like she was straight out of high school trying too hard and overdoing everything. It was very irritating to watch her for two hours. Imagine having to watch a teenage drama queen have attitude followed by breakdowns for two hours. To tell the truth I am surprised because she came across as a sophisticated and mature actress in American Hustle.Her performance reminded me a little of Shea LeBoef's acting in Transformers. Just neurotic and way over the top. Some people might like it. Not my style.Was it not for her, the movie was pretty good.

She is a girl, she got pushed around by politicians, she doesn't want to a part of any of this. The acting is very good, specially Lawrence, Sutherland and Harrelson. Peeta is still annoying, just like in the other movies. The book was written by a women where a girl is main character and written in first person. Of course there is a love triangle.

First and Last Hunger Games Movie I Will Ever Watch on the Big Screen,"Watched the movie today and sadly it didn't add up to my expectations, and the hype that everyone was making. It is very dull. They wasted great actors like Julianne Moore. The whole movie is just all over the place. I think there was only one arrow shot. They didn't even show the cinematic effect of the bombing of the rebel base. Just some reaction of the actors-- not enough. I'd like to remember some scenes while doing this review, but none really stood out, just the face of Katniss with a confused face.Really, this was the first from the HG franchise that I watched on the big screen, expecting it to be y'know, better than the first 2. But, nah I'll just keep on remembering the scenes from Guardians of the Galaxy and looking forward to The Battle of the Five Armies.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hunger Games: The Mockingjay Part 1...what worked and what didn't!,"As a big fan of the Hunger Games Trilogy, I was super eager to see Mockingjay Part 1 at the cinema on opening day. While overall, the movie is good and largely true to the book there were elements of it that just didn't work for me.Jennifer Lawrence delivers another stellar performance as Katniss Everdeen, but somehow, she looks ""too old"" for the role of the 17 year old tribute. While there is no doubting her acting ability, there were times when I found myself thinking that it just wasn't working. The same applies to Willow Shields (Prim) who no longer appeared to be the ""little sister""Other returning actors, Josh Hutcherson (Peeta), Phillip Seymour Hoffman (PLutarch), Donald Sutherland (Snow) and Woody Harrelson (Haymitch) all put up great performances worthy of mention. By far and away, the stars of this movie were Sam Claflin (Finnick) and the amazing Elizabeth Banks (Effie).For me, Julianne Moore just didn't work as Coin. I couldn't work out if it was a casting error, an acting issue or a screen writing problem but it just wasn't right.It was evident that there was a bigger budget on this movie than the previous 2 and I do think there were things that could have been done better, but overall, I thought the movie was good. The decision to include Effie Trinkett in this move was absolutely right and it's definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Boring and disappointing,"I am truly disappointed! I loved the past 2 hunger games movie and i was excited to see Mockingjay, but i sat in the movies with my eyes begging to be shut. It is terribly boring. I'll go straight to my point, the trailer is misleading because the plot doesn't go anywhere. It doesn't build like a normal movie plot should, no introduction no climax no ending no nothing. I spent 2 hours sitting there waiting for something to finally happen. For a war to break, or someone to die, or the setting to change, but the actors just talk and talk and continue talking right to the end. I understand the directors or whoever is in charge is trying to make this movie two parts to gain more profit but this is a total rip off. I don't know if it's just me but I don't quite get whats happening most of the times, I haven't read the book so i was a little confused about the story in Mockingjay but shouldn't book adapted movies be watchable to everyone. I loved the actors and their acting was good in the last two movies but i find them not believable in this one, including Jennifer Lawrence. Many people might not agree with me but i think the actors kind of lacked effort in Mockingjay. There is one thing i liked in this movie, and the only one, which is the song Jennifer Lawrence sang. The song was written by the writers of this movie and i think its beautiful and haunting. I give Mockingjay 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Exceeded My Expectations,"As an avid fan of the Hunger Games books and the first two movies. I must admit I was a little worried that the Mockingjay Movies wouldn't be a good because of the lack of action. Boy was I wrong. Yes there isn't nearly as much in fight scenes but who needs it. Mockingjay was far better than the Hunger Games & Catching Fire.Jennifer Lawrence is an acting genius she makes you feel the emotions with her, and I love the signing scene the song is so catching and she has such a bluesy voice.They still lighten the mood a little bit with plenty of funny one liners that make you laugh.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Big Disappointment of the Year,"I don't know how this movie got 7.5 out of 10 so far but for me its awful. There's not much to be happy about in ""Mockingjay,"" which shouldn't come as a surprise if you've read the book (it's pretty depressing).Much of the film plays out in District 13, a secret underground bunker revealed in last year's ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" that's led by President Coin (Julianne Moore).Unlike the previous two films, ""Mockingjay"" doesn't have a whole lot of action. Katniss fires off only one arrow throughout the film from her now iconic bow. The first movie of this year that I kept checking the clock for movie to end . It was so boring , I felt like I just watch 1/4 of the story line . I should have watch Big Hero 6 second time rather than paying to see this movie",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A great slow burn that sets up a fantastic finale,"The Hunger Games books are surprisingly great reads, but fans would mostly agree that the third book just isn't as consistently engaging as the first two. It's not dreadful by any means, but it does not make good use of the extra room it has with the lack of the hunger games themselves. I will say that I like the games as entertainment but the most thought provoking parts come outside of the games, so it was disappointing that Suzanne Collins just could not come up with enough interesting interactions and moments to keep it interesting.The fact that the first two books really focused on Katniss worked very well. Sadly, the third book continues focusing solely on her point of few when it should have opened up more. As a reader, you miss out on the big picture because the only picture we're getting is Katniss. This expanded focus makes The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 one of the few films that is better than the source material.Mockingjay starts almost exactly after the conclusion of Catching Fire. Katniss Everdeen, Jennifer Lawrence, arrives in District 13 where she discovers that Plutarch Heavensbee, Phillips Seymour Hoffman, and District 13's president Alma Coin, Julianne Moore, want her made into the revolution's face/symbol. Next you learn that Peeta, Josh Hutcherson, has been taken captive by the Capitol and is forced into doing propaganda for President Snow, Donald Sutherland. Katniss agrees to be the face of the revolution, which entails filming propaganda, but only if District 13 agrees to rescue Peeta and so the revolution begins.This movie has far less the action than the previous two movies and instead can be seen more as a character study of how previous events affected the characters. The film touches on issues of PTSD, War, Remorse, death, and is pretty depressing at times but emotionally stunning at others. The films themes about control and perception are expertly injected, and never take a back seat to action sequences. Director, Francis Lawrence, wisely focuses on the story and all the characters instead of the world. This might be the most subdued film in terms of action in the series despite being the biggest in terms of budget, and yet that is a positive not a negative.In the third book, the reader is forced to get all its information through Katniss, and it just does not work. The film's take shifts the focus to a wider view of the characters and this makes even small events that occur have more meaning. For instance, The rescue of Peeta really is not explained well in the book, but in the film it is constructed way more effectively, and revs up the tension dramatically.The films drastic change in focus creates some changes in plot that some purists might get upset about, but in the end the story is better off. Katniss feels less powerless in the film and it makes her character more interesting. With the first two movies under her belt, Jennifer Lawrence is really bringing the character to life, and man does she know how to deliver a powerful speech. She is surrounded by a cast that should get its due as well. Moore is solid as Alma Coin and Hoffman's subdued but great performance shows what a shame it was to see him go too soon. Woody Harrelson Haymitch is still fantastic, but his character gets moved a bit to the side thanks to a complex plot and the love competition between Peeta and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) that is actually handled well. Most of the rest of the cast really do a great job as well.Book adaptations are more often than not tricky business, especially when a single book is split into two movies. The main problem is trying to find a spot to stop the movie about halfway through where nothing was supposed to conclude. Mockingjay mostly avoids this, even if there are some small parts that make this feel like part one of a single story. Mockingjay part 1 builds differently from the previous two films. The difference being that the film is actually building toward something, but instead of just the plot advancing you get character advancement as well and that makes this a very different but improved experience.

"Boring, No Action, Stiff Acting","There are a few good actors/actresses in this film, yet their acting is incredibly stiff/emotionless. There is no action at all throughout this incredibly predictable film. It's very slow and obviously a stretched out film to make money, there was a section where they could have done a nice battle scene, yet all you saw was an emotionless actressess giving calm, pretty obvious orders.The plot was incredibly basic, a very poor 3rd film in the story. Why this lastest for 2 hours i don't know, they could have easily cut this down to 15 minutes.If you have trouble sleeping, go watch this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the biggest surprises of the year!,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 is the third Hunger Games in the series which follows Katniss Everdeen as she is now left to be the face of hope for the rebellion against the Capitol, while also facing pressure from Peeta, who has appeared to have been captured by the capitol. (It's a conflict theme, not a spoiler) -Anyway. I would have never expected Mockingjay to be one of my favorite films of the year, but I was wrong. SO WRONG. Actually it's going to be really hard to find negative things to say about this film, but I will try.-The story itself is different because there are no games, but this one focuses on characters and the political war between the rebels and the Capitol, which I thought was great! There was also action for those of you who like that and the love triangle is still there, but not as painfully in-your-face, for those of you who watch it to see Gale.-The pace is very good. I didn't get bored at all. It has some very funny moments too! Also the tone is much more optimistic than Catching Fire.-The acting is better too! I loved Jennifer Lawrence in it. She's totally hot. There, I said it. Philip Seymour Hoffman is in a lot of the film and I loved him in it! Yeah everybody was really good.-The characters themselves are pretty solid. It's nice seeing Katniss make up her mind. And this film offers more room for lovable characters like Haymitch and Effie to grow! -The effects were very good.-The music is even better than the other two! -So some negatives. It does feel like it is split up into two films. It introduces new characters and we don't see a lot from everybody. That's about all.-Content: This one is tricky. There is no language and no suggestive content or nudity. There are some violent images that are tough even for PG-13. It's not Schindler's List, but not for young kids.-So overall I will say that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 is great all around. If you liked the first two, see this one! It is TOTALLY worth seeing in theaters! I'm probably going to see it again! I would give Mockingjay a strong 8.5/10! If you haven't seen Catching Fire, it's on Netflix. Watch that and then see this.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Simply Fantastic! Everything I Wanted!!,"This much anticipated film is absolutely fantastic with some action and a stellar cast that will blow your mind! This epic story continues with Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peetar Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) who both play a big part in the lives of District 13'ers, each in their own way. They want to unite and save an entire nation. In order to do this, they need the help of their friends and new alliances.I completely love this film and the overall production. It's intense and has such a grand feel to it. With scene after scene, it gets bigger and bigger and you see just how powerful one voice can be. The aerial shots, emotions, excitement and the anticipation of what's happening next basically keeps your eyes glued to the screen. I've read all the books and this adaption is very true to the original stories. Jennifer Lawrence's performance is incredible. She becomes her character completely with a range of emotions - anger, doubt, disbelief and feeling sorry. She is so convincing. My favorite character is Peetar. Although he is not on-screen time as much as the other characters, he plays a big part in the film. Peeta is what drives Katniss throughout the film as she struggles to get to him. Almost everything she does is a result of her wanting to save Peeta. I also like Peeta because, every time he is on screen, he seems to change and intensify the situation. My favorite scene is when Katniss sees Peeta for the very first time. She is shocked and, at the same time, grateful that he is alive. It is nice to see all of the questions that go though her mind through her own eyes. Katniss' eyes reveal how she feels about Peeta.I recommend this film for ages 13 to 18 and I give it 4 out of 5 stars. It is a little slow in the beginning, but I understand why. They have to bring you up to speed with what happened in the previous film. I cannot wait to see Part 2!Satisfy your excitement and see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1. It is playing in theaters now, so please check it out.Reviewed by Brianna B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Same Problems as The Matrix Sequels,"The Hunger Games was interesting on the premise that youths were forced to kill each other in gladiator type matches for the entertainment of a ruling class. The ruling class oppressed the lower classes and used the games to keep them in a state of fear and control. Simple concept that only hinted at what the society was actually like as the entertainment from the actual games is what the hook is. And like the Matrix the idea of a society in Zaion is only hinted at as true main hook is being in the Matrix and the action that comes with it.But when you try to provide answers to how those societies actually function it not only is less interesting but it also kind of falls apart if you really think about it.This movie tries to go for a lot of emotional depth but by the time they say the word ""Mockingjay"" the 10th time I was pretty much done with what they were going for as no normal person would talk that way. We get it she's an important symbol to the movement just call her by her name. And Katniss doing this back and forth ""I can't be the Mockingjay"" and then ""I will be your Mockingjay"" this movie ended up being a real struggle to get through.I might as well finish the next one but wish I had just stopped at Catching Fire. The Maze Runner ended better than this and that's not saying a lot.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Jennifer Lawrence makes this work,"When the producers decided to break Mockingjay into two films, we were pretty much fixed on a course where Part One was going to be anti-climactic compared to the rest of the series. So, no, it's not quite as good as Catching Fire (and thus, nowhere near the level of The Hunger Games). But still, this edition does a good job expanding the Penam universe, and developing the story of our heroine Katniss.Katniss works so well because she's authentic, free of the practiced cynicism that permeates President Snow and even the leaders of the rebellion. A key moment is when Haymitch Abernathy explains this fact to them. And it's really hard to imagine any young actress pulling this off as well as Jennifer Lawrence, who exudes authenticity herself.So Mockingjay has the emotional pull, it has a solid story line, it has a well-constructed dystopian world, and it has a solid cast with an exceptionally talented lead. It lacks only a satisfying conclusion, but as Part One, that can hardly be a surprise.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Redbox I want my $1.50 back,"For me, the Hunger Games trilogy books ended with a thud in Mockingjay. The book had a plodding, slapdash feel and I could barely get through it.

If you dislike this movie. . .,"If you dislike this movie, it's because:A) You haven't read the books B) You don't like the books and/or the Mockingjay book in particular C) You have been conditioned to CGI explosions every 5 mins in Blockbuster films and cannot handle a character-driven movieThe Hunger Games films (excluding the first one) have been the most faithful book-to-screen adaptation I've ever seen. This movie follows EXACTLY the book. It IS the book.I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I was so excited throughout it, and went through all the emotions, even tearing up!So if you don't like it, your beef is with Suzanne Collins' Mockingjay book, not the film.

I actually liked this movie BETTER THAN THE BOOK. There IS action, but it's a different kind of action.I couldn't take my eyes off of Jen, and Josh (Peeta) really pulled it off. I didn't think he could do it. Liam (Gale) stepped up too, because for the first time in the series I actually felt sorry/understood his character. Willow (Prim) also feels more dimensional.

Two hours of bland and over-stretched set-up,"As said with the first two 'Hunger Games' films (which had its plus points but didn't do much for me), the books are fun, scary, thrilling and moving though because being so rich in detail and characterisation they are difficult to adapt.Generally the films, while all with their good points, don't do them justice, following the basic details but with the spirit watered down to blandness and the characters nowhere near as fascinating. Judging the films on their own terms is to me a fairer way to judge though, and will be done here because they are problematic on their own. Of the four films (which all have good points but just as enough problems that stop me from caring for them much), 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part I' is the weakest, it feels too much like set-up and set-up that's very tame and really struggles to justify its length.There are certainly good things. The production values, some dodgy special effects aside, are very well done with the nightmarishly dystopian production design faring best, it's lit with atmosphere and luckily the cinematography and editing is not the sloppy and frenetic kind seen in the first film. The score is thrilling and emotive, and there are some good performances here. This is particularly true of a terrific Jennifer Lawrence, dastardly Donald Sutherland, moving Philip Seymour Hoffman, smarmy Stanley Tucci and classy Julianne Moore.Not all the cast work. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson are still lacking charisma and expression, while Elizabeth Banks (a high point of the first film) and Woody Harrelson have nothing to do.Lack of character development and halfway-decent writing plays a large part here. The characters had a lot of meat to them before but here are pretty bland stereotypes with non-existent development or direction, Katniss excepted. Didn't find myself caring for the relationship between Katniss and Peeta, mainly because of Peeta being written and played so blandly but also the chemistry didn't seem to be there. The writing does feel under-cooked, with some cringe-worthy moments and lacks edge or any kind of emotion a lot of the time.'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part I' could have easily been shorter, because the story feels far too thin and over-stretched which makes some scenes interminably dull and dreary. The film is basically set-up and after finishing on a note every bit as abrupt as the ending for 'Catching Fire' it feels like set-up that doesn't lead or go anywhere. Atmosphere-wise, it just feels rather tame in alternative to tense and leaden rather than edgy. The direction is pretty pedestrian here.In summary, bland and over-stretched despite some good performances, production values and music. 4/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If we burn, you burn with us!","I just came back from the theater and my mind is blown. I am a fan of the HG books.

Governments should be afraid of their people."" That is the entire message of the HG trilogy for me. And this movie nailed it. I dare to say they give a more powerful message than the one given in the book. It is more clear, more intense, and I loved it. The movie was excellent.The performances were incredible. I always loved The Hanging Tree and the way Jennifer sang it was beautiful. There are a lot of powerful moments that are well balanced with comic reliefs.

I am sure Part 2 will be awesome now, since all the action will happen, but I think this movie could have easily been 30 minutes long.

Bore Inc. 3.1.: Mocking Gay,"I appreciated the first two movies of the dystopian coming-of-age franchise that is a little bit too closely inspired by ""Battle Royale"" but this first part of the third and last instalment is a massive waste of time and a cheap attempt at grabbing some cash from the numerous fan-boys and especially fan-girls. In my opinion, both occasional viewers and faithful fans should ignore this release, read the novel instead, and come back to the cinema for the second part of the grand finale. This movie only prepares for the last part of the series, a little bit like ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" but it's even worse.Everything that I enjoyed about the entertaining first two releases is completely absent in this movie. The story has no tension at all and consists almost only of hollow dialogs. One could almost say that there is no real story. The rebels are trying to turn a few propaganda movies, the population is demonstrating against the Capitol and that's it.Instead of survival action, we get to see depressive and lengthy chamber play scenes in grey bunkers. The colourful and exciting locations are gone and replaced by dark concrete structures that make even the most functional Soviet cities look beautiful. The special effects in this movie are not even close to the breathtaking images from the first two parts. Even the soundtrack of the movie is a lot more generic than before. One of the worst parts of the movie was when main actress Jennifer Lawrence suddenly started to sing. It sent shivers down my spine but in a very negative way and it reminded me of some lyrics from an old Puddle of Mudd song: ""I never wanna hear you sing, you sound just like a little kid."" Jennifer Lawrence' vocal performance must be the worst I have ever witnessed in cinema. Nothing improved in this movie and everything that made the Hunger Games franchise so popular is gone.Even the acting is a lot less convincing than in the first movies as it mostly feels numb and unreal. Julianne Moore as President Alma Coin is pale and not credible at all in her role as nobody would follow such an uncharismatic leader in real life. Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee looks like an annoying and old guy who thinks he is funny and cool but happens to be only embarrassing and stupid as he acts like he was mentally retarded. Even the characters I appreciated in the first two movies seem like pale copies of their former selves. I was eager to see Woody Harrelsen in his unique role as Haymitch Abernathy again but he only has a very small role and feels like a completely different character all of a sudden. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket is a lot less colourful, eccentric and sarcastic than before. I'm aware of the fact that the general mood of the movie is supposed to be darker and more mature but the acting hasn't become more credible but simply shallower. In an unfitting contrast to this, Jennifer Lawrence is simply overacting her role as Katniss Everdeen. Every five minutes, you see her crying in a corner of her bunker, exaggeratedly hobbling through some ruins and yelling at everybody and everything when she's not pleased with something. In the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the movie, this acting seems like a welcome change to the tame acting of the others but a few minutes later one gets the impression that the main character has not only become a lot less mature than before but that she is simply out of her mind and dealing with important mental problems. It's not realistic at all to count on a bipolar princess who acts less mature than a twelve-year old and who only cares about her lover even though this is one of the least credible cinematic love stories I have ever seen to lead a revolution. At some point, her cringe-worthy emotional outbursts become unintentionally funny and would rather fit into a slapstick comedy movie.It was incredibly hard to sit through the entire movie. I kept believing as I was hoping for an explosive ending and the only interesting scene of the entire film takes indeed place in the last fifteen minutes but it isn't worth the wait either. Giving three points out of ten in here is still extremely generous. Instead of making me impatiently wait for the final chapter, I'm now seriously asking myself if I should not give up on the franchise. I really liked the first two movies but this one here is plain awful. As I said before, read the novel or a short synopsis but avoid this hollow flick at all costs. It's not worth spending money on it, it wouldn't even be worth watching it if it was for free. This movie is easily the biggest cinematic disappointment of the year.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Good Setup for the Finale,"My first reaction to Mockingjay Part 1: wow, this is going to be long.My second: wow, this is good.Those two thoughts pretty much sum up my experience viewing Mockingjay Part 1. I really didn't care for Mockingjay the book as much as the first two parts of The Hunger Games trilogy, so when I heard it was being split into two parts, I knew this was a good possibility. Taking the same cast and crew as Catching Fire plus a few additions was a good idea, but making Mockingjay into two movies made me think of other young adult series that have suffered the same fate and not turned out as well as they could have if it was one film.That being said, Mockingjay Part 1 gets off to a good start for this two-part epic, mostly because of the script. The pace is a little deliberate, and there's not much action; however, the film turns into a war film shortly after it opens and begins poking fun (in a completely legitimate satire kind of way) at propaganda films. This makes it the darkest of The Hunger Games movies yet, which suited me quite nicely. This being the first of the series without the actual Hunger Games, it felt like a natural step forward for the franchise, and I quite enjoyed its highly political themes. Many times, Mockingjay Part 1 feels more like a political exploration of war and its logistics rather than a battlefield epic, making it quite interesting and thought-provoking. I am fairly confident in saying that Part 2 will have far more of the battlefield epic fans expect and less of this ""boring logistical stuff""; however, Part 1 works very well as a setup for an action- packed conclusion.Speaking of being dark, Mockingjay Part 1's aesthetic is very dim. Most of the film is set in the tunnels and underground chambers of District 13 or takes place at night. I personally felt that District 13 was a more than adequate adaptation of Collins's world from the book that also blended in with Panem as we are familiar with it in the films. The outlandish costuming and extravagant makeup is gone; however, this is the way it is supposed to be, so I didn't mind it one bit.The acting in Mockingjay Part 1 is solid to say the least. Jennifer Lawrence once again commands the film in her role of Katniss; however, she and Donald Sutherland as President Snow are the only characters who actually remain static from Catching Fire to this film. Josh Hutcherson's Peeta is very different (sorry, no spoilers), Woody Harrelson's Haymitch is sober for the first time since his youth, Elizabeth Banks's Effie Trinket is deprived of her Capitol fashion, and Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch is less double-crossing and more commanding. Liam Hemsworth also gives one of the better performances of his career as Gale due to his increased role. The various newcomers from District 13 perform admirably as well, especially Julianne Moore as President Coin. However, I sometimes feel that Haymitch and Katniss are not given enough moments to shine in Mockingjay Part 1, making this film not quite as enjoyable as it could have been.The direction of Mockingjay Part 1 is very similar to Catching Fire, mostly due to the retention of the latter's director, Francis Lawrence. The cinematography brings a little of the first film's shaky camera-work, but it's just the right amount, making the film feel a little more raw and personal. While I didn't think I would like this, it was done in a very tasteful manner. The pace feels a little off sometimes, especially in the beginning; however, as a rule, this is a well-directed film that sets up its sequel well.Overall, Mockingjay Part 1 is a good film. It's not a drastic improvement on its source material (and definitely not its predecessor Catching Fire), but it does what any first-half movie is supposed to do in setting up the ending. Fans of the Hunger Games franchise should like it; however, those unfamiliar should at least view the previous two films before seeing this one.

Each one gets better than the last!,"Although I have to admit, I miss the whole Hunger Games concept that the 1st two flicks had.This movie is all about one military district trying to start a televised revolution with Katniss Everdeen being their spokesperson, despite her most dire concern is freeing Pita from the clutches of President Snow. So it moves from a kind of game show/reality show theme into a metaphor on how two different political struggles use the media to campaign their agenda to the people.But I make it seem like I went to see the movie because of it's complex reflection on contemporary mass media. No, it was action packed with JLaw looking crazy hot as the mocking jay, battling the capital. I thought this was suppose to be a chick flick? My mistake.In the mist of spinning ideas that make it seem like movies similar to the recent release, Kill the Messenger, between are action sequence that make it seem like Black Hawk Down. It's almost a fantasy version of Zero Dark Thirty, which at times seem like quiet overkillBut it did get my heart pumping with suspense, and I loved every minute of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the worst movies of all time,"Yes i read book, but i do not think this affected my opinion about the movie.Acting was terrible, i have no doubt that Jennifer Lawrance will be nominated for Razzie award for this terrible performance.Plot was insufferable and worst of all, the idea of cutting the movie into two part was just meaningless. Great Julianne Moore, even you can not save this bad, bad movie.Obviously, they extended so many line just to make sure that they have enough ''minutes'' to make a movie, that's why we watched so many boring dialog and so many bad acting.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
8.5/10,"I've never been the wildest fan of the Hunger Games franchise. Even before seeing the first movie I always thought the premise had amazing potential (never read the books, just based on the premise), that was confirmed when I saw the first movie. The potential was huge and was there, but unfortunately it wasn't used. I thought the first one was a plain bad movie: it had huge storytelling problems and repeatedly failed to live up to its own intentions. The second one was definitely an improvement. I still didn't see the franchise living up to its potential, but it certainly had some very good moments. Yet, the huge storytelling issues remained. That's where my problems have always laid with the franchise up until now: it has never really given me a coherent world building. Well I can say that now, with the third installment, the franchise has finally given me the satisfaction I wanted from the very start, it has finally realized its potential, used it properly and, call me surprised, it has given us an f**cking good movie.Some minor storytelling issues remain, but finally the major shortcuts and grand visual incoherences from the first couple of movies have gone away and gave me the possibility of looking at the movie without having to be taken out of it every other moment. Visually the franchise has never looked better, the camera work is very smooth and polished and gave an enormous contribution to tension in multiple scenes, yet most importantly there are great set pieces and moments that, thanks to some good CGI, contributed to fantastic imagery. But, where the movie really succeeds is in characters and commentary. Everybody has their moment, everyone gets a full rounded job. You will feel depth and various levels on every character both in good and dark. Doing this at the very best and definitely the highlight of the cast is Hoffman. He was magnetic every time on screen and I didn't even really like him in the previous movie. But here he is astoundingly great and adds to every single moment he has on screen something more to his character, he gives him true depth. Aside him Moore and Sutherland are excellent, Hutcherson is amazing in what he is given, a lesser actor could have really butchered the part, and obviously Lawrence is as stunningly spectacular as always. I was on the edge of my seat many and many times and that final act was absolutely nail biting, this is definitely helped by the strong imagery used by the movie that is exactly what I wanted from it (that last shot was amazing), something that the previous entries din't succeed in. Good job Francis Lawrence, you brought me from nearly hating this franchise in the start to ""can't wait for the next movie"" status.Allbeit the movie has missteps. It falls into useless sentimentality more than a couple of times and it did this totally gratuitously in one sequence (involving saving a cat) and brought down the movie a lot instead of elevating it. I cringed more than once and that is never a good thing. The first half of the movie could have been slightly cut, it gave weight to way too many things that didn't have it and dragged out story lines that could have been solved in a much more easier way, even worst is the fact that some of these were basic clichéd moments to get an initial drama going. Moreover, most unfortunately, some story issues remain, they are very smaller than previously, but still they were made the more annoying by the fact that the previous entries had a very bad track record in the matter for me.I've seen lots of underwhlment in regards to this movie by fans and by people who were excited for it. I think that there is one main reason for which I liked this movie so much and so much more than everybody else. I wasn't excited for it. I had never really liked any of the movies before, only like the second one, so I didn't really care a lot for this one and moreover I had no absolute idea where it was going, I really don't know anything about this franchise other than what the movies show me so that's why I was so surprised by this entry.The movie is the best of the franchise so far for me, it was a truly thrilling experience and more than that, it was a really good film that ranks definitely in the best dozen or so of the year so far.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

copy and paste of Battle Royale 2,"Abnormally, i'd generally like to experience remade flicks. More so the if i loved the original. I know there are extremely few which equals or excels to the original but it's not a big problem for me 'cause i don't even expect them to. It is to me like a bonus track of a beloved album, no more no less.So i got no hesitation in checking Hunger Games as well (i was even excited actually) 'cause the original must be in my all-time best 10, but, oh my..I won't say any more about this XEROX COPY crap. (copied on retarded machine, moreover) Nough said by nough people.Now one thing i just can't believe is how this could be legal. As far as i've read on internet articles, Suzanne Collins and her people haven't even paid a penny to the original Battle Royale makers for doing this, which means Hunger Games is not an official remake of Battle Royale. Then what the h..! is Hunger Games's identity? Some's gonna say it's JUST BASED ON or INSPIRED thing but you know it's way beyond those kinds. Then what? Sort of Homage thing ? Yea possible, but Suzanne Collins and her company have hardly mentioned about the original on either official ads & reports or non-official comments. Instead, Suzanne Collins's kept saying she's got a bit INSPIRED ONLY and Hunger Games is totally different from Battle Royale 2 or something like that. Besides, more importantly, while shamelessly copying scenes-by-scenes from Battle Royale 2, Suzanne Collins intentionally missed the KEY-POINT of Battle Royale 2's story for his own audiences' taste, for COMMERCIAL PURPOSE in other words. Then how can we call it Homage anyway ? My conclusion is : Hunger Games is not only a copy crap, it's rather A CRIME, LITERALLY. I don't understand why Battle Royale 2 makers let them make money with this stolen thing.Am i disappointed ? No i'm fine i didn't even expect. I'm just p***ed and upset for this shitmakers' shamelessness that's all.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Unimaginative, basic and sterile","Do you remember when you were a kid and your parents were constantly on you to wash the dishes. So you'd spend the next hour using every excuse in the arsenal to avoid it. Eventually, you'd relent and grudgingly do your duty. Of course, you'd ensure that you made a complete mess of the entire thing. You'd deliberately leave some dishes a little dirty, splash water and soap everywhere and perhaps even go as far as chipping a dish or two, all in the hope that if you did a bad enough job, you'd never be asked to do the dishes ever again...... well, I'm pretty sure that's what they were going for when they made Mocking Jay.The movie grinds its way slowly from one over-analysed scene to the next with very little in the way of exciting set-pieces in-between. I believe the running time is perhaps this movie's biggest enemy as most scenes were heavily drawn out and padded with needless and dull dialogue. There were a number of scenes that were clearly supposed to be tense and gripping, but failed miserably.The entire movie is just so underwhelming and should have been better!I love sci-fi.

Almost Perfect,"The Hunger Games: Mocking Jay, was very close to a perfect movie. Jennifer Lawrence delivers an emotionally intense, but believable Katniss Everdeen. The Characters portrayed were intelligent and believable. At no point did they make choices that would seem illogical or out of place, simply to drive the plot forward... (with one small exception) like in so many movies these days.The movie was genuinely inspiring, and generally unpredictable. Leaving the audience squirming in their seats as they try to anticipate the coming scenes. Certainly I am glad to have never read the books, because knowing how things would have played out would have ruined so much of the suspense and intensity. At no point was I bored, choosing to hold my bladder for the final half our, so as not to miss a moment.EXTREME SPOILERS AHEAD, only for those that have already seen the movie: My only small gripe, the only thing that makes this movie not completely perfect, (and this is certainly a subjective opinion) is President snow's choice to allow the rescue-team to recover the tributes from the capitol. Sure, one of them had a small chance to kill Katnis, sure she would feel emotional trauma at the pain inflicted on Peta, but I imagine it would have been a lot more effective to execute them, than to give them such a moral boosting victory and allowing them to save more important figure-heads of the rebellion. This decision did not seem as smart, nor as sociopathic as I imagine President Snow to be. I can live with writing this off as President snow being rather demented and therefor somewhat unpredictable, but not without a little reservation.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

They have done such a great job with the films and I can't wait for part 2 to come out to see the conclusion of the Hunger Games Story. This Whole story is actually very true of what could happen in the world today and it has such a truth of a how young women like Katniss can be leaders and how strong they are. It shows that just one voice can make a huge impact in the world. This World needs more voices to stand out from the darkness and how your voice can be so powerful.

Two movies one plot!,I thought this movie was a great movie. My biggest complaint about this movie is I feel like this was a cash grab. Don't get me wrong I think this was a really well done cash grab up but I feel as though the last book Mockingjay part one and two could have been combined into one single movie.With that out of the way I think this was a really good movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. I think that Jennifer Lawrence did a really good job being Katiness Everdeen as the lead in this movie. The acting in this movie was very good all around and I really can't point to an actor and and say they had a bad performance. Some of the people cast in this movie made there roles in this movie more memorable then if it was a different actor. For example Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee and Julianne Moore as President Coin really add something to there roles which might not be present otherwise. The special effects were really good in this movie. I felt like I was really a part of this futuristic world. This was aided by excellent editing by Alan Edward Bell and Mark Yoshikawa. I think the way they cut some of the more dramatic scenes in this movie really increased the suspense.I think this was a great movie and is worth seeing but I think that the reason to make a Mockingjay 1 and 2 instead of just one movie is to make money. Granted 300 million dollars is a lot of money but I think artistically speaking this movie would have been better not split up between part one and two.,8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A war fought over a teenage romance,"I really wanted to like this movie, trust me. I tried giving the books a shot and didn't like the style, the first movie was alright but the second was pretty good. This movie however, is filled with the most arbitrary plot points a five year old could possibly conceive. It seems that the entire resistance movement spends the movie convincing themselves that Katniss and her boy toy matter in the scheme of things. Honestly I'd be spoiling the plot if I elaborated, but it involves dropping flowers after a bombing run, throwing around intel like hot potatoes, and the weakest sleeper agent anyone could find. Honestly the presidents actions have become so contrived that every scene he had was him being filled in on how stupid his enemies were and then just staring off into the distance and muttering something cryptic. There were so many stupid scenes that I laughed out loud several times. There was seriously a scene where a deer looks at Katniss pointing a bow at it and just casually looks away. Gale then mutters ""it's never been hunted before."" Apparently the screenwriters believe fear and fight or flight are conditioned responses. There was also a scene with Katniss, a flashlight and a cat, where she plays that game that everyone plays with cats where they chase the light. As she does this she seems to have an epiphany about her current situation and I'm all like ""okay now this is good, the cat is the resistance, and the light symbolizes freedom. This could be some good stuff."" She then walks over to one of the other tribute boy toys and basically says that it made her realize she needs to save her boyfriend...So much potential for good sci-fi squandered on typical teen romance bullshit",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Less action, more maneuvering, still quite good","The third Hunger Games movie isn't quite like the first two. There are no Games, for one thing. For another, there's nowhere near the amount of action, as the tale focuses much more on the political machinations between the Capitol and the fabled District 13. And yet director Francis Lawrence does a fine job of presenting a gripping story that, like its predecessors, brings the heart-wrenching pain dappled with grand fire and brimstone. It's a rare 'tweener movie that can stand on its own, too.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), you've just blown a hole through the Hunger Games. Whaddya gonna do now? Hop on over to District 13, apparently, which is the home of those who are darn well fed up with the crazy shenanigans of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the Capitol. Katniss quickly learns that her fellow Games winner, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is alive and well, sort of, doing propaganda interviews with Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) in an attempt to get the rebel scum to lay down their weapons. Katniss, appalled at Snow's use of Peeta and at the destruction that the Capitol's military military has wrought, decides to become the Mockingjay, a true symbol around which the downtrodden, beaten-down residents of the not-well-off districts can rally.District 13 is run by President Coin (Julianne Moore), who's every bit as intelligent, strong, creative, and resourceful as you'd suspect Julianne Moore to be in real life. She's convinced by former gamesmaster Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) that Katniss should be welcomed into the district and become the new face of the rebellion. This, naturally, leads to Snow's use of Peeta as more of a personal propaganda weapon aimed at Katniss herself. But who's zoomin' whom? Peeta seems awfully convincing when he tells everyone to lay down their weapons and surrender. It's no wonder that the rebels see him as a tool of The Man and are out for his blood, right? With no games to carry the bulk of the movie, the run time is a little shorter (by about 20 minutes), but that doesn't mean there's no fighting going on. Katniss and her former boyfriend – or is it also future? – Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) are armed with a bow and a Big Gun, respectively, in defense of District 13. We may not get to see hand-to-hand combat, but at least we're not seeing children kill each other. In fact, this entry in the series features far fewer on-screen deaths. But rest easy, there are plenty of harrowing moments, because when one side has a metric ton of big weapons and you do not, you're likely to get stomped on a little bit.The decrease in violence allows the viewer an even better look at some truly terrific acting. The performances by Lawrence, Hoffman, Moore are all award caliber, and I don't mean ""for an action movie based on a young-adult movie,"" either. They're really great, which isn't a big surprise considering the pedigree each possesses. Still, it's nice to see layered character development in a blockbuster, and if this were a more-typical drama, even more praise would be justly heaped upon the cast.Also along for the ride are Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) as the scraggly former Victor with more sense than he lets on; Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) as Katniss' fashion consultant, even in hiding; and Beetee (Jeffrey Wright), the former Tribute who's the tech wizard for District 13. They all have jobs to do in this new world order, and each job centers around making Katniss not into just a one-dimensional heroine for the world but to bring that heroine out of Katniss. You know, organically.I'll admit that the first twenty minutes or so felt a little slow. Not forced, just a stark contrast to the pulse-pounding action of the earlier movies. But then things kick into a whole 'nother gear once Katniss see what's become of her beloved District 12, reduced to rubble in the aftermath of the last Hunger Games. It's compelling, wrenching stuff, particularly when you realize that's not just rubble laying before Katniss.In all, I think Lawrence and company did an exemplary job. You know, it doesn't seem terribly difficult to stage manage action scenes – you let the tech guys do their thing and listen to your DP. But when you have to get your audience to identify with characters and relate to their plight, that takes a softer touch. And it's all well and good to just let Hoffman and Moore and Lawrence do their thing, but Lawrence also elicits fine, underplayed performances from Hutcherson, Hemsworth, Harrelson, and even Sutherland.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Half incomplete,"Adjusting to life in the militaristic District 13(which is reasonably well-established, no Zion going on here), Katniss(Lawrence, strong female role model, compelling as always) is asked to be the Mockingjay, the face of the rebellion. She's not even sure if she can be, but when Peeta(Hutcherson, clearly abused, broken) appears on TV, calling for a ceasefire, she realizes if they win, he will likely be executed as a traitor. In exchange for his safety and rescue, she does agree – and has to convince the thousands of civilians in Panem to rise and fight the hundreds of Peacekeepers(with a very relevant image of a now-militarized country) and the evil, selfish and dictatorial Capitol, led by the vicious President Snow(Sutherland, sinister and terrifying).Where the first two are satire on Reality TV and gladiatorial combat, this completely abandons the Games, instead exploring modern media and how it reflects and affects the culture, with both the State and the guerrilla fighting in part via propaganda, with this 2010 book predicting that aspect of IS. Going into this expecting it to be the same thing as the first two will lead to disappointment. Unfortunately, clever as this is, there are other issues. I'm not only referring to the love triangle, present but only annoying when it rarely flares up into passive-aggressive insults. This should not be merely a part of a story. There is some focus, but mostly, the structure(unlike the others, where the competition accomplished that) here does not work well for a movie. Not a lot really happens, and it certainly isn't as fast as we've gotten used to from these. They felt the need to add a few action scenes, and while they work and increase the scope, they are clearly ""put in"", and change little, if anything. The characters don't have enough to do, and we can tell there is something missing to their arc.I recommend this to any fan of Young Adult fiction.

The constant bickering of politics, setting traps and becoming a icon of hope. Was so generic and boring to sit through, mainly because of the lack of depth and originality. This third installment really didn't need to parts, but it seemed like they really wanted to milk this installment for all it's got. Despite it not having enough good materials to do so. It's like the movie dragged on as long as it can, despite the lack of ammunition to carry on. Just watch this movie to finish off this franchise, you probably won't miss much by skipping this one though.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Can't wait to see the Part 2.,"If you are expecting the same movie you've seen the past year, you are not gonna like this one. There are no Games this time. As you seen in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Katniss destroyed the forcefield and Games were cancelled.So the movie is centered on Katniss as The Mockingjay, the new hope for the Districts to do what they wanted for years, a rebellion against the Capitol. You will see a good movie if you are a fan, and we wont be able to see much action scenes on this one, but that's not important because if you are a fan, the movie will keep you entertained in every moment.Loved the CGI and acting. Ending scene was absolutely fantastic, I just can't wait to see the Part 2.Giving a 8. If you are a fan, you will enjoy it for sure.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
From Bad To Worse,"I was in the middle of the movie and suddenly it looked like the matrix story but in an awful way. I closed my eyes few times and was about to leave the room. I am not sure why the decision to cut the movie in half other than making money. They knew that the story is broken and the only way to make money out of these poor kids is by doing this.It was lame, boring and very slow. No action, no romance, no suspense, and no story.I think what they should have done is to end her role in part I. After her web scandal, she lost lots of credibility and her caricature as a model was destroyed. The upcoming role should be given to her sister, and then they might have something to grab on in the upcoming years. It would be hot, challenging and differently tons of suspense.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"An excellent adaptation of a difficult book, Mockingjay explores the political in a different but very welcome way from its predecessors.","Type three words into Google - 'Why is Mockingjay...' - and the search engine helpfully fills in the blanks: '...so bad?'. It's a common complaint about the final book in Suzanne Collins' best- selling trilogy of young-adult dystopian fiction. There's too little going on in the first half of the book and too much in the second. Characters become overblown and unsympathetic, particularly our heroine Katniss Everdeen, whose angst-ridden narration of the story grows increasingly annoying as she dithers between two boys when she should really be focusing on the war raging around her. It seems like a particularly perverse decision, then, to split this book into two films. And yet, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is something of a triumph. It's a smart, powerful adaptation that mines the great ideas and strengths of Collins' third book while excising its more frustrating elements.Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is no longer trapped in the live-or-die arena of the Hunger Games. Instead, she's been transported to the gloomy secret hideout of District 13, which almost all of Panem thought had been destroyed by the Capitol years ago. In reality, the soldiers and warriors of this District had quite literally gone underground. The subterranean District 13 is now the base of operations for a simmering rebellion against Coriolanus Snow (Sutherland), the imperious leader of the Capitol. Alma Coin (Moore), with arena designer and fellow rebel Plutarch Heavensbee (Hoffman) by her side, wants Katniss to serve as the Mockingjay, the face of a campaign to rally and unite all the Districts against the Capitol. But all Katniss wants is to save Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson), the sweet, steadfast boy from District 12 who entered the Hunger Games - twice - to keep her alive, and is now the prisoner of President Snow.Shorn of Katniss' morose ruminations in the novel, Francis Lawrence's Mockingjay is far more effective than Collins' at morphing into a dark, bitter political thriller. Indeed, it becomes a war movie quite unlike any you've seen before. Typically, audiences are plunged into the heat of battle, or accompany survivors as they struggle free of the carnage of war. Here, we watch with bated breath as the Capitol and District 13 edge slowly towards war. Snow and Coin are playing a ruthless game of chess - political brinkmanship with life and death for stakes - with Katniss morphing from pawn to queen and back again. In one moment, she is at the cruel mercy of Snow, who taunts her with footage of Peeta begging her to stop fighting; in the next, her eyes blaze with righteous rage as she swears to make the Capitol pay for its crimes.No wars can be waged without propaganda - stories and ideas and battle cries that are amplified, twisted or manipulated to either galvanise or terrify the populace. Mockingjay gets this very right indeed, folding some genuinely astute political commentary into its narrative. Katniss may not be required to kill others to survive, as she was in the arena, but she's asked to do things that are arguably even more difficult for her: acting the part of the perfect rebel, speaking lines she doesn't believe against a backdrop that isn't real. The true villain here, Mockingjay suggests, is the media, which splices footage in a way that alters perceptions and truths. There's something both heartbreaking and almost farcical about Katniss' new role in the fight against the Capitol - she's forced to enter situations that will bring out the Mockingjay in her, as she's trailed by a camera crew into the field, with the calm, cool Cressida (Dormer) finding the best angle to shoot this almost-broken rebel hero at her most inspiring.It's true that Mockingjay is considerably less action-packed than its predecessors. The tale proceeds at the leisurely rate of a slow burn rather than a frantic tumble, and might strike many viewers as a story treading water before a tumultous climax. But this is a problem derived from the source material, one which Francis Lawrence mostly turns into a strength. Without the need to constantly serve Katniss' inner monologue, the film slips from war games into actual war with remarkable intelligence and wit, finding something to say even in the expansion of Elizabeth Banks' role as Effie Trinket - first, into a reluctant refugee from the Capitol, and then, Katniss' fashion consultant. There's more room to breathe in between scenes, as Katniss adjusts to her new life in District 13 - a life lived in an underground bunker, but a life preserved nonetheless.Jennifer Lawrence remains the franchise's trump card. She has been miscast in many of her recent films of late, called upon to play characters far older than her years. Strictly speaking, she's not even a physical match for Katniss. But she's riveting here, playing both Katniss' desperation and determination with a burning fire that feels right. It helps, of course, that the character on screen rarely slips into the mawkish anguish that dogged her throughout Collins' last book, but it's the actress who ensures Katniss shines as brightly as she does. The cast that surrounds her is just as good - Moore brilliantly underplays a very different sort of political leader, forming a final bittersweet tag-team with her frequent co- star, the late, reliably great Hoffman.Anyone primed by the gore-free violence of the first two Hunger Games movies might find Mockingjay a bit of a letdown. Even fans of the series will know that it is simply marking time before the politics of this war spins out of control in the final film. And yet, Francis Lawrence's film doesn't feel dispensable. On the contrary, it takes what meanders in the book and transforms it into something rich and characterful for the screen. It may be treading water within the overarching narrative of the franchise, but these are shark-infested waters, and the film draws that out in plenty of clever, rich detail.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Boring,"It's not entertaining like the previous movies, a lot of talking and dialogues in a bunker, they just extended the franchise to make more money and I'm not gonna watch the next one in the theaters, very disappointing!!! Jennifer Lawrence acting was good, in some parts it was a bit, just a little bit exaggerated. But overall I think she did a good job. Some parts were so cheesy and bad that were very amusing. I could hear people laughing at some ridiculous scenes.. The typical laugh you hear when you're watching a BAD movie. I think this is an example of how a studio wants to make more money by extending the franchise.

A good slow burn,"I've read the books and I was prepared to see this movie as a slow burn because splitting the third book in two parts wasn't the best idea.Mockingjay was my least favourite book and it's also very slow at the beginning but it doesn't mean the movie sucked. In fact, I was pretty much amazed by how they made it entertaining compared to the book.The writing is great, the acting is perfect and it is even better than the book.The problem is that the people who didn't read the book won't really like this movie because of what they were expecting after seeing the second movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Somehow; it worked,"First; my experience of the movie while I was watching it; Lawrence acted well; if a little forced at times; the emotional acting rather than dialogue was generally well delivered. The scope and magnitude of the effects and cinematography was absolutely amazing; creating a very raw and believable world; and the other thing I adored was the action and empathy of this movie in stark contrast with one another; the action was very well done for a female led film; which, finally, with this franchise have decided not to skimp on that element. I agree not too much happened, but I was wrapped up the setting and the excellent portrayal of emotional fragility and mental illness to care; and while it may have been overlong in itself, I think each individual scene was as long as it needed to be. My only qualms are the overall pacing, at a push, the moments when Jennifer Lawrence did feel forced, and the under use of the brilliant supporting cast, and god did the romance underwhelm me.

"""Some people just want to watch the world burn""","The Hunger Games, when it first arrived I bet everyone thought it would just another ""Twilight"" genre film. Oh how wrong they were, instead of sparkly vampires we are given necks being snapped and poisoned foliage. So I suppose the reel question is with this being Part 1 will it be a Desolation of Lawrence or a Battle of 13 Districts? Mockingjay has something so much deeper locked inside of it's run time than what is produced. Considering the film now after watching it and having time to think, it has so many ideas and themes. It articulates them so precisely and so subtly that it's only with distance can we truly understand how measured a movie this is. Here is a film that comments on every single major issue in our society simultaneously. The film talks about fashion and our own personal image, racism and decimation, oppression and slavery and so much more. For that alone, it deserves to be seen by all, for it's cultural significance in our world, but that's not it's only success.The film also succeeds as a film. It's true that a film that's all comment and no action would be a documentary, and Monckingjay isn't that, Monckingjay is a film that feels like a grand sceptical, it knows how important it is to fan. It has clearly learnt from Harry Potter, which is the benchmark for adaption fandom, and it just about reaches it. This is from a director who hasn't really had a good success rate with adaptions from other mediums, his previous work includes Constantine and I Am Legend, however it looks as if Francis Lawrence has became stronger over time and I can honestly say that Mockingjay is one of the strongest films I have seen all year.See the problem with Mockingjay (and in fact any 2 part film) is that you have to split the movie in two, and you have to give people a reason to come back for more. Mockingjay does this perfectly. Having read the books I would have split the film exactly where the film does, and the final movements are nothing short of spectacular. It leaves the stakes high and many questions hanging in the air, as soon as the credits roll you only want to know one thing, what happens next? (and let me reassure you the best is yet to come) I should say that Mockingjay is probably more of a drama in comparison to the other 2 films which were more action, but this is how the book is, and at no point feels forced, but more like a logical evolutionary step in what would happen after the events in Catching Fire.I could list of all the cast and explain how they now inhabit those roles, but what would be the point? We all know it anyway, however it should be said that the stand out cast members are Elizabeth Banks and Josh Hutcherson, both of who's stark contrast in previous movies are what brings the reality of the message of the film home to us.Mockingjay is violent, and savage, it is brutal and nasty. It is also gripping and beautiful and one of the best films I have seen this year. It is superior to other films in it's genre in just about every way that could matter.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Corny and cheezy may be the same thing but need them both to describe this,"Don't get me wrong. I liked the Hunger games franchise a lot. I defended it even when my buddies criticized certain moments in the last movies. But in this movie I have to draw the line. everyone can clearly see that the separating of the finale in two parts was not necessery. This movie is just a 2 hours trailer for the finale. The only scene worth watching is the one that climaxes with Katnis shooting down a plane and that can be seen just by watching the trailer. I can think only two reasons they made this Part 1 movie and there is no way there is a third. Either to make more money by two separate movies instead of one, or because they wanted to put all the unessesary melodrama in one movie and keep the action for Part 2. Or both. Either way the 2 minutes trailer was very promising and the 2 hours trailer we watched was very disappointing.

It takes it's sweet time in getting to the story, and that is cruical when the story is so big and needs a lot of character development. Why must I wait a year for part 2?! Why can't they just release it a month after the Blu-ray comes out? The Hunger Games movies just keep getting better and better.

I Feel Confused About This Movie,"First of all, Im not a big Hunger Games fan. I like the previous two movies, but I did not read the books (because Im not a reader. The Only books that I have read, are the Harry Potter book-series, because I am a big fan of HP).I liked the first movie better, than the second. I know that many people would disagree with me, but I like more the indie lower-budget movie style (1st movie) than big budget, that just wants to impress you (2nd movie).About the 3rd Hunger games... I have mixed feelings. It is definitely the weakest of all movies. It just isn't satisfying. It feels so empty. Everything that is in the movie is good or great, but than, when you look at the whole movie again, it is just 1 hour and 45 minutes of talking and 15 minutes of action. It is kind of boring. Smart, but even smartness after an hour turns in ""boringness"".Like I said, I did not read any of the books (but I heard that Mockingyaj is the worst one), so I can not really know if this is true, but I got a feeling, that the novel was split in to two movies just for the money. Because, you know, you just have to do that. HP started it (witch was clever, because that book really needed to be made in two movies) and now ALL the novel based teen-type movies do it.So, to sum it all up, this is a money grabbing movie, with clever dialogue & powerful acting. But this was definitely not necessary to THG movie franchise. It kind of ruined lot of respect for the till-now-praised movie series. It is the same, what is The Hobbit to Middle Earth, or Star Wars prequels to Star Wars franchise. Not bad, but the worst.But, the thing is, you have to watch this movie, to understand what will be going on in the next. Well done Linsgate, you failed with this one, you sell-out!",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Psychological Hunger Games,"The latest installment of the Hunger Games, Mockingjay, Part 1, is a movie that has caused a lot of controversy among its fans. Mockingjay, Part 1 picks up where Catching Fire left off, with the resistance having rescued Katniss but left Peeta to a potentially disturbing fate in the capitol. Katniss herself seems a bit disturbed--like it or not, her courage, compassion and honesty have left her as the face of the resistance--a role that she is clearly uncomfortable with. The movie is mostly a character study of her, as she balances her love for Peeta against her role as the Mockingjay, while also fighting the fact that she is still a very young woman.I will first say, however, that I understand why people are upset about this movie. The spectacular action and cliff-hanging thrills of the first two movies are mostly gone. Those looking for the slick and admittedly thrilling tension of the teenage violence of the first two movies will miss it very much here.That said, this movie is really interesting on its own merits, as it tries to do something both engaging and different. Mockingjay creates a sense of tension quite engaging for moviegoers who like character studies. Katniss has to decide, for example, does she really want to be the Mockingjay--ie, symbol of the resistance? The resistance is portrayed cleverly in the movie, as the good-guy, except that they too engage in a highly specious propaganda and behavior that seems more sketchy than meets the eye.At the same time, Peeta is in the hands of the government, but he appears to have turned traitor to the resistance as the government uses him as a propaganda tool. Or has he turned traitor? The film is admirably not clear. What is clear, however, is that Katniss's actions, as the lightning rod of the resistance, could get him killed, so she has that weighing on her as well.Additionally, the film's treatment of the notion of propaganda itself is ingenious--who would ever have conceived of a teenage movie on this topic? And yet, Mockingjay makes us understand how images can or cannot be manufactured for the purposes of swaying and deceiving a crowd. Much of the movie consists of the conflict of the resistance trying to produce effective propaganda--in other words, lies--from a character as relentlessly honest and principled as Katniss. This is again really interesting.I realize that this movie is not for everyone, but I personally thought it might be the best of the three. Jennifer Lawrence plays it brilliantly, as a teenage girl constantly on the verge of coming unhinged (which is exactly what the movie is about), on the one hand overwhelmed by the awesome responsibilities that seemed to be thrust upon her, on the other hand a young woman in love trying to save her endangered beloved. Only Lawrence could do it, as she seems to possess some special quality of emotion or spirit that only 1 in 10000 people have. She walks through the movie actually torn apart by its conflicts (or at least she seems to!) and that in itself is really impressive.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

So I now expect Part 2 to have over $200 million worth of quality. I may not even watch Part 2, like I said in the title I have almost completely lost interest in the franchise due to this film being so utterly boring that only the cringing from Lawrence's overacting stopped me from falling asleep in the cinema.The entire film centered around Katniss' transformation into the Mockingjay (something that whether you've read the books or not, KNOW is going to happen) So to make it a 2 1/2 hour ordeal is just offensive to the viewer.

A film which got on my nerves more than anything,"Let me start off by saying my girlfriend is a huge fan of the franchise before this film. i was suspicious before going to watch it as i am not really a huge Jennifer Lawrence fan but i decided to go watch it anyway. We sat in the movie and i am sad to say we were both highly disappointed by this movie. Don't get me wrong i love to see more heroines starring in movies and therefore i was willing to give this movie a chance. however the directors of this movie made it so obvious they were trying as hard as they could to create a female lead role that they turned the potentially interesting story into a bland, frustrating, badly acted mess which doesn't do justice to the hype created around this movie. Every second word in this movie was about ""peter"", and about how she didn't care about anyone in the big picture just about saving her peter, whilst constantly collapsing in tears, endangering her peers and blowing off her boyfriend who wants to be loved but instead is ignored because of a less attractive scrawny pipsqueak, who is also blown up to be a hero undeservedly. Even the people in the movie seem to get annoyed with Jennifer Lawrence's annoying portrayal of the ""mockingjay"" and her obsession with peter.my girlfriend and i are both in agreement that we wasted money and 2 precious hours on this hyped up, big budget, badly directed movie which left us totally underwhelmed. the best part of the film was the trailers at the beginning for better movies.

Fantastic way to obliterate the potential of the series.,"Had they told us ""We are going to ruin the series, we don't want it to succeed"", then this movie would have been a blast, it would have delivered.I am truly impressed on how they managed to connect the second movie to this one with the fantastic cliffhanger (of the second movie) transitioning to the third part. The third part has no plot relation to the first two movies. None of the important points that were started in the first and second movie are addressed here. I am challenged with describing everything that is wrong with this movie.I truly wanted to review this movie as professionally as possible, but the writing and directing of the movie don't even give me material to work with.

"Doesn't quite have the same impact as the first two movies, but still good!","The Hunger Games without any hunger games... It doesn't quite have the same ring to it, but I suppose the movie was still intriguing in its own way.There's this interesting thing I've heard people say, though: ""Heroes are the ones who would sacrifice anyone to save the world, while a villain would let the world burn to save the ones they love.""
If you think about it in that way, then Katniss and Peeta aren't really heroes. They care more about saving each other than any revolution or rebellion. Saving their loved ones is their number one priority. They're not classical heroes, which honestly makes them a lot more interesting to me. Truthfully, Gale is more of a hero in this story than either of them, but does that mean he is necessarily a better person? I don't know. What I do know is that it makes him feel less real or authentic. While Gale is fighting to save the world, Katniss is fighting to save the ones she loves. It's a different motivation, and although it might not make her a hero, it does make her a beautiful person!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lacks anything a good film contains. An empty cinematic vessel.,"This absolute turkey was right on time for Thanksgiving. Do not go to see this, unless you are under 15, or an absolute die hard fan of the franchise. She plays the weakest superhero since Tobey Mcguire in Spiderman. This film is painful to sit through. Very, very little story. Although in general I like Jennifer Lawrence, in this film she really missed the mark. She displays little in the way of power, dignity, grace, or inspiration.

An overcharge and a big letdown.,"After paying $48 for three regular (not even 3D) admissions and $30 at the concession stand, we sat patiently for 2 hours waiting for the story to unfold when the movie suddenly ended. What's going on?!! Did you ever go to a very fancy restaurant that served tinny portions of mediocre food? Well, walking out of this movie sort of felt like that: an overcharge and a big letdown.The whole movie could have been edited into 15 minutes, but the actors (all except for Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Haroldson, whose acting is unapproachable) intentionally act and speak slowly to stretch the running time of the movie.

The two movies prior to this one were very good to say the least, however, what used to be an EAGERNESS and NEED to watch and enjoy the series, turned into a disappointment and a mere subtle want to FINISH the series. This was a boring annoyance that was more a waste of my money and time than anything else. They just wanted to drag out the series, when really... you honestly could just skip to the end of the movie where the real action (or whats actually important) happens out of the entire movie.

"""It takes ten times longer to put yourself back together than it does to fall apart.""","When I first watched this I considered it to be one of my least favourite Hunger Games films, and I still firmly have that same opinion now. It's not a bad movie, it's just not on the level of the other three (yet I still give this a 10/10 rating just because I love The Hunger Games so much). Upon this rewatch, I primarily noticed just how much this installment can drag, particularly when they're shooting the propos. Also I would say that the reason why this is not generally rated as highly as the others is simply because, nothing really happens here, at least not up until the last 10-15 minutes. But even at the climax, the ending is a relatively small one in comparison to what we've experienced from the other installments, hence why this is the weakest film out of the bunch.Yet I still love it, and I can't even describe why. I guess I just love the vibe of it more than anything else.But one thing I wanted to mention which I noticed during this viewing was the impeccable, and even terrifying, performance of Josh Hutcherson, especially during the ending. If there's one thing this sequel has going for it, it's that it contains arguably Hutcherson's best singular piece of acting of the entire series.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Very Good Film,"After reading the critics reception of this film I was really fearful that I would get robbed by another filler movie. I was, however, pleasantly surprised with how well the movie treated its source material, and in particular the complexities of the characters.There are a few things people need to understand, in order to enjoy this movie. This trilogy (3rd and 4th films are technically one film) is not Battle Royale. That film was good, and there is a similar core concept. But the Hunger Games never was Battle Royale.This is an important distinction because The hunger Games has always concentrated much more on subtle character developments, and this becomes the Mockingjay's primary focus.The film has never been merely about survival in the arena, this was only ever part of a much wider picture. I you have not appreciated the politics and power play going on, I assume you are unlikely to appreciate this film.Mockingjay focuses on the reality of what the characters go through in times of war and accurately brakes the characters down to their core. before rebuilding (some of) them.Other reviewers have criticised Katniss, for he perpetual focus on Peeta. However Katniss is a very selfish character, she always has been. She is focused on the people that she loves as her primary motivation.The other side of her personality is her natural reaction to things. This movie is as much about that (emotional) battle, as it is about the conflict with the Capital. If you don't like how this can pull one way or the other, then this will likely bug you.Others suffer in their own unique ways. I feel if subtleties are lost on you, then you won't enjoy this movie.Finally, I feel people might not warm to the movie as it is just a continuation. There is not traditional beginning, middle and end. Some people need this structure in the movie to feel like it is moving in a direction, and not just repeating itself. (note:this point was originally brought up by CBG19 on youtube)I like this movie because I enjoy the politics, I enjoy the accurate representation of how war can breakdown people, I do not think this trilogy has been all about the arena, I enjoy the subtle character developments, and I don't need a traditional story structure.I hope you see this movie and enjoy it as much as I did.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A weak drama that bit off more than it can chew,"First off, let me say that the first two movies in the series were very well done. However, I was disappointed to find 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' to be shallow and weak.If you want to see the movie for the action, don't. There are very few 'heart-pounding' action scenes. But I get it, the book series matures into a larger statement about oppressive governments and the concept of freedom itself. That said, the movie was neither political nor philosophical. A good example of a stellar film in this category is 'V for Vendetta.'The greatest disadvantage this film wrought was its insistence to focus on Peeta's personal struggle. It was hard to sympathize with Peeta's problems because the film dragged it along for so long. In the end, the movie was boring and sluggish. It was neither romantic, political, philosophical, nor a simple action film. It was a dull combination of all of these.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If you know to expect a ""Part 1"" you won't be disappointed","I went to this movie knowing that it will be a filler movie. This Part 1 thing wasn't a problem for me. I was expecting a good set-up movie for the Part 2 and that's what I got. It had emotion and humor mixed well. The story however is slow, probably too slow for some, but the great performances save the day. Jennifer Lawrence, Philip Seymour Hoffman are especially good. Not to forget other cast members.The movie also gave some wonderful moments. Partly thanks to the great soundtrack by James Newton Howard. I noticed some parts of the soundtrack to be the same from the first film and it was great that they used some of the same music because the first Hunger Games film's soundtrack was amazing.The movie will need the second part however and I am looking forward to it. The part 2 will surely make this one look better on some viewer's eyes as well.Concerning the source material. To those who have read the books: I think this movie stays more true to the source material than the earlier ones. Even more than Catching Fire. So in that sense this is my favorite movie of the series. In the sense of a stand alone movie, not so much.If you liked the first movies you will surely like this one as well. If you didn't like the first ones, well you were probably going to pass on this one anyway so I don't need to tell you to do that.BUT if you are a new viewer to Hunger Games as a whole, watch the first two first or this will confuse you very much.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If We Burn, You Burn","""This is the start of how it all ends. They used to shout my name, now they whisper it.

Katniss Everdeen, the girl from District 12 survives the arena, unbeknowest to the Capitol and President Snow. Now she must fight and fight she must. But all is still not right. She now has to rescue the one she loves and he is being held captive and tortured by Snow and used as a weapon to get the rebels to cease fire and relinquish their rights as rightful citizens of Panem, according to President Snow. This movie defied all odds. Since 2012, our eyes were opened to the girl from District 12, and then she caught fire and now she is the rebel leader who will bring down the Capitol and their wicked ways. I was one of the select few who saw this movie as part of a marathon leading up to this movie. I was stunned and floored. Nothing will ever compare to this movie. The song that leads this movie is a perfect match to spark that yellow flicker beat.

Worst in the series?,"I've never been a fan of 'The Hunger Games' films. Having read the book trilogy a few years ago, the idea of having a film series based around the novels seemed like a good idea... Unfortunately, none of these films have lived up to the hype surrounding them. I walked into the cinema expecting something far better than the previous films, and by the end of the movie I was more disappointed than I have been with any other installment in the series.As with the previous films, what felt like an hour of time was completely wasted at the start. The time is taken up by boring dialogue and meaningless, confusing conversations between characters that feel like they were written simply to extend the running time of the film and serve little to no purpose at all. The second half of the film begins speeding up, but even then the majority of the time given has been wasted on those 'does anyone really care' scenes from the previous films. Then there's the acting. In both 'The Hunger Games' and 'Catching Fire', Jennifer Lawrence's acting has been one of the few things in the movies that was actually done properly, when compared to the poor acting of the rest of the cast. In 'Mockingjay' however, Lawrence's performance is extremely overdone... Luckily some of the supporting cast manages to do a fairly good. Lastly is the fact that Mockingjay is being split into two films. It's common for a single book to be made into multiple movies (I mean, just look at The Hobbit), but the issue with Mockingjay is that the entire novel could have been adapted into a single film. As I said earlier, the amount of time wasted in this film is insane... The entire Mockingjay novel could have easily been into a 2 hour film if those 2 hours were actually spent properly.Personally, I think this movie doesn't deserve the 7/10 rating it currently holds here. Unless your a 13 year old girl and/or really don't care about the pacing and acting in this film.... I wouldn't recommend it.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mockingjay Proves Fire is Catching as Fast as Ever,"It is always difficult to approach the first part of a two-part film, particularly when it is essentially a set-up for the climactic finale (I'm looking at you, Harry Potter, Twilight, and The Hobbit franchises). Yes, this is undoubtedly a Hollywood cash-grab scheme, but that is not to say these first-part films should be given any leeway in terms of mediocrity. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. I, along with The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, have been solid proof that ""the end is near!"" films can be both highly entertaining and successful. I am pleased to announce that the same can be said about Mockingjay Pt. I.Mockingjay is, without a doubt, my favorite film in The Hunger Games series so far. I suppose this came as no surprise to me, considering the final book is my favorite of the trilogy, and its bleak, despairing mood is captured impeccably in the film. The Hunger Games franchise is no longer about panicked children in an arena fighting to the death. The Games are over and the Rebellion against the Capitol has begun, with Katniss Everdeen (played with ravishing ferocity, once again, by the ever-lovable Jennifer Lawrence) as the Rebellion's poster girl—their ""Mockingjay."" The film makes profound statements about human injustices and the morality of governmental power rather than bloodshed and death, and therein lies the film's success. It has transcended from a violent tale of oppression to a deeply moving and masterful portrayal of fighting for what you believe in, despite the inevitably dire consequences.Mockingjay is melancholic and nerve-wracking from its first shot to its final one, and is therefore an incredibly difficult watch for those expecting a happy or satisfying ending. It becomes clear in Mockingjay Pt. 1 that this is an unlikely outcome, and yet, this by no means makes the film and the statements it is making any less important. It is a tale of anarchism for the sake of rebuilding democracy, which is a fascinating juxtaposition with the utilitarianism of the Capitol. While Mockingjay may not be as action-packed as its predecessors, it makes a much more crucial and relevant assertion through its powerful dialog and somber depictions of the aftermath of a civil war. Fear not, Mockingjay has enough heart-pounding action segments to keep you at the edge of your seat, yet this is notably not the point of the film. From the beginning of the series, The Hunger Games has focused on the sorrow and desperation of government brutality in a dystopian future. As we near the conclusion, Mockingjay delivers the perfect set-up for a satisfying ending. In many ways, Mockingjay Pt. I is simply just that: a set-up for the grand finale. However, it does so without ever losing touch with its vitality as a part of the story and is equally as (if not more than) immersive as all the previous Hunger Games films.You may have noticed I have keenly avoided discussing the plot of Mockingjay Pt. I. This is with good reason. The plot of this film is very keenly laid out and progresses with the perfect amount of subtlety and suspense. Every word spoken and every measure taken is of massive importance to the series as a whole, and giving anything away would feel like desecration. Yes, I have provided you with the basics: The Rebellion is in full swing, Katniss is as vivacious and unrelenting as ever, and the Capitol has initiated a murderous civil war. In all honesty, this is all one needs to know when entering Mockingjay Pt. I because there is truly nothing as satisfying as experiencing the film and contemplating its political and moral viewpoints afterwards. That goes without saying, many that have flooded (and will continue to flood) theaters to watch this film are avid fans of the previous films or the novels, and therefore know exactly what they are in for. I will admit that the film feels incomplete, but I believe that it should, because the best (or worst, depending on your viewpoint) is yet to come. Mockingjay Pt. I is undoubtedly the most profound film of The Hunger Games films as of yet, and I have no doubt Pt. II will surpass it next November—even if it does shred my heart into thousands of pieces. Stock up on your Kleenex, folks.This review is dedicated to Philip Seymour Hoffman, who was astounding in this film as he was in every role he ever played. May he rest in peace.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Over-hyped mediocrity,"This is the third movie in the Hunger Games series. I better state right away that I have not read the books so I do not know how good the books are or if the movies actually follow the book. However, if the movies are any indicator then I will probably not bother to read the books. So far these movies have been a display in over-hyped mediocrity as far as I am concerned.The previous movies had a somewhat ludicrous setup with people running around in ridiculous hair-do and makeup. I was not too thrilled about it but at least it gave the movie some originality. So did the games themselves. This one lacks all of that. It could be any one of a dozen post-apocalyptic stories.The movie plods along at a fairly leisurely pace, sometimes it is quite dull and slow, with some outbursts of action. Katniss herself is really not taking much active part except for being a front figure and propaganda element for the rebellion. In order to milk the series as much as possible for money (I see no other reason why it was done) it was decided to break the third book into two movies. I would say that this movie is a good example as to why that is generally not a good idea.The acting is on par with the movie. It is decent enough but nothing to write home about. Then since most of the movie really is about Katniss hulking and moaning about the unfairness of it all it is maybe not too surprising that I found most of it somewhat uninspired and dull. The same can be said about the special effects. Actually I found most of them to be rather underwhelming. There were also a fair amount of lost moments. For instance the attack on the dam. It could have been made into something nice but instead we get a ludicrous display of a bunch of unarmed people running straight against machine guns planting some bombs and then poof goes a model dam.Having now seen three out of the planned four movies I am of course going to see the fourth one as well but I am definitely not going to be in a rush to go and see it.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Nice.,"I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first https://www.fiverr.com/sumon1200 day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen.

Blandest movie-going experience in recent memory,"I casually enjoyed the first two films, but was not a major fan or anything like that. I thought they were watchable enough, watched them one time each, did not obsess too much about them and did not read the books; so, walking into this third film, I didn't have any sort of high expectations for where the story was going or what would happen to the characters - I didn't even remember any of the characters' names aside from Katniss, Peeta, and President Snow. I was just in the mood for some action. That's it. It's all I wanted. Just as long as there was some action in the movie, I would have been satisfied. But... this movie failed to deliver even that much!There was only one scene, involving some evil attack-planes, that can qualify as a genuine action scene in the entire movie, but even that sequence was rather short - in fact, the most exciting moment in that scene (and the whole movie) was one they'd already shown us in the movie's preview trailer, when Katniss shoots her arrow at the planes.The rest of the movie is just nothing but extended scenes that go nowhere, in which nothing much happens, dragged-out far longer than they needed to be. In fact, with our main character stuck in an underground bunker for most of the movie, almost all the action primarily happens off-screen. Whenever something potentially exciting happens, we generally don't get to see the action itself, just a bunch of people in a room staring at monitors.The movie also had a big problem with feeling repetitive, continually showing us scenes that establish nothing except what we already know. For example, the first time Jennifer Lawrence wanders through the wreckage and rubble left behind by an attack from the Capitol against the innocent district-dwellers, we get the sense that the Capitol is bad and they do horrible things and that Jennifer Lawrence is sad; we get the idea. But then later on, she wanders through another scene of wreckage and rubble in another long-and-drawn out scene. And then we get yet another scene just like that! We get it already! How many times do you have to establish that the Capitol are the bad guys and that Jennifer Lawrence is sad? Hurry up and get on with it already!But they don't get on with it. It just keeps dragging on and on until by the time the movie ended, I found myself asking: That's it? The movie's over already? Really? But nothing happened yet!Without having ever read the books or knowing what's going to happen next, even I can tell that they did not need to split this chapter into two segments. Instead of this dull, unnecessary episode, I'm sure there's no reason they couldn't have just squashed all the events of this film into the first act of the final film.What a disappointment.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Suzanne Collins is one of the most famous fortunate authors in the world.,"She has some of the best adaptation of books ever written.

Teenage Melodrama with Little Substance,Very shallow and trivialized storyline with no depth to the acting. The pace was slow and the content thin. Moviegoers are tired of being gouged by greedy studios. The splitting of the movie into 2 parts with a 1 year intermission just does not work well. The split ending was very abrupt as well with no real incentivized cliff-hanger. In my opinion one of the worst teenage disasters of 2014 by far. Shameful character development and a huge waste of money and manpower.

Far better than the reviews let on,"First, I'm assuming that you've seen the other two Hunger Games movies...else there's not much point to sit through Mockingjay Part I (MJPT1). Second, I'm assuming that you're not a huge Transformers fan and/or didn't think that Pacific Rim nor Sharknado were the height of cinematic perfection.After the first two movies, we already know a lot of back story and setup/conflict between Katniss and Pres Snow. Mockingjay PtI then introduces us to District 13 (her destination as mentioned at the end of Catching Fire) and the District 13 society (only lightly limned in MJPT1). We know there's a war coming and MJPT1 sticks to the story line as outlined in The HG book(s) to a great degree.In terms of the movie and expectations, I never got the least bit bored nor did I feel I was just being dragged through Pt1 primarily to suck money out of me. There's a lot of there-there to be discussed, outlined, and philosophized about and, if you pay any attention, lots of action, too. Sure, this installment is a lot darker but that's how the story plays out.If you compare the structure of THG to LOTR, you know what the protagonist has to do: The Capital is Mordor; Katniss is Frodo; she's the Mockingjay and he's the ring-barer. Neither has an enviable job -- just a sadly necessary, burdensome one. You know where Katniss eventually has to go and MJPT1 does an excellent job of setting this in motion.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Utter mediocrity, dull and disappointing.","Although I am not a particularly huge fan of this franchise, I have enjoyed the movies up to this point. The first was highly flawed but mostly enjoyable, and the second a large improvement, actually among the better blockbusters of that year. This third entry takes the franchise into a dull, predictable and hugely underwhelming direction however.The first thing to note here is the acting. It is generally subpar. Lawrence gives the least interesting performance of her career, clearly either tired with the franchise or not engaged by the weak script. The supporting cast is generally filled with talented actors, Harrelson, Hoffman, Moore, Sutherland and Dormer. However they are almost all wasted, given little to do and often spend time filling the screen with no real purpose. The is most glaringly obvious with Harrelson, who spends the majority of the film wandering around in the background with zero purpose. All of these great actors are shelved in favour of the dull mediocrity that is Liam Hemsworth, who is given a huge amount of screen time here. His presence is comparable with a small moist stone in your sock, irritating and uncomfortable without arousing much of a direct reaction from the victim. The only good performance of note is Natalie Dormer, who is given a passable amount of screen time and appears to be the only actor enjoying themselves.The cinematography, CGI, lighting and set design are all dull and forgettable, not worthy of description or discussion. As is the predictable and horrendously repetitive script, which features around four separate scenes wherein Lawrence's character cries whilst surrounded by rubble and debris.Finally, I will look at the film from the perspective of somebody who has in fact read the trilogy. Mockingjay is a bad book. It has some of the most rushed pacing I have ever seen, and has no character of emotional depth to it. However this film is bad in a totally different, if equally offensive way. It is bland, personality free and lazy to witness. The action is tacked on and boring, the characters are as dull as in the book, and the pacing non-existent. This is a massive disappointment, and a sad collapse of an otherwise decent film series. I would say I have hopes for Part 2, however the second half of the book is a hilarious disaster already, so I am very sceptical.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

If you cannot develop a character in one scene for a two hours movie then there is something wrong with your direction, Mr. Lawrence. The movie lingers on the same subject again and again. They keep talking about the same thing. Repeated dialogues between sisters, with Gale, with Finnick, with team from Panem, with President and Heavensbee. How to make Katniss a rebel kind? Wasn't she a kind from the beginning of this series? What is the need to keep telling her that she is the face to the revolution? I think it was made pretty much clear to her in Catching Fire. But somehow every character in the movie felt the need to convince her that she has to lead a revolution. Come on now. How much prepping up does Katniss need?On the brighter side, the movie has really done well in special effects, creating cityscape and spectacular visuals. Showing gradual decline of the Pita's health is also a smart move. But in spite of that, movies has failed miserably to keep the audience engaged. This is because the story just refuses to advance. Some sequences are unnecessarily prolonged, even the action sequences. When everyone is running to find shelter why is it necessary for the cat to stay behind thus stretching the scene. Suddenly, in the middle of revolution saving the cat became high priority.The movie has too many flaws. In an advanced world with top class weaponry two fighter planes have to circle around multiple times to hit a target. Now, the target is not one person. It is a huge hospital building for crying out loud. When you are forcing an enemy to broadcast a message in your favour isn't it a good idea to record the message, edit it and then broadcast it. Not that you give him every chance to say anything on a live feed. I am sure, in a technically modern world, this wasn't a difficult thing to do. And where is this war going on that everyone keeps talking about like a cheap play on the stage. But there are hardly any scenes of war. On top of that, there is a confusing love story between Katniss, Gale, and Pita. What is with her obsession of saving Pita? She is not even sure if she love him or not. When everyone is planning to revolt against Capitol she doesn't mind endangering the mission by only talking about how to save Pita. Focus girl.Besides the special effects, other good thing about the movie is Philip Seymour Hoffman. The man just doesn't stop to impress me with his subtle improvisations in acting. In a room full of actors he can simply steal all of your attention. I am not sure how much he has completed the second part but he might be the only reason I will risk my reputation to watch it.In conclusion, movie is just waste of time and money. Do yourself a favour and watch something else.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Weakest of the three!!,"They just ruined the whole series when they decided to break mocking jay into 2 parts. The whole money-making idea totally devastated it. This movie had such high expectations, but very little to offer.If you have seen the trailer of this movie, trust me you have probably watched the whole movie. It drags along the scenes of JL being sentimental and more motivated for the cause, forcing to develop her character into the rebellion but pathetically failed. At times you feel that Katniss' character was forced to be made a symbol of rebellion when so many other characters could do better.The movie starts off slow and ends at the same pace. The only thing that saved it from more blushes is Francis Lawrence...what a great director! Background score is as bad as the plot of this movie. You end up thinking what really happened, what has changed and come up with actually NILL.Acting and Direction are good, and this movie will run good because of its fan-following, but totally lacked depth in the storyline. You are forced to think: what was the whole point??Guess they just left everything for the next movie to do some justice. As the 1st two parts were really good, this was a step backwards.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Satisfying Addition To A Daring Blockbuster Franchise,"When the Lorde curated Mockingjay: Part 1 soundtrack came out a week prior to the film's premiere, it sent a wave of forewarning to the world. Listening to the album on Spotify with pulsating glee, I was surprised to find that amidst the various rappers, teen pop queens, and R&B crooners, the soundtrack exploded with the aura of rebellion and fire. So does the film.There are no Hunger Games. There is no obvious cashgrabbing on display. Mockingjay has textures not seen in the previous films; it's more in sync with its political undertones and the thrills are no longer slightly fantastical. Like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Mockingjay Part 1 is a setup for what's to come. What's coming, it seems, is a finale more exciting and more finger-lickingly satisfying than one could ever believe. But Part 1 is hardly just a buffer.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) began simply as a sister to the rescue. But by this film, she's become a warrior, even if she isn't as can't-stop-won't-stop as Black Widow or Lara Croft. At the end of Catching Fire, we found that underneath all the sparkles of the most recent Hunger Games, the workings of a rebellion against the Capitol were coming to light; Katniss would become its symbol.In Mockingjay, she's shaken, rattled and rolled. She's suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and her beloved Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) has been claimed by the Capitol. Her home district, 12, was bombed, with only 45 survivors; both Katniss and the remaining fighters find themselves in District 13, which has been bound underground and is now being lead by the steely President Coin (Julianne Moore). Coin, along with enigmatic gamesmaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), are leading a massive uprising. Katniss will be the face, showing the other districts that turning the other cheek would be catastrophic.Mockingjay doesn't need much of a setup — it moves along like a train off the rails. It doesn't have the slow development of its predecessors, having an everything-is-at-stake attitude that doesn't have time to take prisoners; it's more risky and painstaking than ever before. It's the best of the films, and certainly the smartest. It doesn't feel like a part of a billion-dollar franchise. It's a politically minded thriller that takes you by the throat and demands your attention.Some have complained that there is a severe lack of action. Other have noticed that most of the characters are limited to the claustrophobic walls of District 13. But these are all things that make Mockingjay even better. Without so many brutal fights and faux exotic locales, we are giving a chance to dig deeper into Katniss' psyche, and Lawrence's stunning performance allows us to be compelled. District 13 serves as a reminder of how vulnerable the rest of the districts are to the powerful Capitol; even President Coin, with her monotone delivery and calm figure, seems unsure of what's to come.Mockingjay: Part 1 is unpredictable, unshakeable, and teary. It's a work of fiction, but it somehow feels intimate, close to home. 1984 has always been scary, but there's an underlying understanding that our government would never become so totalitarian. But as we give up our privacy for protection these days, would the rosy evil of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) ever take over? Maybe not, but the film is confident enough to make us believe it. Part 2 may be a year away, but Part 1's heavy, dramatic attitude leaves an impression that has a rippling effect.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Movie Review:  ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1""","Continuing the trend of Harry Potter and Twilight, the third and final Hunger Games book, Mockingjay, has been split into two movies because it's, ""So much story to be told in only one movie."" Yeah, I'll let the filmmakers live with that explanation as long as they make Mockingjay - Part 2 as good as they have Part 1.Picking up literally right where Catching Fire left off, Mockingjay - Part 1 very quickly dispenses any pleasantries and jumps right back into Katniss's struggles and psyche, with Jennifer Lawrence once more proving that Katniss may just be her role of a lifetime. Katniss is now in the long thought destroyed, District 13, and is being used by their President as a figure to rally all of the other districts to rebellion against the Capitol. With war almost all but a certainty, Katniss still finds herself unwillingly thrust in this larger than life game for not only her life, but the lives of all those she cares for.This is a film about war, not only the costs and horrors of war, but also the way that media and propaganda are used in war. Watching Katniss being directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch Heavensbee for a propaganda video they are making -- which is ridiculously stupid, yet authentic in the way our own media represents figureheads -- is one of the few genuinely funny scenes in what is a very tense two hour movie. As it is, what keeps you trucking through some of the horrors that these characters go through is the humanity of the characters and their little quirks that often lend themselves to a little laugh here or there to alleviate the tension happening all around them, because as I've already mentioned, this is a war film.Mockingjay - Part 1 harbors shades of some of the great war films of the past few decades, with one scene in particular that reminded me of Zero Dark Thirty. These scenes, while being played out in a science fiction world, feel startlingly real because of the similarities that are easily seen between the world of Panem and our modern day world with all of our wars and injustices. However, this isn't an anti-war film, nor is it pro-war, it just shows the harsh realities of the world.Sometimes we have to fight for the things that we cannot afford to lose. While peace is a great ideal, as long as there are those who are causing unrest and want to kill all who do not bow to their whims, wars will be fought. It was that idea that I thought was the most poignant thing about Suzanne Collins' book when I read it, and that is an idea that director Francis Lawrence and his screen writing team of Peter Craig and Danny Strong have managed to keep intact for the film. If The Hunger Games crew can continue to build off of the ideas presented here and deliver a moving finale next November, we may be looking at something genuinely special with Part 2. As for now, Part 1 is definitely worth the time of any fan of these books, films, or good science fiction stories in general.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's too slow,"It was very slow compared to the rest of the series.I was really impressed about how they pulled of Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting.Overall(this is my first review) it was an OK movie.I loved The Hunger Games and Catching Fire.I have read the books and to be completely fair, they never followed the book at all. The acting is a (10/10) but the plot was like a (6/10)I gave this movie a (5/10) because there was a fair amount of drama, but not enough action. I was sort of expecting something a little more actiony(not a word) but i guess they are saving it up for part 2.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"follows the book quite well - if you liked that, you'll like this, or...","... If you haven't read the book, but keep up with the series, Mockingjay part 1 - the first half of an adaptation of the third book in the Hunger Games series - it still works. Or it did for me. One of the main things is that it takes its story from the book, and it gives some time to breath for the characters. You get to see how this develops - how Katniss is poised to become this symbol/figure of the revolution for all the other districts, how she's molded (at first unsuccessfully, then majorly) as a figure for the people through what is another ""reality"" show, only this time more on the side of propaganda - and you don't have to rush through it, it's laid out piece by piece, you get a sense of this District 13, the other districts rebellions, and so on.So, first things first, it's its own movie. It's not simply easily dismissible as a 'it's only HALF a movie' sort of thing. Also, the acting is still top-notch for what this material asks for. Lawrence is still incredible as Katniss, having to express more the PTSD that her character has by this point going through two hunger games; Hoffman, in one of his last performances (part 2 of Mockingjay will be the last) strikes a jolly-calm-stern balance throughout his work here as the progandist; newcomer Julianne Moore maybe has the toughest role to play - and she is a lot colder in the book for those who have read it and know - but carries herself strongly in her scenes, aided by gray hair; more surprising is Liam Hemsworth, who I thought was weaker in the previous films, kind of like window dressing. Here, he has to if not carry scenes be more of a firmer presence, like when they return to District 12, or scenes between him and Katniss. He's gotten better.What I liked here is the mix of the 'Media Image', on both the sides of District 13 and the malevolent President Snow with his interviews staged with prisoner Peeta (some of the make-up as he gets weaker is a bit cheesy), and how this is set in the backdrop of this revolution. How much people want change? Well, enough to storm a dam or fight back by going high into trees for a couple of things (these are things we at best hear about in the book but don't see, one benefit of film vs the book in terms of point of view). But best of all I like how director Lawrence paints a relentlessly grim picture, and it's never entirely dour. Nor does it have to be super action-packed; this might deter some audiences who just want the blood and carnage of the Games of the previous films. And to be fair Catching Fire did improve upon it.But unlike something, say, Harry Potter 7 part 1, there's not a lot of aimless wandering around or pondering. Things keep moving, the story keeps going, Katniss' progression as a kind of 'icon' that she naturally becomes through her anger and persistence (and of her handlers), not to mention the bit-by-bit rising of the other districts, it makes for a dynamic film that is really about politics as much as anything else. So that by the time Snow and Katniss have their brief face-off through a video screen, the intensity is white-hot. This is a smart, brawny blockbuster that is not exactly, you know, a ball of laughs, but for what it presents as another in a line of thrillers, it's different and has enough of a satiric edge amid its epic qualities to make it stand out from, say, the Divergent series.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Greed Games,"Suzanne Collins, the author of The Hunger Games series, did an incredible job creating the story of Katniss Everdeen. Lionsgate brought the books to life, and the first two films were a success – until Hollywood became greedy.The final book of the series, Mockingjay, was announced to be split into two films. This turned out to be a poor decision.When I was sitting in the cinema, I had thoughts about leaving the cinema which is new for me. Of course, as I've read the books, I felt like I couldn't – I had to know whether it would improve in the last hour. To me, the whole movie appeared as a preview of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2. There was hardly any action at all, and Katniss (portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence) just seemed to be crying for half of the movie. We all know Jennifer Lawrence is better than that, and the script given to her didn't show all of her talents. The ending was dull, and I'm unsure whether it was predictable as I read the book before going to see the movie.All I can say is hopefully the final film will make up for this one with tons of action scenes and shocking twists, possibly even a twist for those who read the book first.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Slow Crawl,"I was excited to watch this after Catching Fire but 30 to 45 minutes into it, I thought it was me that the movie was moving so slow. The worst part of this movie is Katniss' character role. It's depressing and she has no real script. All she had to do for her part was practice her facial expressions and emotions because there was nothing else coming from her. When I realized the movie was over 2 hours long, I groaned. On one hand I'm waiting for the action to begin and on another, when it does, the reigns are pulled in and it continues it's slow crawl. It's a sleeper. I can honestly tell you that a part of me wanted to see Katniss killed off just to end my pain. I might take the critics advice and shut this off before it's over and just wait for Part 2.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Prepare to yawn -- Painfully anemic and watery,"Surprisingly watery and actionless, this film was a complete bore. The pacing was painfully anemic. The script is so mired and bogged down with cheesy, weepy, whiny dialogue, that only the brilliant Phillip Seymour Hoffman can transcend the mediocre script and deliver an interesting performance. Hollywood's darling in Jennifer Lawrence brings another predictable ho hum performance - - a much overrated actor, in my 'unpopular' opinion. I had absolutely no problem with the splitting of the Hobbit film into three parts as many filmgoers decried and whined. There was a boat load of action and thrills in each of those three films. Here, there is none; therefore, the producers are knowingly and wilfully prolonging the agony filmgoers will surely endure. Prepare to yawn... a lot. This two hours of drivel and melodrama will annoy and depress you.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mockingjay needed to be split into parts,"As someone who has read the books, watching it come to life in film has been nothing but exciting. For me, the first part of Mockingjay was the least exciting of all (I still really enjoyed it, I'm just saying compared to the others). You have to remember that this is not just the first half of a story, it is the last part of the series, so this part is not meant to be exciting and action packed, it is to bring you back to Katniss and prepare you for the end. I feel like they did not have much of a choice, if Mockingjay was one whole film there would have been too many crucial part cut out or it would be a very long film. I am sure people that did not read the books might be OK with that because Francis Lawrence can make anything work, but I am sure Suzanne knew that this was something that had to be taken apart to be right. I love this series, I love the cast, so I did love Mockingjay Part 1, it is not my absolute favourite (Catching Fire is) but, looking at it as a Part 1 movie, it was amazing. I was so impressed with how they changed some things to add excitement in the film, it was enjoyable as a viewer. I cannot wait to see the next part and watch everything fall in place.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A cheap money grab.,"For my review of these two movies, I'm going to be treating them as one movie and copy/pasting this review onto both movies. The only reason why this movie was split into two is because the studio wanted to make money. There is no other logical reason for this nonsense.Plot - This movie isn't very interesting or compelling. The first half is all filler while the second half is a series of semi-violent sequences of poorly choreographed action in between more boring filler. For the most part these movie are very predictable. Anything that is unpredictable is only made so due to the level of stupidity involved. I'm not sure if I can stress enough how much of this movie is boring filler.Characters - None of the actors really care anymore. The guy who plays Haymitch is still enjoyable, but he's a minor character. The characters are all as boring and idiotic and simplistic as they always were.Cinematography - The whole look of this movie is just as bad as the previous movies, but at some points its even worse.There isn't really anything to say about this movie. Its just a load of boring, predictable nonsense.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
tasteless film experience,"The first two instalments were nice to watch and made me curious about the sequel. They totally lost me with this one. I have to add that I did not read the books.The film is very boring and stupid. The characters are becoming boring and shallow. The pace in the film is none. The only action is revealed and actually seen in the official trailer.The characters are totally ruined and Katniss in spite of her previous acts of sacrifice, becomes very selfish, ready to let the whole nation bleed for her own feeling of satisfaction. The new characters are not properly developed and some old ones have rather random appearance, making the plot a set of mostly random and unimportant acts and moments.The young adult previously fighting for her life (and the lives of others) and prepared to kill now becomes a teenager totally lost in her little sorrows and feelings. Again and again and again until the film is over.I had some expectation after the first two instalments and this felt like a let-down.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Expected much more! 5/10,"Review: Man, it's amazing how much trouble this one girl causes these poor people in this movie. Loads of people are getting killed and there homes are completely destroyed just because of this one girl who is wondering around doing publicity for the rebellion. On top of that, she keeps on going on about saving Peter when she doesn't have a clue about his state of mind or why he is going on TV saying that she should stop fighting against President Snow. The storyline seemed a bit to far fetched to me and Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) should have used her powers to kill President Snow except for causing an unnecessary political war. I also thought it was a bit stupid that she was visiting all of these places whilst being filmed, knowing that there was an army looking for her, but thats just me being picky. Anyway, the movie lacked action and it took some time to get going. The performances aren't that bad but I wasn't that impressed with the storyline. I'm not a big fan of the earlier movies so my expectations weren't that high but after hearing all the hype surrounding the movie and seeing the huge box office takings, I was expecting a bit more. On the plus side, it does have me wanting to see the 2nd part of Mockingjay because it was left wide open and it does seem like the true war hasn't begun. Watchable!Round-Up: The director didn't use Woody Harrelson or Stanley Tucci as much as he did in the previous movies and I did miss Lenny Kravitz who seemed like her only true friend. With one week of filming left, Phillip Seymour Hoffman sadly passed away but the director pieced his footage together well. Anyway, the movie seemed more like a political statement then a epic adventure which was a bad choice from the director. The cinematography was done well and you really can see were the $125 million budget went but as I haven't read any of the books, I really don't know how close this movie is to Suzanne Collins original story. At the end of the day, I can't really comment on this franchise until the final movie has been produced but for entertainment, it does drag in places and I'm glad that I didn't have to sit through this 2 hour political drama in the cinema.Budget: $125million Worldwide Gross: $752million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their epic Sci-fi/adventures about a girl who tries to save her colony which is under attack. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"It's worth it, but it's less interesting than the first films.","This film is the third in the adaptation of the literary trilogy by Suzanne Collins, but, unlike the first two films, it brings only part of the last book to the cinema. I didn't read them, I have no particular intention of doing so for any particular reason, so I will ignore the books and focus on the film.In this film, we follow Katniss' first steps as a revolutionary. After being rescued from the arena and recovering from her injuries, she discovers that she is with a group of rebels, the same ones who allegedly lost the civil war seventy-five years earlier, the same ones who inhabit the supposedly extinct District 13. After all, everything was a lie. Everything was a manoeuvrer by Snow's regime to hide the existence of a strong movement of political contestation. Alma Coin, the head of the Resistance, asks for Katniss's support, wants her to become a symbol, a mascot. But she only thinks about the fate of her friends, especially Peeta, who is in Snow's power and seems to have been brainwashed.Well, after the second film turned out to be excellent it was difficult to do better, but it was totally possible to match it. I don't think that happened, although it is very close. This continues to be an excellent film and to be within a standard that does not clash or belittle the other two. I just don't seem to have managed to be that good. To begin with, I hate when a film based on a book splits into two halves, it is almost always a sign that there is immense straw that could be perfectly removed in an editing room by a skilled editor. The film, in fact, drags a little more than those that preceded it, but if the audience gets involved in the story it ends up not even noticing much. It is also a film that has a lot of sci-fi, the most focused on that genre in all of tetralogy.Jennifer Lawrence has remained excellent, but it brings nothing that we have not seen. In addition, attempts to create a romantic plot around her character are weak and cold, whatever the target of Katniss's interest. Donald Sutherland continues to surprise and now gives us an almost perfect villain, in his megalomania, narcissism and thirst for control and power. He is truly an exceptional actor, at his best. Stanley Tucci was much more serious and restrained in the way he brought Cesar, a sensationalist TV host, to life, but it reveals how his character is just a puppet of the regime. Elizabeth Banks is an actress who reveals herself in this film, thanks to the profound mental and psychological transformation that her character will undergo here, and Woody Harrelson gains strength and seriousness, as she becomes one of the most fervent supporters of ""Mockingjay"". Julianne Moore alternates between contained sweetness and charismatic strength and presence; Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Jena Malone are very good, but they don't do much more than they ask. Josh Hutcherson continues to sound weird, although in this film this is almost required by the character.In addition to a great cast and a good story, the film has excellent production values: careful cinematography with good contrast, excellent sets and costumes and great CGI and sound effects that make fights and combats seem like they want to get off the screen . The soundtrack also deserves special mention for its effectiveness and beauty. Composed by James Newton Howard, it is one of those that remains in the ear long after we have seen the film.Full of action and with an excellent story, this film is excellent, although it is not as engaging and intense as the film that preceded it. It drags on more, some scenes seem to be expendable, but that's what happens when, for money, a book unfolds in two films.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I felt like it was an entirely new series and that all of the characters were working overtime to try and fit in. It was just a miss for me.

Awesome!,"Great plot, counting down to the last movie! I really liked the characters. The characters all serve a purpose for different reasons in the movie. The Stunts were awesome! Georgia has been a good location to film this movie.This moment has an unmistakably kitschy ring to it, and it speaks to the quintessence of young-adult fiction and why no real adult should take it seriously (though more than ever, they do). Civilisation hangs in the balance, but what's really at stake is Katniss' feelings for Peeta – the dewiest of junior love stories. Of course you could argue that Casablanca, minus the puppy- love factor, works in pretty much the same way, with the outcome of World War II hinged on the issue of whether Humphrey Bogart's Rick will remain with Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa. But if Katniss is the forceful prime mover in Mockingjay – Part I, Peeta, let's be clear, is no Ilsa. As played by Josh Hutcherson, he has all the charisma of the least interesting member of the Yale crew team. Katniss, for most of Mockingjay – Part I, is more interested in saving this preppy hand- puppet than she is in bringing about the overthrow of tyranny. By now, even much of the audience may not share Katniss' Peeta fixation. Three movies into the Hunger Games series, their bond comes off as more desperately theoretical than ever.Lawrence, who had the implacability of an Olympian in the first two Hunger Games films, now plunges Katniss into a mood of Hamlet-Esq doubt: having become the poster girl for revolution, she's not at all sure if she wants the role. She's wary and woeful, just like the Katniss who first volunteered for the Hunger Games to save her sister. Lawrence has a chance to show some more vulnerability, but Katniss' tearful ambivalence about whether she's committed to the cause, or merely to saving Peeta, plays out in a less than scintillating way. It's not the actor's fault. This is what happens when you split the third installment of a YA series into two blockbuster movies: Part I is basically all dragging exposition.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
