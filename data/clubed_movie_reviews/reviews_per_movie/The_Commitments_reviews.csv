"Excellent story about the rise and fall of Irish ""saviors of soul"".","Alan Parker's brilliant directing effort on THE COMMITMENTS really shines. More than an entertaining spectacle, it has a whole lot of influence on the soul music circuit. Shots of Dublin city life are nicely photographed. The musical acts are extremely well talented and well done, if only the occasional dialogue breaks didn't interrupt the awesome sound. There could've been some more new tunes instead of old ones, but it's amazing to discover the fictional band's lead singer pull them off out of his lungs. Phenomenal! At least you can try to find the soundtrack album. One thing stands out the best: the casting. We need more of today's movies to do the same thing: to provide creative acting talents. The musical genre of modern Hollywood needed something like this to keep it afloat. Highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
For it's time it's a classic,"The Commiments holds a very unique place in Irish modern movie history. For a start you have to understand that the Dublin that the film was shot in was incredibly bleak in the early '90's. Unemployemt was huge, money was scarce etc. When the film opened in Dublin it was a genuine phenomenon. The biggest cinema in Dublin (The Savoy) showed the picture around the clock on it's opening weekend and it played to pretty much full houses at all shows. I watched, for the 4th time, with a crowd of approx 500 at 6.00am on Sunday and the atmosphere was electric. This was a film we could relate to, it was about us and where we lived. Suffice to say it was a monster hit in Ireland at the time. I was working in the cinema business at the time (managing UCI) and I was lucky enough to be at the premiere. When the cast were introduced one by one the roof lifted. I attended the party where The Commitments (all of them) played in a tiny club on the docks called The Waterfront and to say that was pretty special is an understatement. To this day I'm still friend with Dick Massey (Billy Mooney) and and from to time to time he will remissness about his time with the film. The Commitments only played live together three times, the Dublin premiere, the NY premiere the LA premiere. I saw then in their home town! While the movie is certainly flawed it is still a classic for it's time.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Fun loving and full of life,"Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins) is a small time hustler selling pirated tapes and T-shirts. Outspan Foster (Glen Hansard) and Derek Scully (Ken McCluskey) ask Jimmy to manage their wedding band. Jimmy declares that they need to be a hard working Soul band. He puts an ad in the papers and it's a parade of wrong music. His Elvis loving dad (Colm Meaney) doesn't get it. Sax playing Dean Fay (FÃ©lim Gormley) is the first brought into the band. Billy Mooney (Dick Massey) is the drummer. Jimmy gets Natalie Murphy (Maria Doyle Kennedy), Imelda Quirke (Angeline Ball) and Bernie McGloughlin (Bronagh Gallagher) as the backup singers. After watching a drunken Deco Cuffe (Andrew Strong) sing at the wedding, he gets him as the lead singer. Joey ""The Lips"" Fagan (Johnny Murphy) is the womanizing experienced trumpet player who comes up with their name ""The Commitments"". He hires the volatile Mickah Wallace (Dave Finnegan) as their security.This is fun. It's great music. The cast is mostly musicians trying their hands at acting. Some of them would become quite interesting. It's based on the first of novelist Roddy Doyle's lower class Barrytown trilogy. It's heart warming and then sadly inevitable. The portrayal of the Irish lower class is one of loving profanity. The one word I would use is life. This movie is full of life. The movie could have ended with something predictable but this way it's poetry.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Funny, heartbreaking and true","Who needs expensive movie stars when a group of unknowns can light up the screen like this lot?On paper, it sounds like a failure - a cast comprising almost entirely of untrained and untested performers, set in working class Dublin, based on the novella by Roddy Doyle.  By God, does it defy expectations.Jimmy Rabbitte is a working class Dublin lad who's been collecting unemployment benefits for two years.  But he dreams of bigger things, namely making it big in the music industry.  He sets out to form a soul band, and assembles a motley crew of musicians and singers, most of whom don't know each other and many of whom can't stand each other.The look of the film is gritty and realistic - nothing is glossed over. North Dublin is presented in all it's glory.  The home lives of the band members are depicted warts and all - their private lives set the scene for the inevitable personality clashes that are almost as explosive as the music.  In the mix is the unique character of the Irish people - at one point Jimmy enters a tenement block and, as he waits for the lift, looks over to see a boy with a horse.  ""You aren't taking that in the lift, are you?"" he asks.  ""I have to,"" the boy replies.  ""The stairs would kill him.""The real star of the show is the music - this film spawned two hugely successful soundtrack albums.  The band members were cast partly due to their musical ability, and the results are superlative.  The stand out is Andrew Strong as Deco - would you believe this kid was only 16 when the film was made?  His amazing voice belies his tender years, and suggests that he's been smoking a packet a day since the age of about four.  At the end of the day with is a fine ensemble piece, much like the band.  The acting may be a little wonky at times, but the hysterical dialogue makes up for that.Most remarkably, this is a feel good film that does not rely on any of the conventional feel good plot devices.  There are no group hugs, no plot conveniences, no trite happy endings.  Just a shrewdly observed and wittily captured human story about people who dream of making it out of their dreary world.  And isn't that something we can all relate to?",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Funny how the Irish dig Motown...,"I've lived in Detroit all my life, and the great soul music of the 1960's and 70's which was created here (and is still enjoyed here) is featured throughout ""The Commitments.""  The Irish lads and lasses really do up the soul staples, from ""Try a Little Tenderness"" to ""Mustang Sally.""  The actual musical talent is reinforced by the strong character development, industrial setting (North Dublin), and masterful plot, adapted from the novel of the same name by Roddy Doyle. ""Say it once, say it loud...I'm black and I'm proud,"" is never more irreverently humorous than when questionably repeated by Jimmy Rabbite's soul disciples. I own this film, and I could watch it over and over.  The soundtrack is excellent, and the pop culture references throughout the movie are hilarious (especially during the audition scene.) This film delighted both the hard-core Detroiter in me, as well as the Irish lass.  The working class Irish youth depicted in the movie are sincere, and so is their project, The Commitments. (All the great bands were a ""The ..."")",,Anonymous,Music
Brilliant!,"I first heard of the Commitments when I heard someone playing the soundtrack on their car radio. I quickly bought myself a copy and played it about 10 times a day - the music and the singing were unlike anything I'd ever heard before, even though all the songs are covers.It wasn't until about 6 months later that the film was on an obscure cable channel, and I literally got goosebumps as soon as the opening credits rolled with ""Treat her right"". It was so incredible to actually see the characters performing the songs that I'd grown to love. It all became complete actually seeing the story unfold, and by the end you're really rooting for the band to succeed. When they perform ""Try a Little Tenderness"" I've never managed to watch that scene without tears in my eyes, it's such a fantastic version of the song and the energy Andrew Strong brings to it is just incredible, especially as he was only 16 at the time.Anyone who loves music has to see this film, even you're not familiar with soul music - I promise you'll be hooked after seeing The Commitments!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Fun,"A comedy about the rise and fall of a band in Dublin. This film is really funny and energetic, but you'll probably need to like the music to really enjoy it. The Commitments are a rough and ready group of kids that get together with an aging trumpeter Joey 'The Lips' Fagan. I'm not sure whether the cast were singers or actors before the film, but they're certainly pretty good at both during the film. The band plays 'Black' soul and the films set piece concerts make the story fairly zip along. Joey tells stories about all the famous musicians he's played with, but is he telling the truth ? When he arranges for a jam between the Commitments and Wilson Pickett we are going to find out ... or are we ?",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Absolutely great movie,"I love this film. Everything about it might seem like it is just another cliche ridden story about the rise and fall of a band, but this movie is totally different somehow. It rises above anything previous in its genre. The characters are all both interesting, and their personality flaws are used to greatly illustrate the ending  of the movie. The writing was superb, and acting from a cast of mostly unknowns top notch. The musical sequences were great, and served as an introduction for me to the songs and artists that they covered. Colm Meaney was hilarious as the very skeptical father of Jimmy.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"""You raised their expectations of life, you lifted their horizons!""","My one line summary consists of the most profound statement in the movie. ""Jimmy ""The Lips"" Fagin telling ""Brother Rabbitte"" what he has achieved, when Jimmy thinks he has achieved ""Nuttin'"".That being said, I am overjoyed at the amount of people giving their wonderful comments about my favorite movie of all time.I can't tell you all the people I've turned on to this movie. I remember I didn't see the movie when it first came out, then they came out with some god-awful TV series kinda based on the movie (Americanized, of course),which,thank god, met a quick & merciful death. I bought the VHS version, then the Laserdisc version, then the DVD, and am now awaiting the 2 disc special DVD, just released, to come in the mail.I have watched this film countless times & never get tired of it. I've even pretty much deciphered the dialogue(try reading the book sometime,if you think the movie is hard to understand!)One of my most prized possessions is a ""Commitments"" Promotional kit consisting of a ""Making of"" tape and a booklet about the movie in a photo-illustrated 6x15 box that I bought from a long-closed video store about 10 yrs ago. I also found the ellusive ""Commitments Vol.2"" CD in a ""cut-out"" bin about the same time.Anyway,I love the movie, and the whole premise of taking a bunch of unknown,talented, singers & musicians,with pretty much no hope of rising above their surroundings individually,and put them together to form ""The Hardest Working Band in Show Business"".To me, the highlight & peak of the band(and movie) was when they played ""Try a Little Tenderness"". It still gives me goosebumps & brings a mist to my eyes,whenever I see it.I'm still in love with Natalie & Imelda!! And Deco(Andrew Strong) only being 16yrs old!!I always hoped there would be a ""Part 2"", but as Joey said to Jimmy(after the band broke up) ""The success of the band was irrelevent.You raised their expectations of life, you lifted their horizons. Sure, we could have been successful, & made albums & stuff, but that would have been predictable. This way...it's poetry"". What a wonderful philosophy. That whole scene will never leave my mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Vidiot Reviews...,"The CommitmentsBlues music is not popular in Ireland because the Irish have nothing to be miserable about.That simple reason is why the band in this comedy chose to cover soul music instead.Determined to prove his prowess as a band manager, young Dubliner Jimmy (Robert Arkins) puts an ad in the newspaper looking for local talent to start a soul band. Among the freaks that audition, he finds some serviceable horn players and back-up singers. After weeks of rehearsal, the band garners some local success. But infighting and affairs threaten to derail Jimmy's dream.While the songs sung are soul music standards, the new vocal talent behind the melodies brings these classics to life in a new way. Based on the novel by Roddy Doyle, this hilarious toe-tapping adaptation from 1991 still holds up today.What's more, it's nice to see Irishmen playing instruments that aren't just empty whiskey jugs.

Wonderfully funny and entertaining with a fantastic soundtrack,"Dublin, Ireland. Local entrepreneur Jimmy Rabbitte is putting a band together (which he will manage). Through friends, contacts, auditions and blind luck he puts together his band - The Commitments. He decides what music they will play - soul. We see how the pieces come together, the auditions, the skepticism from his parents, their first rehearsal, how things start to come together and their first few gigs. We also see the relationships in the band, particularly the friction. Soon they are standing on the threshold of stardom.Wonderfully funny and entertaining with a fantastic soundtrack.Great plot, based on a book by Roddy Doyle, showing how the average band forms and develops and the internal turmoil. Wonderful dialogue and scenes - incredibly funny, with quotable lines coming thick and fast.However, the thing that tips the movie over from great to masterpiece is the music. Fantastic music, well made and produced with some great concert scenes to add to the vibe.Performances from a cast of then-unknowns are spot-on. Great casting, as director Alan Parker would have been going out on a limb with many of them.Wonderfully vibrant and funny, yet profound, movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Great Music; Not-So-Great Characters,"The music makes this a very entertaining film but there are severe drawbacks: at least to people who aren't familiar with the accents or maybe don't approve a the Lord's name in vain or the f-word said every two seconds as the Irish do in this film.The singers in this film are good, particularly the lead singer who, supposedly, was only 16 years of age when this film was made (but he looks 30). He has a great ""soul"" voice. The story is interesting and there is some good humor in her, too.The bad news is that it portrays the Irish as extremely profane people who do nothing but scream at each other and tell each other to f-off. That wears thin after awhile. Everyone says this: young and old. One hopes this isn't representative of the entire country.The movie also has as one of the characters an older trumpet player who is portrayed as a ""religious"" man who wears crosses and says the Lord told him to do this and do that. Hen then proceeds to have sex with every female in the group. Talk about anti-religious cheap shot. Well, that's typical of filmmakers.In a nutshell: great music, fairly interesting story, but profane, blasphemous and full of scummy people.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A movie made with the Soul!,"The first time I saw ""The Commitments"" I got surprised because it doesn't seem to be a Hollywood-like movie (talking about money) but it's a great example of good script and great performance of the actors/singers. When you see the movie, it seems to be a real-life-documentary.The music is great! And the best of all is that some of The Commitments' members really play and sing...

Like soul?,"You'd better like soul music if you're planning on watching ""The Commitments"". The film is all about a young Dublin man who decides to assemble a rock band from his local cohorts and friends and that's all the film is about. From beginning to end, this raucous comedy tells of the coming together of a motley crew of musicians and wannabees who manage to harmonize on stage while dissonance prevails off stage.

committed to greatness,"In what may have been Alan Parker's (happy birthday, Alan!) best movie ever, a gaggle of working-class youths in Dublin decide to form a soul band. It's hard for say which is the movie's best aspect: the look at working-class life in Ireland, or the soundtrack. You feel a little depressed seeing people's lives - as expected, families have more children than anyone cares to count - but also feel like jumping up and dancing as they play their music.Anyway, ""The Commitments"" is a really great little movie. The great soundtrack, fascinating characters, and other things combine to create something that everyone should see. I guess that any Roddy Doyle novel adapted into a movie starring Colm Meaney is sure to come out masterful (the others were ""The Snapper"" and ""The Van"").",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"The music is tremendous in this hilarious, yet sombre, look at the tragedy that is Wasted Talent","""The Commitments"" burst on to the scene in 1991 and immediately garnered much critical acclaim. It was nominated for an Oscar for Best Editing, but it was the music that would make it the film that it is. The soundtrack went on to sell millions and achieved triple-platinum status. Set in recession-stricken Dublin in the late 1980s, Jimmy Rabbitte is a young unemployed man who wheels-and-deals and dreams of music stardom. He has a strong passion for soul music and when he puts an ad in the paper for musicians to audition for the band he wants to put together and manage, he attracts a wide variety of nutjobs and pure talent. He assembles a line-up, and they hit the stages around working-class Dublin. They become a hit in no time, and with whispers of deals and contracts only down the line, and with Wilson Pickett himself rumoured to be lined up to play with the band while he is in Dublin, all that is going to hold this motley crew back is their hatred of each other.""The Commitments"" is a funny and unique film in that the rags-to-riches tale is turned upside down and we are left with a rather sad ending that evokes, as much of the rest of the film does, real life. There is nothing glamorous here, and director Alan Parker hammers it home by filling the movie with dreary, rain-drenched shots of social poverty and ruin. Choosing to film with subdued lighting also helped, as the film always appears to be in darkness. The characters are rough and very talented and they range from the mysterious and sleazy Joey ""The Lips"" Fagan - who may or may not be what he says he is - to the films finest attribute, the voice of Andrew Strong, who has to be the oldest looking teenager to ever appear on film. He was only about seventeen in this, but he looks and sounds thirty, at least. But what a voice. The rest of the cast are very good, and it is hard to believe that none of them went on to do much else after this - film-wise anyway. Robert Arkins who plays Jimmy vanished into obscurity in the years that followed. Andrew Strong never became as big as he should have. Glen Hansard, however, did go on to become a household name for his band and for the 2007 film ""Once"". Far from a masterpiece - its humour is dependent on Roddy Doyle's writing where we have a bunch of young Irish men and women roaring abuse at one another in between some fantastic musical performances - it nevertheless carries a strong personality and is a credit to the music that it celebrates, and to Irish life and the era it comes from.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Feel Good Music Video,"""The Commitments"" is one of those triumph of the underdog movies, this one about a bunch of Irish kids who want to make it as a rock band.It's been a while since I've seen this, but I remember thinking that the movie wasn't really about much. I liked it -- it has tremendous energy, and a virtual non-stop parade of great songs, but it felt more like an extended MTV music video than it did a movie.But Alan Parker is just the guy to direct a feature length video -- look what he did with ""Evita.""The movie garnered an Academy Award nomination for best film editing, which tells you who the true star of the movie is.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Cymbals of Egos Clashing on the Drums of Glory...,"There's a reason why working-class areas are darlings for sport or music-themed 'Cinderella' films: when you come from a poor neighborhood, that's almost the only options you have. So there's a truth-to-life that Alan Parker effectively explored in ""Fame"" and that he transposed in the Northside of Dublin with a more cynical tone, less inclined to tell an inspirational underdog story Ã  la ""Fame"", but tailor-made for the 90s.""The Commitments"" is adapted from Roddy Doyle's tale of an Irish band that invented 'Dublin soul' and it is indeed a boisterous, energetic, funny and vibrant ode to soul music, invigorated by the kind of youthful spontaneousness that works like a double-edged sword as sometimes what makes great bands can also undo them. Still, there's something inspirational in the central protagonist Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins): a man with a vision and a mission so incongruous it could actually work.Jimmy worships soul for it's the music that best conveys the emotional turmoil of the average man... much more it's a genre that requires vocals, bassists, a chorus, trumpetists, saxophonists, drummers, it's a combination of collective forces rather than the clashes of egos that killed so many bands before. ""The Commitments"" will commit to their music and stick together, at least on the paper.Jimmy insists on that with the same damn seriousness as the 'Blues Brothers' who feel like they're on a mission from God. And in the film's most infamous sequence where he shows James Brown as a model to measure up to, Felim Gormley (at the sax) asks him if they're not too 'white' for that and Jimmy's answer establishes that 'skin' is a matter of opinion, and what counts is how much of an outcast you feel in your own world. That line makes a subtle bridge with ""Fame"" and as Parker said: any poor kid from London or Detroit could identify with the Commitments.That said, he didn't forget to provide that Irish texture with a fair share of folk music, a little Riverdance and accents that are literally written on subtitles: ""bollix"" and ""eejit"" are new words I entered in my vocabulary. He doesn't always dodge the clichÃ©s (there had to be a bar brawl) but Parker assembled a fine gallery of young lads and lasses from Ken McCluskey and Glen Hansard at the guitar to Andrew Strong as the singer whose success went up his pony-tailed head. The Commitmettes are Imelda (Angeline Ball) the pretty one with distracting skirts, Bronagh Gallagher as Bernie the mousy fish-and-ship vendor with the sweetest voice and there's Nathalie (Maria Doyle Kennedy) who has a crush on Jimmy. As for the drummers, the hot-temper issue turns into a running-gag almost as memorable as in ""Spinal tap"".Speaking of which, there are times where I wondered if Parker was so transported by the rock music he let it roll toward ""mockumentary"" territory. I'm not sure the film needed this musical sequence full of comical snippets such as the band rehearsing in an abattoir, a bus, on the streets women were hanging their laundry, sometimes all you need is a simple line such as ""I feel like Madonna"" or the group training while Bernie is babysitting. The rawness is lost in these trailer-baity scenes while sometimes comedy is best taken on small doses: the confession scene where the priest corrects Steven (Michael Aherme) about the singer of ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" is one of the film's highlights, and it's funny as hell.Speaking of priest, the most inspired casting is Joey the Lips (Johnny Murphy) who talks about soul like preaching a gospel, his smile is the vector of cohesion in the whole group, and he seems to have an endless list of name-dropping anecdotes and even one that include the idol of Jimmy's father (Colm Meaney) Elvis Presley whose portrait is hanged above the Pope's. It's very unlikely that he tells the truth but the point is that you don't have to be credible to build a band but be a band first and build credibility afterwards.And the road to glory contains many many steps: from the failed auditions with door closing on wannabe Joan Baez or Boy George to getting the equipment and then the first gigs in local churches or pubs, the real challenge isn't to prevent an eventual power outage but to contain the anger and the egos of the band members who complain about the lack of wages, the tight schedules, the arrogance of Deco who acts like a prima donna or Joey who gets all the girls ... the musical interludes make us appreciate how talented they are and yet how unprofessionally they constantly behave backstage.I concede the arguments get a little repetitive, the film insists too much on that point as if it was trying to warn us that this time Cinderella wouldn't find the Prince... and that the collective dream would crash under the reality of individuals. Anyway, I kept thinking of ""The King of Comedy"" with Rabbite trying to imagine an interview to a journalist which is exactly what people with dreams of glory have in mind and that reveals maybe his desire to form a group is to fulfill some narcissistic void. But still, it was nice while it lasted and paraphrasing Rupert Pumpkin, at least we know they will never be schmucks for a lifetime, they were kings for a night, and many other nights.""The Commitments"" is one of these films that had to exist, I can imagine Parker wanting to make that film, posting announcements on newspapers, auditioning, having to handle all these clashing egos as well and coming to the final product, the making of film echoes its own point, if the film about that band could be made, then the band could exist.... And always hand-in-hand with its fictional content, the film didn't even do well in the box-office, but you know as Joey the Lips said, even that was poetry.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The Commitments,"I always found Alan Parker's The Commitments to be a smug film. That might be slightly unfair to the movie.It's success spawned a cottage industry in Britain and Ireland. The soundtrack of the movie was a bestseller. The actual actors went on to perform as the Commitments.All of a sudden every nightclub from Newcastle to Birmingham were putting on soul bands. One minute the bands that were doing Madness, The Jam or The Special songs. Now they were doing covers of Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett but not one black member in these groups.So for a brief moment The Commitments wasa cultural phenomenon.Adapted from Roddy Doyle's novel by Doyle himself as well as Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. The latter two had experience with working class comedy and dramas in shows such as The Likely Lads and Auf Wiedersehen Pet.Set in the working class Northside of Dublin. Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins) sells bootleg tapes and dreams of managing an Irish soul band. 'The Irish are the blacks of Europe.'His Elvis obsessed dad (Colm Meaney) is not impressed. Ever the hustler. Jimmy places an ad in the newspaper and gets equipment together for the band.The band is assembled with three female backup singers. Natalie (Maria Doyle Kennedy) Imelda (Angeline Ball) and Bernie (Bronagh Gallagher.) Jimmy fancies Bernie.There is experience from Joey 'The Lips' Fagan (Johnny Murphy) the veteran who has toured with bands and has tall stories of playing with the musical greats.Their vocalist is slob Deco Cuffe (Andrew Strong) who has a big voice but soon becomes obnoxious, rubbing the other band members the wrong way.Soon the word spreads of The Commitments after they play small clubs and bars. Their interpretation of songs such as Mustang Sally and Chain of Fools prove infections.Band tensions are not far behind. It all comes to a head when they play a gig where they expect Wilson Pickett to show up.Overall the story was not the strong point of the movie. There was not much depth and it really had to rely more on the songs. The characters torpedoed themselves with pettiness.Alan Parker picked up some non actors for the main roles. A few of them have gone to have good careers.The movie led to two unofficial sequels based on Doyle's other books made by BBC Films. They featured Colm Meaney in the main role.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Dublin soul,"Bring a bunch of destitute Dubliners together to form a soul band. Crazy? No, brilliant. Jimmy Rabbitte is the young man with the dream. He's unemployed (who isn't?) but that's OK because he has the idea, the passion that will change everything. Drawing from the down-and-out youth of Dublin he's going to put together the world's greatest band. And he has just one type of music in mind: soul. Does this make any sense? Not to anybody else. But Jimmy's got the vision. And somehow it all begins to come together. His band, The Commitments, is on its way. But it's not a straight ride to the top. There will be struggles and conflicts and life lessons along the way. But the journey is worth it because, despite all the odds stacked against them, it turns out The Commitments are one heck of a band. Playing their wonderful, unique, rockin' Dublin soul.It's a great ensemble cast that makes up this movie's band. Robert Arkins plays Jimmy, the guy who brings it all together. And then the musicians do their thing. Never for a moment do you not buy into these performers as a real band. Their acting is fine but it's the music they play that makes the movie shine. Unlike so many other movies of this type almost all the singing and playing is actually done by the actors themselves. And when The Commitments cut loose this movie rocks. Jimmy Rabbitte might take exception to that. It's not rock, it's soul. Whatever it is it's absolutely bursting with energy. And that is thanks largely to one exceptionally talented young man. While everyone in the band plays their role well there's no way around it, Andrew Strong is the star. Unbelievably just 16 years old when the film was made, Strong plays lead singer Deco Cuffe. And he's got the voice of a singing god with the charisma and star power to match. But there's a problem. Deco is a completely insufferable jerk. Everyone else in the band hates him, and rightly so. Deco may well tear this group apart.The movie follows the band's rise, with all the drama Deco causes threatening a fall before they hit the big time. Which would be a shame because this band is awesome. When first thrown together they understandably make a stuttering start. But once they get their act together they are something to behold. The music they play is fantastic and it makes the movie so much fun. Whether performing a tender ballad or a really rocking number The Commitments hit all the right notes as they run through a soul classics songbook. Try A Little Tenderness and In The Midnight Hour are two obvious highlights but every song really works, not a musical misstep to be found. The music is so great it largely overshadows the rest of the film. The story largely takes a back seat but there are plenty of good moments in between the big musical numbers too. For as good as he is on stage Strong is also excellent portraying the boorish lout Deco offstage as well. Arkins is terrific as band manager Jimmy, holding his band of misfits together. One other standout is Johnny Murphy as Joey 'The Lips' Fagan. He's the wise old hand of the group, a trumpet-playing philosopher who's played with all the greats.

"Great music, great characters, great story, great everything!","They rock. They roll. They're obscene. They're Irish. And it's for these reasons that I love The Commitments. It's about a group of misfits and oddballs who create a band together aptly named The Commitments. They all have personalities as big as their beer mugs (sorry I couldn't resist an Irish stereotype joke) and so it's no surprise to see how this rag tag gang of rambunctious kids operates. But after wading through all the argument and personality clashes, the band discovers they actually have an incredible amount of talent. The movie's sole focus is on the band and it never strays to unnecessary side plots. What side stories there are all come back to the central focus around the band, each story influencing the band's progression throughout the movie. It is incredibly focused and respectfully handled filmmaking, and for that I love it.The Commitments is extremely fun, yet also a very high quality of film. It's consistent in its pacing, timing, and overall level of energy that never falters. The movie remains at a sharp, witty, and fast paced rate that directly reflects the energy level required to hold this band together. The whole film remains exciting without going over the top. From the opening scene we are drawn in, not to be let go for another two hours. And surprisingly enough, the film is so captivating, yet never gets over-dramatic, and never takes the easy way out in drawing its audience in. It is consistently lighthearted and scene after scene put a bigger smile on my face.What really makes The Commitments work though, is the characters. The bizarre bunch of people brought together to form this soul rock band are all so expertly written and ridiculously fun characters to watch interact. The band is formed of the strangest grouping of people, the kind you would never expect to have anything to do with each other. You have people like the lead singer, Deco Cuffe (Andrew Strong) who is short tempered and extremely rude and obnoxious to all his band mates. There is the trumpeter of the band, Joey 'The Lips' Fagan (Johnny Murphy) who claims to have played for all the greats (The Beatles, Otis Redding, etc) yet might not have all his screws securely fastened. We have a laid back and easy going guitarist, a stylish and independent saxophone player, and of course the three female backup singers who perform a trifecta of vivacious and snappy beauty. And then of course there's the band manager, Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins) who is a respectful guy who's only wish is to create great music. Such steadfast and differing personalities make for some of the most exciting and hilarious interactions I've ever seen.And as icing on the cake, The Commitments has a soundtrack so incredible and so sincere that it almost borough a tear to my eye. Obviously in the movie itself the story plays out that this band is surprisingly incredible and contains a lot of unexpected potential. Yet amazingly enough, this would be true if the band weren't even a movie band. The music in The Commitments is absolutely incredible and the people in this movie can actually play. The highlight is definitely the lead singer who has a voice so rugged and so grand that my jaw practically dropped the first time he started singing. I would have to say that about 30 to 40 minutes of the film is just the band performing and there is nothing wrong with this, other than the fact I would have liked it to be even longer! Unlike certain genres of music that I can really only enjoy in the context of a good film (I'm looking at you country music) I could enjoy the music of The Commitments in any setting and I'm strongly considering buying the soundtrack.The Commitments was an incredibly enjoyable movie to watch and it is definitely one of those I feel I could watch again and again and never get tired of its greatness. There is something so sincere and so real about this film that just makes it hard not to enjoy. The music is so great but even if it's not your style, I would still highly recommend checking out the film, just for the sake of watching a truly well made movie with a fun plot and exciting characters that make for just a purely great time.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"""I get snotty with no man""","A hilarious look at a working class covers band, and their struggling but ever dreaming manager, in 1980s Dublin. Packed with memorable performances and quotable dialogue, it's an absolute gem of a film.

The Stereotypes.,"Alan Parker's Angel Heart is one of my favorite films of all time, and I also like Mississippi Burning a lot. Angel Heart has a wonderfully dark aesthetic, and some of that is visible in Mississippi Burning as well. But while The Commitments is certainly a well-made movie, it has none of that.My biggest disappointment with The Commitments, however, is that I found the working-class Irish characters, their friends and family to be too stereotypically portrayed. (That may be straight from the novel, which I haven't read.) I appreciate that this is a comedy, but still. The Commitments walks a narrow line, and sometimes I felt like I was watching a group of people straight out of a Ken Loach film, but portrayed without the empathy of that film maker.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"""This way it's poetry...""","This is the simple and captivating story of Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins, fantastic like the whole cast), a young guy who decides to form a soul band in Dublin, and all the amazing people who join him. They've got musical talent and big dreams, but is that enough to climb to the top (and stay there)?Alan Parker has made some very diverse films (""Midnight Express"", ""Angel Heart"", ""Mississippi Burning"", ""Angela's Ashes"") in his long career, but you can see that music is in his blood and one of his favourite themes (""Bugsy Malone"", ""Fame"", ""Pink Floyd The Wall"", ""Evita""). He orchestrates a mostly unknown cast (which includes a very young Glen Hansard, from the recent hit ""Once"") in a tale of hope, determination, and great music. The British have a great eye for the bittersweet side of life and misfits in general (""The Full Monty"", ""Little Voice"", ""Billy Elliot"" are fine examples), often with music as an important factor in the background (coincidence? I don't think so!).

Like a Whole New Movie For Me,"I know this is my second review/comment about The Commitments ( my first one being over four years ago) but I gotta say I just watched it for the first time with the ""closed-captioning"" on, and it's like a whole new movie for me!! I highly recommend this to everyone who's ever watched the movie and I'll guarantee you'll be amazed at what you missed in dialog. As many times as I've watched the movie, I always picked up a little more (dialog-wise) than the previous time. Now I know the whole story & all the background dialog. It's almost like a ""Director's Cut"" or the ""Uncut"" version. Don't knock it till you try it! Still my #1 favorite movie.On a side note, I'm sure most of you know Glen Hansard, who played ""Outspan"" in the movie won an Academy Award for Best Original Song this year from the movie ""Once"". I bought the movie used at Blockbuster for $5,just on the strength of the box's liner notes. I loved the movie, but had no clue the male lead was ""Outspan"". But the more I looked at his facial expressions, especially his eyes, I kept saying to myself,God, I know this guy! Picked up my Commitments DVD, but no actors names were on the box, so I got my Commitments CD Soundtrack out and sure enough, Glen Hansard's name was listed. If you haven't seen the movie(""Once"")give it a try. It's got some great songs in it( almost all original, written by Glen and his co-star Marketa Irglova) Well, that's enough for me. I'll write some more in another four years. Marty",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Commitments,"""Jimmy"" (Robert Arkins) is a bit of a restless, creative, spirit and a man who is bored with the Dublin music scene. To rectify matters, he and his pal ""Joey"" (Johnny Murphy) - aka 'The Lips"" decide to hold auditions to create a band. A band with an unique sound to challenge the prevailing mediocrity. After some frankly hilarious auditions that pitch the tone deaf straight into the arms of the fashion police, the pair manage to assemble ten folks as different as gin and Guinness. It's no easy task moulding these disparate and lively individuals into one coherent unit, but oddly enough - despite their differences - it's the music from the likes of Mack Rice (""Mustang Sally""), Al Green & Teenie Hodges and a range of established American soul songsters who manage to provide them all with a common language and purpose as they gradually start to gain some traction amongst a sceptical community and an even more cynical music business. It's fair to say that neither ""Lips"" nor ""Jimmy"" are high on the list at the diplomatic corps, so keeping these people from - quite literally at times - tearing each other apart is no mean feat. Being a Scot of a certain age from Glasgow, it's easy for me to appreciate the old adage that for many, the escape from post-industrial poverty was music - and both Danny Boyle and Roddy Doyle work well to create and engagingly plausible story of folks whose ambition is not to win a Grammy, but to have enough money to buy their kids milk in the morning. Those they assemble for the band are a myriad of characterful and colourful folks - some likeable, some certainly not - but put them on stage and the toes start tapping and all is forgiven. For a while, at least! There's a sense of real talent here, warts and all - and for just shy of two hours it's a compelling watch that reminded me that most bands started out with a talent scouting mechanism that didn't require the likes of Simon Cowell.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Charming,"A movie that does not come out with huge aspirations. Which is fine. It just wants to tell its little story. Set in and filmed in the working class (or lower) neighborhoods of Dublin, it tells the story of a young entrepreneur who starts a band. Instead of heavy metal or poisonous rap, he/they want to do Sixties soul music, despite their Irishness and whiteness. There is a fair amount of subtle humor. I had neither seen nor heard of any of the actors, but then again, I rarely saw much Irish cinema. I was especially impressed by Angeline Ball, one of the back-up singers. The movie was, well, charming is the word that most comes to mind. You probably have to like that sort of music to like the movie, but if you do, check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

If you don't understand it then please don't diss the film on this basis; it's not the fault of the script. As for subtitles, I think a translation might be more use to you!Other Roddy Doyle books, and their subsequent films, are reflections of the early 1990s in Dublin.

The plot is quite simple: a group of guys that want to start a band, & all the process of formation, development & division of the band, named The Commitments. Also shows the different aspects on the life of this guys, including the manager, who seems to be the protagonist of the movie (Jimmy Rabbitte). There are great performances like Deco Cuffe, the singer, who sings like the angels but behaves in a very arrogant, stupid & childish way ( Is this guy really a pro singer???), Imelda (gorgeous), Joey ""the lips"" (like an old wolf teaching the younger cubs), etc. Also I have to say that in this movie appears, although in a secondary role, one of the most beautiful women I ever saw: Andrea Corr.

Dublin Soul,"One of the most versatile and promising directors of the '80s, Alan Parker's run of good fortune (Midnight Express, Fame, Pink Floyd The Wall, Birdy, Angel Heart, Mississippi Burning) seemed over when he came out with the mediocre war drama Come See the Paradise in 1990. In 1991, however he had a surprise hit with The Commitments Â which was his first comedy since the bizarre Bugsy Malone in 1976. The Commitments was nearer to home than any of his recent films Â it was about Dublin, while all of his last dramas were decisively American; it also marked the end of his dealing with war and world-level ethical issues in favor of the small lives of working-class men; and also a return to his love of music, which was prominent in his early films Fame and The Wall.The Commitments is not a musical though; and to call it a comedy is also difficult. It is hilarious though, as well as touching, and it has as much a sense of rhythm and groove as the great songs within. It's a small film, certainly Â especially when compared to melodramatic epics like Mississippi Burning and Angel Heart Â a small film about small people, but it's tight, and it's highly enjoyable from start to finish. A wise choice was made in comprising the cast entirely of unknowns (with the exception of the great Colm Meaney in a side-bit as Jimmy Rabbitte's father) and other than Bronagh Gallagher and Angeline Ball none of them had any interest in acting afterward. That makes the characters and the story all the more believable. And that's the main thing that makes The Commitments work so well Â it's entirely believable, and the characters are convincing and true to life. They're all very unique characters in a true and human way, and there are no stars to steal the show. The story is believable too, and the ending avoids the clichÃ©s of similar British comedy-dramas about working class people in creative fields, which have become so popular in recent years Â films like The Full Monty, Billy Elliott and Brassed Off, and manages to be feel-good and yet entirely convincing.The Commitments is not a major and important film like Mississippi Burning, but to all intents and purposes it's a better one. For anyone who loves soul, blues or funk music it's a must Â for any music lover in general, in fact; as well as any lover of English and Irish cinema. Its message may not change the world, but it will stick with you, guaranteed, as will the film. The Commitments is one of the most enjoyable films you'll see, and may be Alan Parker's best creation. An experience not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
What a film,This is one of those films that does it for you. I saw it on the big screen way back in 1991 and I wasn't expecting much and it blew me away. Its a movie that has aged well. Its still great today as it was back then. I'm glad no sequels were ever made cause it wouldn't have the same feel. It's actually the only Alan Parker movie I ever liked. Cause Fame sucks. I'm really surprised that none of the actors were able to sustain the success from this movie and branch out into other roles.

The Group,"A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing and just as one's perception of British cinema would be wildly off the mark if you knew it solely from the films of Joseph Losey, so your perception of Alan Parker would be sorely lacking if you were not acquainted with 'The Commitments'; easily the most engaging and unpretentious film he ever made, which stands in magnificent isolation and probably offers the definitive insight into the creative process, vividly contrasting the chaotic clashes of egos and petty tantrums behind scenes in contrast to the way it all jells the moment they go onstage and start performing.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Craic!,I saw this at the Cinema back in the day and having just watched it again it has stood the test of time. Roddy Doyle is a genius writer and this film based on the first of his Barrytown Trilogy is a joy from start to finish. It's difficult to believe that Andrew Strong was a teenager at the time of release as he looks and sounds like a musical veteran. Robert Arkins is perfect as Jimmy Rabbitte the young Dubliner on a mission to create a soul band from the local youth and Colm Meaney gives a lovely comic turn as his Elvis obsessed father. The soundtrack is fabulous as the film floats along from one comic scene to another interspersed with musical numbers. If you like this film I recommend The Snapper - the second of the Doyle trilogy.

You will give in to its charm,"I have to say, I started off watching The Commitments in a bad mood. I don't know why... maybe it's because of the really dumb comments my film teacher had made about it (he was showing to to the class). He said 'its a film everyone likes, just like Amelie'. It didn't help that I disliked Amelie... A LOT. So I had already started seeing this with low expectations, but it eventually grew on me, and I gave into its charm. The wonderful, BRILLIANT music had me falling for it, and the realism it had while they played. I wouldn't say this film is incredible, but the music made it work completely.

Not the best film about Ireland,"I stumbled on this film during a binge-watching of Irish culture-themed movies.I'm not familiar with the Dublin suburbs of the early 90s but - already from the beginning - the film was giving me the impression to be watching some kind of stereotypical representation of that scenario.The pace is quick but the film goes to nowhere really. 2 hours felt like 3 hours.Some characters are interesting, like the one of the manager Jimmy, but any possibility of expanding their story is constantly interrupted by an inexplicable urgency of buffoonery.And I don't want to say that a film like this shouldn't try to make laugh, what I want to say - and that's something that was described better in another comment - is that it seems like the film tries too hard to amuse, and in a way that's not really pleasant.Probably, If I enjoyed soul as a musical genre I could've found something more in this film. My rating could be biased because of that. Nonetheless, the film doesn't feel well thought out, and it's one of the few movies that I wish I hadn't decided to spend my time into.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"The story of ""every band""","""The Commitments"" tells the story of the dream a group of young people from the working-class in Dublin have to get out of poverty by starting a band. When they start out, they're not too good, but they get progressively better. Also, the tension between them gets progressively worse, and as they get better their egos also grows. The story itself is pretty straight forward, and I'm sure anyone who's ever played in a band can recognise this story. What makes this film so great, is the joy director Alan Parker must have had by telling this story on film. There are many great performances by the young actors, but what struck me the most is how much ""life"" there are in the environments in this film. In every pub, in every street, in every household there are so many things going on and so many details in describing the environment - it brings life to this story. It's easy to describe a poor neighbourhood in a sad way, but in ""The Commitments"" there is hope and there's lot a humour. It is somehow very exaggerated - but it feels real because of the level of detail. And off course - a lot of great music!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
hard tenderness,"Alan Parker is a generous filmmaker, in the sense that he allows himself to merge into the fabric of his themes, to allow the film to have its own life. That's something i wouldn't appreciate in Kar Wai or Welles, whose personal way to bend stories is the very reason why i go to their films. But Parker seems to have his biggest strength in understanding what the film needs, and allowing it to breath. That's a great quality.Here he tackles soul music appropriated by irish workers, and Dublin, as tokens for the irish spirit.The mere quality and expression in the execution of the songs justifies the cult this film as grown around it since it came out. The music is not original, everything we hear are covers of songs for the masters of soul, but the interpretations are so engaging that you can hardly not be driven by them. It worked so well, that a band composed by several actors from this film, performing under the name of the band in the film still has a career today, still performs live gigs.Among all the good things there is to say about the musical performances, i'll mention the lead singer's face. Andrew Strong's voice delivers all the passion necessary for these songs to work. But his face, apparently so unappealing, forms a series of otherworld expressions, shapes, painful phrases coming out of some upper fantastic world. Parker understood it, and that's why he frames it so often when he sings, in close-up. He engages us in ways hard to understand.Of course than we have a funny plot that surrounds the musical moments, but that's a mere support. The music is the main character, not the supporting bits to a central story.Irish jokes and the black soul of America. That has proved a powerful mix. This film deserves credit, it's a fine moment.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Music

The characters are witty and endearing, especially Jimmy's dad who idolizes Elvis (""Elvis is GOD!"") and the gritty, urban guys and girls of the band. Another aspect of the movie I loved was, of course, the soundtrack. Finally, I also found the cast exceptional, especially when my teacher mentioned that only Jimmy was an actual professional ""actor"", the rest of the cast was chosen randomly ""off the streets."" This is probably why the movie had a very authentic feel of the Dublin projects.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One of my top ten favorite movies!,"This movie has SOUL! There's something so true and visceral about the music, message and dialogue of this movie. Its music and the hope of moving upward rings true. Growing up in a working class, white, small town America in the Sixites, rock and roll and soul fueled our dreams and youthful ideals. The voices of Elvis, Orbison, James Brown, and Wilson Pickett spoke for us otherwise quiet, shy types. With our bedroom doors closed and our hi-fi's and radios turned on, we became animated by this music. I sung and danced ""in my room"" and became a worldly, brave person. That same passion enabled many of us poor and blue collar kids to move out and up. A quarter century later, the young people in The Commitments are doing the same thing. Finding passion and voices for their dreams. Each time I watch this movie, my energy is rekindled and I am grateful for life's journey.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Have You Got Soul,"The Commitments is the story of Jimmy Rabitte's quest to assemble a ""true to its roots"" soul based band comprised of working class Ireland's hungry musicians.  Despite the fact that most of his recruits aren't even familiar with soul music, he manages to come up with something quite wonderful. Director Alan Parker (Midnight Express, Mississippi Burning, Pink Floyd: The Wall) manages to do it again in this one.  The story is simple but its the dialogue and the acting that make it so great, (not to mention the soundtrack).  Parker assebled a group of unknowns (Excluding Colm Meaney as Jimmy's Elvis worshiping dad) and when he finished he had a dynamite band that also prove to be able actors as well.  The band is a diverse group of people and their escapades throughout the film are heartfelt yet laughable at times.  Standout performances go to Robert Arkins (""Brother Rabitte""), Johnny Murphy (""Joey The Lips""...and the band's spiritual guide), and Andrew Strong whose incredible voice fronts the band (its hard to believe that voice belongs to a 16 year old).  Strong is essentially a younger Joe Cocker.  The film is never boring, the music is fantasic and the cinematography and direction are excellent.  All in all ""The Commitments"" is is one of those films that you can watch over and over again and not get tired of.  Its just a whole lot of fun.SSB - December 3, 1999 - NYC",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"One of the best movies about ""I have a band""","This movie still be the ""coolest"" movie on the filmography of Alan Parker. A treasure for every musician or anyone who ever tries to form a band with the weirdest people of his neighborhood. The Commitments works. The time treat and turns this movie into a modern classic, because is enormously entertaining and great as a comedy, as a little drama and contemporary musical, and a beautiful tribute for the classic soul.The soundtrack is one of the most brilliant and inspired of the cinema, a review of classic soul, that sounds like pure air in an increasingly boring world and poor musical level.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
One of my personal favourites,"I'm not sure how many times I've watched this movie since I first saw it in 1994, but I watched it again tonight and it was as fresh as it ever was when I first saw it. It's one of those movies that I can watch over and over again without tiring. I can guarantee you that I'll watch this many more times.One reason is obviously the fine directing of Alan Parker. As with ""Mississippi Burning"" and his other films, he has done a wonderful job. But what makes this effort even better than his other films is the fine casting of virtual unknowns. The characters, each and everyone of them, was very genuine and believable. Andrew Strong is simply amazing. The cast did a great job of drawing me into the story, and of course a lot of credit has to go the writing, it was absolutely wonderful.Technically, the film was extraordinary. The Dublin photography was impressive, and the editing was equally as fine. The pace was good, I never grew bored during the movie. Some have criticised the ""live"" concert footage, but considering the locations the band played, it was a perfect fit for the film.It goes without saying the music is the focal point here, and it simply left me slack-jawed. They say you can't wear out a CD. I don't know about that; I'm on my third copy. Oddly enough, after so many viewings, I pick up on something new every time.If there is one video that everyone needs in their collection, The Commitments must surely be considered. 10 out of 10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Poetry,"What's not to like about The Commitments?  An absolutely brilliant film in terms of story, acting and, last but not least, fantastic music.Director Alan Parker delivered a wonderful film with an ensemble cast that give outstanding performances.  Ironically, most of these talented actors weren't actors at all, but rather musicians.  Parker took the brave step of casting singers and musicians in the hope that they could act rather than the other way around.  And the gamble pays off brilliantly.One of the things I like most about The Commitments are the small, non-sequitur moments peppered here and there throughout the film.  Like the boy waiting at an elevator in a highrise tenement holding on to a horse. ""You're not taking that thing in the elevator,"" Jimmy Rabbitte says.  ""Yeah, I have to,"" comes the reply ""The stairs would kill him.""  Like The Snapper, The Commitments is full of real, surreal and beautiful moments.  Mix them together with an outstanding cast and great music and you've got a perfect film.",,Anonymous,Music
Soul Power,"Really a Fun movie to watch.Its got energy, its got laughs â and Soul!Character interactions are Great. There's plenty of rivalry.

Such a fun movie!,"In my book, The Commitments really does get a 10/10! At the risk of sounding like a squealing fan, I really can't think of anything I didn't like about it.The film as a whole is refreshingly free of the clichÃ©s you usually find in movies of this sort - the characters are original, there is no cheesy romantic subplot (THANK you!), no predictable plot twists. It is all tied together into a remarkably light, funny, and ultimately hopeful movie.The music is fabulous as well, and I believe it is actually the actors singing their own songs - they do a wonderful job on both accounts.The Commitments is such a great little movie.

Love this movie - Andrew Strong puts real Soul into the songs,"First, if you're looking to buy this, do not buy the cheaper DVD on Amazon. It is a bootleg from China. This is a movie every music lover should have in their collection. Andrew Strong and crew make better versions than the originals in their covers. It is offbeat and quirky and there's a lot of trivia that may be unfamiliar to USA viewers. It pays to read the trivia notes. The acting is genuine and above par in so many scenes. I was amazed to learn it was a debut for so many of the core characters. The best trivia were 2: Andrew Strong's dad auditioning only for his 16 yr old son to get one of the lead roles and the kid on the skateboard is an older cover album favorite.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Great fun,"I don't say this about many films, but this is truly one that you can watch over and over and over again.  If you have the DVD, I strongly recommend that you watch ""The Making of the Commitments"" first, it gives great background into the film and actors, without much ""spoilage.""  After 8 years of watching this on VHS, I was surprised to find out that Robert Arkins (""Jimmy Rabbitte"") performs vox on the opening title song, ""Treat Her Right.""  I suppose I had read it on the CD, I just had not put 2+2 together.The story is great and superbly acted by this group of then-unknowns, although you may want to take advantage of subtitles if you have trouble with the Northside accent the first time through.  Even then, it may take a few times before you nail down the colloquialisms.  The music, however, is what makes the film great.

But that's not the point.There are so many nice things to say about 'The Commitments' that I can't figure out where to start. All right, it's a funny movie, because of many things, but I'm not going to say more. You know now that you HAVE to SEE 'The Commitments'. Don't just say the second movie is good enough!

Its modesty gives it grandeur,"A relatively simple tale of young people trying to be musicians and how they nearly made it in the city of Dublin turns out a great movie about friendship and the missteps of life. Aided by convincing actors and a very funny script, the premise of soul music played by white people and the obsession of young Jimmy Rabbite to manage a band which fits these parameters is a treat which never wears out, due to a voluntary lack of pretensions from the whole producing team. Made with the simplest budget, shot in the simplest way possible, the films turns out quite surprising, as it really leaves a mark in its viewer with a clever and very good-tasted use of soul music and the powerful voice of Andrew Strong. Johnny Murphy as Joey ""the lips"" Fagan is also a find, and pushes the film forward as well as Robert Arkins' central character. An achievement, this one leaves you actually wanting to view it a second time. Great work on all departments, due in great part to a self-containment policy from the director. A funny film, which stands out from the rest.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
I'm black and I'm proud!,"I think that ""The Commitments"" is definitely one of those feel-good films! I bought the Collector's Edition DVD and I watch this movie about once a month. I just love it because it's hilarious. It's about a group of 20-something year-old, working-class (lower class) Dubliners in the 1990's. Jimmy Rabbitte comes along and gathers them all together to form a soul band, which gives them ""something to look forward to."" I think that the two funniest characters in the entire film are Joey ""the lips"", and Jimmy Rabbite Sr. (Colm Meaney). Joey comes along to play the trumpet for the band and he presents himself as some type of mentor who claims to have jammed with all of the greats. At the end of the film, you still don't quite understand what this man was about, which is very funny. Jimmy Sr. is the father of the band's manager, Jimmy Jr., and he's obsessed with the late Elvis Presley. As he says, ""Elvis is God!""

R&B Like You've Never Heard It Before,"I've always enjoyed Irish movies. This is one of my favorites because it shows so much spirit and determination to succeed in a depraved area. It gave a group of kids something to put their heart and soul into.The Committments was filmed, not in lush greenery but in Dublin, the ""ghetto"" area where a group of struggling Irish youth endeavor to bring their love of R&B music to the public eye. Young Jimmy Rabbitt, the promoter, manager and band leader auditions singers & musicians until he finds the perfect ones for his group. The auditions are hilarious - held in the home of his parents. Jimmy's father is a devout Elvis fan.The practice sessions are typical of new bands learning the music and trying to get along with one another which is not always the case - very realistic. Jimmy manages to secure a has been professional trumpet player who also considers himself a playboy and manages to successfully woo all three girl members of the band.

It is probably the best of contemporary Irish films. One of the great attractions is that there are so few recognised actors in it. Almost all of the main characters were chosen for their musical ability. It's also one of those films that makes you smile.

Once more with gusto,"Alan Parker does it again! Boasting a canon of varied but always high-quality work (Midnight Express, Fame, Mississippi Burning, The Wall),this man, it seems, can't go wrong. The music is, of course, superb. That Parker managed to get together such a bunch of talented unknowns and had them working well enough to launch a number of chart hits is part of his genius.The other part is sheer storytelling ability. Humor abounds  in the film,perhaps a typically Ulsterian brand (""You're working class,aren't you"",one member is asked.""We would be if there was any work"",he replies). There's also some pathos to balance this and,perhaps,a small lesson on the perils of booze,sex & rock'n'roll. Parker and the film won numerous awards,including the Golden Globe and the BAFTA.The film didn't win an Oscar but it certainly isn't unusual for the Academy to overlook quality like this.",,Anonymous,Music
Top Class Film,"This is an absolutely superb film.

Plus the saxophonist with a bad haircut Dean Fay (Felim Gormley) elderly cornetist Joey ""the lips"" Fagan (Johnny Murphy)drummer Billy Mooney (Dick Massey) religious young pianist Steven Clifford and the psychotic Mickah Wallace (Dave Finnegan).But by far the most talented was Deco Cuffe (Andrew Strong). Being only 16 at the time his singing is top notch and he has released 4 solo albums since.There is not a weak link in that cast, but Robert Arkins was the star in my opinion. Clean and concise his delivery and expressions were just sublime. He has never made a film since. this was his perfect film. Apparently he beat a lot more experienced actors for hi part originally auditioning for the bassist and singing. By the way the opening song is him singing.Brilliant direction and a very intelligent transition from book to film. In my top 5 films.

The Commitments  - a band with a mission,"Alan Parkers masterpiece mixes superb acting performances from a largely unknown, but talented cast,(notable exception being Colm Meaney of Star trek and Con Air fame) with a soundtrack that will be in the viewers psyche long after the final credits roll. The Commitments is unique in its subject matter, set against the urban backdrop of Dublin in the 90s, it follows the trials and tribulations of some of the city's more colourful characters, and the efforts of one Jimmy Rabbit (Robert Arkin) to escape the life of monotony by forming and managing a band with ""soul"". Whilst the synopsis might not sound anything extraordinary, the results are truly comical, especially when he auditions for band members. The resultant throng encompasses every musical taste (or lack of it) including one Boy George look alike, and a guy who thought the queue he was in, was to buy drugs. The scriptwriting is right at the top end of the scale, with the cast and crew deserving full marks in breathing life into the characters that make this heartwarming film sparkle. The genius of this film is very subtle, and its clear that a lot of homework was done researching the project before a frame of film was shot. The Commitments is peppered with great one liners, and scene after scene show snapshots of Irish people and their ""real"" lives. There are too many to mention here, but amongst my favourites are the scene where a young lad is standing in a tower-block basement, waiting for the lift with a large horse. When Jimmy Rabbit (who is visiting Bernie the backup singer) exclaims ""your not taking that horse into the lift?"", the lad replies "" I'll have to , the stairs will kill him"" -if you have ever been to Dublin and seen the horses grazing by the roadside, and on every bit of green, you will know that this is not beyond possibility, a fact that makes the scene all the more comical. Another is the band auditions mentioned earlier,and Mr Rabbits (Colm Meaney)obsession with Elvis. The viewer gets a real affinity for the characters right from the outset, and I defy anyone to sit and watch this film without cheering the Commitments on. The musical performances are quite simply superb, and as a band they really deliver the goods, making this a film that you could watch for the musical aspect alone.The directing is slick, the acting is gritty,and so believable by every single cast member, that I could never visit Dublin without looking for Outspan & Derek busking in Grafton Street. All in all,If you like to laugh, and watch a film with characters larger than life that jump off the TV screen, then this films for you -one of my all time top 5 films.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

One of the best,"The most surprising thing about this gem is that the cast have not gone on to film careers. Many of them can hold their own with the overpaid prima donnas we are subjected to ad nauseum in the celebrity magazines and TV shows. Perhaps this film is proof that acting talent is not really necessary in films, it all lies with the director and the film editor! Nevertheless, this film is just hilarious, and can be seen over and over as each viewing reveals something not noticed before. The cast of unknowns is so good that it is hard to pick the best. The most memorable to me was Joe Fagan, who may or may not have been telling the truth about his ""career"". Whether or not he was, he was spinning the line that everyone wanted to hear. There are so many brilliant cameos in this film that it is hard to single out anyone in particular, or the visual touches, such as the picture of the Pope on the wall of the Rabitte household, with Elvis' picture above. I loved also the depiction of the street markets and the clubs. I have this film on VHS and often show it to friends, but now I want the DVD with the ""extras"".

"The Commitments are the Saviors of Soul in their own Dublin, Ireland way","St. Patrick's Day holiday has many meanings. There are a lot of Irish type movies out there. The Commitments are the saviors of soul in their own Dublin, Ireland way. The film and its soundtrack are exceptional, immersing you in the heart of a country during St. Patrick's Day weekend as you search for some soul to accompany your Irish Guinness beer or Irish Whiskey. Whether you're looking for a witty Irish pun or a one-liner for a St. Patrick's Day Instagram caption (Pat Maloney's ""Whether I drink often or just once in a while; I'm always sure to raise a glass to the dear old Emerald Isle"" fits the bill), or something more serious to share with your children (like the old Irish blessing, ""May your blessings outnumber the shamrocks that grow""), there's something in the movies for just about every Irish occasion. Don't forget to pair a great Irish movie with meat pie, soda bread and a green cocktail or two! ""The Commitments"" is a hilarious, musical, and occasionally poignant film that depicts the turbulent journey of a Dublin Soul band's rise and fall. Managed by Jimmy Rabbitte, an unemployed wheeler and dealer with a vision to create ""The World's Hardest Working Band "". Jimmy Rabbitte, tired of the music scene in Ireland, formed a soul band in the style of Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, and Aretha Franklin. He handpicked a talented group of young white musicians from the working-class neighborhoods of Dublin, Ireland. Most of the young actors in the film had little experience but were chosen based on their musical backgrounds and how closely they resembled the characters in the novel. The movie led to the release of two soundtrack albums. The first album reached #8 on the Billboard 200 chart and received triple-platinum certification, while the second album achieved gold sales status. The Commitments have achieved a cult following and are considered one of the greatest Irish movies ever produced.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Fame"" meets Ken Loach","""The Commitments"" (1991) is the first episode of the so called ""Barrytown trilogy"". This trilogy consists of three films situated in a Dublin working class environment. The other episodes are ""The snapper"" (1993) and ""The van"" (1995). ""The Commitments"" is directed by Alan Parker, the other two episodes are directed by Stephen Frears.Reviewing ""Mississippi burning"" (1988, Alan Parker) I already noticed that the oeuvre of Alan Parker can be divided into films showing social engagement (for example ""Mississippi burning"" about racism in the South of the USA) and films primarily for entertainment (for example ""Fame"" (1980)).""The Commitments"" definitely falls into the second category, being a film about the ups and downs of a starting popband in Dublin. On closer inspection however this is not wholly true. In fact ""The Commitments"" is sort of ""Fame"" meets Ken Loach.Like in ""Fame"" we meet people ambitious to reach the top. Unlike ""Fame"" the characters from ""The Commitments"" do not have the alternative career opportinities the students of the New York high school for the performing arts do have. They are from the North of Dublin and as a quote from the film says: ""The Irish are the blacks of Europe. And Dubliners are the blacks of Ireland. And the Northside Dubliners are the blacks of Dublin."". In a moving scene the manager of the band wants to fire one of the three female backing singers after she has failed to appear on a couple of rehearsals. When he arrives at her home he finds out that she is assisting her overloaded mother in caring for a big family and the band is the only relaxation she has.The resemblance with Ken Loach is the fact that we are dealing with the underprivilied of society. The difference with the typical Ken Loach character is that the characters in ""The Commitments"" are young and have not (yet) resigned to their defeat. When the band starts to have some success, the tension between the members quickly rises because everybody wants to be the star.The cast of ""The Commitments"" consists mainly of non professional actors. When the film became a success real life started to imitate the storyline, all the non professional actors believing they could become real filmstars.Needless to say that ""The Commitments"" has a terrific soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not taxing, but joyful.","The Commitments (1991) -I'm not saying that when I first watched this film I realised that I loved soul music, because I had known all the songs beforehand or had at least heard them at some point in my life, but I think that it would be fair to say that this film and its leading actors, with their outstanding vocal deliveries, went some way towards my finding soul in a more permanent way, not just as an occasional song on the radio that I recognised from a Bounty advert, but as an absolute pleasure to listen to and a joyous combination of music.Years later I would seek out the majority of the songs featured on CD's and many of them have remained staples on my iTunes playlist.So no matter what could be said about some of the production values, lighting, sound or the odd bad line delivery by a supporting artist, there was no way that anyone could deny that right from the start the film had chosen the best songs to provide a cracking soundtrack.What heightened that was the group of actors/singers that they got to perform in the passionate and fun roles.Another thing that couldn't be denied was Deco's (Andrew Strong) outstanding voice. It just fit so well with the music and in some ways it was a joy to watch him perform the songs with such obvious relish and enthusiasm. It was just a shame that he had a touch of the Rik Waller's about him, with very little 'X Factor (2004-24) and his general persona was not so appealing.The girls had great voices too and nobody in the cast really played a bad part. I loved the attitudes of them all with their dry wit and sarcastic ways, but in particular I liked Jimmy (Robert Arkins). Although he was a bit of a caricature of an Irish lad, in a way that might have been seen on an advert for milk or something similar, I really enjoyed his role and the way that he delivered it with humour that wasn't forced, but was very dry.I was glad that they didn't go for Bob Hoskins or any other big name to play the character of Joey ""The Lips"" (Johnny Murphy) as was stated in the IMDB trivia though, because, as much as I have loved Bob in everything he has done, I think his presence in that role would have overshadowed the rest of the cast, which really wasn't the point of it.It was a simple good humoured film about putting a band together and the struggles that go with it all, but it was definitely an ensemble piece, that seemed to deliberately utilise fresh and slightly rough, unknown actors to get an interestingly brassy, but not too harsh result. Yes there were fallings out amongst the band, but it didn't delve too far in to the fractious relationships until the end really. They could have had secondary romances and financial trouble side stories that would have fleshed it out, but probably made it drag too, but they kept it succinct moving the main story of the bands progress along nicely. For me it was all about the band as a whole and using the story to showcase that great playlist.Having been to many performances by a band called ""Joey The Lips"" I can safely say that it's almost impossible to not enjoy those soul songs and even harder not to at least tap your feet along with them.I felt that this one could have been an inspiration for films like 'The Full Monty' (1997), 'Brassed Off' (1996), 'Billy Elliot' (2000) and even 'Four Weddings And A Funeral' (1994) for the way that they were all filmed with a hope and yet still quite gritty, before the more polished stories like 'Calendar Girls' (2003) and 'Fishermen's Friends' (2019) took over, set in posher, more friendly areas and atmospheres.And possibly this film took its own inspiration from 'The Blues Brothers' (1980) although slightly toned down on the comedic car chase scenes.Overall this was a highly enjoyable film to watch, almost more like a concert than a narrative story, but still with a tale that had more than a few laughs.829.91/1000.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"""God sent him."" ""-...On a f****n' suzuki?!""","Well, there's not much else I can add to what's already been said. A great Irish film that shows that there's more to Ireland than the famine and green fields and the troubles in the north(although I'm not saying these aren't important,well maybe not the green fields). The cast is excellent, particularly Andrew Strong who still cracks me up with his facial expressions and, of course, Mickah 'dont f**k with me' Wallace with that memorable headbutt scene.The music is also superb, as are Jimmy Rabbitte's speeches about it; this film actually got me interested in 60's soul music. Although the economic situation in Ireland has improved a lot since 1991 (as, thankfully,has the fashion), the rest of the film hasn't dated one bit.All in all, an underrated masterpiece, even better than the book!",,Anonymous,Music
"""I'm sorry you doubt me, Brother Rabbitte.""","If there was no other reason to watch this film, you could still watch it for the music. The band is superb, and would be worth the price of admission (or rental) alone. It'll have you dancing in front of your telly. No question.Fortunately though, there's plenty of other reasons to see it, such as... (deep breath) the snappy, witty dialogue, the wonderful performances (musical and otherwise), the warm but insightful writing, the tremendously powerful direction, the brilliant chemistry of the actors in the band etc, etc, etc...This is one hell of a film.Also, i don't know if Joey ""The Lips"" Fagin was lying through his teeth about the rest of his exploits, but he could play the trumpet, couldn't he?",,Anonymous,Music
"By god, this movie is amazing","Just watch this movie. Just watch it and I dare you not to like it. I would call it the world's greatest band movie. Please follow me people, I know my thoughts are jumbled and majorly eclectic, but follow me. It is a wonderful journey through a bands ups and downs. And the set of pipes Andrew Strong has, OH GOOD LORD! The music is amazing and Jimmy Rabbitte is such a great character. I love it. By god, I love it! Just watch it and you'll see.

Music to escape from a narrow world,"The simple plot of this movie ( the rise to success of a group of Dublin working-class soul musicians, and their consequent decline, owing to petty, trivial inner quarrels) is just a pretext for a vivid, effective picture of Dublin life. The outlook on that part of society aims mainly to explore the wish, among the young generations, to escape from a narrow-minded world, from squalid urban suburbs, from unemployment, from a reality which has nothing to offer them: lacking any prospects for the future, young people own low expectations and narrow horizons (Joey's final sentence to Jimmy summarizes efficaciously this mood: ""the success of the band was irrelevantÂyou raised their expectations, you lifted their horizonsÂthis is poetry""). The forced urbanization, in a country of rural traditions, has produced paradoxical effects: a little boy tries insistently to enter a horse in a lift; the music critic (who also writes crime news) is met while reporting an accident occurred to another horse in the road traffic. Parents are unsympathetic as they have different values (on the wall in Jimmy's home there are pictures of Elvis Presley and  Pope Giovanni XXIII), or they are simply struggling to get by (Bernie's mother). The heavy influence of the Catholic Church is shown throughout all the movie: Steven practises on the organ of the Church; the first gig of the group is in the Church Community Centre; sacred images, processions, confessionals, recur in the scenes underlining the constant presence of religion in people's daily life. Another feature which is pointed out is the young people's moral behaviour: an unexpected moralism lurks among boys that do their best to be ""transgressive"" but run into gossip and heavy malignity when a girl seems to be involved in a love affair (Bernie with Joey, or Imelda seen on Joey's motor-cycle). Pregnancy, however, seems to be the obvious cause of great part of marriages: both Imelda's sister's wedding, which opens the film, and the one of Imelda herself, in the end, happen for this reason; at her sister's wedding party, at the sentence: ""I suppose you'll be next"" she answers ""I'm not pregnant"". Not yet. Dangers such drug and street violence are taken into account too, but are developed in a non-dramatic way, with an ironical outlook, in the characters of Duffy, the drug-dealer who also rents music gear, probably stolen, and of Mickah Wallace ""the savage"" who loves fighting in the street, but fears the reproach of his friends' mothers. To be recommended to teachers dealing with Ireland present life: it's better than a textbook.",,Anonymous,Music
The Greatest Irish Band That Never Was!!!,"The Commitments is an entertaining and very good movie about a man who wants to start an Irish soul band. He eventually recruits a full band with back-up singers that is pretty good. It shows their formation and overcoming obstacles and petty jealousies only to fall apart as they are about to possibly hit the big time. While the story sounds like a kind of tragedy it is well done, entertaining, funny,  and very different. Colm Meaney is excellent as the father of the band manager Jimmy Rabbite, who idolized Elvis even above the Pope and possible even with God.The band is filled with characters ranging from boars, nitpickers, hotheads,bitchy attitudes and just average people who love music. The most heartwarming part of the whole movie was where they were riding the bus and all singing Destination Anywhere. They were never closer, except for a few times on stage as a band.Even the lead singer wanted to hog the spotlight and become an even bigger prick than he was. The whole cast as well as the story was excellent. This has to be one of the better movie soundtracks to come out of a movie ever.As it is, this movie is worth just a look for the music alone. Fortunately, there is a pretty damn good story to match the soundtrack. The Commitments is a sure a helluva lot better than the Irish Rovers as a band.",,Anonymous,Music
Watch this movie if you want to laugh.,"This movie, the first of three based on novels by and written by Roddy Doyle, is a hilarious look at one man's attempt to make the ""hardest working band in Ireland.""  Following Jimmy Rabbitte, perfectly played by Robert Arkins, and his earnest attempt at creating the next big deal, the film catches the ups and downs of these 11 Dubliners and the surprisingly great band they form.    The musical performances are wonderful and do an honor to the history of soul, and are by the actors themselves, a bonus to their appropriate performances.  Directed by Alan Parker, whose work with previous musical films, namely Fame, certainly helps here.  The writing is certainly not for kids, and might offend a few, but odds are they wouldn't pick this movie anyway.  Definitely the lightest of the three films written by Doyle (The Snapper and The Van completing the quasi-trilogy), odds are everyone will find something to like about this flick (or at least they should). I'm still waiting for Arkins and Andrew Young to show up in another film.  Also watch for a hilarious performance by Johnny Murphy as Joey the Lips, and a subtle performance by Maria Doyle Kennedy that keeps things going in the right direction.  If you haven't seen it yet, go watch this movie to put yourself in a good mood.  If you have seen it, go watch it again.",,Anonymous,Music
Awesome!,"For any band that is just starting out, this is a good movie for you  to see.  It shows the ups and downs of the music business. It is brilliant, great cast! The songs are amazing and if you know of the group The Corrs, which are from Ireland, you can see what they looked like in their early years.  Andrea has the biggest role of all the Corrs, but if you look carefully you can find the rest!",,Anonymous,Music
Bronagh Gallagher: what a face.,"I remember well the (MTV) hype surrounding TC. One would have thought that Jesus wrote and directed this movie, the way it was pushed by the media, the video clip having been played incessantly by every music programme/channel. Fact is, it's a decent little movie, but absolutely nothing special - especially if you get headaches, the way I do, when exposed to more than 3 seconds of so-called ""soul"" music. (Is it called that way because it kills the soul?)There are obvious similarities to Parker's earlier ""Fame"". The one that sticks out the most is how adamant Parker must have been in picking out an ugly bunch (with very few exceptions) once again. (It's the old ""ugly people = realism"" credo.) Still, no need to panic: the cast of TC is not nearly as visually unappealing as the one in ""Fame"". However, unlike ""Fame"", which gets serious occasionally, this Irish-based rags-to-almost-riches story can be classified as a comedy. A comedy musical, alas. The second half features far too many musical numbers, and they drag on for too long. As I said, ""soul"" can be rather migraine-inducing; it is rather simplistic, unimaginative, lowest-common-denominator music, designed to please the true tone-deaf non-connoisseurs among music fans. Andrew Strong may have a great voice for this dull style, but whenever a (white) guy tries to imitate the annoying throat-barks of James Brown, or that overrated bore Joe Cocker, I am overcome with an urge to throw things at whatever the source of the sound may be. Strong is also the funniest cast member.If it's true that Parker picked out only non-actors for the band, then hats off to him, because there is nothing wrong with the acting; there is very little to indicate that all these people were amateurs. That, naturally, also brings us to the distinct possibility that basically anyone can act - given the right director. The bleedin' obvious, of course...There aren't any true laugh-out-loud moments, but the gags don't totally bomb, either. TC is basically interesting rather than funny.One of the things I liked is that musicians and singers are portrayed as the true morons they (mostly) are in real life.As far as Bronagh is concerned: if you've never seen her, just try to visualize the name ""BRONAGH"" and you might come close to imagining her face. It's no wonder Lucas had her killed off within minutes of the start of ""Phantom Menace"".Why is one of the Corr sisters in the movie, but without a singing part?",,Anonymous,Music
A dismally boring film,"This film is about a bunch of deprived people in a slum area forming a band. They hope to make it big with their soul music.I find ""The Commitments"" tedious and boring. The characters engage in endless tirade, shouting profanities at each other constantly. The way they treat each other is simply sad. The clothes they wear are all dismally coloured. Furthermore, the film is set in a deprived area, meaning unattractive sets and locations. All these things make the film unattractive to me. It is made worse by the poor lighting. Many scenes are poorly lit. A scene featuring the tour bus going down the road is a prime example. The cameraman obviously focused on the sky, making the road, houses and the bus very dark.""The Commitments"" sounds like an uplifting film with heart and soul. But I was wrong. It is dismal, hostile and unlikable.",,Anonymous,Music
English VErsion of Plot Summary,"Jimmy Rabbitte Jr., who lives on small gimmicks in a proletarian district of Dublin, has put her mind to organize a musical band for greening the glories of rhythm blues and soul &. Thanks to an ad in the newspaper, Rabbitte Jr. begins to select young people from precarious work but full of talent: Dean, Fay, 595, the bespectacled Steven Clifford, Deco, the fat one without good manners but with a great voice, Billy drummer and Joey ""The lips"", a bizarre and mature senior trumpet player who prides himself on having played with famous soul singers. Aggregates also Natalie, Imelda and Bernie, three plucky girls, excellent singers and very sexy. Procuratisi on credit instruments, begin trials, exhausting, that engage everyone. He began playing in public, in sheds and social festivities: the Group seems pervaded by music fire and ambition. The band, though amateurish and provincial, looks towards the Summit launched and ends in failure: friction, jealousies and small human and artistic disagreements, the Group flaking. Jimmy's dream evaporates into thin air and that great wealth of energy and skill that could yield money and success: siPL dissipates into nothingness.",,Anonymous,Music

Where are they now?,"After pursuing this movie for years, I finally got to watch it! It is a brilliant piece of work about ordinary people with extraordinary talents. I reckon the plot line is rather monotonous but it has full heart and soul. The ending was rather bittersweet coz you'd like to think that a group of such brilliant musicians and singers would make it somehow but it would've been too cliched. I read somewhere that most of the actors are not even actors by profession and it doesn't even show - they all acted well. Not Oscar worthy but well enough for a musical. I could really kick myself for not watching this movie sooner but ah well, better late than never. Now, I wonder if I could actually get to see The Commitments in concert.",,Anonymous,Music
How It Really Is...,"Speaking as someone who has friends/acquaintances in a couple of bands, and other friends who publish a local music magazine and/or run an independent CD label, i can't say enough good things about the accuracy(and sympathy) with which this film portrays such people.The fact that the musicians are portrayed by actual musicians, rather than the producers having hired actors and taught them to fake it, is so unusual for films that it took me a while to realise that the performances were actual, filmed-on-the-fly performances, and not miming to pre-recorded tracks.The various members of The Commitments see the band as a way out of the horrible socio-economic conditions in which they find themselves (""Mr. Rabbitte, you've been drawing unemployment for three years; are you *sure* you can't find a job?"" ""Let's face it, Missus, we're living in a third-world country..."").  The scene in which the normally-sardonic Bernie, seen in the tiny apartment she shares with three generations of her family, breaks down and pleads with Jimmie not to kick her out of the band because she's had to be absent, caring for her sister's child, confessing that she sees no other way out, is both telling and poignant.A line from another film -- ""O Lucky Man!"" -- always comes to mind when i watch ""The Commitments""; when Mick Travis [Malcolm MacDowell] meets Alan Price and his band he says ""Musicians -- are you rich, then?"" and Price replies ""No -- but me manager is..."" Poor Jimmie Rabbitte doesn't even manage to get rich as a manager (though the Afterword-type scenes imply he's doing fairly well); he's too devoted to the music to really sell (and sell out) his friends the musicians.As another reviewer has said; this is one film (and associated soundtrack CD) that belong in the collection of anyone with the slightest interest in music, even if you don't -- normally -- go for soul music.I need to hunt up the DVD; all i have so far is the VHS.Five out of Five -- or Ten out of Ten -- or whatever",,Anonymous,Music
"Excellent, funny, great music",Robert Arkins gets an idea to form a soul band in his home town in Dublin. He finds an unlikely but talented group. Andrew Strong is an arrogant singer and Johnny Murphy is an aging trumpet player who lies his way into leading the band. They call themselves the Commitments and rehearse and after a few gigs get very good reviews. But as with all bands they start in-fighting and Arkins does his best to keep them together.The plot is simple but this is an excellent small film. It not only has great soul music but the characters are all interesting and you get a real sense of life in this area of Dublin from home life to nightlife.If you like music you'll love this film. Ably directed by Alan Parker who also made Fame and the Pink Floyd The Wall movies. He knows how to make movies about music.,,Anonymous,Music
"As a musician, I have lived this film...","Anyone who has ever played in a band can identify with this film. I recommend it to every one I know who has even the slightest interest in performing or has had doubts about how their carrier is going. The feeling you get when everything finally clicks is a big part of what it's like to be a performer and this film is right on the money. I've watched this film over ten times since it was released and the sound track rides with me from gig to gig. This is as real as it gets and the music being performed live is great. I'm still playing today. And no, it hasn't changed much at all. There is something to say for any band that sticks together. I've played in dozens of bands starting with The ""Doo Wop"" vocal groups in the Bronx to the circuit of church halls we played in New Zealand prior to a club opening up in 1964 where you could have a real stage and lights (such as they were) Anyone who is even thinking of joining a band should see this movie. Anyone who wants to have a real good time and meet some great people should see this movie. ""Long live The Commitments""",,Anonymous,Music
