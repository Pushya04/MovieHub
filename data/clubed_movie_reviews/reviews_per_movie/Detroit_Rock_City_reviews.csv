Fun concert adventure,"Being that the story is about kids who want to go to see their favourite band, you know that in the end they will somehow get to see the show.  It's a question if you enjoy the ride to get there.  And I did.Although being a teen comedy (which always means an obligatory puke scene), and some physical comedy which was a little distracting, this film was just fun.  The film works cause everyone can think back to the days in high school when you worshiped a band, played their music, and would DIE to see them play live, and this film captures that feeling perfectly.  It also captures the era perfectly with the music, cars, good soundtrack, and the pot shots at of course... disco (Did you see those SHOES the disco chicks were wearing??).  And of course it was VERY funny in places (I thought my jam sessions were bad...).Also the film had me guessing as to what would happen, sometimes I thought it was predictable, then it switched gears and surprised me, particularly the ending which was so perfectly sweet!!  Perfect music high school camradare done wonderfully.  Even though I am not a fan of KISS, everyone can think back to the time when your fav band was your TRUE means of salvation.Rating 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie rocks!,"I really don't see why this movie tanked and why it is hated by many.  Maybe its poor box office performance was due partly to its R-rating, being that it appeals to a predominantly teenage demographic.  But I found it to be funny, entertaining and downright awesome!This is not a nostalgic piece.  Other than the music, this film's characters seemed to be fished out of contemporary society.  So the older viewers might not enjoy it QUITE as much.  I have to say, my only disappointment was that Kiss only got to perform once, at the very end.  Other than that, this is just a wildly funny comic ride with good performances from the main cast, as well as the supporting--Lin Shaye stands out as the ultra-protective, Bible-toting, chain-smoking mother who regards Kiss as ""Knights in Satan's Service.""  Joe Flaherty, of SCTV fame, also has a funny cameo.What can I say?  I laughed a lot.  I bobbed my head to the music.  I had fun.  That pretty much does it for me.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Detroit Rock City ?.............  Awesome !!!,"This movie was great,funny,cool,realistic and entertaining The Story of four teens who play in a KISS cover band who got tickets to go see KISS in Detroit, but a series of unfortunate events stop them from going to see the concert,and they don't stop at nothing to get all the way to Detroit for the Show of their lives.The Best thing about this movie is that the characters are believable, they are exactly what you would expect, and they act exactly like normal teenagers would in the late 70', in most teen movies you see the usual clich√©'s, but not here.All in all this movie is very entertaining, you never get bored, and the movie really puts you in these guys shoes and feel just like they would in that type of situation.Plus the movie is filled with an awesome soundtrack, with bands like AC/DC, Van Halen and of course KISS who also appear in the film.So my advice to you (if you like good ol Rock n' Roll and Fun movies) is to rent Detroit Rock City invite some friends and Have a great Time.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hilarious, and Not Just For Kiss Fans","I was a huge KISS fan for much of my teenage life (finally seeing the original band on their 1996 Reunion Tour was one of the highlights of my life, as I was too young to witness them in their '70s heyday), so DETROIT ROCK CITY was mandatory viewing for me when it first hit video. I would've loved to have seen it during its short theatrical run, but sadly, this overlooked movie tanked at the box office and disappeared within a week of its release, which astounds me to this day, because even if you're not a KISS fan, any rock and roller past or present should be able to relate to this story of musical fanaticism, no matter what band(s) you might be into.The film does share many similarities to an earlier classic, 1979's ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL (starring the Ramones), but thanks to the more liberal time period in which it was made, DETROIT ROCK CITY is a lot more foul-mouthed and raunchier, which may have cost the producers a PG-13 rating, but it just fine by me... after all, real high school kids don't say ""darn"" and ""heck,"" they spew the F-Word liberally into every sentence! Anyway, our story revolves around four high school misfits circa 1978 whose main goal in life (other than playing bad covers of KISS songs in their basement rec room) is to finally see KISS live in concert at Detroit's Cobo Hall arena. When one boy's fundamentalist Mom discovers the ""demonic"" concert tickets in her son's jacket and burns them, it sets the four friends on a quest to figure out how to get into the concert at all costs, and they set a hilarious series of misadventures in motion along the way. In no particular order, the boys run afoul of a gang of disco-loving toughs on the highway, get mixed up in the middle of a convenience store robbery (thwarted by a Stretch Armstrong doll!), take the stage in a male strip joint to win money for tickets, get their car towed from the mean streets of Detroit, and rescue one of their own from a Christian boy's school. The film's eye candy quotient is filled very nicely by a cameo from Shannon Tweed (real-life companion of Kiss' Gene Simmons), and there's even a tender moment of teenage romance as one boy loses his virginity (in a church's confessional no less!). All this madness is set to an irresistible hard-rockin' soundtrack that features not only Kiss but other 70s titans like Blue Oyster Cult and Ted Nugent. Do the boys finally make it to Cobo Hall to see their heroes? I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, therefore I highly recommend that you check out this overlooked comedy gem. DETROIT ROCK CITY is a hysterical trip down memory lane for anyone who's ever cranked up their favorite song extremely LOUD...and as Kiss themselves once said, if it's too loud,you're too old. Thankfully I'm not too old to enjoy this movie!!",,Anonymous,Music
4 kids do ANYTHING for KISS tickets in 1978,Hilarious...not a brainy or brilliant picture but it carries some off-the-wall moments that make it all worthwhile. The dialogue is unflinchingly crude and certain scenes will just catch you off-guard...definately worth your time. Don't worry if you aren't into KISS...it's more about their journey TO the concert.,7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Silly, but fun!","I thought this movie was fairly entertaining, the performances were good,especially Edward Furlong and Sam Huntington, although the character of Jam's mum was a little overdone. I thought the soundtrack to the movie was good also, it added to the film. I found myself comparing this movie to 'American Pie', due to its physical humour. I was surprised this movie didn't receive that much exposure and publicity. Overall an enjoyable 80 or so minutes at the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Detroit Rock City rocks!,"My summary says it all. This movie did rock! It had funny characters, a funny story and an awesome soundtrack, especially Van Halen's Runnin' with the Devil.The story is set in Cleveland, 1978. Four boys, Hawk, Jam, Lex and Trip who are part of a rock band named Mystery which is modeled after their favorite band, KISS. They bought tickets to see them and go on a road trip to Detroit and get into many misadventures dealing with an angry mother, some tough jocks, some disco freaks, a stolen car and an attempt to win money.This movie was Eddie Furlong's second best(T2 was the first) and it was a takeoff for the other guys. The only thing I would've changed was the mood, it seemed just a little dark for my taste but it was still an awesome movie. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Let's hope it will stay the last KISS-Film. Can't improve perfection,"KISS isn't known to be the most giving band in the world. Sure, you get your money's worth, but don't expect anything more or something like a free autograph or a ""hi, how are u doing"" from the last remaining original members without taking out your wallet first. That seems particularly true these days, where the band still produces tours and albums on the sole premise that most fans are completists, who cannot suffer holes in their collections. So, ""Detroit Rock City"" was one of the last few cases where the fan had the feeling that this was produced by band & fans for fans and not only for cash.Sure, I had rooted for this film when it came out and sure, as a kid I had my room plastered with KISS-posters, wore KISS-Make-Up during Halloween and religiously bought most things that bore the distinct logo (despite the design being altered in Germany, because it resembled the SS-Runes a little too close, suggesting that Mr. Chaim Wietz and Mr. Stanley Eisen were Nazis). Got my dad to smuggle me into ""Runaway"", despite being a few years short of admission (and I didn't want to go see this film because I'm fond of Tom Selleck). Thinking of it, my parents probably bought Gene Simmons a new Cadillac, despite nowadays I'd hope that this money went into the pockets of either Ace Frehley or Peter Criss.By the time ""Detroit Rock City"" hit the cinema, it had pretty much been clear to even the hardened fan, that 90 percent apart from the music was hype and that the two founding members had begun to view their band more of a cash-milking-cow rather than a vehicle to transport good music. But why drop a lifelong habit? Like Richard Linklaters ""Dazed and Confused"", Adam Rifkin was able to capture the feel and air of the time ""When KISS ruled the world"", which is only one aspect that makes the film work. Though by the time I was old enough to get into the concerts KISS had already taken off their iconic make-up, one could really get a feel of what the great KISSteria must have been like. Then there is the humour: I'm not easily moved to laugh tears at slapstick, but I have to admit that a heartily laughed more than once. The priest and the mushroom-pizza, the clash between KISS-Fans and Disco-Guidos or the Hawk stripping for cash, it all made me crack up. As a bonus, there are plenty of KISS Insider-jokes, from the names of the protagonists to the dialogue; it should be abundantly clear: Adam Rifkin knows his KISS.When talking to the fans, the issue of a sequel would invariably come up. Despite still being a fan-boy deep inside, rationality keeps saying that this just wouldn't work ‚Äì as little as KISS worked after 1982. What would people like to see? Our four protagonists being in college and moaning the fact that KISS has degenerated into a run-of-the-mill Glam band during the 80's? Having settled down to a blue-collar-existence and taking their kids to see the KISS-reunion in the 90's or having to witness the gold-digging sham that KISS has degenerated to in recent years? No, it's good that ""Detroit Rock City"" is (and will likely remain) a one-time-thing ‚Äì could be a lesson there for Simmons and Stanley.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Best Comedy I have seen in a long time!,"I saw this film last night and I have to say, it is the best comedy I have seen since The Dictator.I love how everything is so simply put together. The story, characters, music score, scenes, actors and humor. It is all put together so well. Edward Furlong and all of the other actors were excellent in their roles.I laughed most of the time when the boys caused accidental trouble on the road or at the concert.There's really not much to say about this film because I love it so much. What I can say is that if you love the actors who portray the four boys, KISS, the plot where they are determined to get into a concert and never give up, and stereotypical kids getting high and drunk, having sex and loving to rock hard to KISS music, this film is definitely for you. I know it was for me! MEGA 10/10 film right here!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Fun to begin with, less so later on","I enjoyed the set up for this movie more than the delivery.  Most of the slapstick is very funny but there is less of it as the movie progresses. All the acting is great, especially by Edward Furlong.  I was in high school in 1978 and I saw a KISS concert so it brought back some memories and songs I have not heard for awhile.  There are other artists on the soundtrack, for those of you so inclined.  I enjoyed the movie but it was no big deal.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Who writes that stuff?,"I am a Kiss fan, have been since 1974.  I know how to play every song on my guitar and they were my main reason for wanting to pick one up.  I've stood by them through thick and thick all those years ago, even in the early 80's when they were going nowhere here in the states.But this movie... (and I love movies!) it's a nightmare and embarrassment to see.  I went to the theatre to see it and walked out afterwards, I was lucky, no one saw me leaving.  I bought the DVD.  Gene talks about himself as usual and promotes upcoming toys and ventures that he's working on.  I know he likes himself, but WOW!There are some funny bits in the movie, Furlong is on the giving end of those.  His bit in the nightclub is very good.  The rest of the cast is just over doing it to the point of going out of charachtor.It's good to see Joe Flarety in a small role.  Shannon Tweed is sexy as ever and so is The Hedgehog himself: Rockin' Ron Jeremy!The film has it's good spots but they are far and few in between.  I know some over obsessed fans like the ""Trip"" fella.  They need help.  It's good to rock and roll all nite, but some people take it too far.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone cause it's a fan's only movie.  There aren't many of us left either.  I hope the next movie about the band (there's supposed to be a movie about the begining of the band's existance) is done with some respect to the fans.This was worse than the teenage sex romps that are the rage nowadays.

Calling Dr. Love,"""Detroit Rock City""Darth Maul, Austin Powers, Tarzan, John Travolta, Julia Roberts, Cartman, James West, and killer sharks... What else would summer 1999 require? KISS. That's what we need. With all the teenager movies stinking up the multiplexes recently, the only relief is a film featuring the Knights In Satan's Service. Recalling ""Dazed And Confused"" and channeling ""Rock N' Roll High School"", ""Detroit Rock City"" is a heaping portion of good fun. Filled to the brim with energy and acted by a cast of clever actors who probably can't even shave yet, this new music-packed comedy might just be what the doctor (Dr. Love, that is) ordered.KISS fans might not be too happy to hear that the band isn't in the film for more than 5 minutes. Director Adam Rifkin (""The Chase"" and the pathetically forced ""Dark Backward"") and writer Carl V. Dupre have made a film not about KISS, but about four teenagers from 1978 Cleveland who drive to Detroit to see the band in concert. Everything from religiously fanatic mothers (The great Lin Shaye), to money-stealing bullies, and even some Disco lowlifes try to stop our heroes as they trek to see the world's greatest band. Once in Detroit, the friends split up to find opportunities to scam their way into the show. It is also in Detroit where each teen learns a very important lesson about life, and just how much KISS rocks.Leading the group is Edward Furlong. Last seen in John Waters's ""Pecker"", Furlong has opened up greatly in the past couple of films. In ""Detroit"", Furlong gives his best performance to date. I've never seen him so loose on-screen before. Working with James DeBello, Giuseppe Andrews, and probably the most expressive teenage actor working today, Sam Huntington, they each deliver just the right amount of teenage apathy, yet make each one of their characters endearing to the audience. It's enormous fun to watch them on-screen together. You don't come around such a young cast that works so well together too often. Other players include the eternal vamp Shannon Tweed, Natasha Lyonne(""Slums Of Beverly Hills"") in yet another role that cannot seem to tap into her talents as much as I would like to see, and even a girl fittingly named Beth played by the wonderful Melanie Lynskey(""Heavenly Creatures""),It's quite obvious from the brilliant opening credits that Director Rifkin is out to have some fun. He brings back the 1970's with wonderful widescreen lensing, a dab of split-screen, and a soundtrack crammed with classic rock hits. One after another, the music fills each scene with such vibrant energy. After getting so used to the pre-packaged soundtracks that frequently don't have anything to do with the movies that feature them, it's refreshing to see film and sound live in holy matrimony for once.The camera swings and moves with alarming speed. The colors pop and squeak. The era is evoked gently and without(much) sarcasm. ""Detroit Rock City"" is one of the few films that seems to be the product of genuine love for the era and the music. It's a bright film with an enormous amount of good will. Whatever Rifkin has forced upon us before has now been forgotten.If I had to make once complaint about ""Detroit"", it's the typical use of drama to justify the movie. You've seen it time and again, the film you love crashing to a halt so the lead character can make some death-to-the-ears speech about freedom, love, or any other mundane belief. It never ceases to stop any film, and it brings the kinetic ""Detroit"" to it's knees for about 5 minutes. The picture is bright enough to not have to include any dramatic weight whatsoever. It's seems like a screenplay conceit, and probably is. Yet another film that's too self-conscious to really kick back and fire on all cylinders.New Line cut a great trailer for this film. The ""Mad"" magazine-style poster was also a genius choice. ""Detroit Rock City"" is silly and sometimes childish, but it never stoops to the constipated laughs of ""American Pie"" or the plain ugliness of other similar ""boy"" intensive teenage comedies. ""Detroit"" is often sharp, always silly, slightly tasteless, but a seriously rocking late summer film that makes up for the usual garbage that litters August. You wanted the best, you got the best.--------- 9/10",,Anonymous,Music
Rockin' comedy about 4 relentless KISS fans.,"This movie hits home for me as I can completely relate to the characters' determined and passionate desire to go see their favourite band in the whole world. With tough perserverance, they manage to fight every obstacle in their way, tenaciously. Edward Furlong is a vehicle for nostalgia to me. There's something about him that simply irradiates happiness in my way, and he's great in this, so are the rest of the boys, each and everyone get their own moments in the movie, which is important in order to let everyone's own setbacks be resolved according to each character's personality. Lyn Shaye shines as an overbearing and autocratic mother who is tryin' to control her son in every possible aspect.Well, as the boys get on their way to the best night of their lives, chaos ensues.

Dazed and Confused (kiss version),"I bought this film to see a movie where Rock is a Major theme. I love rock and roll altogether.To me the movie is Dazed and Confused with Kiss. Its another cool 70's based movie like American American graffiti, but more with a focus on Rock. I am not the biggest Kiss fan but Edward Furlong is one of my favorite actors and this is noisome performance by him.

Everything You'd Expect,"""Detroit Rock City"" has all the qualities a good KISS album should have.....it's loud, raucous, wild, rough, raunchy and very funny.   It's like a cross between ""Dazed & Confused"" and ""Rock N Roll High School"" and while it's not quite as good as either of those, it's still plenty of fun. Director Adam Rifkin keeps his camera moving and the energy level high.  The kids are all fine in their roles and Lin Shaye, as the fanatically religious holy terror mom of one of the kids stands out also.

There's a lot here that reminds us of what we went through as kids: defending the band, loving the music, feeling like outsiders much of the time but loving every minute of it.This is a fantastic movie for the KISS fan. I felt like I relived a part of my life while I watched it (in 9 parts on youtube! -- god bless the internet).The IMDb ratings scale needs to go to 11 for masterpieces like this.

"Not the Best, but the DVD helps","Detroit Rock City works on me as a cross between Suburbia and the Wizard of Oz.  The Story and script was pretty good by having a 4-some of gross-out teens in 1978 going after their Oz, KISS.  Like the Wizard of Oz, they run into a lot of trouble, including the equivalent of the wicked witch (a conservative Catholic mother played well by Lin Shaye).But not all the elements are in place here for a comedy (actors like Furlong and Andrews aren't the best at comedy), and though there are a few laughs here and there, it doesn't pack a bang like I though it would (KISS which I like doesn't appear until the end).  But, watching the DVD version, I noticed many different scenes and some other things I didn't see the first time around.  A good effort by writer and director wise, but not quite fully dandy.

Abysmal fare who's only saving grace is rock and roll,"Sometimes you get exactly what you expect.  A film produced and by and as a vehicle for a rock band in the middle of a comeback is not to be expected to rank high in artistic merit- and in this case it certainly doesn't.  In fact, as expected, the soundtrack is a much better investment than the movie itself, which like the 70's rock and roll lifestyle it attempts to portray, is characterized by excess, drugs, and over-the-top antics, but unfortunately is not nearly as much fun.  Utilizing a script by Carl Dupre horrible enough to make a fellow screenwriter cringe, and wasting the talents of Edward Furlong, the sole highlight of this rock and roll period piece gone wrong is the music, most notably the elaborate recreating of a 1978 KISS concert.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Rock Trash!,Unfunny and boring comedy about the adventures and struggles of four friends to get tickets for a Kiss show in a big arena in Detroit.

One word:Rockin,"I liked detroit rock city for one reason and one reason only. I am a metal fan and this movie brought to the big screen the adrenalin fueled craziness that is Kiss and hard rock music in general. Anybody looking for ""depth"" in this, has the wrong movie. I like all types of movies and sometimes I like my movies deep. But not all the time. Sometimes I want to smile. Sometimes I want to be entertained. This movie does that and it does that well.I think the bottom line is, if you are a Kiss fan or fan of hard rock in general you will love this. If you are not such a fan, but still open to movies where the sole purpose is to entertain you may like it. But if you hate Kiss or have no interest in their type of music in general your more likely to have no particular interest in this. Me, I thought it was great! Kiss forever!

"Enjoyed it, even though I dislike KISS","Detroit Rock City was surprisingly enjoyable film.  The storyline was solid, as we follow the 4 teenagers trying to get to a KISS concert, while everyone of them has their own version of coming into adulthood, confronted by their biggest fears and dreams.  Not enjoying KISS didn't ruin the film for me, though I surely would have enjoyed it more without that music blasting throughout the film.  Edward Furlong also proved to me, that he is an actor worth watching, and hopefully we will see much more of him in the future. The only downside for me was when their stupidity took over, especially during the driving to the concert, and couple of rather unrealistic scenes which I felt were unnecessary.  The story had such a good base and comedy in itself that it didn't need to resort to some silly scenes to be funny. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Underrated Comedy Gold!,"Being a massive Edward Furlong fan (my favorite movie of all-time being 1991's Terminator 2: Judgment Day, and 1998's American History X being one of my favorites too) i decided to give the film a watch. only thing i'll say is: don't listen to the critics and negative reviews. this movie is easily the funniest i've watched in years, the soundtrack is an absolute BEAST (if you're into Hard Rock and Heavy Metal give it a listen too!), the plot is some of the finest comedy i've seen in a long time. truly an underrated gem - 8/10, a definite must-watch for any comedy and rock n' roll fans!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"It's not exactly aimed toward the thinking public, but Detroit Rock City delivers more than its share of laughs.","To put it in Eddie Furlong's own words, there won't be any Academy Awards here. But who cares? This isn't the kind of movie that makes a person expect a brilliant script or spectacular acting, so they can get away with a little cheesiness. The scene early in the film when `Jam' (Sam Huntington) gets tangled up and winds up getting hit in the face with the phone is one of the funniest parts in the movie, despite the fact that it was totally unrealistic. I would normally have no sympathy for someone who didn't just bend their foot a little bit to get the spring off and thereby remove any danger, but I refuse to believe anyone who says that they didn't laugh when that thing pulled him back across the floor. Huntington stole every scene he was in, particularly that side-splitting scene with the phone, as well as a hilarious scene in the classroom when one of his classmates (Beth) tries to tell him that she has a crush on him.Guiseppe Andrews was also very good as Lex, the long-haired rock n' roll fanatic, and James DeBello as Trip fulfilled the early `Cure' type role. Furlong, on the other hand, doesn't seem to be doing so great. Remember how huge he was after Terminator 2? Sure, 90% of all of that hoopla was because the movie was so good, but you have to admit that Eddie delivered a quality performance in that film. Now, in Detroit Rock City, we have him playing a geeky high school kid in 1978 trying desperately to make his way into a KISS concert. I think that he did a god job in this role, but it's the type of role that is a drop in quality for him, at least from the tremendous Terminator 2 days. In Detroit Rock City, there's a scene where Eddie does a strip tease at a male strip club, trying to win money with which to buy tickets, and he reveals to the world that he has grown into the soft physique of a thirteen year old kid. And this is the guy that was on the cover of every teen magazine you could find only a few years ago.Natasha Lyonne appears in the small and fairly unenviable role of a dreaded disco girl, but she fills the role very nicely with her quality acting. She plays the part of one of the girls with whom all four of these high school rock n' roll geeks eventually find romance, which is probably the only part of the story that the movie could really have done without. On the other hand, the entire film plays like every high school kid's fantasy. These guys receive no respect whatsoever at school, yet on this trip to see KISS, they all end up being heroes in the most outrageous ways. Normally I don't like stuff like this, but you just have to let that go in order to enjoy the movie, because if you do that, it's really funny and really entertaining. Another character that is worth mentioning is the notorious hall monitor who, judging from his appearance, probably should have been named ""Wolverine"" instead of ""Elvis.""Detroit Rock City wasn't made to go down in film history. It was made to make people laugh and to entertain, and I think that it did that on many levels. I'm also glad that the actual band didn't overshadow the film, because if they had played extensive roles, it could really have taken away from the film as a whole. This is a unique adventure story, however unlikely, about four kids who just want to go see their favorite band and encounter every setback imaginable. Never mind trying to figure out who the target audience is, just enjoy Detroit Rock City for the goofy comedy that it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Excellent, but not for everyone","When a film is this centered around a specific ""side"" (as in disco vs rock, people who like the color blue vs people who like red...), it's difficult to ask from others to be mindful about it and just get into it somehow, but I would say this film is at least funny enough that if you're into this sort of raw, dirty American comedy, say, not the same but similar to a Dumb n Dumber, then surely you ought to watch it. It's not nearly as pointless as some would say, and those who call it that are all too obviously missing the message at the end, because it is loud - and - clear. This film is just about freedom, yes that false illusion of first world, middle-class kids' freedom but real freedom still in breaking away from the routine, the order established, not because yay rebels, but because it's so much fun and all kids want to do. The rush, the exhilaration, this movie transcribes those powerful emotions so contagiously, what with the exceptionally strong soundtrack, powerful scenes, the ultimate sacrifice... this film is just beautiful cinema, and honestly I wouldn't even begin to argue for it. If you didn't like it, there's no need to even start the topic. We're just too different, and that's okay, but it's far beyond constructive discussion at that point. Pure nostalgia, and it touched kids from much later generations than the KISS era, myself included. So much adrenaline, emotion and nostalgia. An ode to those kids who didn't care for being in the cool clique, and were 'real' - and made it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"A bit funny, yet not very realistic","The movie Detroit Rock City is pretty funny, but just doesn't cut it for me. The movie seems to drag on forever and the romances are bizarre and spontaneous.  Take one character for instance, he strips at a club (although he's underage)to make money to buy Kiss tickets, loses the contest for money, and yet somehow ends up making love to a beautiful 30+ woman who's eye he catches at the bar.  It's a decent,light-hearted comedy, but extremely ridiculous and not realistic at all, even for a teenage rock/love story.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"One Day KISS Will Make A Great Film, But This Isn't It","What a mess.  Detroit Rock City is made by someone who should be making music videos.  It consists of about 40 songs that are played along with rapid fire editing and overacted scenes.  It is like we are watching MTV if it could be programmed by people who want to rawk rather than teeny-boppers. How fast are we going to demand that movies go before they become incomprehensible?By the way, I love KISS.  KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park is an awful film, but at least it is about them.  This film is about these boys and their lame, male-fantasy coming-of-age story.  The best part was the opening credits, where we get to hear KISS and see cool stuff from the 1970's.  The rest is just awful.  Even their performance at the end sucked because it tried to squeeze all the highlights from a KISS show into one song.The performances were all o.k.  Edward Furlong is a fine actor, but he is just earning a check here.  The other teens are all unremarkable except for Lyonne, who is always worth watching.  The photography is standard while the editing, as mentioned above, is awful, almost as bad as a Michael Bay film. The soundtrack is fun, but I feel like I am listening to a radio station because they switch songs s often.  Films seem to have forgotten how to use music.  Anyway, not much works.The great KISS film will be a concert film.  It is the only time that Gene Simmons allows the band to not be a marketing ploy.  On stage, they are great.  Everywhere else, they always come up short.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Great for die hard fans. Should be enjoyed by concert enthusiasts.,"I first had the chance to watch this movie on Fox some years ago. I didn't watch it when it came out in theaters mainly because I didn't have a ""Huge"" concert culture. I was about to see Metallica and after that, my life changed and concerts have been since then a very important feature in my personal entertainment.The movie deals with a very fun and filled with adrenaline road trip that ends up in a blasting concert by KISS.The situations are very funny and best of all, accurate because if you've been in the same situation; you know it happens! Even the tragedies.The humor is 100% black and works perfectly for these kind of movies. This should be a cult classic in some years.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...""Do you know what KISS stands for? Knights in Satan's Service!""I actually remember when that one was going around back in the day. ""Detroit Rock City"" (1999), featuring a mostly no-name cast, encapsulates the year 1978 extremely well - from the music, to the fashions, cars, and life in general. It is a well-realized moment in time that you can revisit again and again to remember an age when music was so important to us as teenagers. How it felt to want to see your very favorite band live in concert for the first time, when it was all you could talk or think about - dreaming of someday becoming a rock star.Four rocker high school friends, and members of a KISS cover band called Mystery (with the letter ""S"" stylized like the S's in the name KISS) have got 4 tickets to see them in concert in Detroit (no less). This isn't just any band. This is KISS - the hottest band on earth! But, then Jeremiah's Mom discovers the tickets and mercilessly burns them before their eyes, because it is the music of the Devil! Not to be deterred, the four friends hit the road and go to Detroit anyway, determined to find a way, no matter what, to see them in concert. They split up to try and find money to get the tickets they need and have four very different, yet memorable experiences leading to the inevitable conclusion.I personally felt that this was Edward Furlong's best role to date. Yes - even better than that of a young John Connor in Terminator 2. He seemed to handle his part so effortlessly, it was like he was made for it. I've never been big on James DeBello. In every other movie I've ever seen him in, he is always lacking any real acting chops and plays his roles WAY too large, almost like he's just happy to be there. But here, DeBello reins it in, and gave us a fairly good performance as the long-haired pothead - LOL. Our other two actors did a solid job as well, giving us an overall believable impression of four friends who would die to see their favorite band. Also, Natasha Lyonne never looked better. Throw in cameos by Shannon Tweed (Gene Simmons's real life wife) and Ron Jeremy (of all people), and you have a fun cast.I had SO much fun watching this movie and reliving this part of my life. Those days are long gone, but I love films like this that don't take themselves too seriously and know how to have as much fun in the making of them as we do watching them. I recommend ""Detroit Rock City"" at a very strong 7 stars out of 10. Not a favorite, but one I always like to watch. If you haven't seen it, turn off your brain for an hour and a half and remember the good days of when all that mattered was music and friends.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
I Just Heard You Talking Through My Nose,"Detroit Rock City is an awesome stoner comedy about four friends on a quest to see their favorite band of all time, while enduring many obstacles all along the way.It's a very enjoyable road trip movie that is full of genuine laugh out loud moments, and four very simple minded characters that at the end capture your attention through any means necessary. It has a great cast, and is full of all kinds of great old school rock songs.I feel like this movie is very underrated. And with its style of comedy, it should be right there beside the other greats like Dazed and Confused, and Half Baked.

Knights of Satan's Service,"I was born well after the 70's, do not like Kiss, and have never shared any of these character's experiences, but for some reason I was still able to enjoy the movie.It was funny, there was plenty of cussing and nudity, and the writing was good enough to bring me into the movie so that I found myself rooting for these four teenage rockers who tried everything they could possibly think of to get into a KISS concert.None of the four main characters are played by any notable actors, but you will find the faces to be familiar. Edward Furlong (Hawk), Giuseppe Andrews (Lex), James DeBello (Trip), and Sam Huntington (Jam) make up the quartet. All, in my opinion, did a fine job acting and I suggest that if you don't mind harsh language and naked breasts that you go see this movie. I guarantee you will enjoy it.Below are some of the highlights and lowlights of the movie:Best part: When the four teenage KISS fans beat the s*#$ out of some Disco trash, tie them to a guard rail on the road, then paint their faces like the members of their favorite band.Best line: A ticket scalper tries to convince Hawk to buy some tickets:Check it out man, the question you gotta ask yourself is how badly do you wanna see the fucking greatest rock n' roll show in the fucking Earth, right? We're talking Geney and Paul live y'all. I'm talking about the most veluptous woman hanging out in the audience. I'm talking big breastises and tight vestises my friend. You're talking about people passing around joints in the audience. You're talking about fucking Detroit Rock City!Best acting: Sam Huntington as Jam was my favorite choice.Worst acting: Mels Dougal who played Elvis the janitor was just plain annoying.Stars: 7",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Better than I expected!,"Detroit Rock City is a teen film set in the 1970's.There have been quite a few like this(such as the brilliant ""Dazed & Confused"").This film was not as good as Dazed, but it definitely exceeded my expectations.I somewhat like the band KISS(who are the basis of this movie), I like some of there songs, but I am not a big fan like plenty of other people.You do not need to like KISS to enjoy this movie.It's very funny and also has a good story.The film is about four friends who plan on going to a KISS concert.However one of them has a very strict Christian mother who will not let him see them.So she destroys all their tickets.They now have to go and find another way to get tickets and get into the concert, while getting into a bunch of funny misadventures.Detroit ROck City is a funny and great film, you do not need to like KISS to see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Teen Comedy with a twist,"DRC is just another teenage-comedy like we've seen a lot lately. The same corny style humour like in American Pie and Road Trip, only slightly less funny. But it is one with a twist. I personally doubt wether kids today will even KNOW the band KiSS, let alone think it's cool they're in this movie. However, the topic is of all times, lot's of moms are worried sick about the weird en loud music their kids listen do. (KiSS could be easily replaced by Marilyn Manson or KoRn in this movie, it would appealed to more kids that way). Viewers that are a bit older may enjoy the cool soundtrack of old rock songs (that doesn't even feature that much KiSS-songs, mind you), but probably will be taken back by the befor metioned corny humor. (But they might just laugh at remarks like 'Take COOL A.T. GANG FOR INSTANCE, NOW THAT'S SOME REALY GOOD MUSIC!!!' hehehe)Anyways, as I said, a teen-com with a slight twist. It's enjoyable, funny at some parts and how it all works out in the end is okay. Definatly worth a trip to the videostore if you're into some corny stuff, great rock music and don't have high expectations to begin with. And oh yeah, DISCO does SUCK doesn't it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Terrible! Horrible! Revolting!,"I must say that when I sat down to watch Detroit Rock City, I was planning for a good evening of entertainment.  I wanted to see a smart comedy that ranked up there with the intelligence and style of TV's ""That 70's Show"".  I wanted comedy that made me feel guilty for laughing, like in ""There's Something About Mary.""  I wanted this to be as edgy as the whole KISS phenomenon was in the movie's period.I must admit, the first 45 minutes of the film is enjoyable.  However, there is a turning point in the film where the characters turn from naieve and likable, to cruel, calculating and really unfriendly.The fact that the characters become so distant from being likable ruins the movie.  The payoff in the end isn't even worthwhile.  The viewer is sitting there wanting the last 45 minutes of their life back.There is only one bright spot in the movie.  Lin Shaye (who played the riotous Magda in the above-fore-mentioned Mary) is a brilliant actress who plays a mom that you can't help but feel for.  Lin is spectacular. Unfortunately, her character gets forgotten in the writing, with the mom having no closure in the film.Rifkin leaves too many loose ends dangling at the end of Detroit Rock City, and this is the part that really upsets me.  An excellent period piece on the 70's that could have been bright and fun ends up being a hodge-podge of scenes fused together with no rhyme, reason, or ending.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
This shows just how far metal-heads will go for a good concert.,"I've known a lot of people like the members of the fictitious MATMOK that'd label bands like KISS as ""demonic,"" and every one of them are all insane.This movie is not for them.This movie is, however, for all of us that will go through absolute hell to see a killer concert, but this movie isn't just about the music; it's about being able to put your foot down and say, ""if you don't like the stuff I do, you can just eat it!"" Now, I'm no psychiatrist, but if I were, I'd say that Jam's mother had some repressed sexual desires. Did you see how she practically ate that priest's hand when she tried to kiss it out of respect? In any case, this movie is perfect for the rebellious rocker in all of us.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Enjoyable but...,"I was in my early 20's in 1978, the setting of this movie.  Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, etc. were the prominent rock bands and although the music of Kiss was great, I clearly remember that they were not considered to be ""cool"" by rock fans.  Kiss enjoys more popularity today than in the 70's.The four main characters were great in their roles, although too much 90's talk made it's way into the script. In the 70's the f word was used, but not every other word, like it's used today.  Jam's mother was way over the top--what was the deal with all the Catholic-bashing?  I realize this was for comic effect but there were so many blatant errors out of the mouth of Jam's mother who was a misguided but devout Catholic (""holy"" confession?  I think they were confusing it with holy communion!).  Jam's mother was funny but too much screen time was spent on this and it became boring.  Mothers standing outside of Kiss concerts with megaphones?  Gimme a break.Have no recollection of Kiss being portrayed as evil?  People were still shivering over Charles Manson and his followers and worrying whether they would be getting out of jail!  Most people were confused about the make-up and theatrical stuff of Kiss but figured if some people liked it, sobeit.This has been the ONLY film about the 70's that got the styles for guys exactly right!  Guys wore either long, straight hair or a shaggy cut molded very close to the head, and clothing:  army jackets, plaid shirts over ""baseball"" t-shirts (white shirts with rounded dark blue collars), jean jackets, etc.  Those who followed disco tried to look exactly like John Travolta in ""Saturday Night Fever.""  There needed to be more cigarette smoking which was really ""in"" (you were a minority if you didn't chain smoke).  Smoking inside concerts was also permitted.  (The country was still ""free"" back then.)  Only a few mistakes on the girls:  platform shoes went out of style in the mid-70's and had made way to strappy heels and Candies. But the permed hair, rabbit-fur coats, etc. were right on the money.Many funny scenes (the domino bathroom stalls; Hawk's debut as a dancer; Trip's brainstorm to beat each other up); many far-fetched ones (a security guard who chases kids; love in the confessional; a 40-year-old knock-out coming onto Hawk); but a movie most teens today who have openness with their parents will enjoy--""Did that really happen, mom?""

"You wanted the best, you got the best!","It's the summer of 1978. Four friends journey from their hometown of Cleveland, Ohio to see their favourite band, KISS, play live in Detroit Rock City. Except that, as you might imagine, their journey doesn't quite go to plan, and sees them in some very funny situations. Their quest to reach Detroit Rock City to see their heroes live is backed by a tremendous soundtrack that, of course, features tonnes of KISS' mega hits (and didn't they have their fair share, across varied lineups and masked/unmasked eras) but also plenty of other fantastic bands like AC/DC, Thin Lizzy, Sweet, Black Sabbath, Hot Chocolate, Ted Nugent and more. The plot is decent but the soundtrack is superb. Maybe one of the best movie soundtracks ever. Six stars for the movie, the seventh is for the soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
How does this not break a 7 on IMDb?!,From the opening scene this movie is a scream. It has so many hilarious scenes and quotes! The friends have awesome chemistry on their journey to see their favorite band. The feeling of the movie takes you back to the late 70s. They nail that and everything else. I'm shocked it has bad or mediocre reviews here.No issues with the acting and it has a great soundtrack too. Lin Shaye as Jam's mom steals every scene she's in.

Harmless Entertainment,"As a huge Terminator fan I always watch out for other films the cast have made. I found out about DRC quite a while back and was desperate to see it. However, a limited cinema release here in the UK meant that I did not get to see it on the big screen. It was not until July 2001 that I saw it for rental on DVD and that's when I decided to get it. At first glance it looked awful - the security guard Elvis, the numerous cliches like a spotty geek student but after a while it grew on me. There are some genuinely funny moments, namely the toilet scene which has only been bettered in American Pie. It also becomes quite sad later on as we see the four boys relationship fall apart due to the fact that they cannot find any Kiss tickets.Having bought it on DVD two weeks later, I found that I liked it even more. The humour, the acting and the set pieces are all excellent with the ending the only weak spot.So - if you like rock music then by all means buy this. However, if American Pie or Road Trip is more your sort of thing then I'd only reccomend renting this. Overall I give it 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Detroit Rock City review,"Now this is a bad movie if I've ever seen one. In one of film's greatest years, 1999, Detroit Rock City contends with Runaway Bride and Wild Wild West for the bottom spot in a barrel of junkies. The plot is masterful. Four scrawny high school youngsters finally have their chance at seeing the hard rock theatrics of KISS for¬Öthe third year in a row. So when their tickets are toiled by an ultra-religious, chain-smoking mom, the pals scramble themselves in getting to Detroit, and I'm sure you can figure out the rest.Well, not exactly; the movie does go to extreme measures in explaining how the four band members (no, not Gene, Paul, Ace and Peter) go about getting these tickets: losing your virginity in a confessional; saving a smoked-out bimbo and your mom's Volvo (from the Soprano's Steve Schirripa, nonetheless); preventing a robbery in the midst of botching one for a 12-year-old's debt; and of course, stripping down to your bare essentials for MC Ron Jeremy after shuttling a full blender with bourbon-leftovers. Sounds funny, doesn't it? Perhaps Detroit Rock City does have a point with all this tomfoolery in how extreme sometimes these fans can go. And we do understand this movie is a comedy; it is supposed to be filled with slapstick. But does Detroit Rock City aim to the proper audience? It is rated R, meaning the only way prepubescent adolescents-the audience as I see it, to which many will eventually hail this one a classic-will voyeur is through illegal terms.Detroit Rock City also fails at giving itself the late-1970's touch. The camera's texture quality is way too clear and way too bright, missing the necessary flair from films like This is Spinal Tap and Sid & Nancy. This would've allowed audiences to feel `more at home' with the times. Simply costuming kids into pre-90's grunge-wear and settling others into `disco infernos' does not do the trick. Environment does mean something you know; I doubt Detroit looked this glamorous in '78. If there's anything positive coming from this movie it's the kick-ass soundtrack of hard late-70 to early-80's rock. Van Halen, AC/DC, you name it, it's all here. Of course we can't forget KISS, the band aptly subjected throughout.What the film noticeably fails to manage are questions concerning why the Knights of Satin's Service (it's really just KISS) were so frowned upon by moms around the nation. Sure, the loud rock and devilish makeup might be a part of that; encouragements for youth to explore themselves and have a good time might be fair reasons as well. But, what is KISS saying in the music we hear throughout the film towards this highly rebellious group? What separates these anthems of `rock[ing] and roll[ing] all night and partying everyday' from the rest of the music? Most likely, these questions will remain in a music communication class and not in the films that should answer them, simply because it is KISS and they rock and we must do everything in our God-forgiven power to see them.1.5/5 stars",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Very enjoyable.,"As a Kiss fan, I can't say why I've never seen this before until now, but I'm certainly glad I rectified the situation.From the off, you can tell that someone cares enough to ensure little details are correct, it involves a vinyl record, but I won't say any more than that!Once introduced, the characters, whilst not amazingly likeable initially, don't grate, and they do develop throughout the film, and do a fantastic job.The script is sharp and witty, and surprisingly adult in nature for the most part, don't go in expecting an inoffensive goofy comedy, that's not what you'll get at all!The only part that let's it down for me is the end where they actually get in to see Kiss. If this were made today, I'm sure they'd be able to do a better job of recreating Kiss in 1978 via AI.Overall though, it made me smile throughout, and laugh out loud a few times, and I'll certainly watch it again.

"Always fun, occasionally KISSterical.","Four inseparable high-school pals and members of the KISS Army must overcome numerous obstacles so that they can 'rock and roll all nite' with their musical heroes in concert in Detroit (Rock City).Late-'90s teen comedy Detroit Rock City is a bit like the band KISS itself: it's not high-brow art, and there's stuff that works and stuff that doesn't, but in the end, the name of the game is pure entertainment and fun, and in that it succeeds. It might help if you're a fan of the band and are familiar with the tunes that accompany the action, but even if that's not the case, the film's breezy nature, likeable characters, and easy-going '70s vibe make it a perfect film to chug a few beers to (or some 'cold gin').The film's head-banging foursome are played by James DeBello, Giuseppe Andrews, Edward Furlong and Sam Huntington, who work brilliantly together, and they are given able support from two of my favourite actresses, Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey (as Christine and Beth - geddit?). Director Adam Rifkin directs with an energy and obvious enthusiasm for his subject matter, and in turn draws inspired performances from his young cast (most of whom weren't even born in 1978, when this film is set).The funny stuff isn't all grade A material, but, just like KISS's classic '70s albums, it's definitely more hit than miss, with some stone cold winners along the way (Furlong puking into the pitcher gets me every time). As a long time fan of KISS myself (1984-present day), I might be a bit biased, but I would say, so long as you don't have 'great expectations', you won't be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Eddie chooses wisely yet again,"I am what you could consider an Edward Furlong fan, since I rent or tape any film of his I come across. This does not mean though that I'm a die hard fan with articles and posters and stuff. I just think that he's a pretty good actor who chooses his projects wisely. He certainly did so in choosing this film, for Detroit Rock City has a lot of quality. It is funny, it has good rock tunes and the story also holds a few surprises. This is not to say that everything is good here. Sometimes the film is a little bit over the top and I did not like the ending very much (too predictable contrary to the rest of the film), which was somewhat of a bummer for me. The rest is good though if you can appreciate rock music (hear out for some REAL rock classics) or if or if you enjoy Jay and Silent Bob films, for this comes very close to being one. There might not be as much sex talk as in a Jay and Silent Bob film, but experience-wise it sure comes in the vicinity of those films.

Remember going to your first rock concert?,"For many of us growing up, the experience of going to your first BIG concert is an unforgettable, fantastic experience. In many cases it's not the concert itself that we remember, rather the days and hours leading up to the concert, the excitement of the crowd, and sharing the experience with your friends. Perhaps the most memorable experience however, was the simple fact that you made it to the show, a true coming of age for many teens.DETROIT ROCK CITY reminds us of all these obstacles and emotions with a 1978 rock-and-roll backdrop. While the KISS concert may be the ultimate goal of the four friends in this movie, the band (and thankfully, its music) takes a backseat to the characters themselves, and what they're willing to go through to make it there. KISS becomes little more than a piece of scenery, really.While this movie will be enjoyed by anyone who has experienced this -- or are currently -- those who grew up through the 70s will enjoy it the most. Exceptional attention to 70s detail is everywhere, with particular attention paid to 1978 itself. The soundtrack is full of songs released in 1977-1978 (and almost entirely non-KISS) and the selection works well to supplement how the characters feel and the situations they encounter.While no movie may ever compare to DAZED AND CONFUSED when it comes to capturing the life of a teenager in the 70s, DETROIT ROCK CITY is a very welcome, funny, and enjoyable addition to this genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Still a classic,"No matter how many times I've seen this, I always have to watch it again at some point. The plot may be a funny idea for a movie, a group of teens going to all lengths to see their favourite band live in concert, but it's done very well and also great for a good time and a good laugh. Once I got to the point of going to concerts myself, at least one of us in the group would always mention ""what if the Detroit Rock City movie thing happens...""

For KISS Themselves Only,"Made about twenty years too late, this still could have been a pretty funny little picture if someone had told writer Carl V. Dupre to include a little knowing subtlety to balance the crude sophomoric humor. Four teenage headbangers set off on a quasi-road trip to Detroit to see their idols KISS; there isn't a whole lot for today's kids to relate to and with the slavish devotion the film pays to the band (bassist Gene Simmons is one of the film's producers) there isn't a whole lot for older filmgoers either. There's only the likability of Edward Furlong (the ""Terminator"" films) to carry it, but that's not nearly enough. Perhaps the biggest offense is the waste of Farrelly Brothers favorite, Lin Shaye.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Long live the 70's,"""Detroit Rock City"" from 1999, is an absolute gem of an irreverant film that perfectly captures the spirit of youth, friendship, and the love of rock music. This wild, over-the-top comedy takes us back to the vibrant and rebellious spirit of the 1970s, centering on four teenage friends who embark on an unforgettable journey to attend a KISS concert in Detroit. The film's nostalgic vibes are wonderful, and should resonate with anyone who has ever felt the thrill of live music and the sometimes adventurous lengths one would go to for their favorite band. The humor is spot-on, blending hilarious antics with heartfelt moments that highlight the bond between the friends. Each character is endearing and relatable, bringing a unique flavor to the story while showcasing the universal themes of teenage dreams and the quest for freedom. Edward Furlong, James DeBello, Sam Huntington, Lin Shaye, Giuseppe Andrews, Natasha Lyonne, Shannon Tweed, and Gene Simmons (from the band), make up a great ensemble cast. The soundtrack is a rock lover's paradise, featuring classic tracks that perfectly complement the film's energetic atmosphere. The cinematography captures the essence of the era, immersing viewers in a world filled with colorful characters and iconic moments, all strictly 70's. The opening scenes of this are a riot, and it only gets better. An instant cult classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Tasteless, stupid, sophomoric, but undeniably funny","I never liked KISS. If it wasn't for their make-up and pyrotechnics, I don't think anyone would have given this overrated band a second glance. DETROIT ROCK CITY may not be the best thing to come out of their existence, but it sure is better than KISS VS. THE PHANTOM OF THE PARK.DRC is not a particularly good movie, but I can't say I didn't laugh my butt off quite a few times. The scene in which Edward Furlong drinks too much, then vomits into an empty beer pitcher to the tune of ""Boogie Shoes"" was the funniest vomit joke I've seen since the ""Autumn Years"" segment from MONTY PYTHON'S THE MEANING OF LIFE. The scene in which the boys are hiding in a girls bathroom while they listen to a cute girl crap her brains out in the next stall was another sophomoric but funny moment. And a scene in which they get a priest high on mushrooms to break their buddy out of parochial school brings tastelessness to a new level.This movie is proof that you can be stupid AND funny, just as long as you are indeed funny. A lot of comedies think just setting up a stupid/tasteless situation will automatically provide laughs, then do nothing to make the joke work. DETROIT ROCK CITY works. It might be dumb, crude and immoral, but it made me laugh. That's all I ask.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Annoying characters and ludicrous sub-plots - miss it.,"Detroit Rock City: the trials and tribulations of 4 teens trying to get into a KISS concert in 1978.  The premise spoke to me on a personal level - when my brother was 14 years old he told my parents he was going to stay at a friend's place, when in reality he and four friends drove 6 hours to another city to catch KISS in concert.I went expecting a light story and some good laughs.  What I got were annoying characters ( if I had to hear Trip spout more stoner stupidity I was going to scream) and mind numbingly stupid subplots (can anyone actually suspend disbelief long enough to buy Edward Furlong drinking until he fills a pitcher with vomit, then dancing onstage in a male stripper contest then being picked up by Shannon Tweed, and getting paid for sex?). By the time these misfits actually get to the concert, you don't care.Miss it.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Incredible Hulk"" Episodes Were More Entertaining","I was hoping to like this one. I remember having contests with my brother when we were little, trying to touch our nose with our tongue, like the KISS guy.Needless to say, I could never do it.The film was occasionally entertaining, but also overbearingly crude and at times, moronic. I thought the main characters were jerks, save for Jam (Sam Huntington), who was the most ""human"" person in the flick. Huntington does fine work and made me look forward to his next role. But many of the dramatic situations made no sense, KISS was barely in it, and the flashy directorial style was too much to handle. I also got tired of Shaye's one-note work as Jam's crusader mom and the broad, stereotypical characters.

Easy entertainment that will also be easily forgotten (unless you are a KISS fan),"I am not a KISS fan, but I have been to their concert a few years ago and must say that they do a great performance. So I sure can see why four teenagers who actually are fans of the band will go through all of this to get a ticket. The movie was made in 1999 when all the teen comedies like American Pie came out and goes by the same formula of a light, crude, silly comedy. My problem with this movie is that I really dislike the overacting. I don't blame it on the actors themselves, they are just doing what they were told to, but it kills the fun for me. In a lot of scenes I felt bored, most entertainment came towards the end. I really liked how they ended up getting the tickets, the scene where they came up with the idea and are doing it was hilarious. I won't say exactly what happened because I don't want to spoil the fun for the ones who didn't see it yet. Many famous faces in this movie. It is kind of sad to see Edward Furlong nowadays knowing that this was his last decent movie and he became a B action/horror movie actor after. Too bad, he had so much potential and was great in American History X. A part of me wonders if this movie ruined it for him. It was a pleasant surprise to see Melanie Lynskey in it. The soundtrack is really good. Speaking as a metal and rock fan I really liked it at all. When it comes to soundtrack I would give it 10/10. I don't want people to think that the movie is bad based on my rating. 6/10 just means that it isn't very good and lacks in many parts, but it is still above average and provides some entertainment. KISS fans will love it. It will also appeal to the following groups: teens, stoners, fans of 70's rock, fans of silly comedy, but not all of them will remember this movie forever and place on their top list. It will still give them some laughs.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Best Movie Ever.,"God yes, I love this movie. I've shown this movie to my friends and now it's pretty much a ritual that we watch it every night. Well, at least I do. This movie is amazing.

It never gets old and it's ridiculously fun to say the lines along with the movie and without the movie. So if you're pondering whether to see 'Detroit Rock City,' do it already. It's a great story of kids rebelling against authority and all the crazy antics that happen while trying to accomplish their goal, to see the greatest rock and roll show on the earth.

I liked this movie better the first time I saw it...,"...when it was called ""Rock N Roll High School"".I still am not sure whether the moviemakers meant this as a ""tribute"" or just a ripoff. Before I even saw the movie, I saw the poster and trailers, and figured it out. I could go on and on about the similarities, but if you've seen RRHS you know exactly what I mean, if you haven't, you probably are already mad at me and stopped reading.I'm not a big KISS fan, so I didn't get into that part. It was worth a matinee though. The kids who played Trip and Lex were especially good, the kid who played Jam got on my nerves for some reason, just the guy's face.On the negative side, the movie had some pretty predicible moments. There was some gross-out humor that was unnessacary, just nasty and seemed tossed in to jump on the recent trendy grossout bandwagon. The movie ended too suddenly. The 70's retro stuff was a little too contrived. (I hate when they go out of their way to mention and show 8 track tapes and happy face logos, etc) Most of the ideas were stolen from Rock-N-Roll High School. Edward Furlong just sorta gives me the creeps for some reason, maybe I read too much about his personal life and it affected how I see him even when he's acting. The dialogue needed work. Stupid Blair Witch Project take-off print ads.On the plus side, there were lots of twists to the plot that I didn't expect. There were a few Ramones songs used to great effect on the soundtrack (the more I think of it, the more I think the filmmakers, or someone involved anyway, were Ramones fans). Lex is a dead ringer for Dee Dee Ramone in the late 70's. The kid who played Trip was pretty talented and funny. Good period detail and costumes. Cameo by Ron Jeremy (another trend lately, but so far it hasn't been run into the ground yet). Some good laughs, and some satisfying moments. You do feel for these kids and want them to get in to the show...we all can identify how bad we wanted to see our favorite band live in high school. And hey, it's not supposed to be Citizen Kane, so why not go and enjoy yourselves? You could do worse.I could see how this would be, like, the ultimate movie to a KISS fan, just like Rock and Roll High School is to a Ramones fan. But let's face it, if RRHS had never been made, the filmmakers defintely wouldn't have come up with this movie on their own.",,Anonymous,Music
Shannon Tweed looks pretty good for 40 something.,"I saw this for free so I thought it was pretty funny. If I'd paid for it I might have felt differently. The best part of the movie is where the four main characters split up and have separate adventures trying to find KISS tickets before the show starts. Ed Furlong's adventure is especially funny as he runs into Ron Jeremy and Shannon Tweed at a male strip bar.This movie was a better than average teen flick, and it's good for few laughs.

A pleasant surprise!,"Okay, this movie is not exactly high art and I seriously doubt it'll win any Oscars. However, this movie is a really enjoyable teen romp through the 70's. Although this movie chronicles the adventures on four teens who are trying to make it to a Kiss concert, Kiss isn't the central focus of this movie. This movie is specificly about these four kids and their hopes, dreams and escapades. Take away the Kiss factor and you still end up with a good movie. I'll admit we could've done without the ""girls' bathroom"" scene. But this movie is a really enjoyable rock 'n' roll comedy.If you're a fan of Kiss, or 70's hard rock in general, then you're sure to enjoy this movie.

Detriot Rock City: A movie misunderstood.,I pretty much think this movie was just complete misunderstood by the public. They made out to be like it was gonna be a kiss movie. And that is why it did not sit so well at the box-office. But it is more about 4 goofy teenage boys who long to see there favorite rock band that they long to see live. But I personally think that it was a brilliant movie. Wheather your a kiss fan or not you will enjoy this movie. I'm a big kiss fan. DRC is much better than them stupid American pies movies. And they made millions at the box-office. It's just not fair. The actors are really great playing their roles. Especially Eddie Furlong. So if you have never seen this movie I advise you to watch it.

Couple this with some odious bathroom non-humor, a lack of attractive women beyond Natasha Lyonne and the negative one-dimensional depiction of the protagonists and you have a curiously disappointing teen flick.The focus on pot-obsessed dudes is disingenuous since Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons were never into the drug culture; their idea of a party was working hard creating music, performing, touring, making money and celebrating gorgeous women. Unsurprisingly, mind-blowingly beautiful females were always attracted to KISS and frequented their concerts; so were dynamic, talented males. I'm not saying pot-worshipping, denim-clad waifs weren't an element of their fan base, but KISS devotees always involved WAY more than this.No wonder Paul Stanley lamented: ""To call it a KISS movie does it a disservice, because it does a disservice to the KISS fans, which is what it's really about.The film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot entirely in the Toronto area.GRADE: C-",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Once in Detroit, the story splits into four different segments, all trying to get concert tickets. As I'm watching this, I'm saying ""Hey, I hung out with guys like this!"" The camera angles used really added to the humor.The movie captured the era really well. From 'Elvis', the hall monitor, to the John Travolta wanna-bees in the Trans-Am. I forgot how silly, but yet fun the era really was.This is another movie that really doesn't take itself too seriously, but if you were there it makes that much more funnier!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
known faces does not always equal good movies,"lots of good actors, and a story that could be described in one sentence! i dont even think i smiled once! i dont even know why i bothered to see the end of the movie. it was ok to see it on a sunday morning, but i would be angry if i went to the cinema and wasted my time!",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Kiss rocks and so does this movie! Highly underrated!,"This is one of those movies that you cannot help but love because as a teenager, we have just about all been there at some time or another. This movie is very funny from start to finish! You don't have to be a KISS fan to really enjoy this movie because it is not just about the band Kiss. This is a movie about high school teenagers on a quest for something they love and will stop at nothing to get it no matter what the stakes are. This movie never got it's due and that is a shame because once you watch it you will find yourself wanting to watch it again and again. Great cast with a great story so I highly recommend it and I promise you will enjoy it!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Effective Adventure Movie,"This is an exaggerated adventure comedy set at the butt end of the 70s with poster art reminiscent of 70s movies.However, don't expecta trip into nostalgic territory like you'd get with something like That 70s show, as this movie has more in common with adventure comedies of the 80s onward in tone. In appearance, it looks like a 2000s movie through and through. A few characters are dressed in 70s clothes here and there and they talk about how they hate disco once in a while, but the stereotypical 70s definitely only show up in passing.Anyway, it's about 4 friends who are big fans of KISS and want to go to a KISS concert. It's not just a matter of buying the tickets and going, though. Destiny puts a bunch of obstacles in their way, so it's not so simple as buying 4 tickets and going (of course).They get separated at some point and get into a bunch of crazy situations, then it becomes like 4 different adventure movies. It ends very neatly and happily. Everyone getting laid and all neatly resolved.In short, it's a NEAT and simple comedy that doesn't take itself seriously. While the situations are crazy enough, there's nothing much to distinguish it from its predecessors (Losin' it (1983)) or the next generation of similar buddy trip films (Eurotrip (2004)).If you're an avid consumer of teen comedies, you might be bored by the repetitiveness and predictability of this one. Nevertheless, it's mildly funny and entertaining if taken on its own.Honourable Mentions: Role Models (2008). A funnier comedy where the band KISS plays a substantial role in the plot (these guys seem to be really popular if they keep making comedies where they're so significant to the plot - I don't even know who they are, to be honest).",5.0,Anonymous,Music
I identified with it,"If you're into old fashioned rock n roll, like me, and if you're also going through the hell that is high school, like me, than this movie is very enjoyable. I have to admit to sitting through the movie and just thinking about how cool these kids are, and what a great time (late 70's) they're living in. It was a comedy, and I thought it was pretty funny at parts. Other parts might've been a little outlandish, and the story line is a little predictable, but I liked the characters. They were believable.I'm sort of dissapointed that this wasn't promoted much. I saw one commercial for it late at night about a week before it was supposed to open. My friends and I went dressed up in full KISS gear to the 8:00 show on opening nights. There were only two other people in the theater. You think with all the money Gene Simmons has, he could've put a little more into the advertising. But, anyway, if you liked, maybe, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, than this is the movie for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Sex, Drugs, and Rock n' Roll","This was a road trip movie whose jokes fell short. It takes place in 1973 where four kids want to go see KISS, yet they run into all kinds of interference mainly in the form of one of the kids' mom. There's music, pot, girls. Or let me say that different: sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. The movie was pretty typical and barely registered a laugh.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A time capsule...,"This movie was a very intense trip back through time for me. I was the same age as the four main characters in the movie in 1978, and I actually got chills at how well Rifkin manages to recreate middle America in 1978. The story is solid, the wardrobes/ hair styles are incredibly accurate, and even the sound track is on track. There may have been some errors as pointed out by others, but these are so few and far between, that they don't make any discernible impact on the film. I give it 8/10 because I lived through this era at that age, and I recognized every song, reference, and nuance that was represented.THANK YOU ADAM RIFKIN!!!!",,Anonymous,Music
um?,"Detroit Rock City is absolutely the greatest movie ever made.. (Other than Fight Club and American History X, they are my other two favourites). Edward Furlong and all the others were great in it, just trying to have fun and not worrying about all the acting.  Mystical sucks, but they had to learn everything in a month or so.. So I do give them credit.  This movie is hilarious (especailly when Elvis falls on the football field screaming), and also a great film for anyone to watch.  (I've gotten a few people addicted to it also) I love the Volvo! Edward Furlong is definitally the hottest person in the world, and all i have to say about this movie is that it KICKS ASS.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Really funny,"I don't really like KISS at all, but this is a really funny movie. A group of my friends saw it on opening night and my best friend was like, gotta be there an hour early or it'll be sold out. Yeah right, we were almost the only ones in the theater! The film is hysterical! We all liked it. Lex (Andrews) and Trip (DeBellos?) had the kewlest ""endings."" The only part that wasn't too good was the part with Hawk in the car with the older woman... he could have had a much better ""ending."" Otherwise it was all quite enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1978,"As soon as this film began, you knew it wasn't going to win any Oscars, but you didn't mind as the film is so enjoyable from start to finish and is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.Set in 1978, the movie centres around a quartet of male teenagers from Cleveland, Ohio, that are fanatics of the rock band KISS, and have tickets to see them in Detroit.Hawk, Lex, Jam and Trip are the foursome hoping to rock out at the concert, but after Jams 'god-bothering' mother finds the tickets, she burns them much to the horror of our four hero's. Deflated and depressed, the Guys then win tickets to the concert via a Detroit radio phone-in, and head out on the highway for the night of their lives.After an altercation with some disco loving stella's a guido's, they arrive in Detroit, to find that the tickets were not won after all as Trip, (the undisputed arsehole of the group),hung up the phone bfore the DJ could take his details. Once again without a ticket to the concert and with their car stolen, The four are at a loss, knowing that their favourite band are within spitting distance.The teen rockers decide that it's now every man for himself between now and concert time with each then having their own hilarious adventure. I personally can relate to this story as it was only a few years ago that a similar scenario happened to me i.e another city/band playing/no ticket.The acting is great, with Edward Furlong giving a brilliant performance as Hawk. Blessed with the looks of a young Michael J Fox circa Back to the Future, Furlong carries the lead role with confidence and believability. James DeBello, is hilarious as Trip, the true stoner of the group, and his moronic ways of thinking makes you laugh out loud. Lex, was played well by Guiseppe Andrews, though his character did seem superfluous to the proceedings at times. Sam Huntington as Jam gives us probably the strongest performance of the four leads. The character of Jam is a troubled one, and the audience, watching this movie, will love him, pity him and at times want to strangle him too, but the scene where he finally confronts his dominating and narrow-minded mother is the best acting in the whole film. Lin Shaye's portrayal of the mum from hell cannot go overlooked, and she is certainly one of the best character actors ever.If you like your rock music, or if you remember being a teenager that liked rock music, or even if you just like 'hold your gut laughing' teen-comedies, then Detroit Rock City should almost certainly be on your 'to watch list'. Oh! and by the way, This movie has one of the best Kick ASS soundtracks I've heard in a long time, comprising of Kiss (obviously), Black Sabbath, Thin Lizzy, Van Halen, Styx, The Sweet, UFO, AC/DC, Blue Oyster Cult and erm Popcorn by Hot Butter.Enjoy!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
AWESOME!!!!,"This movie is most awesome movie I have ever seen! When I first rented this I watched it four or five times! It's great. There's just something about it that I love. I'm not that sure.Detroit Rock City is about 4 teens in 1978, maybe 16 or 17 years old, who are KISS freaks! They have a band called MYSTERY that play nothing but KISS songs. Hawk is the leader, Trip is stupid one, Lex is the one with stupid lines, and Jam is the sensitive one who has a psycho religious bitch. She has tried but nothing to get Jam to listen to her music, Karen Carpenter, Donny & Marie, and other pop music crap. Well after three years of hopelessness to go to KISS concerts, they finally have nothing in there way. Until Jam's mom torches them. So now they hit the road to Detroit finding some way to get tickets. Along the encounter ""stellas"", a hot older chick, and others.Sure there are plenty of corny lines, ""Your belt buckle may say rock 'n' roll but your breath says pepperoni baby."" and many many other, most of which belong to Lex, poor guy, he has the stupid jokes. But it was still awesome. and Hawk is one lucky guy (SHANNON TWEED!! GOOD LORD!!)I give Detroit Rock City 10 stars **********!!!!!",,Anonymous,Music
The boys are now in town,"Avant-garde director Adam Rifkin has successfully made a teenage film that shows passion, urgency, and desire all in a believable state. The story of his film Detroit Rock City works because we like these characters even though they are odd and strange outcasts, and because the story's central point of focus, KISS concert tickets, seem to be so easy yet so difficult to obtain. It's a simplistic story made complex because of heavy factors; like age, overprotective moms, and disco Guidos.The four boys are do-it-all Hawk (Furlong), party-boy Lex (Andrews), loudmouth Trip (DeBello), and insecure Jam (Huntington) who love to rock out, work soft, play hard, and smoke marijuana. They have a garage band called ""Mystery"" that mirrors the band they idolize, KISS. After much trouble they look to have their eardrums blown off at an upcoming KISS concert, but because of Jam's overbearing mother, the tickets are gone and so are their hopes for the best concert ever.Though by sure luck, Trip calls into a radio show, answers the obligatory KISS question, and wins the four boys four tickets and backstage passes to the same concert. So now, they break Jam out of a boarding school his mother placed him in and are now resuming their plans for the best concert ever.Rifkin clearly knows how to have a fun time. He seems to know how it was to be a teenager who loved sex, drugs, rock and roll, and loud music. All the boys start as cookie cutter stereotypes, but it isn't until the final act of the film where they go off on their own that we see the true side of everyone of them.The fatal mistake Detroit Rock City made back when it was released in 1999; it cut off its main audience. Because of its R rating, used to fully utilize the language and drugs true to the youth, certain High Schoolers who I'm sure mirrored the behavior of the individuals portrayed in the film weren't allowed to see it without a parent. But how could you make a PG-13 Detroit Rock City? I just don't see it.This also occupies one of the best film soundtracks I've heard in quite sometime. Yes, lots of KISS songs are played to amuse the fanboys, but songs like ""The Boys Are Back in Town,"" ""Highway to Hell,"" ""Iron Man,"" ""Jailbreak,"" ""Rebel Rebel,"" and more are all snuck in. Detroit Rock City doesn't just stoop to the level of all KISS, all the time. I sneaks in other easily recognizable rock tunes to please both the fans of the band and rock fans in general. No assembly of knowledge on KISS is required to enjoy this film. It's a centrist kind of film.Now if only the ending could've been more. I dare not spoil it, but it feels like something was thrown on the cutting room floor too early. It feels vacant, void, and abrupt. Detroit Rock City is an eventful camaraderie of enjoyable characters and amusing events that please the most persistent and choosy buddy comedy fan.Starring: Eddie Furlong, Giuseppe Andrews, James DeBello, and Sam Huntington. Directed by: Adam Rifkin.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Best Rock/Metal Movie ever made,"This Movie is WICKED! WHAT A GREAT MOVIE! If you're looking to rent or buy a good music film, I HIGHLY recommend you buy this film. Many will say that ""Rockstar"" or ""Dazed and Confused"" are better worth seeing. Well they're good, but no match for Detroit Rock City! Don't get me wrong, i like all metal movies and movies with great soundtracks. Dazed and Confused, Rockstar, Pretty In Pink, Even Flash Gordon because of it's marvelous Queen Soundtrack (R.I.P. Freddie Mercury We Love You!), but I think this movie is better for both it has a great plot, tons of HILARIOUS and fun scenes, and a wicked soundtrack ""straight from hell"" *laughs*. I Give this a Big Fat 10 on scale. Highly Recommend it for any rock fan. Especially for a KISS fan. I mean come on, KISS is one of the best bands ever to play and a movie having to do almost completely with them is just as awesome. Great movie you gotta see it. Thank you for reading.

"as this movie proves, the '70s will NEVER die","One of the great things about movies that look at times past is the way they poke fun at individuals who didn't get into popular culture. In this case, four friends in 1970s Michigan worship KISS, but one's mother is a fundamentalist Christian who believes that KISS stands for ""Knights In Satan's Service"".In a way, ""Detroit Rock City"" is sort of an excuse to be crazy. Whether it's the scene where the four friends hide out in the girls' bathroom and listen to the girl in the neighboring stall, or the part where they finally arrive at KISS's concert, this movie has something for everyone. Everyone who loves the '70s, that is.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Another fine Rifkin film.,"Detroit Rock City really exceeded my expectations.  There's some great scenes in this film and they come together in a suprisingly cohesive way. The script was actually very funny - once the movie gets past an initial string of physical comedy bits that the actor can't carry that well (and shouldn't be expected to) there are some very funny lines and situations.Special mention has to go to the soundtrack - most of the songs in the movie aren't on the disc (there must be 45 songs in the film).Overall I thought it was a great summer movie, and I noticed a lot of Adam Rifkin/Rif Coogan signatures in the direction which added to the hilarity. If you liked this, be sure to check out The Invisible Maniac, which is in the same vein of humour (although in much worse taste in some ways).",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Four friends journey to see Kiss.,"A teenage comedy set in 1978. Four high school friends have tickets to attend the Kiss concert at Cobo Hall in Detroit. One of the boys has a mother who is a religious fanatic who thinks that Kiss is the devil's music.

It's obviously not an epic, but holds its own as a new cult 'KlassiK' as far as I'm concerned, (pun intended).The beginning credits rolled and took me on mini trip back to the late 70's and the current events of the day, while the timeless KISS Klassik 'Love Gun' cranked in the background. The credits really got me geared up for the movie.The members of Mystery were fun to watch plotting, scheming and doing any and everything possible to get to the show. ""Jam's"" mother is one of the best characters in the film, her part gave the movie an extra flare that was most funny.The soundtrack of this movie is right on!!!!!Detroit Rock City is a great movie to watch over pizza and beer after a long workweek!!*  If you like this movie, I recommend ""The Stoned Aged"". This movie has a similar premise- it takes place in the mid 70's. Two guys are relentless to find this 's**tload of fine chicks' every guy in town has been talking about.

Hawk, Trip, and Lex's dreams were shattered! Then, they drove themselves to Detroit, and went to the WURP station, and thought that Trip won the tickets, and he didn't finish completing his call, and they were furious. Few scenes later, they finally went to see Kiss!!! They faked the ticket takers that, they were mugged, and the other 4 were arrested for stealing and assault, the one man was the one that decked Trip at the Convienient Store!!!, and It was a great film , and hilarious!!!!THIS FILM ROCKS!!!!

Coming of Age in the 1980's,"Filmed as a retrospective, this production entertains, while also teaching its audience the lessons of friendship, manhood, love, family, parenting, money management, and how to win when the chips are down.Okay, that may be a weighty summation of this light-hearted love-fest devoted to KISS, but it is also apt, if heavy-handed.The quest can be substituted by anything other than KISS tickets, and the meaning and message are still there.Otherwise, if you're not into learning anything from your entertainment, it is still entertaining. I found it quite endearing, in fact. Proof you don't have to be a teenage boy to appreciate it.It rates a 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Rock City Rocks!,"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised!  Detroit Rock City was very entertaining, and I'm not even the biggest Kiss fan.  The good thing is, you don't have to be.  Kiss only plays a minor part in this film, more thematic than actually physically present.  Instead, what you have is a coming-of-age comedy with a wicked pace, loud visuals and a soundtrack to match.  Adam Rifkin does a great job directing, and while the script sometimes falters into stereotype-ville (√† la ""all adults are morons""), the film shines when it deals with the four main characters (led by Ed Furlong, who like Leo deCaprio will always look like a 16-yr. old).  The protagonists are well developed, and endearing.  On the sidelines there are some neat little cameos from Natascha Lyonne, Joe Flaherty and Ron Jeremy among others.  And the film has a wicked bite too - adolescent raunchiness is captured nearly perfectly in many of the film's scenes.  It's not nearly as subtle as Richard Linklater's masterpiece, ""Dazed and Confused,"" but it's a great summer movie, and it's a lot of fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
gives you that 'special' feeling,"'Detroit Rock City' was the coolest movie I saw in '99. I was shocked to see it only grossed $4 million at the box-office, which makes it the lowest grossing movie I've ever seen i the theaters, that I know of. But who gives a damn!!!!Of course, it's pretty popular to make a raunchy teenage-boy movie starring 4 teenage best friends. But this time, instead of the boys searching for a dead body, trying to rid their football coach, lose their virginity, or drive cross country to intercept a sex-tape, their trying to get into the biggest concert of the year. But what I liked about this movie over the other raunch fests is that this took place over 20 years ago, in a time of teens I knew so little about. I heard the original production plan was to set the movie in present-day, and have the guys going to Detroit to see Kid Rock AND Eminem. That would have been a HUGE mistake. One wannabe-black white guy is bad enough, but two is enough to make me wanna go on a killing spree, terminating all white guys who think they're black.But enough about poseurs. I saw this movie with my friend, my brother, and my dad. If my dad thinks one of my favorite movies is funny, it's funny. After seeing it, I just wanted to go out and start my own band, which I've already tried several times, unsuccessfully. I hope Edward Furlong, Sam Huntington, James DeBello, and Guiseppe Andrews go on to bigger projects, but hold this movie as the most underrated, coolest gem of the '99, right up there with 'SLC Punk'.",,Anonymous,Music
This is what happens when you don't film where the film takes place,i saw the movie and i have to tell you that if that it was funny in the beginning and sucked at the end.....also why film the movie in toronto if you're gonna call it Detroit Rock City??  I'm from Detroit and I'm happy this movie bombed cause it wasn't filmed in Detroit.  Hint for producers whose scripts require scenes in Detroit:  Film it here!!!!,,Anonymous,Music
Funniest Movie I've Ever Seen!,I thought Detroit Rock City was so funny!  You can't stop laughing!  The only thing that  didn't like about is they used way too many swear words!

That 70's Movie,"Overall it wasn't bad.  Although it's a teen movie, I think people like myself, who grew up in that era, may find it enjoyable for the nostalgia factor alone.  Had a few wild nights going to concerts myself.  This movie brought back some memories I thought were erased long ago by excessive THC levels.",,Anonymous,Music
Take it for what it is,"Many people are very critical of this movie and therefore slam it left and right.  But if you watch it for what it is, it's just plain ol' fun!The basis of the story is four teenage guys in 1978 and their quest to see their favorite rockers *KISS* live.  These four young men go through heck and high water to accomplish this. ANYONE who is a ""true rocker"" from way back will admire their determination.The sound track is a real ""blast from the past"" and is just as much fun as the movie it's self.This film is never going to win major awards.  Just get a bunch of buddies together and relive your younger days and maybe a few fantasies through this film. ENJOY!!!",,Anonymous,Music
Lots of hot music in a putrid setting.  V1.01,"To really like this I need to work at it. The walls of the girls' Jericho did not fall until the third session of filming that particular scene, some things take work.There are also two rather special historic commentaries on my DVD and I assume that proper late 70's rock fans are likely to know of those.This is from a time that was not too good from my view, personal disaster, but there was some good rock and roll on the radio. Buying a few, very few, LPs, USA speak albums?, KISS was there. Not the best but among those that stood out as among the best. The classical music that stood out for me included Carmina Burana and I would have interpreted its influence on me in a different way to how this feature uses that piece, for me I was more waving a red rag at bulls that did not appear to be bulls.There is a lot of violence in this story, but other facets too. Round our way most seemed to use more subtle forms of violence on big babies but this does give some variations of that, sort of. I found it easy to get ground down, those years. Some get trouble from all sides.*The commentaries point to KISS having been targeted by some fundamentalist Christians who considered the band to be agents of the devil, their music something that these fun C felt a need to attack. My difficulty is with how the feature interprets that.The feature shows Catholic mothers and priests as agents of the anti KISS. They are very much in parody form. As an ex Catholic I do find the expression to be not in tune with the wide variety in that church. The bits with priests are mostly too way out for me to be able to take, I need to jump over those. The exception as the bit where Beth notices her love going into the church. Inside the church a problem, despite Beth's acting. There are several features where I would really need a personalised copy and this is one of them. I need deletions.The Catholic mothers, particularly the mum of Jeremiah, a different thing. First time round that felt way too bad but that reaction soon calmed. More viewings also allowed me to notice how her idea of child care appeared to be influenced by ways of dealing with a pet dog. Not a warm sort of way as with Hermione and her Crookshanks, more a Ron with Pig as shown in the novels. Pig expected to do things on a Must Do basis, otherwise no love. This is parody, but it could be noticing something rather relevant in some of the fundamentalist Christian worlds. I find that it is there in other worlds too but maybe one only notices if one is a big baby. I would expect Harry and Ron to not survive well in the modern world and JK Rowling and Warner do have ways of saying that. The ending of HP7 novel is very modern speak.So, some fundamentalists attack and this feature shows a response by the Rockies, them attacking back, but doing that in an upside down way. By going with the flow of trying to sound evil? By these four fans waving goodbye to most any sort of sense? The world moves away from fundamentalist understandings about such as the ten commandments and this shows everyone diving into disease as the alternative way? So, this is just a feature, one that took me some getting used to. It is not about reality in the fullest sense?Could be that in any type of fundamentalist belief there is a failure mode of there being no leeway. Believe, no other option, no freedom to think. If one feels a longing to drop out there can be no good way to do so. Most characters in this story remind me of that sort of thing. There will be different interpretations, though.*This feature has lots of good music on the soundtrack. I play it because of that. Just I do experience a problem with the foreground, most scenes that include priests, and deletions are the only solution that would be liable to work for me. This is a story about the walking dead, KISS as a setting for that.",,Anonymous,Music
I thought it was surprisingly well made for a teen flick,"Detroit Rock City is an excellent example of a good time summer movie.  No great earthshaking message was meant to be imparted.  I found it to be funny, entertaining and well put together.  The soundtrack for this movie is top quality and that in and of itself makes this movie worth the price of admission.",,Anonymous,Music
Great Movie!,"To many people try to examine this movie like its supposed to be an academy award winner. Its just a comedy give the harsh reviews a rest. I found it fun and entertaining. All the characters were unique and had there own ways of dealing with things, which I liked. Not only was it funny but I like how no matter what kinda hell they went through they stuck together in the end. I found that each actor played there parts great. I also like that the guys in the movie didnt take crap from anyone, and had each others backs. I love Edward Furlong and I loved his character in the film. He seemed like the leader in the group who keep it together. It is a movie that I think teenagers would like more than adults. Though ill admit it doesnt deserve an oscar, i think its a great movie that most people will find to be very funny.",,Anonymous,Music

The best coming of age comedy to date. Hysterical film!,"While growing up, I was always a huge Kiss fan, and when I heard that they were making this film, I was a little skeptical. After seeing the God awful Kiss Meets the Phantom (even me, the mega-fan can't get into that one), I didn't know what to expect.This film shocked the hell out of me. It was well written, well acted, and just plain hysterical. Pure comic greatness. There is not enough good things to say about this film.The film takes place in 1978, when Kiss were on top of the world. Four friends decide to take a trip to Detroit to see their heroes in action. As they travel, they have many different adventures, all very funny and exciting.This film bombed at the box office, and it was a true shame. When I saw this on opening night, there were only five other people in the theatre. Even if you are not into Kiss, give this movie a chance, as it really does entertain, and does a good job of re-creating the late 70's.",,Anonymous,Music

wonderful movie; fantastic DVD,"Detroit Rock City is a movie that should be seen on DVD for a number of reasons, most specifically the special features, including 3 full-length commentaries, including one with the members of KISS. Now, I was never a KISS fan--but had many friends in 1978 (my late junior and early senior year in high school) who were. This movie more than anything captures the SPIRIT of KISS fans. Even the actors and crew admit on one of the commentaries that the film tried to take things a bit ""over the top"" in the way some scenes were portrayed, but too many critics of the movie (and they are mostly negative--and strongly so) miss the true heart of this movie. This movie does have HEART, and it has nothing to do with KISS (sorry, guys). The heart of this film are the Galahad boys who are journeying toward their own Holy Grail (in this case, a KISS concert, but more generally, their own independence or rather self-dependence).  The main four characters, especially Sam Huntington's (Jungle 2 Jungle) character and Giuseppe Andrews' (Independence Day) character stand out, as do those two actors. And as with many good films that have been misunderstood, it's even better the second (and third) viewing. If you want a film about KISS, buy a music video. If you want a movie about real people, get this one.",,Anonymous,Music
"""The Last Cool Movie of the Millennium""","I've seen what is pretty much the completed version of this film, and let me just say that I can't stop watching it. The film is basically a road trip/adventure film about four guys who would do anything to get into a sold out 1978 KISS Concert.What's cool about this movie is that it isn't trying to show off to anyone. The dialogue and ordeals are genuine and believable, yet fun at the same time. For example, when the leader, Hawk (Eddie Furlong) is forced to battle stage fright and endure a drunken striptease before hundreds of drooling old ladies. You find yourself rooting for the characters because, there's a lot of them in us. Whether we wore long sideburns and skin tight shirts in the seventies or are Pearl Jam fans of the Nineties. There's a unity to the characters in this film that the audience will truly bond with.For a film that's been labeled ""the KISS movie"", there is not that much KISSTORY here. The four guys in the movie are on a quest to discover KISS. Their devotion for the band helps to shape their characters, but it does not encapsulate them. What is present in the characters is the ""attitude"" of KISS. The belief that ""there is no such thing as failure, only quitting.""The best description I can give of this film is that it's a 50/50  split between ""Stand By Me"" and ""Dazed and Confused""; Two incredible films. The connection works. The film is not flashy and Adam Rifkin's direction plops us into the adventure in a way that doesn't bring light to the fact that it's ""just a movie."" He creates a wonderful blend between originality and creativity. A KISS fan his whole life, Rifkin and the rest of the cast and crew understand the motivation that drives the four main characters through their car chases and convenience store hold-ups.The marketing campaign for the film has mentioned the line that one of the stars, Natasha Lyonne once said; ""It's the last cool movie of the millennium."" Believe it. We live in a society of post-modernism. I, for one, sort of enjoy it. Go see this film in the theatres. See it for four true and honest performances from the young cast. See it for a hilarious scene in the girl's washroom. See it for the kickin' song list that adds everything to the feel of the film. Most of all, see it because when we were kids, all of us, there were no such things as consequences.",,Anonymous,Music
"Fun for the fans, if maybe no one else","This movie really isn't for mass consumption: it's for fans of KISS, or people with friends who are fans of KISS, and thusly are forced to watch it. And contrary to the opinions of the last reviewer, we DO exist, and there are millions of us.  And I am one of the most militant KISS fans in existence, which most people find humorous since I was born ten years after ""Alive!"" came out.  That being said, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie. There are fan-only in jokes, such as the drummer's girlfriend being named Beth.  It's just a load of fun, as I may be in a minority among the people who can actually relate to the characters: a teen aged male musician.   And the obsessive characters are alot like me:  knowing all of the band's birth names, for instance.  I laughed like a madman the whole way through, particularly during the scene in the strip club.  This is supposed to be an over-the-top scene, but actually makes Edward Furlong's character more relatable- the first time I sang with my band in front of a largish audience, I had to fight not to throw up.  This scene shows you the extremes of what stage fright feels like.  But probably the greatest point in the movie is the ""looking down the massive tongue"" shot during the concert.  As a huge fan of Gene, that one shot made the movie.  The only real problem I had with the movie was the tendency toward historical inaccuracies. AC/DC's ""Highway to Hell"" plays at one point, although the film takes place in 1798 and that song wasn't released until 1979, and KISS didn't start their sets with ""DRC"" in '78.  Gene wasn't even playing the right bass. But those are things that probably only I would've noticed and thusly don't really effect the film.   Also, the main character in the movie is the drummer.  This only bugs me because I'm a bass player, and the bass player in MyStical is the one who screws up and hangs up too early in the first place. But anyway, if you're a KISS fan, I don't need to tell you to see this movie since you probably already have.  If you aren't a KISS fan, you probably shouldn't bother.  But, whether you like the band or not, buy the soundtrack.  With the exception of Marilyn Manson's horrid rendition of ""Highway to Hell"", it's gold from first track to last.",,Anonymous,Music

An entertaining physical teen comedy,"I saw this movie at a sneak screening a little while ago.  It's a funny comedy about 4 teens trying to score KISS tickets back in the late 70's. The movie follows the 4 boys and demonstrates what they're willing to do to obtain the tickets.There are a lot of familiar faces in the movie and the story moves along at a nice pace.  A large part of the comedy is physical, along the same lines as that found in There's Something About Mary.Overall, a good movie that will be liked by the under-21 age group, doesn't do much for the older generation even if it attempts to sway them into the theatre by mentioning KISS.My biggest problems with the movie, the script could have been funnier, relied less on physical comedy and more on the screenplay.  Second, its suppose to take place in Detroit but it wasn't shot there.  If you're going to shoot the film in another city, try to make it a point to avoid capturing their famous landmarks in the scene. Hopefully in the final release, these landmarks aren't so obvious and noticeable.",,Anonymous,Music
If you were a teenager in the 70's then you remember.,"I always like to watch these comedies that take place in the 70's because that's when I was a teenager. Some get it right, others fall short of the mark. Dazed and Confused is the most vivid 70's movie I've seen. This one is entertaining in its own silly way, but doesn't quite get it right in some areas. In the 70's, many of us considered KISS to be a joke, and those kids who were into KISS were basically dweebs who were trying to be cool...most of the kids who really wanted to rock liked Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Nugent, UFO, etc. And who could forget Van Halen's debut album. But that aside, this movie is not so much about KISS, but about rock fans in that era, and the excitement of going to one of their concerts, whoever the band might be. The film does capture that goofy excitement, like pulling up to the concert hall and seeing the marquee outside, and the crowds, like one big party. The story is basically of four friends trying to score tickets to get in the show, who have comical, but far-fetched experiences in trying to obtain them. One other thing the movie does touch on, and it was a big 70's thing, was the rock and roll vs. disco scene. I remember me and my friends HATING disco, and those guys hated us, but we didn't care.",,Anonymous,Music
You'll enjoy 'Detroit',"The past few years there has been a lot of movies about teenagers in the 70's. All of which are pretty dull with the exception of this one. It's about four teenage boys, Hawk [Edward Furlong], Lex [Giuseppe Andrews], Trip [James DeBello], and Jam [Sam Huntington]who are all die-hard KISS fans. Before they can attend a KISS concert in Detroit, Jam's mom [Lin Shaye] burns their tickets. But being the die-hard KISS fans that they are, they steal Lex's mom's car and head to Detroit. It may sound like a road movie and a part of it is, but it's not just a road movie. It's a teen movie, a comedy movie, an adventure movie, an action movie, and most of all it's a KISS movie. All this in one movie. Together, it makes the perfect for everyone [except young kids], especially KISS fans. This will be known as a comedy classic for generations to come!",,Anonymous,Music

Not bad...not great either,"I just finished watching ""Detroit Rock City"".  First of all, I must say it was better than I expected.  I didn't know it was going to rely so much on physical comedy.  At first this bothered me, then I got used to it.  It reminded me a lot of ""Rock & Roll High School"" in that aspect (although it is far inferior to the Ramones MASTERPIECE...that's right...MASTERPIECE!!!! LONG LIVE ROGER CORMAN!!).  Both movies meld Rock n' Roll fantasy and reality together.  Initially I was expecting a ""Dazed and Confused"" rip-off, but luckinly the only obvious lift was the Trip character who was pretty much a copy of Slater from the Linkletter film. I'm not quite sure where all the Catholic bashing came from, I thought it was very extremely misdirected.  The whole Mother character was rather stupid also.  The other three leads more than made up for the lack of a coherent script and some rather silly plot devices.  The kid who played Jam was very enjoyable and I really wanted to get to know his character more. Edward Norton and the other guy showed a lot of enthusiasm.  They looked like they had a lot of fun making this movie. The whole ticket search part of this movie reminded me Zemickis' wonderful ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" which chronicles five kid's looking for Beatles tickets in Feb. '64 for the Ed Sullivan show.The biggest surprise was seeing Melanie Lynskey as Beth.  I absolutely fell in love with her in ""Heavenly Creatures"" and had no idea she was in this movie.  Hopefully she will show up in more movies in the future.Anyway, if you have nothing better to do and want to see a pretty good Rock Comedy, you could do worse than this movie.

"A favorite of mine, but...","For me, Detroit Rock City was THE movie of 1999.  I thoroughly enjoyed everything about it.  Being a teenage musician with rock band idols, I could easily relate to the main characters. Perhaps the most shocking part of seeing this film for the first time was finding that it isn't 'the kiss movie', like so many reviewers (who probably didn't bother WATCH it) have dubbed it to be.  Leave your 'Kiss Army' i.d.s at home, because a kiss movie it's certainly not, but rather a celebration of what being a teenager with a dream is all about, and it captures every aspect perfectly.  Every scene is scored with great music ('Frankenstein', 'Godzilla', 'Blitzkreg Bop' and dozens other amazing 70's rock tunes). Bottom line: It's a great, innocent-spirited (though in no way innocent), comedy aimed at a younger audience than it's R rating would allow in to the theatre ($4,000,000 at the box office? What the...), but for the older people, it's a great 70's - teenage rock 'n' roll nostalgia movie.",,Anonymous,Music
liked it but...,"I liked the movie it was OK but kiss sucks so bad and it made it so hard for me to enjoy the movie does anyone else feel this way I liked the acting edward furlong is a great actor and that is why i watched it in the first place but then seeing an obsession with kiss made me not enjoy it i think kiss is overrated and they should have used a different band even a mad up band would have been better however like i said the acting was good and it had good humor[Trip calls Lex's mom a dyke] Lex: Just because she's a female gynecologist, that doesn't she's a lesbian. And even if she was, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD. Trip: 'Shrooms.",,Anonymous,Music
"I ADMIT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT KISS, BUT I STILL ENJOYED IT A LOT","Like many others,I think this movie is very funny,it reminds me a lot of rock n roll high school.This movie is also adventuress.The boys somehow belive they where actully ment to go to this kiss concert.But face with a lot of opposition to get there,they run into a school security guard,Jam's right-wing mother,a little/big brother bully gang,ect.But they remain commited to try to attend this concert.With rebellious and hilarious scenes,this is my type of film.Even though this movie is also very anti-conservative,but the mothers scene was also hilarious.My favorate part was when she yells at Jam over the loud speaker so that the entire school can hear and laugh(I GIGGLED SO HARD DURING THAT SCENE).I didn't know christians belived in smoking.",,Anonymous,Music

I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS,"I was just like those guys....but in the 80's.  Seeing movies like this reminds me of how old we are getting.  It's like any of the old heavy metal movies I use to look at in the 80's as well.  KISS is just trying to cash in with the big bucks before saying ""good-by"" forever.  I do not agree with some of the things in this movie that evidently made it bad.  The language could have been toned down.  people didn't cuss that bad until now.  And the way they were dressed in my eyes was mostly 80's heavy metal style instead of 70's.  The hair style on some of the characters was also a bit 80's. 70's hair styles was mostly windblown or parted in the middle and feathered back.  It was ok... I give it a 4.",,Anonymous,Music
