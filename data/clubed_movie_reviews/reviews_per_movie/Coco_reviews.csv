Pixar has created a masterpiece of cinema,"I'm no critic, but Coco is close to movie perfection. It definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, no doubt, and is by far the best animated movie ever created. The visuals are stunning, the characters are fantastic, the twist is somewhat predictable but still great, and the story is so touching. This is the best film I have ever seen, over Shawshank, over The Godfather, over The Matrix; this film is a godlike creation from the very, very best of cinema. Do not be fooled by the haters who say it is a poor portrayal of a tradition; the tradition is likely far more beautiful in Coco than in real life. Fantastic, I am blown away.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Charming Depiction of a Beautiful Spanish-Language Tradition,"Coco tells the story of young boy named Miguel living in Mexico (Coco is his great grandmother). Miguel loves music and must keep his love a secret from his family who has forbidden music of any kind since the days of his great great grandmother. On Día de Muertos, Miguel wants to enter a contest to showcase his musical talent, but his grandmother intervenes, reiterating the family's ban on music.In his hunt for a suitable guitar to play, Miguel finds himself in the land of dead, meeting the spirits of those who have passed on. On his adventure he meets his musical hero, much of his deceased family, and a strange man who asks for his help and quickly becomes a close friend. Along the way, Miguel helps his new friend and his friend helps him understand the true significance of Día de Muertos.Of course, the title character (Coco) turns out to play a vital role before the movie is over. When the moment arrives, she delivers something powerful, and it's beautiful. It moved me in a very satisfying way that felt well-earned and authentic, rather than manipulative, the way many movie moments of this sort feel.Quick sidebar: when I took Spanish in high school, my teachers would occasionally incorporate culture from Spanish-speaking countries (usually Mexico) into the lessons. In some of these lessons, I learned about Día de Muertos. Sort of. I'm not sure if the lessons were lacking or if I just wasn't paying much attention to them. Regardless, I learned more about Día de Muertos from Coco than I did in four years of high school Spanish classes.In high school, my understanding of Día de Muertos was that it was basically a Mexican Halloween. They raised spirits from the dead and played music or something, as I understood it. It seemed silly to me. After watching Coco I realized that the tradition is anything but silly.It's not about the dressing up or the food or the music. It's about family and remembering those that came before us. Leave it to Pixar to not only entertain me, but also educate me about a rich and wonderful tradition of another culture. Bravo!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Pure Delight!,"Pixar has done it AGAIN! 'Coco' is a yet another delightful ride from the prolific animation studio, who's winning streak seems to never end. And that's good for all, since 'Coco' is all heart & soul, rewarding the moviegoer wholeheartedly.'Coco' Synopsis: Aspiring musician Miguel, confronted with his family's ancestral ban on music, enters the Land of the Dead to find his great-great-grandfather, a legendary singer.'Coco' captures the themes of Life & Death, with genuine feeling. Themes of family, passion, defeat & redemption also are explored here, but with humor & real emotion. While I laughed for a good share of this winning story, I also found myself weeping in the film's final-act. This is a true fantasy-adventure, that gives life & death true meaning.Adrian Molina & Matthew Aldrich's Screenplay is excellent. Lee Unkrich's Direction is colorful. And of course, the Animation is extraordinary. 'Coco' unfolds gorgeously & not for a second, does the pace drop.Vocal-Performances are top-notch! Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel, the protagonist, is a joy, Gael García Bernal s Héctor Rivera, a charming trickster in the Land of the Dead, Benjamin Bratt as Ernesto de la Cruz, the most famous musician in the history of Mexico and Miguel's idol & Ana Ofelia Murguía as Mamá Socorro ""Coco"" Rivera, Miguel's great-grandmother, stand out. And yes, this is a Film made in America about Mexicans & their tradition. Take That, Mr. President!On the whole, 'Coco' deserves all your time & money. Don't Miss It.

Shocked!,"I knew absolutely nothing about this movie walking in, the only reason I was there was to take my daughter to see it is strictly because my wife said there was a short Frozen film that played along with the movie and my daughter just so happens to be the biggest Frozen fan on the face of the planet.Not only was I surprised by Coco, it might be the most in depth best story line I've ever seen in an animated movie. It was also educational and shed an entirely new light on the background of the Mexican holiday Dia De Los Muertos.Wonderful movie, can't say enough good things about it!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I cried twice watching this.,"I have always been a fan of Pixar. They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn't work that well. Then came Pixar with it's revolutionary debut, Toy Story. Funny, sweet, modern, relatable and plus, completely 3D animated, which marks the first time a feature film was completely 3D animated. And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.Though the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven't felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.Coco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don't think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it's definitely up there among Pixar's finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like. I'm sure they'll like it and I'm sure you'll hug 'em all as soon as the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coco is the number one Pixar cartoon I've seen so far,"There are no shortcomings in the picture, connotation and plot of animation, each of which touches the hearts of the people. The animation of ""death is not the end, forgotten is"", let us move, don't forget our dead relatives.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Heartbreakingly beautiful. Surpasses Up and Inside Out,"Coco is about Dias de las Muerte (Day of the Dead), family, family crises and musical passion. The posters have a boy and an adult skeleton capering through the afterlife. So you can know that upfront, Pixar is going to fully deal with the subject of death that it touched upon I UP and hinted at in the death of childhood innocence in Inside Out.We were subtly forewarned that tissues would be needed. :)It surpasses the other aforementioned masterpieces by being more relatable, drawing on family restrictions and prohibitions (e.g. ""there will be no X in this family!"" X being ""instead whatever has caused pain to a family member in the past"". Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us. Most of all it taps on the shoulder and whispers that the temporal, the world we live in, in just as important as the next one and we should strive to keep family bonds strong. For when we're at the end of our rope, who else is there to pull us up?Did I mention bring Kleenex? A full box. Even hard core macho men are driven to quiet sobs and immediate phone calls to mothers and fathers telling them ""mama, I miss you.""Beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
What's not to like?!,"I am very glad I saw ""Coco"" and understand exactly why it won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, as it's terrifically entertaining, fun to watch...and quite touching as well.The story is set around Día de Muertos, the Mexican Day of the Dead. Miguel is a nice little boy whose family, inexplicably, HATE music and insist he never can grow up to become a musician. And, wouldn't you know it, but that's EXACTLY what the boy wants to become one day. But after destroying his homemade guitar, he is unable to enter a music contest...so he decides to take one from the local cemetery. Not surprisingly, this creates all sorts of problems...and Miguel is transported to the land of the dead. What's next? Just see the film!The CGI for this film is simply the best you'll currently find...putting it well above the quality of competing studios, such as Universal and Fox. In addition, the scope of the images is just breathtaking....and a treat to see on the big screen. Additionally, the songs, story and characters are all lovely. One warning, however, is that this film will very likely start you crying now and again...be sure to have some tissues nearby, just in case. A must-see film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Arguably The Best Film Of The Year, And Certainly One Of Pixar's Finest.","An impeccable fusion of first-rate storytelling & jaw-dropping animation, Coco is an awe-inspiring, highly riveting & endlessly entertaining delight that's crafted with passion, precision & perseverance, and is practically flawless. Arguably the best film of its year, this exquisite ode to remembrance & heartfelt tribute to Mexican culture isn't just Pixar's most culturally-defined work to date but is impressive enough to rank amongst the revered studio's finest efforts.",,Anonymous,Animation
"A colorful ode to the Mexican culture and to the family values, but that's kinda it","If you agree with the 'family comes first"" motto, but are tired of it being linked solely to the muscular bald guys and fast cars, then Coco will become a pleasant refreshment for you. A lush and lovingly made animation film based on the Dia de los Muertos theme from the Mexican culture, it is a touching experience and a joy to watch.However, after all the praise Coco received from all around, the actual viewing experience has left me slightly disappointed. Maybe because I did watch The Book of Life, another animation inspired by the Dia de los Muertos lore and featuring the similar ""family wishes vs personal destination"" conflict, a film some consider Coco to be a rip-off of. Or maybe it's because, despite all its pretty visuals, cute characters and singing solid enough, Coco clearly doesn't invest too much into having more than a single layer of meaning.You see, here we have a painted prettily and with lots of fizzy buoyant quirks, but still a rather simplistic take on the eternal topic of love's duality and generations' conflict. A kid who loves music, but hatred for it is a family trait for several generations, so he embarks on an unexpected journey through the world of the dead to find a way to unite again what has once been separated and to mend what was once broken. And to sing a few songs and to battle some personal fears while he's at it. There are some nice and emotional scenes along the way, and some lessons learned for some characters, but it's still more or less a linear journey from A to B where good is mostly good (although not without a typical feminine touch of a raging maelstrom of emotionality), and bad is, well, at least clearly selfish from the get-go, and then it's plain outright evil.What is missing in my opinion is the multi-facet delivery, or at least a deeper morals of the story. Sure, ""love your relatives and do what you believe in"" is cool, but ain't it what every single animated film is eventually about? And you could reach the ending inevitable for such genre with some more convoluted and morally difficult effort than just being a boisterous music prodigy with tons of luck to his aid.It's not a good idea to criticize art for not meeting your expectations. After all, nobody does it just for you, so why what you think must matter at all? Still, if you are not too fond of stories being rather straightforward, then Coco might feel somewhat shallow. And if you're not a kid who loves everything shiny and moving, then the second half of the film might feel kinda random, slapstick'y and, at times, on seriously heavy drugs (the color-changing monkey burping blue flames or multiple Frida Kahlos crawling out of a giant papaya to drink an even more giant cactus' tears being some examples). For you, I might recommend watching The Book of Life instead, which, albeit arguably less glossy and vibrant visually, has a story much more complex and not stamping ""good"" and ""evil"" labels on things, thus showing the duality of people and of the life itself.For everyone else, go ahead and watch this film. For its loving care for the Mexican traditions, sharing not just the language but also the passion for something outside the typical Western outlook. And clearly for the multiple Frida Kahlos crawling out of a giant papaya - that was hilarious beyond all sane measure!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The amount of Pixar movies that are so much better and everyone is saying that this is the best one...,"Honestly, I wasn't amazed or fantacised by 'Coco'. It's nowhere even near the same level as Toy Story 3, Inside Out, Up and WALLE. It went on for too long, some scenes dragged and weren't that entertaining. The first half especially was extremely dull, I literally just didn't know why I was watching the film. But the day of the dead scenes were kinda entertaining and quite a bit of fun. That was really when the film started to pick itself up a bit. The animation is spectacular and I'm glad that Pixar satisfied me with their stunning visuals, like they always do. The characters are good-fun and are people you can definitely relate to. Miguel is a great lead and when he's stuck with these skeleton-like people (I don't know what to call them, sorry!), it really is a lot of fun and entertaining. Although I didn't even enjoy Coco that much, I'm pretty sure you will, I'm pretty sure you'd like to watch it.I enjoyed this one less then Cars 3 but give it a watch, and if you don't want to, don't. The first 40-50 minutes you may not be entertained or satisfied like I was, but you will be surprised and amazed and the second half. My overall review of the film is that it's not bad, watch it if you want to.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Overwhelmed!,"I'm a 24 year old student who sometimes tends to overthink about the values of life and how one, including myself, expresses these kinds of thoughts through every form of art that tells a story. So as a person that really puts his soul to a movie he watches I have to say that this film is one of the most beautiful things I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing.Coco does a fantastic job of capturing the viewer from the first moment. It cleverly captures the beauty of the ""Day of the Dead"" tradition, by unfolding one of the most heartwarming stories I've ever seen in a movie, around it. The film features a young Musician called Miguel and the pursuit of his dream of being a musician against his family's approval. Throughout the movie while Miguel engages in an adventurous journey through the land of the dead, he is caught between the love he has for music and the importance of family bonds. 
Quiet a simple and pretty well covered subject. Somehow, Coco manages to so simply and beatifully capture the essence of what it means to be human. What it means to love and what it means to have passion for the things and the people you love. The story was told in such an elegant way that it didn't make me think about the values it represented, but instead it made me feel them, without me even analysing what I was watching. It did it so gradually that at some point near the end I was so overwhelmed by a scene, which definetely goes to my ""top 10 best movie scenes"" list, that I caught myself crying. Not tearing up like I usually do when a scene touches me. Actually crying.I could go on and on about Coco, but I'll leave with saying that this is a fantastic movie and I honestly feel grateful that I had the chance to watch it.A must see!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Stunning, beautiful, colorful, powerful, sad, happy. A joy of a ride.","I may be biased, since this movie portrayed perfectly what life is all about in a small Mexican town.Or, perhaps I wanted to see Pixar really get back on the game. Go beyond Up, and make a complete movie that was as beautiful as the first 20 minutes of Wall-E.I got my wish.This is the movie I wanted Pixar to make, once again. A movie about what family means. A movie about the choices we make, and the roads not taken.This is a stunning work of art. It'll move you from happiness to tears, from memories of the past to the joy of the future. To understanding, to remembrance. To the joys and pains of being alive.I can't even begin to imagine how Pixar made a movie about life and death that is so colorful, so absorbing, so poignant, and so approachable for kids, and with so many layers upon layers upon layers of meaning and significance for adults.To watch Coco is to love Coco, and to remember the Cocos in your life that are no longer among us.Thank you, Pixar.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Viva Coco! (Despite it's flaws),"Coco (2017) is an animated film co-directed by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina. It is a story set in the fictitious Mexican town of Santa Cecilia, where young Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) embarks on a journey when his passion in life and dreams are called into question by his family. All Miguel wants from this life is emulating the great and famous singer Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt) but his abuela and relatives oppose. Miguel must come to terms with his family and return back home after he disrespects the ""dia de los muertos"" tradition and a curse falls upon him, trapping him with the dead. He finds help from the deceased Hector (Gael Garcia) and members of his family like Mama Imelda (Alana Ubach) as he finds a way to express his talents and learns family history.At its core Coco is a story about passion, memory and family. Miguel follows a story arch where he must learn self value, bravery and the value of being true to one's self while remaining loyal to family, respecting tradition and remembering one's past in the form of family history. With a reputation for great storytelling, juggernauts Disney and Pixar have found a way to tell a story with such a worn arch with a new and authentic style. A lesson is learned by almost every main character as they grow and develop. Passion is pitted against tradition (and perhaps stubborn customs) and the outcome produces strong emotions on the viewer. At times the story felt carried itself with the drama and flair of a Mexican ""Telenovela"". These are some rich themes for what may be considered a ""kid's film"" but they develop organically and are never forced. However the film doesn't lack that slapstick humour or easy and quirky kid's comedy (Especially present in the playfulness of the dead characters' bones).The production team made a respectable effort preparing for the production of this film, and the results were worthwhile and evident. The film is brilliantly set in Mexico, showcasing a wide range of customs and cultural icons that made the film feel authentic. Everything from Mexican cuisine (Like tacos, tamales or ""pan de muerto"") to celebrities (Like Frida Kahlo, El Santo, Pedro Infante or Cantinflas) make an appearance. Traditional ""Mariachi"" or ""Charro"" suits and elaborate woman hairstyles are accurately represented. Mexican family culture is accurately represented from the respect towards our loving, stern and kiss filling abuelas, to that spicy and sassy personality characteristic of Mexican and Latin women. Even the idolization of popular musical icons, similar to Ernesto de la Cruz in the film, resembles the decades old fascination with the likes of actual celebrities like Pedro Infante or Jose Alfredo Jimenez. I authentically felt the story was set in a real, picturesque Mexican pueblo. Every small detail felt in place and that enhanced the story. The film understands and respects the traditions of ""dia de los muertos"" while giving it a modern twist. Despite the difficulties, and risks, that come with portraying such a rich and complex culture the film makes a much appreciated effort in introducing a side of Mexican culture that is at times neglected in favour of easy-to-go stereotypes.The film felt beautifully animated with intricate finger movements while playing a worn-out guitar or the miniscule pores and imperfections of the bones. Visually gorgeous and impressive the film makes use of a brightly coloured pallet, like with the rich orange used for the ""cempazuchitl"" flowers or the ""papel picado"" banners. The music fit perfectly with the tone used for the story and never stopped having a particularly Mexican flavour from the use of the guitar or trumpets to the ""marimba"". The score continued to set the story appropriately.Coco is carried by memorable fun moments, like Miguel's encounter with exotic Frida Kahlo, and beautiful and emotionally filled ones, such as that of the last act which grounded the story's themes of love for music and family during a scene that is sure to invoke a tear or two. Despite a few moments where it felt that the plot was driven by the oversimplified and unexplained mechanics of the curse, the film in general doesn't stop being the memorable and enjoyable experience of a familiar story executed with fresh and authentic style.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I guess we'll have to see how much lower the score goes for this movie as at the time of this review its a 9/10, but its still just shocking to me to see it that high even though it's early. It truly is Pixar's 8th best movie at most and it's an alright idea but at the end of the day it's just a check all the boxes average movie.

Another great film from Pixar,"This Pixar animation is centred on Miguel a Mexican boy who dreams of becoming a musician. Unfortunately for him his family has banned all music because his great great grandfather had abandoned his great great grandmother to become a musician... they expect him to become a shoemaker like the rest of his family. On the Day of the Dead he plans to sneak off and take part in a music competition but his grandmother destroys his guitar. Needing a new instrument he breaks into the tomb of his hero, legendary musician Ernesto de la Cruz, to borrow his guitar. As soon as he plays a chord something strange happens... nobody alive can see him but he can interact with his dead relatives who can enter the world of the living that one day. He returns to the Land of the Dead with them. He learns that if he stays past the end of the night he will become one of the dead! His family could return him but add the condition that he must give up on music... he refuses believing that Ernesto is his great great grandfather so could return him without such a condition. Héctor offers to help in exchange for taking his picture back to the Land of the Living. In what follows Miguel learns more about his family and culture.I found this film to be an absolute delight; the story is charming with excitement and genuinely emotional moments. I loved how it was based on the Day of the Dead; a celebration I'd previously heard of but didn't know about in any detail... I'd thought it sounded rather macabre but thanks to this see that it is really something rather beautiful; a day to remember dead family members. As one would expect the animation is great as were the detailed backgrounds. The central story of a child trying to return from a spirit world strongly reminded me of Studio Ghibli's 'Spirited Away'; the execution is quite different though so I never felt this was copying that film. One might think that a film about characters who are dead might be a bit creepy for younger viewers but the character designs aren't scary; in fact I think the film could be shown to children wondering about death. There are more songs than most Pixar films but it isn't a musical... characters perform rather than just break into song. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to all film fans.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Pixar Movie Yet!,"Yes, Pixar Animation Studios has done it again -- their latest release, Coco (2017), is not only a return to form, but also manages to be their best feature yet. From 1995 all the way up until 2010, Pixar knocked it out of the park with every release, save for Cars (2006) and maybe A Bug's Life (1998). However, after Cars 2 (2011), it seems every release of theirs has been bad or mediocre, except of course for 2015's extraordinary Inside Out (2015). Luckily, Coco (2017) manages to be the second great Pixar movie since Toy Story 3 (2010), and hopefully a return to form for good this time. All I will divulge about the plot is that it follows a boy named Miguel and his dog traveling into the Land of the Dead. From there, the story takes you to startling visual, entertainment, and emotional heights that no Pixar movie, no kids' movie, and very few ""adult"" movies have ever taken you. Yes, this is even more emotional than Up (2009) and Inside Out (2015) -- both of those films moved me to tears, but never hit me as hard as this one did. It touched something deep within my soul, and unlike most emotional films where my eyes will water a bit, in this one I began to openly weep. It was an emotional catharsis like I've never experienced before. Aside from the poignant elements, the film also manages to be enormously entertaining, with exhilarating sequences that reaches levels of fun Pixar hasn't reached since Monsters, Inc (2001) and The Incredibles (2004). They use the visually gorgeous Land of the Dead they have created to their full advantage, to provide a rollicking adventure that combines imagination and entertainment brilliantly. The other thing I should mention is the score, which is, by far, the best Pixar score I have ever had the pleasure of listening to -- yes, even better than Finding Nemo's (2003), Up's (2009), and Inside Out's (2015). I suppose that shouldn't come as a surprise, considering this is the most musical movie Pixar has ever created, but nevertheless was one of the many, many memorable aspects. In Conclusion, my favorite Pixar movies up until this point have been Toy Story (1995), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), WALL-E (2008), and Up (2009), with Monsters, Inc. (2001), Ratatouille (2007), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Inside Out (2015) not far behind. I have been disappointed by their seemingly endless sequels this decade, and by the fact that even their originals (Brave (2012) and The Good Dinosaur (2015)) have been okay at best. Even Inside Out (2015), though I love it, is still better at delivering an important message to children than it is being its own story. But with Coco (2017), Pixar has nailed it. It brought me back to childhood nostalgia of watching Pixar classics like Finding Nemo (2003) and Toy Story (1995); the fun, the adventure, the laughs, and the tears. This is what a Pixar movie should be, this is what a kids' movie should me, this is what any movie should be, and it is truly one of my favorite movies of all time.RATING: 10.0/10.0",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It is absolutely a celebration of a lifetime,"Have always loved Pixar, and really like to love most of their films (all three 'Cars' films and 'The Good Dinosaur' are my least favourites, and although the second 'Cars' had a lot of problems for me the third one is the only less than average one).As for favourites, they are all three 'Toy Story' films, 'Inside Out' and 'Up', love 'Wall-E' and 'Finding Nemo' as well. After seeing 'Coco' yesterday, hearing nothing but great things about it and seeing the near-universal critical acclaim, from personal opinion (and many others it seems) it is right up there with the Pixar masterpieces. Would go as far to say it is easily their best since 'Inside Out', which is saying a lot since the films between that and this were lesser Pixar efforts (enjoyed 'Finding Dory' though, though it is a long way from being one of Pixar's best).'Coco' is one of the longest Pixar films, clocking in at nearly two hours, but it sure didn't feel like it. Seeing it in the cinema, the audience was a quite large one, if on a side note not as many as thought. With it being a family film, the weekend and that it was only released three days ago, part of me was thinking it would be sold out. Throughout everybody, children and adults alike, was laughing, in awe and crying. It is also a different Pixar film, with a unique setting and that it is more music/song-oriented, and has replaced 'Inside Out' as their most mature and in depth, with themes that are remarkably daring and relevant.Lets talk about what is so brilliant about 'Coco'. The film is a triumph when it comes to visuals, one of Pixar's best-looking easily. The animation throughout is absolutely spectacular, whether in the real world or the Land of the Dead. The colours are so vibrant and atmospheric and there is so much gorgeous detailing in the backgrounds, nuances in the way the characters look and the skeletal designs and movements have amazing dexterity that is both clever and ghoulish.Just as triumphant is the music. Michael Giacchino's score is one of his best and most multi-layered, capturing the spirit of Mexico in a way that's celebratory. The songs are similarly infectious, ""Remember Me"" is not just a beautiful song but it has a great, upbeat message and adds a lot to the story.The writing has so much spirit, poignancy and entertainment value. The jokes are sophisticated and amusing, neither childish or repetitive to me and Dante is both adorable and funny, and the emotional elements are truly heartfelt, especially in the last act. The story is bright and breezy in pacing, despite the fairly long length one doesn't feel it. The Mexican culture and family values were clearly comprehensively researched and the film feels like a warm, fun and heartfelt tribute and celebration to culture, family, music and even Latino cinema in the Golden Age (the latter proving crucial to the revelation of a major plot twist).Not since 'Inside Out' has a Pixar film made me laugh and bring tears to my eyes as much as 'Coco' did, not since 'Paddington 2' has a film's ending leave me sobbing. The relationship between Hector and Miguel has a huge amount of heart and complexity, one can understand the point of view of the Rivera family (living and dead) and the macabre elements are very imaginatively realised.The twists in particularly the last act keep coming, mostly unexpected and all very clever. Some elements of the reveal with Ernesto were not that surprising (Pixar have done similar and it is fairly clichéd, my one slight criticism with 'Coco' but found it easy to overlook) but none of it was guessable too early and it was extremely well done and tense regardless.All the characters are fully formed and have strengths and flaws. Hector was the most fully rounded and provided the most heart and a lot of us are likely to find ourselves in Miguel and his aspirations. Imelda is also memorable as a character and the chemistry between all the characters is realised beautifully too.Voice acting is first rate, especially the remarkably multi-faceted contribution from Gael García Bernal as Hector. Anthony Gonzalez also voices with spirit and emotion, Alanna Ubach achieves a balance to Imelda of not wanting to get on the wrong side of her and having a caring side and Benjamin Bratt shows a side that one is surprised is in him.In summary, truly amazing and a celebration of a lifetime. One of the most deserving recipients of a perfect score in a while. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun but nothing great,Beautifully animated and entertaining but not as great as everyone is making it be. There were some beautiful songs and the voice acting was also pretty good but the concept or the execution was nothing new. As for an animated film that concerns about Day of the Dead I prefer The Book of Life. There were some obvious attempts at some political commentary that fell flat for me. The story was also quite predictable nonetheless a fun watch where they kept their respect for the culture.,6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A pointless recreation of a beautiful tradition,"Kinda disappointed with this one. Coco could've been a cultural statement and a exploration of family values and death itself, but instead is a rather dull look at a celebration, not a tradition. The aesthetic qualities are there, as well as the overall depiction of current Mexican society (sort of), but everything else feels poor in comparison, vane even. The protagonist's journey lacks actual purpose, the writers seem more focused in the real adventure that in the metaphorical one. He doesn't grow or mature. And that is just one of the many issues this movie has. At the end, it's just another decent tearjerker children film.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why I believe it deserves a 10,Pixar has come a long way. To them their creations have become a science into human emotion and I don't know any better company that has nearly perfected the craft. Soon they'll have 10's across the board from music to picture and from story to the characters. Never have I seen that more than in the movie WALL-E. This movie is up there. More than just its basic elements it dared to dive into a culture that very few in the world know about. It went above and beyond in research in getting those in Mexicos stamp of approval. It touches a deeper recess of the heart where the soul lies dormant and awakens it with hope and optimism. It takes the differences we often critique and judge upon another group only for Pixar to place a mirror right in front of us and stare at our own reflection. It takes the common elements so as to identify with the characters and stir a feeling of commonality. It's brilliant and ingenious. These things alone give it an 8. The 10 is because it was bold and dared to go places other won't. In this I found originality. Something you don't see often these days. Best part of all it unified. It takes ones thick skull (pun intended) and supplies human emotion as the medium to communicate the message so as to reach the heart. One may call that manipulation but due to its sincere true message and goodness I humbly give it a 10.,9.0,Anonymous,Animation

In one word: Spectacular.,"A Pixar's masterpiece, impeccably done in terms of research (about the Mexican culture), animation, script, musicalization, direction and production. A subtle yet charming and inspiring story; with a quality of animation worthy of an Academy Award (I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of the great winners of 2018); with an extremely powerful soundtrack; an excellent script; likable, well-developed and relatable characters; and extremely respectful of the cultural component in which the story is inspired. In short, one of the best landings of Pixar - perhaps repeating a bit its known formula, hence you can feel a ""back to basics"" in terms of the narrative, history and character development, but at the same time managing to stand out as a fresh and purposeful product that will undoubtedly give a lot to talk about.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not a fan; disappointed,"First of all, I have always been a huge fan of Pixar. I loved nearly all of their films, except for Cars 3 and Brave (I actually thought Cars 2 was fine - don't hate me!). I am usually very open to most films and give them positive ratings despite a few flaws.With Coco, I was utterly disappointed. I was lucky enough to snag a few preview screening tickets last Friday. I went with my wife and 8 year old child. My son really liked it, but that was mostly because of the outstanding animation (some of Pixar's best animation yet) and the lead character. My wife and I both found the same flaws in this.The story is very different from what Pixar usually makes. Coco is not as childish or simple as most of their other works. The concept is guaranteed to teach children about a new culture that they might not know about. While this may sound like a huge positive, it completely ruins the film for adults who cared about the story. Almost every major plot point relies on the viewer understanding a certain amount of Spanish to know what is being said among the characters. Unfortunately, I took 4 years of French in high school and had absolutely no understanding of the Spanish language. I was confused as to exactly what was being said during the climax. A character mentions to another character some important detail about the story in Spanish (which I will avoid spoiling for you) that I had to infer for myself in order to keep up with the heavy story. I don't know if there were originally subtitles to the film or not, but my theater at least had no subtitles for English speakers.From the trailer, this film appears to be more mature and daring than a typical Pixar film. In reality, this movie is just more confusing and goes for visually stunning shots more often than it goes for emotion. This is still a good movie for kids - as opposed to a movie like The Emoji Movie - and has a few teachable moments. There is a nice and thoughtful message in this, but no real impact or emotional weight to carry it through to viewers. Think of this film as an African proverb - it offers an important life lesson, but no emotion or story to accompany it.In the end, I can't really recommend this film unless you are willing to sacrifice your standards of an engaging story and emotional impact for stunning visuals and an original concept from what used to be my favorite animation studio of all time.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Late to the party,"Ok so I'm very very late to the Coco party, but I'm so glad that I convinced myself to watch this film. Having no knowledge or real interest in the Day of the Dead festival I wasn't really bothered about this film at all, and also after the flop that was Moana, I thought Disney had lost it, however I am a massive Disney / Pixar fan, and willing to forgive them most things (except Meet the Robinsons) my absolute favourites being Up and Wall-E, and I thought nothing could ever come close, but by golly does this knock both out of the water.

"Good, not great.","Coco is about a family that was defined by a moment in their history. 
We follow Miguel, a young boy who aspires to be something that his family is against.
This movie was directed by Lee Unkrich and is a original movie presented by Disney and developed by Pixar, this means that you can expect great animation, music and at least decent writing. Lee Unkrich has co-directed a lot of Pixar classics like Finding Nemo (2003) and Monsters, Inc (2001), neither of them perfected but deservedly have the pronoun of classics. Other than being co-director, he also directed Toy Story 3 (2010), which in my opinion is a bit underwhelming, I would never call it a bad movie, because it has the same production quality as the other Toy Story movies, but I believe it has a lot of problems in its script and story, not gonna delve to deep about, just have in mind that I didn't love it, and would consider it a decent movie, not good.
Coco follows a lot of plot lines and ideas from other movies, but I wouldn't consider it a down for this movie in terms of quality, just makes it less original and more of a retread of another movies like The Book of Life (2014). Unfortunately this isn't the big problem of Coco.
The big problem of Coco it's mediocrity when it comes to the script and the finality of the ideas, not only it is incredibly obvious where the story goes, it also does unnecessary plot twists that are obvious and lack of sense, which I won't spoil for obvious reasons, and because of this the emotional scenes are less effective at least when it comes to the story, because the score is so effective and well made, most people melt and forget the inconsistencies of the story, which didn't work for me, mostly because I am not a target audience of this movie, being in my twenties and having no children.
Other problem I had is that the story had a big potential which fell through, by going through obvious and overdone paths, basically it decided to end as a perfect knot instead of a little more realist. With this point I meant to show why I didn't think the story and script are tight and perfect.
Other than this problems it follows the great productions of other Pixar/Disney collaborations, having great music and animation with little and complex details, so I would recommend this movie as a fun movie for the whole family, but don't expect, at least if you are like me, a masterpiece.
I would rate it a 6-7/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Overrated colorful movie,"Do not say this is Pixar's best movie. That's an offence to Pixar itself.
Coco is a visually pleasing animated film, with stunning colors, nothing more.
I was disappointed, I really thought a Pixar movie on the Day of the Dead could have great potential, but that potential was wasted.Rather than a celebration of Mexican culture, what I have seen is a celebration of the American perception of Mexican culture (in a respectful way, at least). This was no surprise though. 
What made it impossible for me to enjoy this movie was the way the plot was sacrificed in order to deliver the ""Be who you want to be"" lesson. The first part of the movie focuses so much on this one idea, with so many clichés it even made me consider leaving the theater.But as I said, the colors make it a pretty film and I was hoping I'd be enjoying some of Pixar's excellent humor at some point. That never came. This movie will make you chuckle a couple times, but that's it, it lack's Pixar's magical combination of plot, humor and feelings.They came up with one or two good ideas and Death is depicted in a really nice way, but the plot was so scarcely developed some events remain unexplained.

Well produced but extremely predictable,"This movie having an average rating of 8.5 at the moment is to me just another proof that the rating and review system of this site is completely out of order...Pixar used to be all about telling great stories with a lot of playful creativity and originality thrown into the mix. But what Coco is just yet another sad example of is that they've found their ""successful"" formula as well as they've settled into a certain safe way of doing everything. This is the same story we've seen a million times before: A kid has a dream for his future but is prevented to follow that dream because of the surroundings he lives in (in this case his family), and of course he goes on a journey that changes everything and he can eventually live this dream. This is basically A Bugs Life (and a million other similar stories) in a Mexican setting but without anything new and original added. The main plot twists where so super obvious that you spent half the film waiting for them to be revealed... Also all the structure around the story - the flow of the story, the supporting characters, the way it's animated, the many little slap-stick (supposedly) humorous elements - it all reeks of habits and ""let's just stay in our comfort zone and play it safe""....

A Celebration of a Living Culture for the Dead (Might Be Too Hard an Act To Follow for Pixar),"Coco is the 19th feature movie produced under the banner of the trailblazing Pixar Animation Studios and is another resounding triumph for critics and audiences alike. The four reasons that makes it so are the setting of the story, the use of original songs, the quality of the animation itself, and for telling a story with morals.The story takes place in Mexico during the celebration of the Day of the Dead when people commemorate and pay their respects to their departed ones. There are a lot of points in Mexico's culture that the writers could have chosen but choosing this colorful setting for the story really gives the movie a strong base for something fresh and original to build on with the other aspects. 
A significant aspect of the movie that is predetermined by the setting are the songs used. For the lot of movies produced by Pixar, you can note their use of original songs and how they impact much of the storytelling. With Coco, the songs feature a Mexican style for sound which adds to the movie's cultural flair. The one entitled ""Remember Me"" which won for the film the Academy Award for Best Original Song is one that will stay with you long after watching the film for sheer emotion.Coco is also an exhibition of Pixar's finest work in animation yet. Each part is a testament of the effort to capture the essence of Mexico's culture and to strike balance between expressionist artistry and capturing real life. The move manages to give a feeling of other-wordliness and at the same time almost a fluid realism.Last but not the least, if people won't buy the movie's achievements in the technical department, it would still be a triumph for the story it tells, a cross section of a vast culture that's seldom fleshed out entirely which focus on music and family. You may have caught a glimpse of the Day of the Dead in the opening sequence of the last Bond movie, Spectre and you may have thought that George Romero's zombie film of the same name is about it. But it is in this movie that the Mexican Celebration gets into spotlight on its own for the world to see. As one from another country, I applaud the makers for telling the story in the most artistic way they can without compromising the importance of the story's morals thus, continuing the Pixar tradition of responsible entertainment. Truly, it is a story that can deeply affect the audience and make the world a better place.Given that Coco excels in a lot of departments, it has downside. Despite telling a story in a unique setting, venturing to another country and showcasing another culture, some of the plot devices that drove the story have already been used in the previous Pixar Movies, that if you are one that follows closely their output you would immediately notice some scenes are play out very similar to the ones in Monsters Inc, Inside Out, Up, and Toy Story 2. Now, the makers could argue that this could be a form of Homage or a technique to imprint their signature but one can't help being alarmed about a possible diminishing of original ideas from the company that brought us out-of-the box, revolutionary animated tales such as Wall-E, Up, and the Toy Story Trilogy that captured our imagination.Though at this point Pixar seemed to have set the bar too high for itself with its latest effort, their recent outputs all together are beginning to show a formulaic approach to storytelling with frequent self-referencing and also resorting to release sequels to their originals which is not bad at all but as a moviegoer you crave something new especially with the talents and resources Pixar has.With the many accomplishments the creators have garnered with this noteworthy movie, it is good to hope that they will be able to create more imaginative, original, culturally diverse movies in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Really good but somewhat flawed,"""Coco"" its the latest Disney Pixar animated film, I try not to miss that many Pixar movies and even if a few of them have escaped me I still do whatever I can do to watch them, I love a good Disney movie and ""Coco"" its no exception.I know that the gimmick this time its that it takes elements from the Mexican tradition known as El dia de los muertos (actually, it takes elements from general Mexican culture) but I cant help to feel that this is a small story that happens to take place in a huge startling world, we follow our characters through a journey that only affects them, the rest of the world does not depend on their fate but they aren't apathetic towards them, its a nice balance between a big story and a personal one.The plot isn't anything special, the world it establishes isn't special either, the characters are likable but they aren't great, except for a few of them like our main lead who carries the whole movie (as it should be), yet I wish they would have developed the rest of the family a little more or at least in a better way.The movie opens with exposition, as many modern Pixar movies do, I remember ""Moana"" doing this too, it doesn't bother me that much, I know that there's a lot to explain and to establish, so I just go along with it until it stops giving us information and tries to have actual scenes, when we get to them they are worth it. While I do like movie I will say it hits all the story beats a movie like this would, its not original, its quite predictable and melodramatic at points, but its effective, for whatever flaws it may have, never do they break the mood and they feel somewhat insignificant when compared to the wonders the film offers. The themes and subjects it plays with are familiar to me, physical death isn't the worst thing awaiting man and the pursuit of a dream will take away part of you.I was predicting where it would go and I was also awaiting for an specific moment to come, as I knew that it will be executed perfectly, and it was. I had a good time watching this, when its not being good its about as average as you can get, that goes to show how superior Pixar is to the rest, when they are not being exceptional they on the same level as their competition.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Family movie"" takes on a whole new meaning. Also, stay until the final credits!","I saw this movie at a special screening at Pixar Studios in Emeryville, CA. What an experience for the heart, mind and sou!We generally think of family films as those aimed at children, that happen to be enjoyable enough for adults. Coco, however, will be as much a hit in nursing homes as it'll be among grade-schoolers, who will laugh and cry in equal parts as the people at my screening did. It's about a family, a multi-generational family living together. I won't spoil anything, but I wish I'd been as good a great-grandson as the boy in this story.Here are my six takeaways from the morning after. I'm sure more will come to mind in the coming days and weeks, because it definitely deserves a second or third view:1. The story is probably the most rich, complex and well-written narrative I've seen in an animated film. It breaks into, and surpasses, some worthy live-action screenplays. Pixar should start campaigning for a Best Original Screenplay nomination in my opinion.2. The animation and production design are as expected, first-class. There are feast-for-your eyes visuals in the creation of imaginary places and characters, but what most impressed me was the everyday places and people, and how they filled them with cinematic wonder and color. Note: everyone I was with agreed that the detail of the titular character of Coco was unlike anything we've ever seen in animation.3. I'm a guitar player, and I can say with certainty that this is the first time I've seen animated characters correctly playing the instrument. Even in live-action movies this is not always the case, but in Coco it's obvious the filmmakers captured real guitarists playing note-for-note what you hear in the music.4. All the research and consulting into Mexican culture/sociology has paid off. To the rest of us the movie seems very respectful of family dynamics and the Día de los Muertos celebration. But the best proof lies in Mexico: since its release (which was one month before it appears everywhere else) it has become the highest-grossing movie in Mexican box-office history. After the screening I read that many of the minor characters were drawn as an homage to legendary Mexican entertainers.5. The filmmakers created a good balance between the characters' use of English and Spanish, as well as in the visuals (streets and shop signs, etc.). English-speaking audiences will understand the plot, while learning some vernacular in the process.6. Stay until the last credits roll! The filmmakers added a heartwarming segment at the very end. You'll be glad you stayed.Here in the US it's being released around Thanksgiving, and just like Saving Private Ryan made us respect The Greatest Generation, this movie will make you want to hug and kiss all your elders at the table.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Didn't Connect with ""Coco""","I have to admit that ""Coco"" left me a little bit cold.It's got dazzling and colorful animation, and it brilliantly brings to life the land of the dead. It's also refreshing to see a high-profile animated film focused on a people and a culture (in this case Mexico and specifically its celebration of the Day of the Dead) that aren't traditionally represented in mainstream movies. But the story just didn't connect with me the way the best Pixar movies (like ""Wall-E"" and ""Toy Story 3"") do. I knew when I was supposed to cry, but I wasn't sad enough to. I'm not at all religious and I don't believe in an afterlife or think about the dead in the same way this film obviously does, so maybe that explains my rather indifferent reaction to it when others seem to be responding so strongly to it.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I am a little bit sad because this wasn't dubbed in my mother tongue Telugu. Please do not be fooled by others if they say it doesn't worth watching. It worths watching more than any movie. My suggestion is to watch this movie alone and don't let your emotions stop coming out of your heart. It's Fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't know why this is so highly rated,"Don't get me wrong, it's fun and ticks a lot of boxes - indeed the whole endeavour seems to have been planned with that in mind.
I love cartoons, or animated features, as they are weightily called nowadays, and my earliest cinematic memories are of Peter Pan, Dumbo and Bambi - films that I treasure to this day. And people are doing fantastic things with the medium now, so The Incredibles, Monsters and WALL.E have joined the classics among my favourites.
I like that the film addresses an interesting theme and a culture, but I enjoyed Book Of Life more, although both are refreshing and bring so much colour and liveliness to the screen. 
However, there are a great many animations that I rate more highly, not to mention other films in other areas. So I think 6 is about right for this one. I was enchanted by Inside Out, but only gave it an 8 (the same as classics such as Snow White and Fantasia), since there are aspects of it that are aimed at a younger audience.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

SUPERB,"OH MY GOD, WHAT A MOVIE!!!!!! I can't remember when I watched something so good.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Overrated and cliché,"Let me start with the conclusion. This movie is overrated and cliché. Here's why. First of all, the movie uses a typical American Hollywood formula. Introduction character, introduction problem, introduction second character / sidekick, problem solving seems to be getting progress, plot twist, opposition (bad guy or whatever) gets the upper hand, main charecter saves the day and then the movie ends. 
This doesn't necessarily have to be a problem but this movie basically felt like two long cartoon episodes stuck together. In the past there are several TV show episodes where someone gets stuck in the realm of the dead on the Mexican holiday dia los muertos. One can ask how original it still is. You combine that with characters that aren't too interesting - it even has the typical seemingly useless animal sidekick that plays a minor role - and a plot that's predictable and one can understand why I can't possibly consider this movie to be a classic. 
Don't get me wrong though. I still enjoyed this movie somewhat, although that was mainly because it's of its highly polished animation and the presence of a good 'vibe'. The music definitely helped with that.Summary:Not original story;Typical movie formula;A bit predicatable;+ Highly polished animation;
+ Good vibe.",,Anonymous,Animation
A visually stunning and emotionally satisfying animation.,"""Coco"" is Pixar's latest entry to the canon of memorable animation and centers on young Miguel and his quest to find someone in the land of the dead. Passionate about music, he discovers his fire and learns who he is and where he comes from amidst this creative and fascinating world. With stunning visuals and a heartwarming story, this film stands as the year's best in animation (which stands pretty far from the rest of the year's mediocre attempts).Despite an abysmal accompanying short film, ""Olaf's Frozen Adventure,"" ""Coco"" does indeed leave its audience feeling optimistic and emotionally touched. The story is engaging form start to finish and takes many unexpected turns that deviate from a preconceived notion of the story from the limited trailers available. This makes the film overall feel fresh and original, despite the themes being repeatedly used before.As expected from Pixar, animation quality is top notch with breathtaking and intricate layers of meticulous detail and attention. It's no wonder this was a massive animated undertaking which feels like a real treat considering much of the animation released this year has been subpar at best. Every frame is delicately cared for which makes the experience that much richer.Another element many will be pleased with is the film's balance of subject matter and themes. This however, was a part lacking in my view. Its themes handle one's relationship to family contrasted with one's passion and desire which make conflict with the former. By asking a strong question from the beginning, ""Which takes precedence, family, or career?"" we are given something powerful to think and ponder throughout the film. However, this is answered but never truly explored during the second act. This felt like not only a missed opportunity but a steal away from the themes being fully explored and consequently, the payoff feeling justified.""Coco"" through and through is quite enjoyable with a positive message for younger viewers. Despite my personal problems with the film, I would easily see it again and recommend it to practically everyone I know. It's memorable, fun, and very sincere in it's execution.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I'm extremely impressed with Pixar's ability to make films that focus on very difficult and real issues in a way that is entertaining, funny, and powerful enough to appeal to viewers all across the board. I do not want to give ANYTHING else away other than this simple message: GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! And SEE IT NOW!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why is this popular?,"I am genuinely confused as to why this movie is so highly praised. All it has going of it is nice animation and a story focusing on The Day Of The Dead. Take that away and what do you have?-A boring, cliched, predictable, formulaic, unoriginal story.-A terrible script.-Some overused and forgettable songs.-Some of the most boring and cringeworthy scenes that I've ever seen.-Cliched characters.-Some of the worst tropes you could possibly put into your movie unless you are planning on making it comedic (South Park did the ""villain rants on about plan onstage and they think only the protagonists hear them but a protagonist turns on a microphone so that everyone can hear them"" in S13 E1 ""The Ring"" back in 2009 and it was way more entertaining and nowhere near as cringeworthy as its done in this movie's painfully boring finale). I'm just using this scene as an example. Honestly EVERYTHING in this movie has been done better by something else before. It is painfully bland and unoriginal.This movie is so cliched and predictable and boring and uninspired and stupid that I can't recommend it. What child would stay awake during the runtime? What adult wouldn't get bored ten minutes in? I only watched it due to all the praise it got, and spent the whole runtime wondering where it was coming from.If this movie was more focused on The Day Of The Dead, and everyone's motives made more sense, then this movie would've been much better. The whole family hating music because of a musician leaving is a bit ridiculous, even though the movie tries to present it seriously. There is barely any tension because every time a character is in ""danger"" you know there is going to be some kind of ex machina that's going to show up and save them.Overall I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you want to take a nap.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coco Film Critique for Geography Class,"To the average viewer Coco would be described as a cute kids movie that is based in the afterlife for most of the film. And while there are ghosts, skeletons, and alebrijes, the movie almost captures Mexican culture perfectly through the mission of Miguel and his plight to make it back to his family from the spirit world during Dia de los Muertos. Not only is the storytelling magical, but the music gives another medium to help the film flow but also to help infuse it with Mexican culture and sound. As a geography major it also impressed me how the creators made a fake Mexican town for Miguel and his family out of real places in Mexico. It is true that most of Miguel's time is spent adventuring in the Land of the Dead trying to find Ernesto or running from his deceased relatives but the writers took such care in detailing the first twenty minutes in the Land of the Living.Miguel and his music hating family live in an imaginary town called Santa Cecilia. While this is not a real place in Mexico, the name of the town even gives us a sense of where we are located based on other Mexican city names like Santa Ana, Santa Matilde, and Santa Cruz. Three places I want to mention is Santa Fe de Laguna, Guanajuato, and San Andrés Mixquic, Mexico City. The writers used the tiny town of Santa Fe de Laguna as inspiration for the town of Santa Cecilia to give the town a timeless yet historic feeling. Guanajuato was the base design behind the streets of the Land of the Dead; the town's colorful elements but historic feel is the perfect contrast. San Andrés Mixquic in Mexico City is a cemetery that is used to model the cemetery in the movie that Miguel accidentally transfers from the Land of the Living during Dia de los Muertos. By using these places as inspiration for not only Miguel's home in the real world but the architecture in the Land of the Dead, the filmmakers easily make children and adults believe that Santa Cecilia and the Land of the Dead are real locations in Mexico.Overall this is genuinely one of my favorite animated movies of all time. With the amount of love shown by each family member for one another there is no way I do not cry every time I watch it. The multiple subplots filled with twists and turns keep even the most distracted minds intrigued. There is truly a perfect amount of suspenseful, heartwarming, and fun loving scenes within the film. The animation is stunningly a filled with so much detail put into conveying a sense of time, space, and culture with the help of the outstanding soundtrack. This movie will make anyone want to go hug their loved ones and take a trip to Mexico by the end.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Absolutely magical and beautiful. One of the century's finest animated films.,"It's rare for me to finish an animated film and think ""I want that to become a classic."" But it happened with this one. As a Latino, I can't put into words just how beautiful it felt to hear the music in the film. I don't remember the last time the music in a film was able to move me so much. That goes for the entire film. I had heard so much about how sad it was, but I honestly think this is one of the most genuinely happy films I have probably ever seen. There's sadness sprinkled in there, but most of the emotion derives from watching such lovable, magical characters convey themes so eternal and personal. A lot of films intend to teach you the importance of family and all that clichéd stuff, but this is that rare film that truly earns it and truly rises above others to make you get it. Maybe I connected so much to it because I am of the culture, but wow do I think this is a truly special gem, needed so badly in a year like this. After it was over my friend turned to me and said ""Don't you dare say anything negative about this right now because I won't be able to take it."" I'm sure there are flaws in there, but the whole thing conveys such power rarely seen in animated films, and as far as I'm concerned, power that even most Pixar films don't carry. I absolutely think this is one of Pixar's best works and I hope it receives all the recognition it deserves.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Predictable, unoriginal, but well executed","For me Pixar has become synonymous with a new way of making fairy-tales that has both the fantasy setting and themes associated with traditional fairy tales, yet at the same time unconventional characters, and original stories that would be interesting for an adult to watch even if the kids are not around. Coco however is much more of a typical Disney movie full of one-dimensional characters and completely unoriginal plot where one can guess the ending after watching the first five minutes. It is a well executed animation, that does a pretty decent job of keeping your attention while it is still going, but it leaves absolutely nothing behind, the moment it is over. It was a great idea to set this during the day of the dead Mexican festival, yet one original idea about the setting is simply not enough to make a a full-featured film around.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

The movie has some of the most impressive animation that I've seen.One could make the argument that it's not appropriate to use an important part of another culture for a movie, but this movie makes sure to be respectful about it. We even get a depiction of a certain painter. I'd say that ""Coco"" makes up for ""The Three Caballeros"" (which was basically a big excuse to stereotype Latin America).

An Above-Average Film Blown Out of Proportion,"I'm not really too knowledgeable on the Day of the Dead Mexican tradition. Nevertheless, I don't think one should have to be to enjoy this film. Coco is a fun watch, especially because of it's main characters Miguel and Hector, as well as it's unique art style. However, I wouldn't go as far as calling it the best Pixar movie ever, yet, it's certainly up there in my opinion. Coco is an overrated film for sure. Too often are above-average films like this blown out of proportion by critics. The film sort of lacks adventure, being as the whole movie takes place over the course of one night. Miguel does travel to another realm, yet, I feel still very little of the Land of the Dead is actually explored. The story is cliché, yes, but it still manages to engage the viewer and keep them interested just enough. The families ban on music seems a little silly to me, talk about overreacting. Staying on the topic of music, I wasn't really impressed with the soundtrack for this film. I usually find myself with the songs from the movie stuck in my head but not with this one. I didn't really enjoy the songs while I was listening to them either to be honest. All in all, Coco was a positive experience. I don't watch a lot of animated films but this one looked good enough to check out and I'm glad that I did.

One of Pixar's finest,Coco is a prime example of the creative team at Pixar operating at their peak with new ideas and exciting worlds to explore at the same level of emotional maturity that you expect from their best output. It's got a really strong twist that holds up to a surprising amount of scrutiny if tested and it all culminates in a devastatingly emotional ending that celebrates the unwavering bonds between family and the personal connection that can be had with music.Anthony Gonzalez is phenomenal with an adorable lead performance where he's instantly likeable from the opening narration. It's very demanding as he's present in almost every scene but he never falters with a boundless enthusiasm and the emotion he brings makes his journey thoroughly investing. Gael García Bernal is amazing as a likeable huckster who's story unfolds with heartbreaking tragedy and Benjamin Bratt is perfectly typecast.Lee Unkrich and co-director Adrian Molina direct with efficiency as the film moves with a consistent speed without rushing for a single scene. The animation is absolutely gorgeous as it does what Pixar excels at. It strikes a strong balance between photorealistic objects and locations contrasted by character designs that are more animated and stylised. The land of the dead is an awe inspiring wonder and the skeletons work with the exaggerated comedy seamlessly.Terrific songs are usually Disney's forte however Pixar prove that they are just as gifted in that department when needed. They're super catchy with Remember Me designed to be the standout thanks to its added emotional heft. Interspersed in between songs is a fantastic score by Michael Giacchino which fits in naturally with both settings and when it's combined with the epic introduction to the land of the dead it elicits goosebumps.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I bet if you watch this masterpiece movie you will be in love with it and the main character a young boy who has dreams about playing guitar but his family is oddly against the idea because of his great grandfather. So to say this is a film containing a unique idea. I had tears in eye at the end of the film. I highly recommend to watch this wonderful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Must-Watch!,"Coco tells the story of a Mexican family against music, and their young boy Miguel born to sing. The topics of this movie are portrayed outstandingly. The message of family importance is conveyed so convincingly that I believe the movie to be of great importance.Some scenes make me so emotional that I cry over and over again, but that does not take away the beauty and magic.If you have not watched this yet, I tell you you should change this!! It is recommendable to both old and young audiences and should also be watched with children if possible!The values this movie teaches are truly fantastic and must be carried on.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The BEST Disney Pixar Movie I have ever seen,"This is the best Disney Pixar movie I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot. I'm 19 years old and every time I see this I cry and I laugh and I pay attention as if it's the first time I'm watching it. This movie is not only cute, it's funny, happy, and it really does a great job at teaching people about the Mexican culture. Ugh. Such a beautiful culture. It makes me UN POCO LOCO. Every song is great. I sing it all the time. I'm a grown woman and this is the best Pixar film ever. So good. I am so proud to have watched it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Thoughtful, Moving, And Visually Stunning","My daughter wanted me to watch this with her - a repeat view for her, a first-time for me. I wasn't fully focussed for the first part of the film, which may explain why I found the first act of the film a little aimless and shapeless, like it was drifting. But it really kicked up a gear for me, providing a thoughtful, nuanced take on different cultural perspectives on death, memory and grief. As such it's both moving and potentially helpful. It's also one of the most visually beautiful Pixar films I can remember, the colours popping off the screen, and the realisation of different ideas is quite stunning.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not perfect but colorful and with engaging themes and ideas - a bit too respectful and broad though,"My toddler means I don't watch a lot of films, but when I do then I tend to watch it over and over and over again. Over time I have tried to bump her to different things, even if only to get more diversity in the mix. Coco was one such film snuck into normal habits, and it was done because I'd not seen it myself. The film follows a young boy who is banned from playing music due to an ancestor who was a musician but left the family, and when he tries to steal a guitar to enter a Day of the Dead contest, he finds himself transported to the other side and needing the help of his family in getting him home.As is often the case with Pixar films, Coco deals with some difficult issues in a way that is accessible and not too challenging. In this case it is death and loss, and the film deserves credit for the way it gives messages of acceptance, of grief, and of memory. Coco is also notable for the cultural setting, which is unusual in such a mainstream film. The pressure of both of these things can be felt though, and while the film is pretty light and well balanced, it does feel a bit restrained by the pressure of being respectful and serious on its setting and themes. Perhaps related to this, the film is not as sharp in the narrative as Pixar at their best - it doesn't totally have the heart, laughs, or intelligence that an Up or Wall-E or Toy Story would bring to the table. For sure it is still a very good film, and is solid across the board, but it rarely rises above this - which is more than fine were it not for the film's own ancestors standing above it.",,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful and colorful story.,"We went for Coco due to its promoted deepness, after having watched Soul. Eventually, Soul inspired our follow-up discussions and thinking more as it was more relevant to us in our current environment and life-cycle.
This does not change the beauty of Coco though. The movie culminates in a very emotionally moving ending making it impossible for us to hold back our tears.Apart from that, it was extremely interesting to learn about the Mexican culture and the backgrounds of the holiday Dia De Los Muertos (Day of the Dead).
I was raised in a culture, where family plays a very important role. Watching Coco I felt a connection to the up- and downsides, the support and the limitations as well as the dogmas and the beauty that come along with strong family centricity.Definitely worth a watch within any setup. I can imagine though that watching Coco with your families including kids, parents, grandparents will be the most entertaining and beautiful experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Representation Done Right!,"So, lets call out the obvious. The storyline was beautiful and touching, the animation was phenomenal, and the cinematography was stunning. Huge credit to everyone who really made this movie special. However, credit must be given to the people who did their research into the Mexican culture. What I really loved was the fact that they didn't under or over represent the culture. Meaning, they put in just enough detail to nearly perfectly represent the culture! I loved this film!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bueno,"Movie morning with Iris/ Gertie.After a patchy few years, this is a Pixar semi-return to form. And it's themes perfect for our Corona-times.Some will say Disney is obsessed with death, but it's good to get the topic out in the open for children and adults alike. Although it's stronger theme is around the family.The visual detail is astounding at times. The Land Of The Dead is a blingy sugar rush of transportation systems, music venues and cribs. It's funny and although it gets a but maudlin, i resonated to this graceful film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Long and boring,"On the up side, the technical level of the animation is outstanding, and I suppose the tear-jerker ending is OK. But, IMHO, the down sides far outweigh the positives. The movie is incredibly long with one pointless scene after another, apparently designed to show off some flashy animation. And, when you cut thru all of that flashy animation, the story itself is actually pretty lame.I'd wager that the vast majority of the high reviews for this film are from kids who don't care that the story is trite in the extreme, and people who have some sense of cultural pride in seeing a movie set in Mexico that doesn't involve Clint Eastwood blasting a bunch of Mexican bad guys. If you are not in either of those groups, I suspect you'll be left scratching your head over the astronomically high rating of this long and boring movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Cempasuchil Bridge,"""Coco"" is unquestionably a movie about bridging gaps. In the film, a literal bridge of marigold petals links the Worlds of the Living and the Dead for a night. In the real world, Pixar has tended a symbolic bridge with this film to link Mexicans, Chicanos (U.S.-based Mexicans and their descendants), U.S. nationals and the world via one of our most difficult shared human experiences. This isn't a movie spearheaded by Mexican artists to introduce the world to one of our beloved idiosyncrasies, like the inevitably comparable ""The Book of Life"" (a movie that I like but have far more issues with as a film fan than ""Coco"", regardless of nationality) but to simplify it as ""a culturally appropriative work by a non-Mexican"" would be to not only miss the point of the story told in it but to miss the point in its creation as well.Lee Unkrich and the team at Pixar clearly went at great lengths to not only understand the holiday itself but also how to best present it to those unfamiliar. There's also a clear effort to try and understand the culture(s) that originate, adapt and celebrate the holiday (or as much as one can ""understand"" Mexico in anything less than a lifetime). Why so much effort? What one can infer from interviews with Unkrich is that his decision to make the movie came from a place of genuine admiration and curiosity. Filtered through Pixar's famously thorough work ethic in the service of storytelling, you end up with a film fruit of both love and intelligent, hard work, clear in many of the filmmaking decisions.For those in the know, Mexican Spanish expressions are uttered without subtitles, national celebrities (or at least their skeletal avatars) appear and are paid tribute, the cultural differences between regions of Mexico are alluded to, the movie is clearly set in the modern day and respect for the country, its people and sometimes complicated family dynamics is on display. Regarding our relatives north of the border and elsewhere, the cast of the film is more Chicano than Mexican-born and the more internationally-popular term ""Día de LOS Muertos"" is as common as our preferred ""Día de Muertos"". For those complete outsiders to the holiday, its emotionality and symbolism are explained just the right amount to follow the plot yet leaving some air of mystery while Santa Cecilia is not too far from that most-familiar depiction of small, dusty colonial towns as the face of Mexico. All these compromises show that the film is intended as a message of unity and understanding. Yes, some references will definitely fly over many audiences' heads, but the Pixar magic lies in that, making some parts of the film so specific, they've managed to turn the whole universal.Mexicans, a people defined by a tug-of-war between indigenous, European, personal, global and other identities that work best when balance between them is achieved, are a prime example of the importance of finding what's universal. Our holiday dedicated to ""let's turn mourning into joy"" may seem incongruous but it comes from the observation of joy and death as being equally unifying. We're all united by knowing joy, some of it courtesy of those who've passed on. We're all united by and equal in death, to every being that's ever lived. The death of beloved ones brings us memories, their memories bring us joy, this is the essence of Día de Muertos. ""Coco""'s noble essence, par for the course of the Pixar canon (perhaps not as bold as ""Wall-E"" or ""Monsters University"", but bold enough) is to bridge the relatively small gaps between personal passion and responsibility, Mexas and others, on the same level as those huge gaps between joy and mourning, death and life. Thanks to the respectful research and collaborations behind the film, its essence not only aligns with that of the holiday, but hopefully will complement and strenghten each other, for years to come, for every early November night that we remember... and smile.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good enjoyable film - but something's missing from it,"Coco is a film with an interesting premise and great animation, if you look at the trailer to try to decide whether to watch the film. Dia de los Muertos and a Land of the Dead fantasy storyline is really intriguing. And the Mexican holiday is something you almost never come across in mainstream films - a plus for elitists who like to think they're exploring and opening themselves to different non-Anglo cultures.Coco is a really good, enjoyable film. There's not much wrong with it, if anything. The music is beautiful, especially when Mama Imelda was singing her gorgeous song on stage with Ernesto De La Cruz, though he was being mean and swinging her around roughly.I really liked the skinny, unfortunate Hector character - and not surprisingly, it was voiced by Gael Garcia Bernal, himself a very charismatic actor. I liked the part where Hector was disappearing because no one was remembering him, and he turned his shot glass upside down. When he dressed like Frida Kahlo a couple of times, that was amusing too.The epic animation of the Land of the Dead, such as that bridge with the the golden leaf-like piles, was really stunning. The film was glowing in a very positive, technicolor, gorgeous way. The Land of the Dead wasn't some scary or somber place - it seemed fascinating, happy, and spectacular.What I liked best about Coco were the Hector parts, the magical bridge, the stunning Land of the Dead ""cityscape,"" and the animation overall.Coco is far better than some of the other major animated films of the past couple of years, like Moana, Zootopia, or Kubo.But I guess something was missing from Coco. It seems like an enjoyable way to spend two hours, and it would probably be the best of the films shown at the theater at any given time. Coco seems like it's supposed to be full of heart and soul - it was about a soulful kid wanting to pursue his love of music, and it was about familial love, too. But what is that something that's missing? Maybe its just me. Maybe I'm more fond of films that are more classic fairy tale-like, such as Frozen or Disney's Beauty & the Beast (1991). Maybe those just speak to me on a deeper level because I loved fairy tales so much my whole life. Coco is not a film I will fondly remember years to come - but maybe that's just me.Anyway, this film is definitely worth watching. It seems like it would nominated for the Academy Awards Best Animated Feature - if they don't forget about it by the end of the year. :) And maybe it will be nominated for cinematography and music, too. If you're trying to decide whether to watch, it, just go for it. Most likely, you'll enjoy it a great deal.",,Anonymous,Animation
The Holiday Treat That We Have Been Dying to See!,"How do you feel after a relative passes on? Sad? Afraid? Regretful? Doubtful? Relieved? Maybe you'll remember your exact emotions after seeing Pixar's newest celebration of family.A young Mexican boy named Miguel lives with his mamá Luisa and papá Enrique, his little sister Socorro, his aunts Carmen and Gloria, his uncle Berto, his cousins Abel, Rosa, Benny and Manny, his grandparents Franco and Abuelita, and his great grandmother, Coco, together, they're the Rivera family. The ancestors remain dear to the Riveras' memories— well, except the father of Mamá Coco who left his family to pursue music. Today, all the Riveras, Grandma Abuelita in particular, took it to discipline anyone for touching an instrument.On the other side, a dense city houses Mexico's deceased souls alongside numerous other colorful spirit animals. When one of the inhabitants' photographs is set out by the live family members in the local cemetery on Día de los Muertos, a gate designed to resemble an immigration system gives them the okay to cross the amber leaf bridge to see their loved ones. Miguel knew them for years only through stories and photographs, and now he finally meets them in person after stealing a famous musician's guitar leaves him cursed. Miguel's ancestors include great-great grandmother Imelda, Mamá Coco's mother, the short Papá Julio, the plump Rosita, the horn-eyed Victoria, and the twins Felipe and Óscar; he must receive one of their blessings before sunrise, or else he will be stuck there forever.But Miguel thinks he found another way home through his musical idol, Ernesto De La Cruz, his great-great uncle from the story! He even has a way to find De La Cruz: Héctor, a silly little man desperate to see his family again since they never once set out his photo. Then once a Shyamalan twist reveals why he wants to see his family again so bad, the true heartache comes full circle.This production proves Pixar's continually committed research, including the steps outlined in the Día de los Muertos ceremony. Especially amongst the world of the incarnate, beautiful leaves create relaxed candlelight glows, like the long celebrated fun creativity shined by the immortal hopping lamp! I'm sure it keeps accurate to Mexico's family values, since audiences in Mexico were supposedly thrilled at the premiere, taking in $28 million since its October 27th release! The same level of effort goes to the voice actors: Anthony Gonzalez gives a true, soulful performance for Miguel, his musical voice as pure as child actors come, and the right cast surrounds him with further compassionate voices, whether dead or alive.Yet once Miguel enters the afterlife, coincidences lead him to wherever the narrative takes him. Similar to what the revolutionary animation studio continues failing at, the details of the world prioritize comedy over realism. For instance, the undead skeletons drink liquor, but at the same time, say they need no bathrooms. Some other elements appear to contradict the hard research, such as English being the primary language spoken in a Mexican location. Pixar long succeeded in its widely-loved shorts without dialogue, so couldn't they expand that format to a feature length? I mean, imagine if Coco was entirely in Spanish, except speech kept to a minimum? I think it would have made the experience a lot more authentic.Looking deeper into the script's issues, the title character, Mamá Coco, gets too little screen time to serve her plot importance justice; she just sits in her wheelchair, eyes half open, less prominent than her highest potential. The writers should have implemented the family theme further by giving each boy and girl (and dog) in the Rivera family a purpose.In full honesty, the script's issues stem from the protagonist, Miguel; he starts off whiny and selfish, in turn making his growth throughout less earned than its capacity. In fact, quite a few offensive moments seem tossed in for humor's sake, specifically a brief unnecessary scene where Miguel notices a nude portrait model (a skeleton). The depiction of Mexico's afterlife as truth rather than myth may also concern some more religious viewers. And finally, the gate used to allow Mexicans to pass through on Día de los Muertos almost parallels Trump's future vision of his wall, which could offend some more conservative viewers.Although Coco can overall still please anyone looking for a good holiday treat. These months are not always a happy time, considering the number of deaths around this time, so this special celebration of both life and death just might satisfy our hurt.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

An animated movie that makes me cry, and I mean actually cry, is a rarity, and this movie did just that.

Most of the bad reviews were calling it boring and predictable, but I'm convinced they are either brainless or watched the wrong movie. The twist at the end caught me completely off guard.

One of Pixar's best movies in recent years,"3.5/4Pixar explores new territory in Coco, the realm of Mexican inspired music. Due to the rare hit (Inside Out) or likely miss (Finding Dory, Cars 2, Cars 3, The Good Dinosaur) status Pixar has maintained in the past 5 years, I steered clear of seeing this possible disappointment in theatres. However, Coco, along with Incredibles 2 releases the following year, proved that Pixar was stepping up their game for good this time.The story follows a 12-year-old boy named Miguel who's passion for music is being stifled by his relatives, who forbid music. They instead want him to be a shoemaker in the family shop. This is due to a long past family tragedy involving a musician. When Miguel is fed up with being deprived from music, he runs from home to preform in a music show. His disobedience leads him on a journey through the Land of the Dead to find his ancestor, the musician.The film shows a great understanding of its protagonist's circumstances, as Miguel is essentially unhappy apart from music. These characters, much like those of most other Pixar movies, tackle real emotions. You feel you know them on levels you wouldn't know them in, for instance, a Dreamworks movie.In the objective sense, the story of Coco is very well done and fleshed out. It was definitely a solid, intricate plot and kept the audience on edge. This movie's plot rivals the likes of Ratatouille and Toy Story, and is definitely a more complex universe.Your emotions tend to run off with Coco more than the average Pixar movie. Nothing will get those tears jerking quite like the leading single of the soundtrack ""Remeber Me"". Every song further propels Miguel's journey in such a soulful, emotional manner. You can see the effect music has on Miguel much in he same way it makes the movie. It would be a dreary Coco without the vibes put out by it's melodies.I realized how great the animation was when I saw the bridge of orange rose pedals seperating the living and the dead for the first time. The colors popped through the entire movie and produced a very Mardi Gras vibe. I really enjoyed the richness of the visuals. If you can, I recommend you see this in HD.While the renegade musician's journey doesn't quite have my vote for Pixar's best movie, it's a force to be reckoned with. If you get the chance to see it, don't pass it up.",,Anonymous,Animation

"I'd recommend Coco just for it's creativity, but it's combination of story and song make it one of Disney & Pixar's best","Once a year in Mexico, people bring treats to a graveyard where they hope to contact the dead andwait a minute, isn't this the Christmas season? What's with the sudden Halloween ideas? Actually, this is a special day called Dia de Muertos (in English, that would be the Day of the Dead) where the dark reality of death is suddenly made colorful and an embraced part of life. Death is not seen as an end, as the connection to our loved ones is how they still remain a part of us, even when their gone. The Day of the Dead remains a celebrated day in Mexico, and even the United States.There is something to those who say that they feel the spirits of their loved ones. Perhaps it's the connection of the memories or maybe it is their ghosts that are there to remind them that they'll always be watching. You could argue that these people are the closest to their families if they still consider their ancestors a vital member of the family. The Day of the Dead for this reason, stresses the importance of togetherness and family, which is why I have to recommend Coco for everyone this holiday season.Within the Rivera family, a group of shoemakers, music is outright banned in the household, even though 12 year old Miguel (played by Anthony Gonzalez) wants to follow his hero Ernesto de la Cruz (played by Benjamin Bratt) and become a famous musician. It's explained that about four generations ago, one of the Riveras became a musician and never returned home. In turn, the now abandoned wife become a shoemaker, and the rest of the family followed suit. Regardless of ban that's heavily enforced by his grandmother Imelda, Miguel constantly watches Ernesto's old movies, performances, and listens to his most popular song, ""Remember Me"".When Miguel wants to enter a local talent show, he tries acquiring a guitar by steeling the one within Ernesto's tomb. As soon as he strums it, he suddenly finds that he cannot be seen by the living and can now see skeletons visiting their families during the current Day of the Dead. His skeleton ancestors tell him that they can get him home, but under the condition that he can't play music. Not wanting to accept that, he travels through the land of the dead to find Ernesto in order to get a non-binding blessing from him.I will flat out say it: Coco may now be one of my favorite Disney movies. This is a film where everything happens to be beautiful. The story is beautiful. The characters are beautiful. The animation is beautiful. The voice work is beautiful. But why is it all beautiful? A lot of that falls on the overall story and plot where everything the child goes through feels warranted and earned. It's almost never predictable and kept me going on trying to figure out where everything was going to lead; not just for our hero but for his family.Coco has one of the most original designed worlds in a while, fitting in with other imaginative worlds like Metropolis, Blade Runner, and Batman. It is huge, looking like it could hold the population of the dead, with every part of it looking lived in. It blossoms in color, turning a world of darkness into a work of art. Coco took advantage of an underworld that has a majority Mexican inspiration and ran with every direction possible. Seeing this on the big screen made it all seem like a dream I never wanted to leaveand this is from someone who didn't see it in 3D.Of course I have to address the music. It represents everything fun and spiritual that Mexico is capable of. Though the movie is not technically a musical, it does come close with how songs are sung and just how their placed. I can already bet that ""Remember Me"" will get the phrase through it's sweeps at the award season. But without giving away how that song progresses, I'd like to address ""Un Poco Loco"" which I'd love to know if it was an original song for the movie. It's a funny little but that seems fitting for it's moment. Composer Michael Giacchino gives the movie an extra sound that makes me convinced that he's the next john Williams.I'll give this ten special guitars out of ten. Coco is a special movie that is meant for whole families, not just kids or even adults to watch alone. I have to recommend it alone for it's creativity, but all of its elements together make it a must. Please see this movie and find what a beautiful song it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Coco,"What struck me the most was the scene in which great great grandmother Immedal accidentally fell into the rising stage and had to sing loudly, only to end up crashing into the four seats.In fact, there's no delay in the main plot without it. Being forced by reality (raising children, taking care of parents, supporting a spouse's career, etc.) to give up one's dream, and finally having a successful career and having a happy family with a full generation of children will be looked up to and respected by others. Isn't that a perfect life? Isn't this the perfect ending to most episodes that encourage emphasis on family and affection?However, in every quiet night, when his/her family sleeps soundly, will he/she miss his/her dream and miss the young self who fought for the dream? Or console yourself that there is no such thing as perfection, that when God opens a door, he must always close a window. Is that good enough? But touch their own heart, we do not deceive yourself, those regret really not burning people?Pixar, instead of stopping at chicken soup, dared to tell the audience: one yard for every yard.Success elsewhere is success elsewhere, and dreams lost there are only to be found again.After giving up her singing dream to raise a child, Pixar rediscovers her dream on stage -- a complete, sparkling, fiery Imeldar.At that moment, she was singing, her beloved husband was accompanying her, and the whole world was listening. This was the film's special fulfillment for her. I like the idea.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not at all a winner - in my opinion,"I wish I could make myself rate it lower, just to balance the excessive overrating going around. 
To say it simple, the animated movie felt boring most of the time. In did touch me in the end, perhaps even a tear. But this happened is the last 5 minutes of an 1h40 length story.
I feel the 10/10 rating going on here has to do with the fact that the movie portraits something of the mexican culture, many live in the USA and feel like an overlooked minority.
Nowadays in hollywood: the story is not that appealing but is it about a minority? Then it will be very well rated. I am all for minorities but can you make it more interesting??
This being said, aside from the long and a bit boring story, the animation is fantastic and the ending one won't leave you indifferent. Thus the 6 star rate.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not a great family movie,"Coco (2017) was co-written and co-directed by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina.This movie has an extremely high IMDb ration of 8.4.

However, 105 minutes is too long for this kind of movie. I could just sense the directors adding more and more animated special effects. Not needed, but, if we can do it, then let's do it.I hate to be a curmudgeon, and risk many ""unhelpful"" comments about my review. I know the movie won an Oscar, but I didn't think much of it.

Coco Review,"Coco is the project in which Pixar has worked, a film that addresses one of the most important Mexican traditions: the Day of the Dead.Tells the story of a 12-year-old teenager, Miguel, who has the dream of becoming a successful musician, even though his family does not agree with it, since they believe that they have been cursed by music, as the great-great-grandfather his family to pursue his dreams as a singer. Miguel's desire arises from his admiration for the deceased singer Ernesto De La Cruz, so Miguel decides to go to his grave to borrow his guitar and participate in a contest, where he will demonstrate and seek to convince his family about his passion for the music, but in that course things get complicated and Miguel enters the Kingdom of the Dead. the music, but in that course things get complicated and Miguel enters the Kingdom of the Dead. For Pixar this film represented a great challenge, he worked on it for 5 years, we will see if they achieve the long-awaited success. The film arrives on the screen on November 22, 2017 in the United States; while in Mexico on October 27 and in the rest of Latin America on November 23.

Here's a Shocker: Pixar Made a Good Movie!,"Dia de Muertos, or ""Day of the Dead"", is a Mexican holiday in which families gather to commemorate and pray for their ancestors, with comfort food and exuberant decorations, all to help the deceased on their spiritual journeys. It's a stunningly beautiful and sweet celebration that could easily fit into most any cultural tradition, so why isn't it more widely recognized? Well, Pixar is doing their part with Coco. A studio that's never afraid to explore sadness and death with levity and heart, they've given us (in essentially their first musical) a film as vibrantly colorful and moving as the holiday it's informed by. Coco's story is pretty basic: kid rebels from hard-nosed family, makes friends with other outcasts, discovers his true calling, gets into some trouble, and tries to reconcile his tradition with his desire. Think Ratatouille, with music instead of food, and people instead of rats. It falls into some unnecessary story clichés and questionable character decisions, but it's never overwhelming. The brightness in the smaller things is incredible. The preciseness of the music, the connection to characters' plights, the energetic scenes and scenery, the jaw-dropping and unique animation; it's all festively enveloping. And beneath the juxtaposition of the unremarkable story and near-perfect details is Pixar's virtually unblemished record of deep emotions. The colors of Coco's world may draw in our sight; however, its characters' arcs, its thoughts on the importance of extended families, and its unapologetic desire to explore the inevitable and inherent sadness of aging and death, with plenty of entertainment along the way, make it another Pixar movie families should be celebrating.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

However, I was amazed at how unlike that prequel the reason is very understandable and relatable. They don't just throw it in for a dumb reason, they back it up with a legit conflict and misunderstanding. Also all the characters are great, even the one that looked like a dumb comedic sidekick ends up being a lot more than I anticipated. Even the main character is not made to be an all perfect kid, he's being a legit kid; naive, eager, fast, and found his calling in the wrong direction ultimately leading him the right way. Even the villain's really good. He's no Frollo, but good grief, even though I got spoiled on who it was I was not prepared for how incredibly despicable he was! I hated him, and not in a way that I could like him! And of course the animation's terrific! That had to be some of Pixar's most difficult work, especially on the dead characters, Coco, and leaves. I read that this movie took 10 years to make and it really shows through the writing, animation, music, and even trying to capture the culture. I've never heard of a Disney film where there's actual research on a culture, or at least enough to take all the time they did to actually attempt to get it right (or at least I hope so - did they get it right?). And for the record, I didn't quiet cry, but certainly I was welling up with tears, I just held them back from falling.

While I always appreciate the work and creativity that goes into every Pixar film and praise them for the messages they put across, I usually find their films boring and typically don't watch them more than once. When I went to see Coco, I was more interested in seeing Disney's Olaf's Frozen Adventure for some Christmas fluff and thought that Coco was just going just as dull as Inside Out was. However, I was not only pleasantly surprised, but Coco has reached Finding Nemo and a Bug's Life levels for me. Coco praises the idea of family, music, and is filled with beautiful animation and many tearful and intense moments that put you on the edge of your seat. The music is also the music is spectacular, and as great talent behind them.I went to the theater thinking that I was going to see a great short and a decent film, but instead I got a great short and a fantastic film.",,Anonymous,Animation
A Visual Spectacle with a Warm Message,"12 year old Miguel comes from a family with a longstanding ban on any kind of music due to his musician great-great grandfather walking out on the family. Naturally, Miguel's passion is music which he pursues hidden from his family. After he gets transported to the land of the dead on Day of the Dead he must obtain his ancestors' blessing to return to the world of the living. When they won't give him the blessing without him swearing off music, he embarks on a quest to find his great-great grandfather and get his blessing.Coco may be the most visually beautiful of all the Pixar movies. The stellar animation is filled with color and brings the land of the dead to life. Excellent voice work helps to make Coco one of Pixar's better works.Coco is a great movie for kids and adults alike, though it may be a little heavy for the youngest children due to the importance of death to the story. At its core, Coco is a great story about the importance of family and honoring your ancestors.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Coco"" Movie Review","Optimistic, talented, Miguel ventures through a life that has been so terribly unfair to him. His family disapproves of his musical interests, and all his time must be devoted to making shoes, although he has always been a good kid and just wants to follow his dreams. Miguel must make a tough decision when it comes down to his dreams and family. He finds himself in an extraordinary world like no other, and with the help of his fallen ancestors and role model, Ernesto de la Cruz, in the Land of the Dead, maybe he has a chance to end the banishment of music in his family once and for all...I hardly started in ""Coco"", and already I see the exceptional visual effects and soundtrack that sets this movie apart from any animated movie I have ever seen. This movie comes to show that animation is a medium, not an age category for little kids, therefore proving that it can be interesting to any age. The movie ""Coco"" makes for a very special viewing due to the beautiful message that reminds you to listen to your heart, follow your dreams, and above all put family first.I was in awe by ""Coco"" and what made me love it, even more, was how different, yet remarkable it was, than your traditional Spanish animated movies. When I began taking Spanish in the 7th grade, I remember watching the movie ""The Book of Life"" in class. I thought it was amazing. I was able to learn so much about The Day of the Dead, and the rituals that are practiced. Then I saw ""Coco"". It set ""The Book of Life"" apart by a far shot. ""The Book of Life"" showed us the meaning of true love, and finding your person despite all the obstacles you may face. That was the first thing that set it apart from ""Coco"". ""Coco"" not only shows how love conquers all, but it also showed the meaning of love within a family. Since I do know quite a bit about this special holiday, I am able to say that both films did a tremendous job capturing the idea of The Day of the Dead, and why it is so important in many Spanish speaking countries. As similar as these two movies are, I have never seen any movie quite like ""Coco"", when it comes to the message behind it all.Like I said before, one of the main attraction's of the film ""Coco"" is its astonishing visual effects. The two worlds in this movie are connected by beautiful orange marigold's. When the filmmakers had the idea for this movie, they did lots of research on The Day of the Dead and found out that families lay marigolds out on streets connecting all the way to their ofrenda (or alter) with pictures and memories of their loved ones. In connection to this holiday, marigolds are so important, because they help guide the spirit of a family's loved one home. The bright orange marigold bridge was brought to life through the latest animation technology, and it was an exquisite view for everyone. The inspiration for the Land of the Dead was the hilly Mexican town of Guanajuato, that had beautiful lights surrounding the town bringing it to life at night. The scene where we first see the Land of the Dead in ""Coco"" was shot with 7 million lights, giving it it's luminous colors and shapes that bring the whole story to life. The breathtaking animation makes this movie definitely worth seeing.Yet another main attraction of the movie, ""Coco"", is it's the euphonious soundtrack. This film features an original score from Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino (the composer who wrote the songs from Disney's ""Up""), a song by Oscar winners Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, and additional songs co-written by Germaine Franco and co-director and screenwriter Adrian Molina. Director Lee Unkrich said, ""Coco' has music in its DNA,"" which is why it features a variety of beautiful Mexican music. Franco explored a wide variety of instrumentation to write these songs, including a guitarron, folkloric harp, a Quijada, sousaphone, charcheta, yjaranas, requintos, marimba, trumpets, and violins. The traditional Mexican songs in this movie, bring the characters and town to life and inspire the main character Miguel to venture on a risky path towards being a musician. There was so much work put into all of the songs, including the hit song ""Remember Me"", which was written as both a lullaby and an upbeat song. The soundtrack leaves you blown away, and the creativity put into each song makes it even better.From this movie, 12-year-old Miguel learns the true meaning of family, and the sacrifices you have to make. The script has some inspirational quotes that melt your heart, and leave you wishing for more. One of the first times Miguel realizes the importance of family is towards the end of the movie when he says, ""We may have our differences, but nothing is more important than family."" This quote is important to the storyline because Miguel realized that no matter your differences and your goals in life, you'll always have one thing in common, and that's the bond and love you share for each other. Although Miguel learns to cherish family, he also learns to follow his dreams, despite the obstacles he faces. Miguel realizes that he is different yet special, when he says, ""I am not like the rest of my family. There's something that makes me different."" He realized that it is one thing to follow your dreams, but first, you have to believe in yourself enough to pursue them, which is something Miguel struggled with. Miguel, as well as other characters, teach you to always put family first, but to also accept who you are, and to never be afraid to follow your dreams no matter the circumstances.I could go on and on about this movie, but I'll stop there. To conclude, ""Coco"" is a vibrant story of family, fun, and adventure with remarkable characters, visual effects, and a soundtrack that gives the story liveliness. With crazy twists, and lifelong lessons, this movie is by far one of the best films to see, and I promise you when I say that it will truly melt your heart, because in the long run, being yourself matters more than you know.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The best disney film !,"This animation movie talks about a family hater music but Miguel wants to be a musician. Miguel goes to the land of the dead from Hector to make his dream come true.In my opinion the movie is funny and unpredictable, the visuals are colorful and very beautiful and the music is very funny and joyful. The story is very original because it talks about the land of the dead in Mexico, and touching because the other of the family are so endearing. I love the other Hector, he is very funny and nice, he his voiced by Gael Garcia Bernal. And I love Lee Unkrich, he is the best director of animation movie.

It Was OK !,"Coco is a new pixar film that talks about a boy whose dream is to play music but his family believes that music has a curse on their family then the boy enters the land of the dead to find the real story behind all that.I didn't hear anything thing if the film I've only known the film about two weeks later and I was a little surprised that it got released already.I guess I enjoyed the film for the most parts at least, the story was soo original and I seriously don't recall any film as same as Coco but was it great ? Or by most critics who said it was ""best pixar film"" absolutely NOT the film was very enjoyable and original as I said but it really don't deserve all the praise it got I mean I could easily name at least 10 better pixar films !The music/songs were original and good well it has to be that's what the film is about right ? I actually liked one or two songs that I don't know the name of but they were good.Speaking as for the story as I said it was very special one you from the start really feel the boy's love for music and you want him to accomplish his dream and of course in every Disney ○ Pixar film there should be an emotional moment but for that one I really couldn't feel it maybe I expected a bit more I don't know but it's wasn't a very emotional ending as most said maybe it's just me !Coco was an OK pixar film the main thing I liked about it is the original story and maybe some of the songs, I don't think that I'm going to see it again thus the main thing that I do every time after I watch a good film that I liked is to wait until the film got release to watch again or just watch some scenes on YouTube, but sadly not for Coco, don't get me wrong as I said I liked the film but it's only good at a first watch that about it for me.And there's also an unnecessary, waste of time 21 MINUTES introduction to Olaf's Frozen Adventure film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Omg, ""NO""","The CGI in this movie is great . But the story line was pointless and nothing to do with Coco. It was more about the family Rivera. It's should of been called, ""Miguel"" or the "" the Rivera's"".",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Is family a dream-killer or quite the opposite?,"As the father of a little girl, I shouldn't mind that the world of animation became a platform designed to preach ""girl power""... but channeling my inner child, I was waiting for one Disney movie to be about a boy... it's silly I know, but maturity isn't kids' strongest suit.So I had an instant liking on ""Coco""... and the boy inside cheered, little did I know that the adult outside would weep. Damn great films, just when you think you've seen them all, there comes a little gem of imagination that catches you off guard and grab you by the heart and plunge you in a universe that look magnificent on screen yet the magnificence is nothing compared to the inner beauty of the story.""Coco"" starts with your ""typical"" Disney family, but you've got to love how atypical they are from Disney standards, yet typical in an archetypical way. The Riveras, four generations of proud shoemakers and perhaps the only Mexican people to have banished music from their life... because the previous matriarch of the family was abandoned by her husband to pursue his career as a singer (the backstory-sequence is colorfully rendered in the beginning). The singer died, Music became a taboo and a golden rule was to never mention his name, ever. His last connection with the world of the living is Mama Coco, the great-grandmother of Miguel.Miguel is also your ""typical"" rebellious kid, his dream is to become a musician, he loves music and his idol is the great Ernesto de la Cruz, a crooner-idol who died too soon in a freak accident. ""Seize your moment"" is the legend's motto, a hymn to every dreamer who wants to be a doer. And even if the phrasing conveys some opportunistic undertones, we want to embrace it, because well, isn't that the most valuable lesson to teach kids? (especially when you have every member of a family leagued against a child, wasting his talent).But this isn't exactly what the writers of ""Coco"" had in mind... sure, the Riveiras strike as quite annoying dream-killers, sure, music is important but it's less an end than a mean, a mean to reconcile the present with the past, to resurrect memories that have been buried in a ground of misunderstanding and bitterness. The magic of ""Coco"" is to translate matters of life, family and death into fantasy elements and dazzling visuals, just like ""Inside Out"" did with life and family period.""Don't forget me, I'll always be there"" says a dying character while pointing his index on his beloved one's heart, it's a common cliché but it's the only relief one could take with him to the 'long road"". And ""Coco"" turns it into a simple but heartbreaking song, ""Remember me"" and it says a lot about our deepest needs in lif... whether you believe in it or not, after watching ""Coco"", you just want to believe in an afterlife that allows to live as long as you're being remembered... aren't we all in the same boat after all?Maybe not. Maybe fame is the ultimate the antidote against oblivion. Maybe that's why many people dream of posterity... yet ""Coco"" doesn't say that posterity doesn't matter, it just says that it doesn't matter the way you think it does. And it simply gives a meaning to the idea of being part of a family in case some of us have forgotten. We don't choose our families, but they're part of our DNA, it's there from the start and no matter how far we go, we can never forget where we started especially when we want to move forward. Remember Mufasa's words to Simba about forgetting himself.Miguel sees his future in music, and his journey takes him to the Land of the Dead, where dead people are much alive, hanging on the memories of their families and their celebration during the 'Day of the Dead', the only occasion for them to visit the real world in a night where their pictures are surrounded with personal items, candles and flower petals. Ever since Disney's seminal ""Dance of Skeletons"", there seems to be a mix of fascination and revulsion with the world of the dead Disney. But it's only fitting that a universe that killed so many characters could provide us a light of hope and allow the dead to show up once in a while like in ""The Lion King"".Maybe it's a clever way to tell kids that death isn't final, the real death one when we're forgotten, maybe the reasons humans live long enough to see their grandchildren grow is to being remembered for a much longer time. The adventure in the world of the Dead with Hector, all the dead Riveras and de la Cruz is an adventure like only Disney animators at the top of their game can provide, but the film reminded me of many other life-changing classics that made me think.""It's a Wonderful Life"" made me wish more people could forgive themselves for so-called failures, ""Back to the Future"" warned me that a simple choice can lead to failure and there was no coming back. ""Coco"" filled my mind with similar thoughts, so many people die without coming to terms, living apart while they have so much to share and so many grandchildren don't realize what a blessing having grandparents still alive because we're blinded by ego or by dreams.This is how the film spoke to me, we all wish to accomplish big things but sometimes, instead of seizing the moments, we make the ""wise"" choice... in a world that cherishes dreamers, starting with Disney... so we spend our life blaming ourselves for these choices. ""Coco"" made me feel like Dorothy ended up saying ""There's no place like home"", the film moved me and made me feel a little better with my choices... and that was something I didn't see co-coming.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Don't forget the feeling of being loved and loved,"I couldn't stop crying while watching this movie. I miss my father, he died when I was 6 years old. I don't have many memories of him, I just remember that he loved me very much. Mom always says I look like my dad and I'm smart like dad. Being forgotten is the second death. Family is very important to us, we can't avoid the loss of loved ones, but we should keep in mind the feeling of being loved and loved. If possible, I really hope my father can accompany me to grow up.Pixar Animation Studios is really a tear harvester. Every time I see his movies about family themes, I am really moved. I actually knew the general story before I saw the movie, but it didn't affect my experience. The soundtrack in the movie is really very nice. After watching this movie, I have a kind of impulse to understand the cultural customs of Mexican people. This may be the power of cultural transmission. It is common for an ancient people to remember the way they came and to remember their ancestors. In Chinese culture, on Tomb-sweeping Day, we go to clean the cemetery and cook a meal at home to invite our dead ancestors back home. I like movies with cultural stories, which makes me realize the meaning of human history.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Day Of The Dead Authenticity/movie review,"I would rate the movie Coco (directed by Lee Unkrich) a 10/10 in terms of all-around entertainment and Cultural accuracy. The cultural piece I want to focus on the most is the depiction of El Dia de Los Muertos more specifically how accurate their traditions were in the movie and see if they accurately celebrated the famous Spanish holiday. One of the most important traditions of El Dia de Los Muertos is the offering table, every family has their own offering table where everything on it serves as a symbol for something else(Avila, Lisa. ""A Day To Remember Family."" A Day To Remember Family, 5 Nov. 2011, pp. 1-1.Elibrary.). This held true in Coco where on Miguel's offering table he had old shoes of his shoemaking ancestors and some of their favorite meals and snacks all offering as a symbol of something they liked or did in their past life. Another common thing to do on El Dia de Los Muertos is to visit the graveyard for a big party. Families bring a huge feast to eat while they clean tombstones, sing songs, and talk to their ancestors(Kelleher, Elizabeth. ""Day of the Dead."" Kids' Games, Animals, Photos, Stories, and More, National Geograohic Kids, 28 Sept. 2016, kids.nationalgeographic.com/explore/celebrations/day-of-the-dead) . Even though we did not see Miguel's family celebrating at the graveyard it is clear other families took to the graveyard to celebrate as we could see after Miguel got cursed into the afterlife. Overall Coco Is a culturally accurate and entertaining movie and I would definitely recommend watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""death is not the end, forgetting is.""","I have seen coco three times and each time I see it, I have different feelings. If I watch it for the first time intoxicated with the gorgeous exotic culture of the Day of the Dead in Mexico, and even want to fly to Mexico to feel the enthusiastic and unrestrained local customs,I watch it again and cry for the heart-touching song""Remember me"" over and over again, then the third time is to pay attention to the interpretation of ""death culture"". The last time I watched it with my six-year-old sister, she asked me at the end of the movie , ""if one day our relatives die, will they also wait for us to commemorate them in the kingdom of the dead?"" I suddenly realized that we always avoid death in East Asian culture , and we regarded it as a tragic disappearance rather than a day worth celebrating. We are avoiding death and afraid of talking about the days that make us sad, but forget the most important point, ""death is not the end, forgetting is."" For us,our departed families are not far away. As long as we are still missing them and the family ties are still there, they will also look at the people they love deeply in another world.Thanks to Coco, I finally said to my little sister ""They will. Although we don't have the Day of the Dead, as long as we still remember them, they will definitely come back to visit us in any way. We can't deny that we love each other deeply."" As you can see, education about death is condensed in this film,I really love it and recommend it to all of you.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Land of the Dead is depicted as a visually stunning, colorful world, filled with glowing marigold bridges, spirit guides, and vibrant skeletons, all brought to life with Pixar's signature animation prowess.At the heart of *Coco* is its exploration of the importance of family bonds, memory, and heritage. The film beautifully conveys the idea that remembering and honoring loved ones keeps them alive in our hearts. Its message is deeply touching, especially in its portrayal of how the power of music and family traditions can transcend generations.The movie is also celebrated for its respectful and authentic representation of Mexican culture, with a talented voice cast and original music, including the Oscar-winning song *Remember Me.* *Coco* is a heartfelt and visually enchanting film that resonates with both children and adults, leaving a powerful and emotional impact long after the credits roll.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Divine,"Pixar delves deeper into the realm of difficult and hard to visually conceptualise subject areas with its family-friendly film about death, 'Coco', while setting the story in Mexico with the main character, a young boy striving to become a musician named Miguel, classifying as a minority under Trump's America. The Land of the Dead, the setting for a large portion of the film, is an interpretation of traditional Mexican beliefs that are realised in the film alongside a deliberate avoidance of any religious connotations or messages. The dog - a Xoloitzcuintli, native animals to Mesoamerica historically believed to guide dead souls to the underworld - is named Dante in reference to the Italian poet Dante Alighieri, whom travelled through the underworld and returned in his epic, 'The Divine Comedy', ultimately to the same objective as Miguel in informing the living of the greater truth that they have learnt in their travels. As much as Dante's Divine Comedy is structured around the religious values that shaped medieval understandings of the world, 'Coco' is about family, and its messages are equally about the bringing about of a more socially unified world. Especially in the current climate where social division has been prevailing more than ever in recent times, commonly reflected through the sentiment pervading border control policies, 'Coco' provides a vision of all the good that perhaps we have been forgetting, and a landscape where border control is not about division but about bringing families together.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It didn't quite make sense either.-First 30 minutes explaining how family absolutely hates, hates, hates music. Even has fear of music. 
-Main character can go into the dead world seen by the dead while alive. He is in the live world while being alive but can't be seen.More than anything, when a conflict is based on the lack of communication, it makes for a waist of 1 1/2 of time. Had they just explained that Mr ______ was the family's _____. Mr _____ is related to the family and didn't return because Mr ____ did this terrible thing. The family won't give main character a blessing unless he promises ____, nothing else.

Music is always important to any film, but it has such a different essence in Coco.Coco is an emotional love letter to Mexican culture and is masterfully depicted in stunning animation and art design., The colors are as vibrant as the characters. The celebration of family and ancestry is core to Miguel's journey as he experiences the realm of the dead. Miguel himself is a treasure. That scene when we first see him play guitar makes me cry.... Well many moments from this movie makes me cry.When you think about Coco, what scene stands out to you the most? Everyone's answer is the ending. Miguel tries to help Coco remember her father, and when nothing worked, music did. A scene that hits hard whether or not you have a relative with Alzheimer's, that moment brought all the themes together. Music allowed the memories to come back and Coco told stories of her father, making sure the memories of Hector remain in the family. ""He loved you, Mama Coco. He loved you so much."" That scene.

Far be it from me to speculate as to why something like this...,"...captures people's hearts and imaginations but something also appropriating culture like Isle of Dogs was marginally reviled for it.

My girlfriend's niece, at 5 years old, couldn't watch this film as the skulls apparently scared her. I look forward to the time where she begins to grasp what death is about and can shed some of her fear of it by watching this film and understanding how another culture celebrates and deals with the most natural of things.
Yes it's another animated film with a silly animal sidekick and yes it all plays out exactly as expected, with just the same beats and just as briskly, but it's visually fresh and physically comedic and touches on some of the balanced ideas about art and fame, family and sacrifice, memory and forgiveness.
Overall I enjoyed it better than I thought I would and I might even watch it again some day although there's little else to be gleaned from it, it won't be boring.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Dead with love, all together","Pixar is not for nothing one of the best animation studios, it is behind Toy Story, Walle or Up, among many others.
Now Coco brings us that tells us like never the day of the dead of Mexico.
It is an easy film in the sense that the themes of the film are clearly exposed in dialogues, which a priori would be bad, but when thinking about children it is understood. These themes, however, are extremely transcendental and are carried with great care and affection. These topics are for adults because they are in the background.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Disappointing and Overrated: ""Coco"" Falls Flat","As an avid fan of Pixar films, I was eagerly anticipating ""Coco,"" but unfortunately, it failed to meet even the lowest of expectations. From the contrived plot to the lackluster character development, this movie left me utterly underwhelmed.First and foremost, the storyline felt cliché and predictable, lacking any originality or depth. It seemed as though the writers took a generic template and slapped on a few cultural elements to make it appear fresh. The supposed twists were easily foreseeable, leaving little room for genuine surprise or engagement.Moreover, the characters were painfully one-dimensional, failing to evoke any real emotion or connection. Miguel, the protagonist, was bland and unrelatable, making it difficult to invest in his journey. Even the side characters lacked substance, serving as mere props to propel the lackluster plot forward.Additionally, while the animation was visually stunning, it couldn't compensate for the glaring flaws in storytelling. Stunning visuals alone cannot salvage a film devoid of heart and soul.In conclusion, ""Coco"" is an overhyped disappointment that falls short of Pixar's usual standard of excellence. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this forgettable film. I give it a generous 1 out of 10 stars.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Charming fantasy, made with pure love for country, culture, music and life itself","I never thought that Pixar had lost their touch necessarily, but I did think they'd left me behind. As a kid, seeing the original ""Toy Story"", I saw them make history with the first fully CGI film. I knew, then, that animation had changed forever, and that 3D animation was going to replace 2D. I also knew that this wasn't a bad thing, as Pixar proved everybody wrong who thought that CGI could never be as charming as traditional animation - or feature as much emotional impact.I thought I'd go on loving Pixar flicks my whole life, and whereas it's true that I can still appreciate their quality, I found myself left out of the party with some of their more recent, celebrated movies like ""Up"" and ""Inside Out"". Those movies weren't bad at all, I just expected to love them and be moved by them as much as I was by the first two Toy Story movies, and I wasn't.I didn't want to go on being disappointed by a company I loved, so I was wary of watching more of their flicks, until I read about ""Coco"", and saw that it is the most popular movie in Mexican history, despite being an entirely American production. I have always felt that the biggest test of a movie about a foreign culture is how people from that culture receive it. I don't care so much how an American movie about Mexico does in America, or even here in Australia: you know it succeeded in its mission if it takes off in Mexico, and it was phenomenally successful there.Despite the problems the country has with crime, gang warfare and corrupt governments, the culture of Mexico is absolutely irrepressible, and is famous worldwide for that reason. ""Coco"" feels totally authentic in its tribute to this culture, and even in its depiction of Mexican family life. Pixar clearly went all-out, not only in securing legendary Mexican talents as voice actors such as Edward James Olmos and Cheech Marin (and found a typically fantastic newcomer to voice the protagonist, as they did with ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Moana). They also went deep into Mexican culture to represent a loving and authentic portrait of it on the big screen.This is not all, though, and I want anyone who reads this to pay attention to this bit: to me, ""Coco"" was also a return to form for Pixar's storytelling prowess, featuring some very impactful revelations, and the company's legendarily effective pathos.""Coco"" is a fantastic movie in a number of different ways, and a latter day classic from Pixar.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Still a cinematic masterpiece,"Coco was magical, ever since I watched it, but i wanted to watch it again to see if it's still what it felt like, and honestly, as an adult, it felt even more powerful and meaningful then I thought.Firstly, the animation and theme setting are both wonderful, the city of the dead looks absolutely glorious and beautiful and the art style really compliments the overall aesthetic of the movie.Secondly, the story is wonderful, watching a kid developing his passion into his strength and reuniting his family on the way is a beautiful journey and felt even more impactful watching it as an adult.Anyway, this movie is definitely not short of amazing, and I would love to have the feeling of watching it for the first time again because the ending is an absolute masterpiece of emotions and familial love, and I couldn't recommend this movie enough :)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I had no prior knowledge of this movie whatsoever.Coco not only caught me off guard, but it also has what I believe to be the greatest, most in-depth plot I've ever seen in an animated film.

It's Pretty Good,"I'm quite a bit late to the party, but I would say that it's pretty good. There are moments where it gets a bit cringe worthy, it kind of slows to a crawl at points, and it struggled to keep my attention at times, but it's a solid movie. The best part of the movie was at the tail end of it. Roughly, the last 30 minutes was the most exciting and entertaining part of the movie. I honestly would have liked the movie to have followed that plot point a bit more, but it does set the lore of the world really well. I do feel like I waited too long to see it, though. It maybe would have had a greater impact on me a few years ago. Right now, I just sort of feel like it was a solid, but standard movie. Not bad, but also not really living up to all the hype that I'd heard about it at the time. I often find that to be the case with movies that get super hyped by the general public, though. I'd watch it again, but I would also be okay with missing the first half of the movie and coming in on the latter half where things get really good. I will say this, the colors were beautiful. It was such a wonderfully colorful movie. I wish that I could have been younger when I saw this. I think if I had been, it would have resonated with me more. As it is, it's quite decent. Very good even. It just didn't hold my attention as well as I would have liked, and the most interesting and entertaining part of the movie was more of a footnote to the main movie. As to how well Pixar embraced and represented the culture, I can't really speak for it myself. It seems like they embraced it all very well, but far be it for me to say for certain without knowing enough about it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""La llorona""","I've watched ""Coco"" countless time and every time I'm watching it like for the first time. And one day watching it I thought if it is impossible to say what is better, for example, ""Coco"" or ""Ratatouille"" maybe I can try to figure out what is the best episode in animation? That's also very difficult question but on my opinion the episode when Imelda accidentally is forced to do forbidden is told so artfully and keeps so many senses, beauty and elevates the story on the ""Olympus"" of storytelling. ""La Llorona"" is the most powerful thing I have ever heard. It is not ""the song for the song sake"" like in Disney. ""La llorona"" is the quintessence of the woman's tragedy. If Gods should tell us the example of a deftly storytelling, they definitely could tell the story of Imelda, how and why she sings with her husband again after decades of separation.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Though visually stunning, and wonderfully enjoyable, Coco isn't as deep as it first seems","After watching the trailers for Coco, I wasn't sold. I didn't laugh at any of the jokes, nor did I find any of the characters endearing enough to justify dedicating almost two hours of my life to. Regardless, I saw it anyway; I've been attempting to see films I thought I won't enjoy recently, but yet again, I've been surprised.I will quickly say that I don't think Coco is a masterpiece. I'm not entirely convinced it's even 'great'. I still enjoyed it, however, and that's good enough for me.The main talking point for the film seems to be the visuals, and for the most part, I can understand why. It's certainly a very pretty film. You can see how much time and care went into each frame, and I can't even comprehend being one of the animators on a project like this. With this said, however, I don't feel I witnessed anything revolutionary in terms of animation. While my memory might be wrong, I believe this film to be on a similar level to Moana. That's definitely not a negative; Moana's probably my favourite animated film in recent memory, primarily due to it's animation.The brilliant visuals do bring a flaw, however. With all of the wondrous colours assaulting your vision, it comes full circle, and ceases to be impressive after a while. There is simply too much colour for me to enjoy the film as a whole. I'll use a scene from Rogue One as an example. Regardless of your thoughts on the film, one of the final scenes featuring a certain Sith Lord was generally considered to be brilliant, at least amongst fans. The absence of colour, followed by the jarringly bright crimson adds to the scene, and doesn't simply exist to be pretty to look at. Sometimes, less is more.The soundtrack was rather mixed, too. Parts were very fitting, and added to the scene. Other parts, however, sounded like generic Disney filler that could have been pasted into any other film and work just as well.Since the film features music, primarily guitars, rather prominently, I also found myself confused at moments; I heard somebody playing the guitar, but the character actually holding it wasn't doing anything. It took me a few moments to realise it was actually the scoring.Additionally, while this movie is obviously aimed for the family, I found many of the plot-points rather obvious. It intentionally makes it's plot unnecessarily complicated in an attempt to fool you, but if you understand basic storytelling tropes, you'll pick up on the plot rather promptly, even if the film changes specific elements just to surprise a few people. The film feels as though it's trying to be surprising, and sad, and funny, rather than letting it's scenes speak for themselves. Much of it feels forced, at least to me.Many of the characters also weren't particularly likeable. The main character, Miguel, comes across as a legitimately bad person many times in this film, and everyone else doesn't fare much better. Obviously, the villain is cruel, but also those who we're supposed to like are selfish and unpleasant. I thought that at the end perhaps they'd apologise and acknowledge their wrongdoings, but it never happens. Only Miguel has to change himself in this film, and he still gets everything he wants in the end anyway.Overall, this film actually struggles to excel in specific areas. It's very serviceable, with bits dipping below average, and others rising above. Thankfully, the pros manage to outweigh the cons, making Coco an enjoyable film, regardless of how simple it's message is. I'll give it a shaky 7/10, though if you enjoy all other Disney films, or the general aesthetic of the movie, you'll most likely love this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Coco"" will have you coming back from the Land of the Dead to watch it","I watched the movie ""Coco"" on Friday, November 30. I think that it was a delightful movie. Some family reunions in the movie will make you want to cry. ""Coco"" also has some scenes that will make you laugh your pants off. .The movie is about following your dreams but also remembering about your family. I think that the actors and actresses act just like their characters. They talk like how their characters would and reacted how they would react to something. I think that the whole cast of ""Coco"" did a great job. It really is an excellent movie to watch with your whole family""Coco"" was released on November 22, 2017. The movie took place in Mexico on the Day of the Dead, October 31. The main characters are Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez), Mamá Coco (Ana Ofelia Murguía), Hector (Gael García Bernal), Mamá Imelda (Alanna Ubach), and Ernesto De La Cruz (Benjamin Bratt).""Coco"" is about a young boy, Miguel, who wants to follow his dream of becoming a musician. Miguel's family hates music, but that is the only thing that makes him happy. His idol is Ernesto De La Cruz. On the Day of the Dead, Miguel finds out that there is going to be a talent show and he wants to sing and play the guitar. However, he didn't have his own instrument. He asks everyone to borrow their guitar, but no one lets him. Then, Miguel remembers that there is a church dedicated to Ernesto De La Cruz in the middle of the cemetery. In the church are his coffin and guitar. Miguel breaks one of the glass windows and gets inside. He gets the guitar and plays the strings. All the people outside of the church finds out that the guitar got stolen. When Miguel tries to apologize to a guard that came inside the church, the guard passes right through him. Miguel finds out that he turned into a ghost. He exits the church and enters the Land of the Dead. Miguel finds his dead ancestors that are now skeletons. His ancestors find and take him to Mama Imelda to get his blessing before morning. If he doesn't, then he'll become a skeleton just like his ancestors and live in the Land of the Dead forever. He gets his blessing by Mama Imelda but doesn't follow all of her conditions which sends him back to the Land of the Dead. Miguel wants to get a blessing by his idol. He wants to find Ernesto De La Cruz to get his blessing and find out why his family hates music before it's too late.I liked that ""Coco"" shows and talks about different traditions to the next level. At the beginning of the movie, the houses were all decorated with Papel Picados, Marigolds, lots of fruits, and pictures of their past away ancestors. I think that the moral of the story is about thinking about your family before following your dream.I'm assuming that other people who watch ""Coco"" will learn the same moral as I did.I would recommend this movie to those who like fantasies and mysteries. Though, I would not recommend it to like realistic films and to those who skip the movie/shows to the end to reveal the secret. If you don't like musical movies than you wouldn't want to watch ""Coco,"" either. The MPAA rating of ""Coco"" is a PG meaning that any age of children can watch it, but parents are advised to watch with the younger kids. My final rating for ""Coco"" is 5/5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Coco is a heartwarming tale that hosts an array of memorable characters on a beautiful Mexican canvas.,"Pixar rarely put a foot wrong, but lately their animations have become slightly uninspired (I'm looking at you 'Cars' franchise). Fortunately they are back, detailing an imaginative world with some extremely creative intricacies. A young boy who wishes to become a musician is forced to continue his family's legacy. Rebelliously he ignores his family's wishes and steals a guitar, to which he suddenly becomes cursed and now resides in the afterlife. This is probably as adventurous a film can be for children in regards to portraying death. Highlighting the importance of remembering loved ones and embracing your family, it's an extremely tender story that rather touched my heart. Trust Pixar to make me emotionally vulnerable. On top of this it's packed full of Mexican culture, in particular the Dia De Los Muertos (""Day of the Dead"" between you and me) event that is brimming with hearty family values. Miguel, our protagonist, starts off as a stubborn rebel but slowly succumbs to the realisation that others are just as important. Being surrounded by his deceased relatives develops him as a character, to which we emotionally become invested in him and the story itself. A few twists and turns to keep all viewers engaged. Absolutely gorgeous animation, especially the afterlife world which is populated with vibrant spirit animals and colourful architecture. An all Mexican cast is much appreciated and definitely enhances the authenticity of this production, the voice acting and musical numbers were both executed perfectly. ""Remember Me"" was a beautiful song, its lyrics pulled me in. The humour doesn't always hit, and that really is my only flaw. The screenplay just tried too hard. Having said that, this is one of Pixar's better animations in recent years and continues their powerful hold of the genre. That ending though...urgh, I nearly teared up.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Coco: A Musical Journey to Remember,"""Coco"" is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful film that tells the story of a young boy named Miguel who dreams of becoming a musician, despite his family's generations-old ban on music. The film is a celebration of family, tradition, and the power of following one's dreams.One of the standout features of the film is its breathtaking animation. The colors, textures, and details of the landscapes and characters are truly mesmerizing. The film's depiction of the Land of the Dead is particularly impressive, with its vibrant colors and intricate designs.The voice acting is also top-notch, with newcomer Anthony Gonzalez delivering a heartfelt and endearing performance as Miguel. The film's supporting cast, which includes Gael García Bernal, Benjamin Bratt, and Renée Victor, also turns in strong performances. The chemistry between the characters is palpable and helps to make the emotional moments in the film all the more impactful.However, the film is not without its flaws.

Buenos Nachos!,"My Nephew (The 22 year old) insisted that I watch this film because, and I quote, ""It's the best!"" Why I should choose to listen to him on this occasion, when his taste is dubious at the best of times, is quite beyond me.The Disney films of late just don't seem to have the charm for me that they used to and although this is one of the better ones, it is still lacking that certain something special or magic that Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Aladdin, Beauty & The Beast, The Lion King, Little Mermaid and even Snow White all had.I don't know if it's that the stories have all become a bit more teenaged rather than child orientated or whether I have just become a grouch?I can totally see that if I was a Mexican child, it might mean the world to me that Disney had finally released a film that I could connect to as a recognition of my heritage and even as a British 40 year old I can appreciate that, but I don't know if there's enough about the Day Of The Dead to educate the rest of us and gives us the chance to appreciate it fully.It's easy viewing, but I want to be wowed when I watch a Disney film. I want to come away from the experience in awe, with an overwhelming need and desire to tell everybody about it, as I did with those listed above. They're not always going to have a huge hit on their hands, but I do expect them to have some understanding as to which formulas work best by now, they have been doing it for a while after all. It does come close, but there's no cigar.It's an interesting story and the characters are likeable for the most part. As I have said above, it is nice to see another culture recognised in order for those of us that live so far away to gain some knowledge of what the Day Of The Dead is all about or at least spark an interest.Some of the humour is a bit slapstick and that's fine, but it needed an injection of other funny things too, maybe something for the adults hidden away as well. It might have been good to show the evolution that had occurred by making it more obvious that it was 2017, as the setting all still seemed to be quite old fashioned, not even a mobile phone in sight. I think this would have shown how the world had changed since the original issue started, giving a clearer picture of why it was so unfair that Miguel wasn't allowed to like music.Personally, I hate the injustice of films like this, where elders impose their views on the youth. It took me 3 attempts to get all the way through Footloose for that very reason. It just seemed to far fetched.I can see that it would appeal to kids for its bright and colourful, graphic images as well as its fast pace and I can empathise with Miguel, as I firmly believe that music is life. It's not a film that I will die without having it in my collection, but give me a few years and I'd probably quite happily sit and watch it one bank holiday weekend.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brought me to tears,"From the vibrant opening scene to the heartfelt finale, Coco is a cinematic masterpiece that captures the essence of family, tradition, and the power of music. Disney and Pixar have outdone themselves with this extraordinary film that not only entertains but also resonates deeply with audiences of all ages.Phenomenal Storytelling and VisualsCoco tells the story of Miguel, a young boy with a passion for music, living in a family that has banned it for generations. The film explores Miguel's journey as he accidentally finds himself in the Land of the Dead during the Día de los Muertos celebration. What follows is an adventure filled with colorful characters, rich cultural references, and a plot that keeps you hooked the entire time.The animation is nothing short of breathtaking. The vibrant colors and intricate details of the Land of the Dead are awe-inspiring, creating a visually stunning experience that immerses you in this fantastical world. The character designs, especially the skeletal inhabitants of the afterlife, are both imaginative and endearing, bringing a unique charm to the film.Beautifully Written SongsOne of the standout aspects of Coco is its music. The songs are beautifully written, seamlessly blending traditional Mexican music with a contemporary touch. Each song not only complements the narrative but also enhances the emotional depth of the story. The standout track, ""Remember Me,"" is a poignant anthem that encapsulates the film's themes of memory and legacy. It's a song that lingers long after the credits roll, reminding us of the power of music to connect us across time and space.The film's score, composed by Michael Giacchino, adds another layer of magic to the experience. It captures the vibrancy of Mexican culture, weaving together melodies that evoke joy, sorrow, and nostalgia. The musical elements of Coco are so integral to the story that they become characters in their own right, guiding Miguel on his journey and bringing the narrative to life in a way that words alone could not achieve.A Story of Family and IdentityAt its core, Coco is a story about family and the importance of understanding one's heritage. The film beautifully portrays the complexities of family dynamics, especially when traditions clash with individual desires. Miguel's journey is not just about discovering his love for music but also about understanding and reconciling with his family's past. The Land of the Dead serves as a poignant metaphor for the importance of remembering and honoring those who came before us.The film also tackles the universal theme of pursuing one's passion against all odds. Miguel's determination to follow his musical dreams, despite his family's disapproval, is a powerful message for anyone who has ever felt torn between their desires and societal expectations. Coco encourages viewers to embrace their true selves and follow their passions, while also recognizing the value of family and tradition.A Heartfelt ConclusionThe emotional depth of Coco is undeniable. The film's climax is a tear-jerking moment that brings the story full circle, leaving the audience with a profound sense of closure. The themes of memory, love, and legacy are explored with such tenderness and care that it's impossible not to be moved.In conclusion, Coco is a phenomenal film that captivates from start to finish. The stunning visuals, beautifully written songs, and heartfelt story come together to create an unforgettable experience. It's a celebration of life, culture, and the enduring power of music and memory. Whether you're watching it for the first time or the tenth, Coco is a movie that resonates deeply and leaves a lasting impact. It's a must-watch for anyone who loves a good story, beautiful animation, and soulful music.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Pixar Classic,"Does Disney's Pixar ever do a bad movie? At first I was thinking to myself where this movie was heading...but it turned into a fun filled enjoyable ride they combined great Mexican culture, music, family and the Walking Dead to create this fantastic story. This would be enjoyed by all members of the family. Score: 8.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Criminally abusive family learns nothing,"CocoThis movie is 7 years old, so spoilers are to be expected.A cute movie that focuses on the Day of the Dead, Coco explores the idea that family is the most important thing in the world. Unless you wish to pursue your dreams against the will of a tyrannical matriarch, and then you're physically and emotionally abused.Miguel wishes to be a musician. But his great great grandfather pursued his dreams leading to his wife and daughter to fend for themselves. It doesn't seem to matter that he died before he could return.Flash forward to the present where we see Miguel concealing his dreams because the rest of the family doesn't care about independent thought. He has to run away, which I cheered for, so that he could explore what it's like to perform. However, due to an unexplained phenomenon, he ends up the only living person in the land of the dead.This film then explores the concept that, over time, people become forgotten. The idea that, without photography, a person won't be remembered is a bit shaky. What about those people that existed before that invention? I guess they're all forgotten, and the land of the dead should be a lot less populated. I find it nice that, in order to remember Coco's father, it is music that brings an old woman back to life.I enjoyed the music. I enjoyed the visuals, as always, due to Pixar's attention to detail. I did not enjoy the abuse of ""family"". My friends who grew up in this culture say it is completely normal. That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Withholding love to mold a child to their whims is so abusive, and will lead one to therapy for years.The sudden change back to a family that enjoys music, when the dozens of them hated it before, is lazy writing. The far superior Encanto explores these themes in a much better way, without the need for random abuse masked as love.Again, I found it cute due to the bond that Miguel shares with Hector, and the explanation of family remembering you is paramount. But the real life family is such crap, it really drags the movie down. And the characterization of everyone, except Miguel and Hector, was not done well.It's worth it for the land of the dead sequence and music, but the rest of this movie can be skipped. Go see Encanto instead. You won't be hit with a shoe by narcissistic women.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A magical, wonderful and emotional experience.","I had never seen this movie in theaters due to lack of interest, but after discovering it on Netflix a couple days ago, my curiosity was immediately peeked, and I decided to give it a chance and watch it. I have absolutely no words. ""Coco"" is, without any doubt, whatsoever, a masterpiece of a film and the best one Disney and Pixar's made in decades.The characters are the most sympathetic fictional beings you will ever see on screen; especially Héctor. You are gonna fall in love with all of these characters. The songs, animation, voice acting, morals and writing are brilliant. Seriously, this movie has everything an animated movie SHOULD have; Characters with immense likability, through and through, moving, catchy and emotional songs, the list goes on. Not only does ""Coco"" have things children will enjoy, but it has material adults will love, as well.I could put up many reasons why I think you should see this movie, but be warned; It is bound to make you cry, at points, including a certain plot twist and ending, which I refuse to spoil. After I watched it a couple times, it instantly made me bawl like a baby. I have a very sensitive heart, and this movie ripped it out and showed it to me, full throttle. The plot is handled with such care and love, you won't be able to stop watching. Once the film becomes an emotional and bittersweet rollercoaster ride, and my goodness gracious, does it ever, you feel a sense of peace and happiness shortly afterwards. I thought ""Fluke,"" ""Titanic"" and ""Finding Nemo"" were the only movies to make me cry buckets of tears, but ""Coco"" managed to break that scale.Without question, ""Coco"" is arguably the greatest Disney movie I ever watched. I've grown up with Disney, all my life and this should be up there with ""Pinocchio"" and ""The Lion King"" as their crowning achievement. I have nothing more to say in this review, but the following; I advise anyone who hasn't seen this movie before to watch it. Trust me, it is totally and completely worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

You Will Remember This,"This is Pixar's saddest movie. Now I understand that saying that is no small thing, considering that Pixar runs off of children tears. But the way in which this film focuses on death, family and forgiveness primes the pump for some of the hardest hitting sentimental moments in all of film. Every time Pixar seemed to be off track, they would come back and make a film like this and prove when they are on the top of their game, they are unbeatable. The world of the dead is such a breathtaking world it makes every frame beautiful to see. The music sequences are expertly animated. So, what holds this back from being one of Pixar's best? Well...The story of a family hating music and forbidding a child from pursuing anything musical has been done to death. Of course, the child will have a passion for music, and be gifted in it. But all the family will forbid him from playing music and lessons will be learned. It is just such a tired a predictable storyline. Likewise, I big portion of the movie could be settled if people just sat down and had a normal conversation with each other.It has some of Pixar's worst set ups, but also some of Pixar's very best pay offs. Go go see Coco.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A great movie,"I liked this a lot more than I remembered. Only three or so years have passed since I first watched it, but for whatever reason it hit harder emotionally than it did the first time. It's a bit of a slow-burn, by Pixar's standards, because it saves its best moments for the second half. There are some genuinely good plot twists and very emotional moments, and it tackles the theme of death in a way that hits hard but without feeling like it's too much for younger viewers.Even if the second half is better, I don't think the first half is weak. I actually liked knowing where the plot was going, and appreciating the way it keeps certain things hidden from the audience, only to reveal them at an opportune time. It makes for one of Pixar's less predictable films in recent years.It's also one of their best post-2010 films. I've been a little harsh on ""post-golden age Pixar,"" but they're still capable of putting out really good movies (even into the 2020s, and Soul and Turning Red demonstrate).Coco might not be perfect - as there's a couple of jokes that miss here and there, and I think perhaps one too many things plot-wise that feel a little too convenient - but it really does deliver in presenting an imaginative fantasy world, a compelling story, and a final act that packs a real emotional punch. And like all of the studio's very best films, it feels like the kind of one that just gets better the more you rewatch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

if it is true...,"The whole story is pretty simple but touching: Miguel was restricted by his families to learn music. At the day of the dead he accidentally walked to the land of the dead and figured out the truth, as well as the meaning of dream, love and death!I am surprised by the idea of death Pixar introduces in this cartoon. Actually it is important for children to think about the world after death and realize what's important in their life. If the final death really refers to the moment nobody remembers in real life, then leaving some positive impact when alive is crucial in extending after-death life in another fantasy world. The meaning of life is not about length but depth :)
Also, death is not so fearful: dead people could walk across flower bridge and reunite with their family happily! Greatly appreciate Mexicans created such a memorial but fun festival!Both of great great grandfather and great great grandmother are doing nothing wrong.

Wonderful,"Such a great movie. Really creative. Really entertaining and well done. I love Dash's chase scene. I love the sequence of Helen getting stuck in all the doors. It's brilliant comedy and taking advantage of the sticky situations someone who can stretch can find herself in. I'm kind of astonished at the dark/adult content this movie deals with. Suicide? dead family? Playing getting sucked into a jet engine for laughs? Not to mention one of the most grisly Disney deaths I can think of (Others to me would be Bugs Life and Tarzan). That scene of the jet getting blown up always gets me emotionally. It's super tense and you understand both Helen and Violet's viewpoint of asking Violet to put a force-field around the plane. You're pulling for Violet and yet feel the frustration and fear of Helen. It's edited so well. Ug! I'm gushing. It's also refreshing to see a full family in a family movie. Disney has a lot of broken/single-parents and I get it. It saves money to not have siblings or two parents. it's less complicated. it makes kids like that feel better. But it's so nice to see a movie about family and about what they can accomplish together and show what a family can be. It's really encouraging. One of Pixar's best.

Sweet and entertaining,"Young Miguel is an aspiring musician but his family forbids music of any sort in or around the house. This dates back to his great-great grandfather, who left his family to pursue a musical career. The hero of Miguel's town is the famous (and, several decades-ago, deceased) Ernesto de la Cruz, regarded, in his day, as one of the greatest musicians in the world. Defying his family, Miguel enters a Day of the Dead talent contest but, after his grandmother smashes his guitar, is forced to ""borrow"" Ernesto's guitar from the museum. This sets off a chain of events, resulting in Miguel entering the afterlife and needing to get Ernesto's blessing to re-enter the living world.Sweet, entertaining movie from Disney and Pixar. Energetic with an emotional ending and some interesting takes on family, loss and memories.Not brilliant - it is slanted more towards kids than adults. Once the afterlife segment starts it relies a lot on cheap sight gags involving skeletons' body parts.

One of Pixar's most beautiful creations,"Coco is gorgeous to look at, it's a visual feast for the eyes. The use of color and color palettes is amazing. The movie does a wonderful job at capturing the essence of Hispanic/Mexican culture. It portrays Hispanic culture in an honest, respectful and beautiful way that it would make any Hispanic/Mexican proud and happy. It definitely made me proud to be Hispanic. This movie's funny. I know Pixar always has a way with humor but I wasn't expecting it to include humor that was specific to Spanish-speaking people. There were jokes throughout that caught me off guard and had me laughing really hard.The whole idea and premise for the movie is brilliant. They took an existing Mexican tradition and expanded on the possibilities, asking themselves what it would look like if the Land of the Dead/Afterworld could be physically manifested. The way they bring all their ideas to life on the screen is done in such a beautiful way. There's so much attention to detail and everything is so colorful and gorgeous to look at that it's almost overwhelming. I found myself pausing the movie at times just so I could take a look around at the world and the environments. Seeing the Alebrijes take physical form and come to life in the Land of the Dead was very cool to see.The plot twist with Ernesto De La Cruz and Hector was unexpected, I didn't really see that coming. It was like a curveball right to the gut. It was masterful the way they wrote it. It was clever the way they kept subverting expectations and kept you thinking one thing only to switch it up. It's a beautiful movie about tradition, the importance of family, acceptance, forgiving, understanding, the power of music and following your passion.I can't believe it took me 7 years to watch this movie, but I'm really glad I did. It's an inspiring, endearing and entertaining ride of a movie. I definitely teared up and got excited during it.

"Enjoyable, energetic and emotionally mature; it might even provoke a tear or two.","Pixar have always aimed for a kind of emotional maturity not often seen in family fare and 'Coco (2018)' is no exception, with the only 'kiddy caveats' being its initial abundance of extremely on-the-nose and unnecessarily front-loaded exposition, with some genuine emotional resonance rising from the fairly typical 'finding your family' and 'lost loved-ones' themes that are here elevated through their brilliant execution. You empathise entirely with the musical Miguel at almost every moment, from finding the obtuse stubbornness of his family incredibly frustrating to coming to terms with the sacrifices he must make in order to stay with them, and even the various twists and turns are pretty original (also quite risky) even if I did cotton onto them far before they were actually revealed. It's really enjoyable and, in typical Pixar fashion but maybe more so than before, it might even provoke a tear or two. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

6.8/10,"A boy chasing his dreams, a family bound by tradition, and a world where the dead are more alive than one might expect: Coco uses all the clichés but does it just right, crafting a beautiful story. Vibrant yet sombre, playful yet deeply emotional, it writes a narrative that balances joy and sorrow with remarkable precision. The story unfolds effortlessly, balancing the general kids' film aspect with a deeper storyline, and belonging into a journey that feels both intimate and grand.Visually, it is nothing short of breathtaking. The Land of the Dead is a spectacle, glowing marigolds, intricate cityscapes, and spectral figures that move with a fluidity only possible in animation. Despite not being the ideal audience for an animated children's movie, even I can admit this magic could not have been recreated if not drawn. Every frame is meticulously designed, making the world feel tangible despite its fantastical nature. While I usually lean towards live-action films, I can acknowledge that Coco is an example of animation at its peak, with artistry that speaks for itself.Music is handled with restraint, and the musical-like aspects are well done. It enhances rather than dominates, allowing the narrative to take centre stage. Coco is undeniably crafted for a younger audience, yet its depth and clever writing ensure it resonates beyond childhood. Brilliantly executed, perfectly structured, yet not quite in my personal favourite; a 6.8/10 feels just right.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"With deeper themes, colorful visuals, and the right amount of heart, Coco understands the mexican culture perfectly!","When I saw the previews of the movie, I became interested at the concept of a Pixar film exploring the Mexican culture and Dia de Muertos (AKA The Day of the Dead) and to my surprise back at late 2017, it lived up to my expectations and became one of the best films of that year (including Dunkirk, Wonder Woman, War for the Planet of the Apes, etc.) Sure, it has a cliché about music being forbidden (nothing negative to say about it), but once we got to the Land of the Dead, the rest of the film got a whole lot better.Not only does it have a great plot full of heart and emotion that explores the themes of culture, family, life, and death brilliantly, but the characters motivations made them believable most notably Miguel and Hector. Also, there is a plot twist which I'm not going to spoil to those who haven't seen the film yet. The pacing is really good, the directing is really strong, Michael Giacchino's score is brilliant thanks to it being authentic to the setting the movie takes place, and last but not least the animation. Not only from the expressive character designs on the humans and skeletons on the Land of the Dead, but the visuals themselves which are just as gorgeous as Brave's Scottish setting.I've found myself another favorite Pixar film (heck it's also my favorite CGI animated movie). It's just as good as the Toy Story trilogy, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, and Inside Out. This deserves a LordoftheFuture seal of approval. Recommended! :)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Amazing,"I took my son and his friend to see this recently and it was as excellent as the reviews had suggested.An amazing film in a long-line of animated greats, the key difference here of course is that it exposures the viewer to another culture that is not always portrayed in the best light, if at all.Its a very easy watch and is something you would happily sit through again and again.This is what happens when you set out to make a great and entertaining film that also happens to be culturally enriching without shoving it in your face.Beautifully produced and heartfelt story.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but felt more like a strong modern Disney movie than a Pixar quality.","I just watched this on Netflix and was rather excited. I remembered the hype when this came out and how strong of reviews/ratings were on IMDB. I'm not going to go deep into the story, but I will say I enjoyed myself and it is certainly worth the watch. The music is very good!...but the story is pretty basic. Some twists, some comedy, something about family values, you know a modern Disney movie; it's nothing ground breaking. This is more in line with Brave than Up or Wall-E in terms of Pixar movies. Again, I did enjoy the movie, but the don't pay attention to the overly positive reviews, unless you really enjoy the family matters moral; which to be fair, I'm not a big fan of.

Brilliant Cultural Experience,"Coco is a brilliant Pixar film about the Mexican holiday Day of the Dead. The Book of Life is also based on the holiday. It's good to see that those studios try to help popularize the holiday. Coco has brilliant animation and storytelling, as I may say about all of Pixar's films. Day of the Dead is a holiday about death, memory, and family, so Coco has each of those aspects in the story. In the story, Miguel got brought into the Land of the Dead, in which completely changed his view of the holiday. The story has various pieces of foreshadowing and you will pick up after having at least one good watch. I feel like you could go through all the emotions while watching. Like several Pixar movies, there's a scene that's particularly tearworthy. There's some differences between Coco and the Book of Life, so I suggest to watch both to take in everything in film that's to offer for Day of the Dead.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Coco,"Budding guitarist ""Miguel"" is puzzled by his family's long-established ban on anything musical. To him it just doesn't make any sense at all especially as, generations ago, his family were at the top of that very game. Determined to get to the bottom of that mystery so he can emulate the legendary heart-throb ""Ernesto"" (a cross between Julio Iglesias and Justin Bieber), he finds that serendipity takes an hand in things. On the Day of the Dead, he manages to get himself transported to the the vibrant and surprisingly lively land of the dead where he encounters the slightly mischievous ""Hector"" who promises to guide him to his great, great grand-father, find the truth and enable him to return home to a family that will, once again, embrace music. He has to get a move on though, as he only has the hours of darkness to fulfil his quest - so the race is on. Meantime some of his other, long deceased, family are also on his trail bent on returning him home without his music. To be honest, I found the underlying tale of loyalty and family to be just a bit overly-sentimental at times, but the quality and vivacity of the animation is a class apart - huge great eyes and smiles that tell the story so much better than words ever could. The story marries the musical with the dastardly and mysterious nicely with a well written script and a quickly paced storyline that is really quite entertaining. This works better on a big screen - it really shows the animators art off to best effect and, luckily, this has plenty for the adult audience too with some engagingly quirky characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Mediocre Long Story & cliched plot,"Don't believe all the hype re this film. Good colorful detailed animation at times but the majority of this film occurs in the Mexican cultural ""after world"" with no plot. This causes no emotional climax at the end of this long drawn out film.The plot is about a frustrated sad Mexican boy who overcomes his parents challenges by visiting his ancestors in a special annual night. In Mexican ""afterlife"" world, he meets too many ancestors relevant only to him, & they repeat the same cliche message.The plot is stagnant during this very lengthy time & the animation sadly becomes dull & repetitive. The ancestors are introduced as characters only to waste time, worse they're interesting only to the boy, NOT viewers.
Some scenes are inappropriate for very young kids scared of skeletons.It's hard not to get sleepy due to the dull plot, repeating message & length of film. The ending leaves viewers detached from its mediocre start. One is glad it's over but dissatisfied of wasting both money & hours of time on another hyped studio awarded film with cliche story that's been told better in countless previous films.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

The vibrant colors and intricate details of the animation brought the story and the characters to life in a way that was truly captivating.But what really stood out to me about the movie was the way that it used music as a way to explore the theme of family. The way that the main character used music as a way to connect with his family and his cultural heritage was a beautiful way to show how music can bring people together.The relationships between the characters in the movie were also a really important part of the story. The loyalty and commitment that the characters showed to each other was really heartwarming and it made me feel like I was part of their family too.Overall, I thought that this was a really feel-good movie that had a lot of heart.

The ending of this movie makes people believe it's better than it is!,"I've only ever heard good things about this movie but I never actually watched it myself, Pixar films are usually films I always see in the cinema and I rarely miss out on them because they are usually very consistent in their quality. This film isn't poorly made in the slightest, the voice acting is good the story is compelling atleast and the animation is good quality as always, there are just too many slight things that let this movie down a lot. The story isn't original at all, for people who have seen the movie 'The Book Of Life' they will all know that it is almost the exact same film just ten times better. The plot is beyond predictable, like I guessed every twist and every plot detail a mile before it was revealed. The characters are boring and don't feel like Pixar characters normally feel. The animation is good but has some moments that look so low quality, it's the spirit animals that look terrible, they tired too hard to make them bright and vibrant and doing this just makes them look 2D and flat. The ending is the best part of the movie as it is so emotional and so relatable that it has the whole audience sobbing and really connecting to the film. It's because of the ending that people tell themselves that this is a good movie but deep down it is just a very average one. I can see what they were going for and it definitely has that Pixar feel to it, but I just think that there are other films that are too similar and just quite frankly better than this one.

"Another stunningly imaginative and beautiful Pixar film, and maybe its most emotional","Known for imagination and creativity, Pixar has transported audiences of all ages to astonishing cinematic worlds with nearly every film on its resume. ""Coco,"" inspired by Mexican culture and the aesthetic of Dia de Muertos - the ""Day of the Dead"" holiday - is another gem in its crown, a six-year passion project stunningly realized, wonderfully immersive and emotionally resonant.""Coco"" begins with a predictably cliche family film premise but eventually evolves in unexpected ways and takes brave turns. Miguel (Anthony Gonzales) is a young boy in a family of shoemakers that for generations has sworn off music because Miguel's great-great grandfather was a mariachi who abandoned his family to pursue his dream. Naturally, music is the thing Miguel loves most; he aspires to be as great as his idol, legendary singer Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). When his family discovers his hidden passion during the celebration of Dia de Muertos, it goes poorly, and Miguel somehow finds himself in Land of the Dead on a quest with his dreams at stake.Pixar's trademark innovation immediately kicks into gear once Miguel moves over to the spiritual plane in which only the souls of the dead exist. He meets his ancestors and other skeletal figures, including the jovial drifter Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal), and a host of brightly colored spirit animals. But as much as the Land of the Dead ironically dazzles with vibrant life, all of it is built on a foundation of family and remembrance. These souls can only existence in this world as long as they are remembered, and they can only cross into the land of the living on Dia de Muertos if their photo is on someone's ofrenda (altar).So the film's main song, ""Remember Me,"" has more powerful connotations than Robert and Kristen Anderson-Lopez's simple melody and sweet lyrics suggest. Director Lee Unkrich (""Toy Story 3"") and co-director Adrian Molina weave these deeper themes into the very fabric of the film's imaginative conceit and the payoff is at least as moving if not more than ""WALL*E"" and ""Up.""The story also isn't shy on dark notes and heartbreaking moments. There are some mature themes and a palpable sense of familial conflict, with characters who have strong values such as family or pursuing one's dreams who make poor choices despite these values and intentions. ""Coco"" sends powerful messages when these choices come to bear on the plot.Although Pixar chooses to dip back into the well of its first original creative successes a little too often, films like ""Coco"" prove that its spirit of ingenuity is alive and well. Granted, Unkrich and his team had to dig deeper, steeping themselves in a culture and new ideas in order to unearth something both original and universal. These kinds of successes may become more sparse over time as unique storytelling territory becomes harder and harder to come by, but with time and energy, ""Coco"" proves anything is possible.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Beautifully done!,"I was very skeptical at first, as a Mexican I was afraid they'll use the stereotypes and put us in a box, but by the end of the movie I felt more Mexican than ever.Coco exploits one of the most important Mexican traditions in a very respectful way, it shows what Día de Muertos it's all about, the one night a year where we can reunite with our beloved ones that are no longer here.Pixar-Disney jumps out of the box, once again, and leave all the princess and fairy stories to show us the importance of family and traditions in a unique funny and colorful story. All the characters are right on point, they grow together learning from each other making it one of the most emotional and pleasing movie I've seen in a long time.A movie that will make you laugh and cry, Coco might be a movie for children but a guarantee everyone will just love it. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One Of Pixar's Best,"Pixar, aside from a few weak entries with either Cars 2 or Brave, has always been the studio that places quality entertainment over making a quick buck. Coco is their latest outing, and I'd be absolutely lying to everyone if I didn't say that I loved every second of my viewing experience with this film. Coco is easily one of their best in years and possibly one of their best, period. Diving into themes that felt very risqué for this particular studio, I found that these particular elements only added to the overall story as a whole. Here is why I believe Coco is the must-see movie this year and why it will probably bring tears to many.Due to a tragic past that I won't discuss here, young Miguel (the main protagonist of the film) is forbidden to ever take up music as a profession. Looking up to the great Ernesto de la Cruz, he hopes to be like him one day (the greatest musician to ever live). As he borrows Ernesto's guitar to perform in a contest during the Mexican day of the dead celebration, he is sucked into the land of the dead, where he meets his ancestors. Discovering new things about life, death, and the importance of family, Coco is a film that will send you on a roller coaster ride of emotions.Throughout the first act of this movie, you feel as though it will be a touching story about a boy who's able to connect with the family he was never able to have met, but the hidden secrets will shock even the smartest of viewers. I hope you'll be as shocked with some of the reveals as I was because the writers have really outdone themselves in terms of making you care for these characters. Yes, the plot itself may have familiar elements, but what film doesn't nowadays?I believe that Coco found a way to spin the clichés on their head, injecting some very dark aspects into this movie, which I found to be quite the risk but also worth it in the end. There are times when adults will feel as though they're watching a mature film due to how certain circumstances play out, and while kids can still enjoy the spectacle of this movie, this really is a children's movie for adults. That being said, the spectacle of it all is still worth the price of admission alone.Disney/Pixar continues to impress its audience in terms of how detailed the majority of their films have become, and Coco is no exception. Not only was I sucked up in the emotional journey that Miguel goes through, but the visuals only added a level of depth to the story, due to the fact that the animators have really made these people feel realistic, not in a true-to-life way, but in the way they move or speak to one another. This film is everything you could possibly ask for from Pixar.In the end, Coco is the reason we go to the cinema. We want to be transported to a unique world that makes us forget about reality, but that also reminds us how important reality still is. The core essence of this film's existence is to remind everyone that even the biggest of dreams will have their issues and that family really is the most important thing in life. Whether or not you choose to buy into that aspect will probably make or break your enjoyment of the movie, but I was moved to tears by it. Pixar has created another masterpiece in Coco and this may just be the best film I've seen all year. I can't recommend this beautiful piece of filmmaking enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Vibrant Magical Journey!,"Pixar has done it again, and given us a great confection all wrapped up in time for the holidays, and it's a new movie called ""CoCo"" A kaleidoscope of colors and textures that bring to life a little Mexican Village, one so very similar to what I grew up in. Every detail feels so authentic, and every character so very real. The research and development spent on this film all pays off with a vibrant story that combines the real world with spiritual world populated by those spirits that have passed on.With a stellar cast of voices by Benjamin Bratt, Gael Garcia Bernal, Alanna Ubach, Edward James Olmos, and newcomer Anthony Gonzales as the main protagonist Miguel, all providing flawless characterizations along with magnificent singing voices.With the very sure hand of directors, Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina we are transported to the very colorful and vibrant world of Mexican folklore, combining it with a modern aesthetic that is both appealing and mysterious. The Pixar artistry is at work here on such a high level that every frame dazzles us with amazing imagination!The music is such a treasure here, and sparks a range from traditional Mexican songs to the very touching and moving song ""Remember Me"" which serves as the vital core of the entire film.A great treat for both children and adults, ""Coco"" is a treasure that will live on with the greatest of the Pixar cannon.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fine, but Extremely Overrated!","I have a couple of issues with Coco. The biggest one by far is that I found the film to be overstuffed with characters that are by no means essential to the plot, which is by the way quite thin and stretched at the same time. And it goes without saying that the approach they took to tell the story is indisputably unoriginal. Let alone the familiar themes the film tackles. What makes up for these problems are: the jaw-dropping animation, the vast and vibrant world that you can't help roaming over it in your mind, and the flawlessly-executed heartbreaking final act. I think the music and the songs are quite good, especially ""Un Poco Loco"" and of course the Oscar-wining ""Remember Me"".(7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
6.7/10 - Fun Overall,"Coco! Another widely loved Pixar film, and that's the first time I've watched it, tbh.So, the story goes on like this - Miguel, a young Mexican boy, is part of a family of shoemakers. His family hates music, since music made Miguel's great great grandpa leave the house and abandon the family. One thing leads to another (spoiler territory here), but eventually Miguel finds himself in the land of the dead, during the Mexican day of the dead. He goes on a journey to get back to the land of living - if he won't succeed in doing so before sunrise, he'll stay dead permanently.I didn't have high expectations, and this film really didn't blow me away. But I did have good time watching it :)The aesthetic of everything, especially in the land of the dead, feels quite unique and colorful, and I kinda dig the vibe that Pixar created there (though they could've done it better and take the concept further, imo). They also use so many everyone-being-dead-related puns, and most of the time it works quite well. This film just has a cute, fun energy to it, so, yeah. I also think that some emotional moments here were quite effective, especially towards the ending of the film.As for things that I didn't really like - the characters feel quite shallow. I mean, they're simple, and they work in the context of the plot, but I didn't really feel any depth or any special connection to a character in this film. The plot was also kinda cheesy at points and predictable most of the time, not in a terrible way but still in a noticeable one.And that's it, I guess. Didn't have a whole lot to say it. This film is simple, generally fun, though chessy at times and feels kinda forced in a way, you know? Like, it doesn't have the creative flow of some other Pixar films, but still, pretty solid. I'm feeling a 6.7 on this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Vibrant and Colorful, But Not My Kind of Story","Coco is a Pixar film that has been widely praised for its vibrant depiction of Mexican culture and its heartfelt exploration of themes like family and remembrance. The story follows a young boy named Miguel who, on the Day of the Dead, finds himself transported to the Land of the Dead, where he embarks on a journey to discover his family's history.While the film's visuals are stunning and the cultural representation is commendable, Coco didn't quite connect with me. The story, though touching, felt too predictable and sentimental for my liking. The musical elements, which many find uplifting, didn't resonate with me as strongly as they might with others, and I found myself not fully engaged with the characters or the narrative.Coco is a film that has clearly struck a chord with many viewers, but it's not one that I would choose to watch again. I give it a 2/10 for its artistic merits, but the story just wasn't something I enjoyed.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best animations,"This was a family movie that mini-me chose and it was such a lovely tale! Miguel loves music but due to a past event with his grand-papie music is banned from the family household and they all follow the line of shoemaking. However, it is time for the Day of the Dead festival and he has a way in, a way to meet his family and to get their blessing to play music again and bring joy. I loved meeting Hector, a soul/skeleton who was running out of time as he was being forgotten. Once forgotten you leave the place and disappear. They work together and it is a fun friendship to see blossom. Yet, you know there is a time limit for these two because if Miguel doesn't get back by dawn, well let us just say he has to hurry!I loved how the Land of the Dead is so vivid, bright and colourful, it is a party place until they move on. It was interesting to learn more about the Mexican celebration and their beliefs, and what this festival represents and means. I have always said I would love to go to the festival and celebrate the lives.Not going to lie, I cried and so did mini-me, it was such a beautiful story and when you learn the truth behind what caused the ban, well it was so heartbreaking. Bit ""dark"" for a Pixar film too! It is definitely a cut above the rest of some the newer films and I hardly heard anything about this when it came out.

Mexican folklore and Dia de la Muerta are complex ideology but Coco does a beautiful job of explaining them and will probably convince people to either celebrate Dia de la Muerta or at the very least remind the viewer to remember loved ones who've passed and/or appreciate loved ones more while they're here with us.

"Sweet, emotional and visually superb","'Coco' is not Pixar's best film in my opinion. It doesn't achieve the completeness of other monumental titles like 'The Incredibles' or 'Toy Story 3', nor does it match the inspired cleverness of 'Inside Out'. It is, however, an appealing, colourful and emotionally tender film with unique visuals, enjoyable musical numbers and splendid animation.The respect for authenticity in the representation of Mexican tradition is to be applauded, with the designs of the dead ancestors all built around the graphic skulls that are used to celebrated Dios de los Muertos. Every shot is beautifully crafted, a profusion of glowing candles, marigolds and vibrant festival colour.The film is ultimately about the importance of family, community and honouring your shared history. It's a celebration of culture. I found this was laid on a bit thick at times, with characters often explaining too much of what they do with regards to festival preparations etc, which kind of makes it feel like a lesson. I felt the expository stuff was aimed more toward younger children than a more knowing audience who didn't need to be spoon fed, but anyway it's a small criticism. The emotional moments are not as deftly handled as Carl and Ellie's heartbreaking love-story in Up, they felt a bit syrupy and hammed up in parts, but they still manage to pluck the heartstrings and the ending is well earned, a few plot contrivances aside.Overall the story is well told, with loveable characters, in particular Dante, Miguel's brain-dead dog, who has some of the funniest animation I've seen in a long time, every scene he was in had me in stitches. I also loved the sequence with Frida Kahlo and her avant garde art installation. There's at least enough humour to keep adults entertained, even if most of the film feels aimed more at the under 10's.Coco is good, wholesome fun!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Homage To Mexico,"Pixar's unique and colorful take on the Dia De Los Muertos was truly remarkable. The story was a match made in Pixar heaven due to its heart wrenching and heartwarming moments. Though this story seemed a bit morbid at times, you can really tell Pixar catered this movie to adults as well as kids. The visual effects were probably my favorite in any Pixar film thus far. The amount of detail on screen at any given time was beyond belief. Also, the character development was extraordinary. Having an extensive look at each character's background not only helped you fall in love with the characters, but it was also used as a unique storytelling device. The music in this movie was great too as it paid homage to the traditional mariachi style still practiced in Mexico today. The movie even featured some songs with lyrics entirely in Spanish. Overall, I would say this movie captured the Mexican heritage to a T. The characters were memorable, the story and dialogue were exceptionally written, the visuals were gorgeous and bursting with color, and the music was festive and fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar has done it again!,"Let me start of by saying that as Mexican born and resident, I found this movie very respectful and honest about our culture. So, watch it without any guilt! ""COCO"" tells the history of Miguel, a music- loving boy trapped on a shoe maker family that happens to hate music for generations, this is because his great-great grandmother was left by a musician. After breaking his family rule of ""no music"" he embarks on an adventure through the world of the dead. This is Disney at its finest, a powerful movie with a powerful message, even though I found it to be more on the WDAS territory, it is clearly a Pixar trademark. I cannot speak about the voice acting in general since I watched in Spanish, but for that matter the cast was very well developed here in Mexico and they made a wonderful job on that department. Gael Garcia's did same voice as in the English version at least I can say that he did a very nice job as Hector. The only thing I didn't like about the movie (And the reason I subtract 1 star out of the 10 maximum) was the third act, which I found It to be very cliché with a very, very old trope found in lots of movies and even regular TV shows and cartoons (I ain't going to spoil anything), but don't worry, it is compensated with the rest of the movie which I found it be very clever and emotional all the way through. And of course! As an old Disney-Pixar tradition this movie is one hell of a Tear-Jerker so don't forget to bring your tissues to the theater. I'm sure you and your family will enjoy this movie so go see it, you won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful and unpretentious,"Yes, the movie starts a bit slow and takes its time to build up momentum. It is rich in cultural reference to Mexico that may be a bit strange to embrace to non-Latin Americans. The music in the movie is soft and emotional, but not epic, glorious or Oscar-grabbing. The major plot points are predictable. Most of these are not really complaints, just factors of potential viewing (dis)pleasure.Apart from these, the film blew me away. I had zero expectations walking in the theater with my kids, wasn't sure whether it's just another animated movie after first 30 minutes or so and definitely saw the result of Ernesto/Hector clash coming. It nevertheless grabbed my soul at that breaking point and never let go. It was only then that I truly started to care for our main characters and their family, but did so doubly.Coco is, for most part, seemingly a completely irrelevant character, until she becomes a focal point of everything. Of entire (mostly dead) family line. She is the key to love and forgiveness of their (deceased) parents, to a final wish of a missing father and to both Miguel and his family members (dead and alive), who come to finally understand that respect for family is just as important as respect for dreams of its individual members. And it is not just Miguel who ultimately suffered from Imelda's hate for Hector, it was also Coco. But her grief and own final wish were locked away in a catatonic body until Miguel came back from the dead to set that wish come true with a song, filled with love for family.I could not really claim this is the best film I have ever seen, but it was the one that immersed me into its story most and evoke my emotions.There were three times I've cried watching a movie in my life: - at the end of East of Eden when I was 7 - at the end of Color Purple when I was 15 - for the entire final third of Coco, now when I'm 40+.It will always have a special place in my heart. I will always Remember you.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Very good animation...,"""Coco"" is an Animation - Adventure movie in which we watch a young boy going to the Land of the Dead in order to find his great-great-grandfather, a famous singer, after he learnt that music is banned in his family.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had a nice, interesting plot accompanied with beautiful music and songs. The direction which was made by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina was also very good and they both did an excellent job on the way they presented both the plot and their main characters. The voices of Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel, Gael García Bernal as Héctor and Benjamin Bratt as Ernesto de la Cruz were fitted very well.

Coco,"In Disney Pixar's movie, Coco one of the main cultural pieces that was represented was La Dia de los Muertos (day of the dead). The story in this movie took place on Dia de los Muertos which is normally on November 2nd in Mexico, but in America, the holiday starts on Wednesday, October 31st and ends on November 2nd. I believe that Coco had a great representation of this Hispanic holiday. According to Wikipedia.org, ""The multi-day holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died, and help support their spiritual journey....traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars called ofrendas, honoring the deceased using calaveras, aztec marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts."" In the movie, the family had a very well represented ofrenda to honor their passed relatives. They set out food, candles and pictures of their relatives which is very accurate to a real Ofrenda. 
Google Arts and Culture states, ""It is a day to honor and commemorate the lives of the dearly departed and to welcome the return of their spirits"". This holiday is basically celebrating the lives of past relatives, but some homes believe the spirits come back to us and walk among us at night so they can see their family. In Coco, there was a bridge of leaves that allowed the deceased ancestors to walk into the living world and visit their family, but before then they had to go through a security checkpoint to make sure their picture was put up or else they would not be able to cross. Not all families believe the same thing but they're all around the same traditional holiday.
According to Culturegrams Database on Mexican holidays, ""Each town also has an annual festival that includes a religious ceremony, meal, and dance. Many people try to return home for these events."" This is describing how important and relevant holidays are in Mexico including Dia de los Muertos. In Coco, the town that Miguel and his family live in there was a huge festival going on celebrating this holiday. They even had a talent show where anyone could sign up and play music. 
 I believe that Coco is very accurate to this holiday and traditions they represented in the film. The only aspect that is not one hundred percent correct in Coco was how the little boy went into the world where he could talk to the dead. Not because this isn't culturally accurate, but because it is just fiction. A lot of pieces in this movie were more about building a story in fiction mostly to catch the eye of the watchers. 
Coco was very accurate in cultural representation (despite the parts of building a story as I mentioned above), not only were so many aspects in the movie relatable to people of the hispanic culture, but they were also extremely enjoyable. Overall Coco is a great cultural introducing, family and heart touching movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The respect for the mexican traditions and culture was perfect. The script is so well made. Characters were simply so realistic and easy to identify yourself with (specially Miguel, you can feel a connection with that character).

I give my Thanks to Coco!,"They say that there more than just what I have as a YouTube career, the same would go for having a life Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, the rest goes on, but on this night of March 2nd/3rd, 2018 has became I night to never forget, so brace yourselves for what needs to be saidCoco itself has became a blessing that there's more than just what need to be famous, it shows the passion to be with the people that look up to you or down on you. They can be known as the greatest or even the grandest moments of your life, even in your darkest of days. This movie shows the visual of how families are shown in a human's most upright respect.A began the life I knew on August 31st of 2014, on my main YouTube channel, It not only became just to start the career to make the honorable moments of my life, but to honor the most fun I'd have in years. Months passed after beginning this life, and I'd had gained some of the best of friends, some who I've considered to be the ones who helped me begin the acting career I was, how I say, a destiny, and that destiny was something I'd spread out to folk I've lived for, until the day when my Mom passed on Oct. 27th, 2014. In light of her death, I'd admittingly had a choice at the time to decide to forget about starting a life online or continue on something that would mean the world to me, and to this day, even months in the future, I would still wonder on that, and as I look down on them as the torture that I'd never would see my Mom again, and then... after seeing this masterpiece of movie tonight, this movie not only the dramatization, the betrayal, the living influence of life, the cultural accusation, an unbalance heartbreak, and mainly, the perfect truth of friendship, loyalty, and love, but what it made me realized... was that....it kept me closer to my Mom.So let me ask you this, ""When you began the online career you have today, did you ever once think that you not only began this new journey just to become famous as of now, the fun of wanting to do this for a change in pace, having to try to be someone your not, or if your like me, you did this not only for your well being, but to honor a relative, family member, or meant something that means the world close to your family?"" Today, I look upon the life I turned on, as something to dedicate my relatives, both past and present, the friends that I've seen from time and time again, whether they are still with me or against me, the memories that made us the people who we are are today, but I mostly treasure my present days around the day about my Mom and Dad, because they make me think of people who are courageous, who are loyal, who have a passion of honesty, generosity, kindness or laughter, who stand out towards them or me, who have loved and tend to love someone they know in theirs or my life, but their also the reason on how they made a wise choice for having me in their lives.Furthermore, to my friends, relatives, family, and friends who I consider as family, I ask you, what really is the best moment in your life you can intend upon, on who you've become in the years you lived. I not only honor this to the many people reading this or to mine and many more Christians like me and many more to come, I honor this to the name of Coco, because after all, like Miguel and Héctor stated, we're all are just, ""Un Poco Loco!""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
El mejor from Pixar! (No spoilers),"Coco is a new animated movie created by Lee Unkrich and tells the story of Miguel and how he wants to become a great musician just like his great-great-grandfather. This movie was on the Oscar buzz list ever since it got released so I gave it a try since I loved the Toy Story trilogy and Finding Nemo which were also created by Unkrich if I'm not mistaken.Let me start by saying that I was starting to believe that in nowadays cinema there wasn't any more ""inspiration"" or creativity until I saw this movie. I'll admit it's like most of the animated pixar movies regarding the narative structure but the originality of the story cannot be neglected. This is probably the best movie of 2017 and even if it had only 105 minutes it felt like a three hour epic. That was because this movie was so rich and so many things happen that it hits you and stays with you long after it's over. This is probably the most mature movie I've seen from pixar ever. The story is very original and the set pieces are so authentic and it gives you the Mexican atmosphere so naturally and makes you basically teleport into this universe. And although I've said it above that this movie follows the same narative structure as most of pixar movies, it has a original story to tell and one that is mature, one that is full of message and ideas. For example the idea that everyone dies sometimes and all of us sooner or later will be forgotten or how important is to love your family and treasure those you have for the time you have them with you. I have an old grandma and while I was watching the end I had such a warm feeling of wanting to hug her and tell her I love her and that I'll miss her when she's gone but I always remember her. This is what a great movie does to the audience: it inspires them, it reminds them of things that we sometime bury due to our hurry in this life. I just can't find any superlatives for this movie. The voice acting is fantastic and the most impressive thing is that all the cast was spanish talking persons which had such an authentic feel in the overall movie. Then there's the score which is fantastic. I cannot understand how it didn't get nominated for Oscar since it replicates the traditional mexican style of music while also being a beautifull movie score. Props to Michael Giacchino who is one of my favorite composers alive. It's beyond me how this didn't get nominated for original score but the generic iconic music of star wars the last jedi by John Williams did. My only gripes with the movie might be that it somewhat slows down in the middle and some creature were kind of a unanswered mystery for me. Aside from that this movie is pretty much flawless and is one of my best movie experiences ever.In conclusion: fantastic movie with great story, amazing voice acting from a well chosen cast, great score and songs and superb animation. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Overlong, overrated movie","Coco (2017) was co-written and co-directed by Lee Unkrich. The other co-writer and co-director was Adrian Molina.This is a Disney Pixar movie that has an extremely high IMDb rating of 8.4. With thousands of rating and reviews, in a way it's foolish of me to cast a dissenting vote, but that's what I'm doing.The good news is that the animation is excellent, as expected. Also, that it teaches Anglo kids about the Day of the Dead, which is an important holiday in Mexico and for Mexican-Americans.The bad news is that it's stereotypic, violent, and far too long. (Disney has plenty of money, and owns Pixar, so why not throw in an extra 15 or 20 minutes?)I think the subject would be frightening to children, and the violence--even animated violence--would also be frightening.So, at the risk of sounding like a curmudgeon, and of receiving many non-useful ratings of my review, I'm going to rate it 7. (I would rate it lower, but it is useful for kids to know about Day of the Dead, even at the risk of learning about it from a bad movie.)P. S. The theme song, ""Remember,"" doesn't strike me as a winner.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A beautiful celebration of family and Mexican culture.,"'Coco' is a Pixar film directed by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina. Lee Unkrich is a long Pixar creative behind such classics as 'Finding Nemo', 'Monsters Inc.' and the 'Toy Story' sequels. So it doesn't come as a surprise that he delivers once again with 'Coco' which is beautiful and vibrant in every way. Co-director Adrian Molina also deserves a lot of credit of course as he also wrote some of the original songs for the movie.In fact every single person involved in creating this stellar animation deserves an abundance of credit as every aspect of the film is a pleasure to enjoy. Not only is it incredibly entertaining but it is emotionally resonant and introduces audiences who may not know much about Mexican culture to an authentic and heartwarming portrayal of it.'Coco' is about young Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) who dreams of becoming a musician like his idol Ernesto de le Cruz however his family have banned music due to something terrible that happened a few generations ago. During Dia de los muertos, after a set of mysterious events, Miguel finds himself in the Land of the Dead. Once there, he meets trickster Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal) and together they go on an adventure to discover the real story behind Miguel's family history.The entire voice cast is fabulous and they handle the comedic moments in the film very well as their timing is perfect. In particular, Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel, Gael Garcia Bernal as Hector and Benjamin Bratt as Ernesto de le Cruz are most noteworthy. The animation is typically stunning for a Pixar production and the eye-popping, colorful visuals complement the involving, heart-string tugging story wonderfully.'Coco' boats a slew of original songs including 'Remember Me' written by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez (writers of 'Let It Go' from 'Frozen') which looks set to win the duo their second Oscar for Best Original Song after winning their first for the aforementioned 'Let It Go'. 'Coco' also looks strong to take Best Animated Feature which it so richly deserves. Not only is 'Coco' the best animated film of the year, it's one of the best films of the year period and I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Culturally Relevant, Slightly Skewed","Big movies and studios have a reputation of bending culture and history to create a more entertaining product. Disney and Pixar can be included in this conversation (more Disney though than Pixar, with movies like Pocahontas and Aladdin being some of the most controversial). Pixar, however, has remained relatively close to the cultural truth with Coco. Even though it still has its controversies (mainly regarding its plot originality), the movie makes for a colorful, entertaining spectacle of Mexican culture; specifically during the Day of the Dead, or Dia de los Muertos.Coco takes place during Dia de los Muertos, a colorful celebration of the passed on. This can make for an interesting setting for Pixar, and they worked very well with it. They present a story on the importance of dreams, family, and remembrance. The remembrance part is very prevalent (even its Oscar-winning song is named Remember Me), and it should be. In fact, Judy King states in her article on mexconnect.com that, ""On this night, those who wait realize the importance of living to be well remembered, working to be well respected and loving to be well missed""(mexconnect.com). The struggle to be remembered leads people to create a legacy that they will be remembered by, or others tainting said legacy. In the story, Hector, Miguel's great-great grandfather, had been left forgotten because his family tainted his legacy by quite literally tearing him from his family after leaving them and never coming back. On the other hand, De La Cruz worked to create his own legacy by stealing songs and credit to become a well known and respected in Mexico. The need to be remembered is centered on the fact that the spirits of the dead need to return to our world during the Day of the Dead. However, if one were to be forgotten, the story portrays a ""final death"" where there is no one left to remember someone, and they fade away forever, even from the the realm of the dead. After being skeptical of this being portrayed as true (I had never heard of this idea before), I discovered that this is actually more or less the real idea. Victor Landa is quoted in Judy King's article on mexconnect.com as saying ""The third death, the most definitive death, is when there is no one left alive to remember us"" (mexconnect.com). This is why people work so hard to be remembered, so that no one ever forgets them, because of they fade from the memory of the living, they will surely disappear from any existence.One discrepancy that I found was the spirit guides. In Coco, they are mostly portrayed as colorful animal hybrids, such as winged dogs or cats. While they do fit in well with the mood and scenery of the movie, they do not portray the whole truth. They are most likely inspired by Colima Dogs, ceramic dog figures designed to help guide the dead in mesoamerican lore. Kristen Romey of National Geographic attests that ""The most frequent depictions take the form of small ceramic vessels known as Colima Dogs... which may have served as symbolic dog guides to help the soul of the dead travel through the Underworld"" (nationalgeographic.com). So, while the guides aren't all true, they do have basis in real world lore. In fact, a dog named Dante is commonly featured in the story as a ""connection"" between worlds, and even morphs into a spirit guide himself.In conclusion, while Coco, isn't 100% accurate to cultural truth, there is very little bending to it. Even the added elements have cultural basis to them, which helps them to blend seamlessly to the rest of the story, which has allowed the cultural elements of the Day of the Dead to guide an entertaining story that looks familiar to people who celebrate the holiday, and they have built off of many of the elements to create amazing environments and artistic storytelling.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"I have to say few words, Pixar","The nitpicky asshats will point out why the movie's called Coco since they did the Legend of Zelda thing where the titular character isn't the protagonist and is instead a kid named Miguel. But that's not the point. I admit the movie gave off a bad first impression not simply because of Pixar's decline in quality in recent years but also because the teaser trailer gave off the impression that it was going to be a Book of Life knockoff. Although in that movie, he doesn't even die until the third act which trailers made the main selling point. However, that has always been Pixar's thing. The trailers make the movie look like your generic animated comedy but are more than that. And Coco is no exception. Once again, Pixar demonstrates how they're still the best in the business when it comes to modern animated movies. They're not terrified of moral guardians, something which even DreamWorks succumbed to after How to Train Your Dragon 2 despite what my opinions have to say about that. The animation is beautifully crafted. The animators once again worked their asses off and it shows. There's always a fine level of detail added. It deals with the themes of death from a child's perspective amazingly well and balances out slapstick antics with skeletons and a fine level of poignancy especially near the end of the movie. The music. Oh, God, the music. It's practically tearjerking. Bring some onions as an excuse for crying. Since most of Pixar's cast and crew was Latino, it showed that this was indeed Pixar's love letter towards Mexican culture, specifically Dia de los Muertos. Nothing feels like it's racist. There's is a predictable plot twist since we're constantly whacked on the head about a certain fact regarding Miguel's family but what movie hasn't done that? I think that was the writer's point. That you shouldn't make blind beliefs based solely off of pictures. Looks can be deceiving. Family comes first, all dreams have their own limitations, we should always consider the consequences of pursuing fame. And also, don't steal on the Day of the Dead if you're Mexican. Much like Inside Out and, to a lesser extent, Finding Dory, Coco shows that Pixar still hasn't lost their touch. Let's hope Incredibles 2 is just as awesome as the first movie. It has the same director though given Tomorrowland's reputation, we might have to be wary when going to see it. Only time will tell.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
AMAZING!,"In Santa Cecilia, Mexico, Imelda Rivera was the wife of a musician who left her and their 3-year-old daughter Coco, to pursue a career in music. She banned music in the family and opened a shoemaking family business. Ninety-six years later, her great-great-grandson, 12-year-old Miguel, now lives with Coco and their family. He secretly dreams of becoming a musician like Ernesto de la Cruz, a popular actor and singer of Coco's generation. One day, Miguel inadvertently damages the photo of Coco with her parents at the center of the family ofrenda and removes it, discovering that her father (whose face is torn out) was holding Ernesto's famous guitar.Concluding that Ernesto is Miguel's great-great-grandfather, Miguel leaves to enter a talent show for the Day of the Dead over his grandmother Elena's objections. He enters Ernesto's mausoleum and steals his guitar to use in the show, but becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can see and be seen by his Xoloitzcuintli dog Dante and his skeletal dead relatives who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him there, they realize that Imelda cannot visit as Miguel removed her photo from the ofrenda. Discovering that he is cursed for stealing from the dead, Miguel must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise or he will become one of the dead: to do so, he must receive a blessing from a member of his family using an Aztec marigold petal that can undo the curse placed upon him by stealing Ernesto's guitar. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing but on the condition that he abandon his musical pursuits when he returns to the Land of the Living; Miguel refuses and attempts to seek Ernesto's blessing.

However, his shoemaking family refuses such dreams and instead insists on letting him follow their long-standing work passed down for generations. Things become more complicated when he is cursed and journeys to the Land of the Dead with the help of his deceased relatives to fix the wrongs he has done.Coco does use a few familiar elements used in past Pixar films that I see them like ingredients used in making this particular movie:The aspiration of RatatouilleA hint of Inside Out's conceptThe emotional touch of Toy Story 3When blended with Mexican culture, music, and customs, including traditional beliefs for Mexico's holiday Dia de Los Muertos, it's a story worth telling when seeing it through Miguel's perspective as though we've grasped his inner psyche and are channeling it. And his meetings with various whimsical characters in the Land of the Dead offers an insight to what he's been missing and didn't know he had all along.Miguel's family felt so relatable that it's reminding me of members of my own family at a young age. Like I can literally see their personalities residing in these characters, especially kindhearted Mama Coco (who reminds me so much of my late maternal grandmother) and Abuelita (like my paternal grandmother) that it brought a tear to my eye and hushed weeping from some people that night. I'd say this feels relatable no matter who you are or where you're from because while a dream of being something greater is one thing, never forget that family is also equally important. The voice cast did an impressive job, especially newcomer Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel. Not a shred of doubt this flick will be noteworthy during award's season. This is a movie that can apply to any generation.To director Lee Unkrich and the rest at Pixar. Gracias.The moral: Cherish family. They may tell one to know their place, but it's not a crime to follow one's own path to something more life-fulfilling than initially given.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Somewhat predictable but genuinely heartwarming,"I wasn't sure what this movie was about at all when I started watching, but I definitely didn't leave disappointed. There was a lot of gorgeous and colorful moments, and all the characters look individual! It's pretty refreshing to see strong matriarchs in a Pixar movie. The storyline I found it a bit predictable and the way they changed between english and spanish a bit odd (it's not like they are supposed to be speaking english at any point? So what are the switches supposed to symbolize?) but a nice opportunity to learn a couple of new phrases of a new language. There's also some thrilling moments and just enough Though the biggest joy I found with Coco was how curious it made me to find out more after all it taught me about this wonderful holiday and the spirituality behind it! 
I think there is a nice message about loving your family but also accepting their differences and individuality. Definitely a movie I could see being a big favourite, if it just got the promotion it deserved.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Near classic Pixar with terrific music and a deep and moving message on memory,"Coco is a very, very good movie that earns its heart about two-thirds of the way in - a little later than one may be used to given this is the director of Up - and has imagination pouring in every little mark of animation and detail. It's also the rare movie by this studio to be an animated musical, of a sort, and it is ingrained in the DNA of the thing- I thought it would be about something as simple (and still important) as music. That would have been enough. I got more than that, chiefly an inquiry through drama about what memory means in existential terms. Yeah, I didn't expect that quite either, but then again it IS the land of the dead we're dealing with here.It is one thing to think deeply about what a life means and the death that everyone faces. The real terror is not having anything beyond this plane of existence; this world of the undead skeletons snd spirit animals is comforting ultimately since, naturally, there is a place after we die that we can reunite with others and be merry and so on. But what if you are gone and... That is it? Mexican culture (and this goes for other cultures too) has another idea about the afterlife, hence the Day of the Dead (Dios lis muertos), than we typically think of. But functionally it is this version of heaven that is a bit, uh, funkier, cooler, more colorful, less uh... White.The main conflict is deceptive here. I think what keeps it from full greatness for me is that Miguel is a bit too typical of one of these animated characters, or just in any of these ""I wanna do this with my life"" ""No you can't! Family!"" ""Bah! No!"" Etc stories. Just this past summer the underrated Patti Cakes had that basic premise in gritty rap. This also has to include, as these stories do, the old ""dont meet your heroes"" maxim, in this case with Ernesto De La Cruz, the Mexican equivalent of an Elvis. So while one might think this is where the movie will be going, what throws the plot an excellent monkey wrench is Hector, a gangly undead guy who comes on like he'll be another in a long line of helpful but, again, conventional comedic side kicks (this world's Genie).The power of Coco, past its inspired look and immersive world and its solid aims at humor (ie the wonderful surrealistic scene where the female assistant to De La Cruz makes her Dali-style sets), is that Hector, not Miguel, is the heart of the movie. It should be too jammed full of revelations by the end of the second act (and like other Pixae, this *is* very 3-act structure, and thats fine, they know how to do it well), maybe taking its cues slightly from Telenovelas for dramatic emphasis. But without revealing too much, as you should go in knowing little story reveal wise as pissible, Hector emphasizes the main song of the movie, ""Remember Me,"" and it makes a profound point. Memory is for the living after all - why have a cemetery at all or a memorial like done every Day of the Dead otherwise - and it's another one of those times like Inside Out where a characters existence carries total, paramount importance.Oh, and if you don't cry (as my wife did), you'll smile, genuinely, from the commitment to its emotional outreach. Coco isn't in my top grouping of Pixar films but it's only due to a minor feeling of familiarity. Its strengths are no less though than classic Pixar: amazing and deeply- drawn characters, unforgettable designs, and that is about something at a time when a lot of animation storytellers think having characters dance and tart is enough. This wants you to laugh and cry and sometimes be genuinely surprised, and if you buy the soundtrack that's icing on the cake.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Touching...,"A pretty good story and the music was wonderful. The relationships are touching and goes to show just how important family is.

the story of a young boy trying to break the harsh family rules and play music and on the way is entrapped by a curse,"Coco is a very unique phenomenon. Not only it has shown that there are still those with vision and perspective in Pixar and in general US but also has given back the true feeling of art back to the animations once more. Coco tells the tale of the most humane part of all humans, family, love and art...but very cleverly this tale takes shape around the Mexican culture and traditions. At a time that US has never been more divided on many different issues and Mecicans have been pictured all as illegal immigrants and the main causes of crimes by media, Pixar shows courage and creates a masterpiece that confronts such idiotic ideas and tries to remind all people a lot of things that they forgot, the fact that we all are the same and share the same feelings and sentiments. Unlike many movies music in Coco is not just a tool to fill the uncomfortable silences but it is the real protagonist of this story...it is present at all times and you miss it if it isn't for a second. The visual effects of the movie are incredible and stunning. Everything has been done for a purpose and every character has a role to play. It made me cry twice and to be honest it wasn't the sadness or heartbreak that caused it, I was so absorbed in how they introduced the concept of death that was overwhelming for me. In conclusion I found Coco to be one of the best movies of not only this year but of all time at least among all the other 3D animated movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

So far the best international project in which they represent Mexican culture.,"The Day of the Dead is the traditional celebration in which Mexicans honor the deceased and is of Mesoamerican origin. There is an infinity of international projects that have tried to portray the Mexican culture, but in one way or another have failed miserably (some more than others), getting to see some in which we are represented even in a ridiculous and offensive . I must confess my fear that ""Coco"" would be part of this list, so I initially rejected the idea of ​​wasting money on the ticket; but once the fear has been overcome, I have been surprised to see that from the intro of Disney, to the credits, the Mexican culture is present. I do not know if by the controversy in which he was involved or by the collaboration of Lalo Alcaraz, but the magnificent work to which Pixar has accustomed us, was pleasantly surpassed, portraying in great detail not only the mysticism that surrounds the festivity, but also other elements that are truly part of our culture (family coexistence, music, costumes, beliefs, characters, etc.). The story of a Mexican boy named Miguel who wants to be like his musical idol (Ernesto de la Cruz) even against his family, takes him to meet Hector, who becomes his companion in adventures and with whom both Miguel and us We recognize many famous people, we discover the importance of the family and the values ​​that identify us as people and as a nation. Although in general terms the film is worthy of being recommended for the whole family, I must clarify that some situations and ideas represented are not characteristic of that festival or have been incorporated in recent years and that the personality of some famous people has been significantly altered (I suppose with the purpose of giving a touch of comedy to the story), which is why I find it painful not to give an absolute 10. Now I understand when they qualified me with 9.9 and they told me that my work was for a 10 if not for a tiny detail, but in case the creators of Pixar read this review I will compensate them by telling our followers that if they have not gone to see it, Run to your favorite cinema! If they are Mexican they will be happy to see how they dignify our culture after so many grievances and if they are not Mexican, but want to know and understand Mexico (especially the Day of the Dead tradition) it is the most fun way to do it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is an unusually strong offering from people wanting to build a bridge and not a wall,"In this age of hostility it's a wonder anything positive could survive social media and especially anything so well done and ambitious. It's as if the creators were somehow protected from the daily knocks we all witness or read about. But somehow they've managed to make an intensely educational film entertaining and powerfully emotional.Some of the characters are so spot on they ought to be studied in cultural classes. And the story is clever and brilliant; it's not easy to find a way to treat death and the afterlife that doesn't affect sensibilities. And it's all done in a very uplifting way without the slightest bit of resentment.I'm sure there are many who aren't interested, but for the more important group, those willing to listen, this movie is just what the doctor ordered.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
AMAZING -- But not for Everyone,"As a familia, we went to see Disney's/Pixar's Coco last night at the the little Empire Cinema in Brewster. WARNING! visually tantalizing film with excellent story, emotionally evocative and terrific humor, but not for everyone.Only other attendees, middle aged couple sitting near the back and family of 5 across the aisle; three kids, 7, 4, 2. Throughout the film the 4 year old intermittently screamed her head off terrified of the many skeletal characters. The 2 year old was either hypnotized by the visuals, or also screamed in panic as the Mom dragged the hysterical 4 year old out and then back again. (Sometimes Mom carried both out) This happened at least 5 times. Eventually the 2 year old calmed down, allowed to roll in the aisle spreading out a bed of popcorn she upended onto the aisle.On our side of the aisle we were well behaved, thanks to Tootsie Rolls an Fig Newtons. The aging Coco was truly amazing to me. The design and animation very close to the reality of my own Mom in her last stage of life. Tears were frequent. Upon leaving we passed the still seated middle aged couple. The husband's eyes covered by his hands also in tears.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A happy movie for happy people,"This is a Pixar movie that I have known for 7 years but only now had the chance to watch. I watched it twice in a row. The movie made me think and worry about the concept of life and death. Every movie has its pros and cons. This one is no exception. What I loved about the movie was first and foremost the music. The songs were catchy and had good melodies. The Mexican culture of Día de Muertos was presented in a very interesting way. It was a meaningful holiday with a message about family. The story of the photos was complete and clearly told. I was quite moved when the two pieces of the photo were put together at the end of the movie.But let's talk a little about the points I'm not satisfied with the movie. The story still has holes that are not explained. Why does playing the guitar make Miguel disappear? The plot also gives quite hasty answers. It's like people immediately accept the truth about the villain. Remember, these are fans, they don't easily give up on their idols so quickly, like in a blink. MIguel's too quick change about his idol is also not convincing. And the desk drawer containing the letters, they were right there and no one knew about it for years? And there are some things that aren't compelling. The world of the dead isn't interesting, it's just a bustling city. The villain isn't particularly special. He doesn't even need to act like he does at the end. Because what evidence does the boy have other than his own words? It's not entirely convincing. The way he ends up is also boring. Did he die twice?Finally, I would like to talk about my thoughts on the theme of the movie, life and death. It is part of the universe and everyone has to go through it. The movie is about family and has a happy ending. But for those who have been hurt by their families, seeing happy families may only make them more hurt. It's tiring to see that in the world of the dead, people also yearn to be remembered. There are people who just want to be forgotten. Not everyone grew up happily to enjoy this movie. That is why I say the beauty of this movie is not for everyone. Sometimes, we cannot avoid being forgotten. And in a way, this also hides a very unique beauty, which this movie has not fully shown. Like Chicharrón and his guitar.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coco Es Excelente,"I have always loved Pixar films (well, most of them) and was looking forward to this as an original return to form for the animation studio. It followed through on that promise and then some. Stunningly animated, culturally relevant and emotionally powerful, this animated stunner is Pixar's best film since ""Toy Story 3."" Lee Unkrich's direction is excellent, making the film a gorgeous and stunning love letter to not only Mexico but its people and culture. The plot is thoroughly engaging throughout, and never becomes predictable despite the presence of several Pixar tropes. While some of the small children in the audience I was with got a little antsy, everyone still had a great time and absorbed the unique details of the story.Pixar's art direction is second to none in the film. The Land of the Dead is laid out as a visual wonderland, with more unique puns and Easter eggs to count on a first viewing. The all-Hispanic voice cast are uniformly great, and the film manages to be both entertaining and fun while still incredibly powerful at the same time: a nearly impossible trick to pull off in an animated film. The film's action and travel scenes are thrilling, but the movie never loses grip of its strong and hopeful message about the value of family and familial love. At the end of the day, both children and adults will love this film, which is one of the year's best. It's great to see that Pixar can still continue touch generations with animated films of exceptional quality like the ones that helped them become a household name. 10/10Note: The short film that precedes the feature, ""Olaf's Frozen Adventure,"" is a bit of a waste. It probably doesn't help that I'm not much of a Frozen fan, but it's quite long (over 20 minutes) and the songs are rather annoying.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Pixar Is Back! Beautiful, Stunning and Emotional","It can't be denied that Pixar is one of the best studios of animation. Most of their movies have become classics and we all love their characters (Monster Inc, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Toy Story, Up, etc.) But since 2010 the only great Pixar movie had been Inside Out, the rest of them being boring or unnecessary sequels that weren't so great. But with this movie Pixar is back at its best form.This movie tells us the story of a young kid who wants to be a musician like his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz, but his family does not let him play music, so he starts a journey across the Land of the Dead in the Day of the Dead festivity to try to follow his dreams. Well, my only issue with this movie is that the basic idea of the story is not that original. I mean, a kid wants to do something, but his family won't let him, so he has to do something about it to finally reach his dreams. But the way the story is told to us is the thing that will make you forget this. It's a really beautiful story about the family, the love and the music, all with the background of the Mexican culture. About this, I have to say that Pixar exceeded my expectations. They really did a great research of every little detail of the Mexican culture and they put it into the movie with such a love and care that just for seeing all of those little details you would want to watch it a second time (in the credits you can see all the name of the families that helped in this research and that shows the interest Pixar put into it).The cast (well, voice cast was really great). From the young Anthony Gonzalez (as Miguel) to Benjamin Bratt (as Ernesto de la Cruz) or Gael Garcia Bernal (as Hector) they are all perfect in their roles and they give a special feeling to their characters that was really great and added a lot to the story. It's usual in good Pixar movies that it has really lovely characters and this is no exception. It has some really wonderfully crafted characters that you fall in love with even in a less than two hour film.The visuals of this movie are amazing (what you expect?). All the recreation of the Mexican culture is fantastic, with really colorful landscapes, and with a lot of little details full of meaning. Some shots even looked like they were real images with animated characters in it. The music is fantastic as well. There are some really beautiful songs. I especially love the song Remember Me (Recuérdame) that appears in many different versions throughout the movie and it is really emotional. And also a special mention to the Pixar composer by excellence, Michael Giacchino (who even has a brief cameo in the movie as orchestra leader) who as usually gives the movie a lot more emotion with his beautiful melodies, bu also recreates the musical soundscape of Mexico with really funny musical tracks with guitars, trumpets and so on.I would recommend this movie to everyone. I mean, it's a movie that will touch you for sure (I cried for the final 10 minutes of the movie). It's really beautiful, with lovely characters, stunning visuals and really emotional music. What else would you want? It's Pixar at its best. I think you don't need more, so go watch it right now!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Remember us...,"Yeah, Pixar returns to telling classic stories of family and love in animated ""Coco"". Directors Adrian Molina and Lee Unkrich's ""Coco"" surprise with their story surrounding The Day of the Dead – Dia de Los Muertos. Vibrant images and colors amaze with texture and wonder. ""Coco""'s state-of-the art CGI visuals alone astound. Yet, its big heart lies in the story. Molina and Matthew Aldrich's screenplay resonates forgiveness and remembrance. When Anthony Gonzalez, who voices Miguel, sings ""Remember Me"" near the end tears shall fall. The stories and memories of those we love define legacy. That makes ""Coco"" so special.Miguel's Great Great Grandfather abandoned his family to pursue his dream of becoming a musician. His great Great Great Grandmother voided the memory of her husband in photos and life, creating the family shoemaking business in his absence. She condemned all music for the family. Coco is Miguel's wheelchair bound Great Grandmother, who seems to remember very little, much less her Father.However, 10 year-old Miguel has no interest in the family business. Secretly he is the singer songwriter, who plays guitar much like his Great Great Grandfather. His dream is to perform music like his hero Ernesto de la Cruz, voiced by proud Benjamin Bratt. His music inspires Miguel.On Dia de Los Muertos the spirits of deceased family members visit their homes in the real world. These spirits who look like luminescent skeletons cross over the autumn leave covered bridge between our world and the Dead. Rather unnerving and creepy at first, this soon passes. Those forgotten in the real world become ""truly"" Dead.In ""Coco"" Miguel crosses over to the world of the Dead when he steals Ernesto's legendary guitar. He needs to find Ernesto, who might be family. If Miguel fails to return by next sunrise he shall remain there forever. Surprisingly the world of the Dead is filled with multicolored lights and life. The sights and music of ""Coco"" delight.On Miguel's journey to find Ernesto, he meets his deceased relatives including his Great Great Grandmother, who outlawed all music in the family. Miguel befriends musician Hector, voiced by whimsical compassionate Gael Garcia Bernal. As a friend of Ernesto, Hector promises to help Miguel meet him at his annual concert. Directors Molina and Unkrich create the touching bond between the two. Hector inspires Miguel to find his unique voice. While Miguel gives Hector the faith of family.In Great Great Grandmother's epiphany, she may not forgive her husband for forsaking her and their daughter to pursue his love of music. Yet she remembers him, and remembers their love. In a sense remembrance allows for forgiveness.At times ""Coco"" is loud pretty eye candy as it succumbs to the simple seek and find narrative. But the surprise reveals what you kind of know half way through. Miguel discovers his legacy and the family who loves him. Those who come before us are the possibility of love and becoming greater than we know. ""Coco"" touched my heart. Life is about love and family.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

An exploding piñata of vivid colours and warm feelings,"Back in 2014, Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) was used as subject matter in The Book of Life, but I couldn't get pass the half hour mark. It was too kid-friendly and too contrived for my taste. I never like stories which I can map out the narrative trajectory way ahead of time. Sitting in the cinema, the first 15 minutes of Coco had me charting the story ahead of time and the dreaded feeling cascaded over me. Then, when it was least expected, the rug was pulled out from under my feet and I watched the rest of the movie with a big smile and with tears streaming down at the end, every tear was earned.Coco had some exposition to get through in the beginning and got through it did with panache and familial familiarity. The backstory is told through paper cut-outs and we learned why music is downright detested in the extended family. Though the attention to details is stunning, my mind unconsciously went down the dream-broken-dream-fulfilled road of redemption. But ever so surreptitiously Pixar surprises with a sharp turn and delivers another sumptuous piece of storytelling with Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 3) holding the steering wheel.Coco possesses a kinetic charm as Miguel, excellently voiced by Anthony Gonzalez, waltzes through the Land of the Dead in a vivid sea of colours. The world building is amazingly rendered with its own internal physics and reality. It is a riot of warm hues and buoyant mariachi music, a thoroughly realised universe with skeletal figures that have real souls.The characters are all well-drawn and the voice work by the all-Latino cast is excellent. The passion is evident in full wonder and as vivid as a rose petal on snow. The Mexican culture and traditions fill the screen with authenticity and are lovingly rendered. So much is conveyed via a framed photograph on a family altar that it transcends to something else altogether. The reverence for the folks who have passed on is well-handled. When it hits the last act, my tears streamed down.Coco is no Inside Out (2015), but it is still a timely and glowing piece of work, an exploding piñata of colours and all shades of warm feelings. School is out, bring your kids to watch this and after that, sit somewhere nice and share about all those family members who had passed on and who meant so much to you. I think the act itself keeps them ""alive"".PS – I do feel that the trailer inadvertently let out some of twists in the story, so I would suggest not watching it if you intend to see the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
