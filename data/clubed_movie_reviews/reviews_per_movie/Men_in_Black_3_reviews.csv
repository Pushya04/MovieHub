Super underrated.,"Before the time travel stuff, it's a bit tired...but man, once we go back in time, it's actually astonishing how great it is. Brolin rules, the model party scene is perfect, and I don't think it can be overstated how wonderful Griff is. Most importantly, it solidifies J and K's relationship in ways that most Hollywood comedy sequels wouldn't even bother, becoming a surprisingly emotional story of friendship and commitment.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Bigger Imaginations,"It's been a decade since the last MIB film was released. We kind of missed the series even though Men In Black 2 wasn't really that good. In this sequel, it's pretty small and unnecessary but it still has the charms and bright imagination. Great Performances and Solid Visuals. It also has the same tone of the original Men In Black films. It's a wonderful action, adventure movie with non-stop enjoyment.Thankfully, it does not follow the modern blockbuster roots and stay loyal to its own. By the way, this is a comical action film. It may not be a large one but what matters here is the fun characters. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones still got it but who shines here is Josh Brolin. He can perfectly imitate the facial expression and voice of Agent K and it's a lot better when he's around.The plot sounds like a generic time traveling story, but there are imaginative and wonderful sequences in these. The humor is still clever. There is still a heart. The action is not quite appealing but the time jump scene was spectacular. A lot of people will be rooting for the design of the villain, Boris the Animal. At first glance, you might think it's creepy but you'll realize how awesome he actually looks.Blockbusters like this are now obsolete. Our usual modern blockbusters are generic and bland cookie-cutters that are easy to be forgotten. This actually stays to its own kind. It's comical, it has life, it cares to the characters no matter how small and absurd the story is. Yes, it's small, but there are so many merits that are worth seeing. Either you're a fan of the series or not, you'll find it very enjoyable. The Men in Black series is still imaginative and fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Josh Brolin Played a Perfect Tommy Lee Jones,"I am not exactly a Will Smith fan. I think the last Will Smith film I watched and liked was the first ""Men in Black"" film back in 1997. I was surprised to learn that there will be another installment of ""Men in Black"" this year, the third of the series. The second MiB was shown in 2002, and I did not even care to finish that one. Will the ten years between the last episode and this one make a difference? I needed to see that.In this film, a vicious alien villain known as Boris the Animal escapes from his prison on the moon, where he had been locked up since being arrested by Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) back in 1969. One day, Agent K disappears from the present day. His partner Agent J (Will Smith) realizes that K had been assassinated by Boris forty years ago, which caused a major change of events, allowing Boris' alien race to overrun the Earth. J had to find a way to travel back in time to 1969 in order to save K and rectify the tragic consequences of his death. Can J save K and in turn save the Earth from the clutches of Boris?The odd couple was just as they were before in the first films. Will Smith is still his old loudmouth Agent J as Tommy Lee Jones was his tight-lipped Agent K. As J goes back to the past, he will interact with the young 29-year old K, perfectly played by Josh Brolin. Brolin amazingly captures the laconic persona, and even the distinct voice, of Jones so well that they seemed to have been one and the same actor. It was also good to see Emma Thompson again in a major film as she portrayed Agent O, another senior agent with a soft spot for K. The younger Agent O was played by a cutie named Alice Eve, but she certainly did not convince us that she would look or act like Emma Thompson when she grows older.I must say that this film was really a most entertaining one. Well, maybe more for me than for my kids. Younger audiences may find the jokes about 1969 cultural references, such as the hippies, the racial tension, etc., to be a bit difficult to grasp. But the fun action sequences with some exciting futuristic vehicles and weaponry, the imaginative and repulsive aliens made by no less than the master monster-maker Rick Baker, the thrilling integration of the historic Apollo 11 lift-off, and the touching revelation of K's big secret made this a very good and enjoyable movie to watch. 3D did not seem necessary. Director Barry Sonnenfeld got it right this time, and this segment certainly gave perfect closure to the story arc of the whole series.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Surpassing the previous two movies...,"I will start out by saying that ""Men in Black 3"" is the best of the series so far, at least in my opinion. Why? Well simply because of the depths of the story, it is better planned and executed, and more enjoyable than the previous ones.The story ""Men in Black 3"" is about Agent J traveling back in time to prevent an alien invasion of Earth and to prevent the assassination of his partner, Agent K.Unlike the previous movies, the various aliens in all their strange appearances do not have that much of a prominent part of the movie. Sure they are there, but mostly as background characters. That is nice in itself, because there is still a large range of strange alien creatures to be seen, just in a less active role in the movie. The story in ""Men in Black 3"" is more character driven, with focus on Agents J and K in particular, and a single alien, Boris the Animal. This does work out quite nicely, because the story takes on a more personal aspect of storytelling, and there is a really, really great moment towards the end of the movie when you learn the truth about the two agents relationship. That was something that I really enjoyed.Again, you have Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones returning to their roles, and then Josh Brolin really pulled off stepping into the shoes of portraying a younger version of Agent K. Boris the Animal was also nicely played by Jemaine Clement. And Emma Thompson stepping in as Agent O, new leader of the MIB agency after Zed having passed on.And as with the previous two movies, the CGI effects in the movie were really great, and the aliens were realistic and believable. Which really is an important thing to make a movie like this enjoyable.I found this to be the best of the series so far, because it is a more personal story where the multitude of strange alien creatures didn't have a huge part of the screen all the time. And the depths of the plot were well planned and executed, despite the minor flaws here and there (if you read through the 'Goofs' (here on IMDb), but that is really minor details that, I will admit that I didn't notice at all, you'd notice only if you are a, well, a nerd! No offense to anyone. But you really have to be a perfectionist to factual details to notice that, so hats off to those who pointed them out.If you enjoyed ""Men in Black"" or ""Men in Black II"", then you definitely have to watch ""Men in Black 3"", because it adds a lot to the overall storyline of the MIB universe.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A playful return to form....well, almost.","A decade away from the movie scene has given the Men In Black series a chance at a fresher, newer perspective. Taking its cue from Shrek Forever After, MIB 3 takes on a tired concept (time travel in this case) if only to acknowledge the failure of its dull sequel and take us back to a different era allowing us to view the franchise from an unsullied angle. The result is a film that returns to its roots and gives audiences the chance to relive much of what they first enjoyed – a smart, sci-fi, buddy comedy that embraces everything weird and wonderful about the unknown universe.In his first cinematic role in nearly 4 years, Will Smith's Agent J is the usual charming, witty wiseass we expect him to be. Still teamed up with the laconic Agent K (wrinkly Tommy Lee Jones) he is no closer to cracking his older partners deadpan demeanour but their relationship issues take a back seat when a nemesis from Kay's past, Boris the animal, turns up to exact revenge for having been imprisoned on the moon 40 years ago. His elaborate plan takes him back in the past, to the day he was caught, and sets ripples in the present, where K no longer exists and a different reality results. J has to then literally time jump (off the Empire State building no less) and fix the past for normalcy to return in the present.Directly Barry Sonnenfeld seems to find his groove once again with the zany and icky shenanigans that put him on the map with the original. Using plenty of the wide angle camera work that gave him fame as the Coen's favourite lenser, the resulting imagery should work wonders for those who decide to pay extra and catch the film on 3D (converted). Boris the animal is also a return to series villains being screwball and menacing in equal measure (remember Vincent D'Onofrio?) and Rick Baker's excellent makeup effects are both incredible and revolting. The big surprise is how well Josh Brolin impersonates Jones in the role of a younger K – which should not be a surprise considering Brolin's recent, impressive body of work as a bonafide actor, most notably in W. So chameleon-like is his performance that you forget it's him and actually completely believe it's just a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones that you're seeing.The films primary achievement and a true signal of its return to form though are the scenes set in the past. Not only is Josh Brolin a deadringer for Tommy Lee's K during his youth, but the hip musical vibes of the late 60's/early 70's allow for plenty of playfulness to ensue with a particularly hilarious segment devoted to Andy Warhol. If that isn't enough, everything very neatly ties into another epochal scientific moment from that time period and ends on a moment of curiously satisfying emotionality that provides not only closure to the film but the series as a whole. If that doesn't make you forgive all the wrongs that the sequel did and embrace this film as one of the years better movie franchise offerings the only thing that might work on you is a neuralizer.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Entertaining and well made,"This film is about Agent J going back in time to rescue Agent K from being murdered by aliens.My friends say that ""Men in Black III"" is a brainless comedy, you can go in just for a few laughs and switch your brain off. After watching it, I can safely say that I have another opinion.""Men in Black III"" does have its brainless moments. It can be politically incorrect too, but it is entertaining and fun to watch. Special effects are realistic, and the scene involving a very tall building made me so nervous that my palms perspired a lot! The ending is very touching; I certainly did not see it coming even though a friend guessed it.I think it is great that ""Men in Black III"" manages to combine emotional elements in the middle of mainstream blockbuster entertainment. I look forward to the next film in the series already.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Adventure,"The criminal Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from the LunaMax, a moon-based maximum security prison. He comes to Earth seeking revenge from Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) that has blown his arm up and arrested him forty years ago and protected Earth from a Boglodyte invasion. Boris is defeated again and he travels back in time to 1969 to kill Agent K.When Agent J (Will Smith) notes that the time line has changed in the present days and Agent O (Emma Thompson) tells him that K died in 1969, he decides to travel to 15 July 1969 to save K on the next day. Agent J has difficulties to convince the Young Agent K (Josh Brolin) with lies, but when he decides to tell the truth, K believes in his words and they seek out Boris together.They are helped by the amicable alien Griiffin (Michael Stuhlbarg) that has precognitive powers and gives the ArcNet to K to protect Earth from the Boglodyte invasion. Further, J learns a secret about K and himself.""Men in Black 3"" is a great adventure of this franchise, with a wonderful story and magnificent special effects.

A Bit Outdated But  MiB3 Is Still Fun,"Well, whaddaya know, the ""MiB"" have gone MiA for 10 years already! No wonder many of us have forgotten about them as Men In Cape and Bodysuits (aka The Avengers, Batman, Spider-Man, et al) have been hogging the cinemas while the ""Men In Black"" go missing-in-action. No matter, they are still a barrel of fun in this three-quel that comes as more of a surprise than a treat that we have been waiting for.And with Barry Sonnenfeld back at the helm of this troubled and delayed US$215-million production, it is a nostalgic film in more ways than one.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles as agents J and K of the secret Men in Black organization that monitors alien activity on Earth. The 'odd-couple' have their work cut out for them when extra-terrestrial serial killer Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from his maximum security prison on the moon and travels back in time to kill K. Since only J remembers K's existence, it's up to him to venture through time, look for a young K (now played by Josh Brolin) and stop Boris from destroying the world once and for all.I have never been a fan of time-travel plots and I still don't like them. However, the time-travel subplot here is just to provide the ""Back To The Future"" fantasy to the MiB franchise. The narrative, as well as the mood and tone of the movie, are light-hearted, fun and always on the outer limits of credibility. Again, it is nice to see how a deadpan face like Jones' can generate so much mirth. The Smith & Jones pairing is augmented by Brolin who gives a good representation of how K would be in the Sixties, with most of the sequences accompanied by popular Sixties hits on the soundtrack.One of the staple jokes of the MiB series is the celebrity cameos that suggest alien origins. In MiB3, we have a 'twist' that suggests a certain pop art personality is an undercover MiB agent! Still, the mainstay of the MiB series is Rick Baker's creature designs and make-up rendered in 3D. The 'monster show' does not disappoint, especially that of a huge fish that attacks diners at a Chinese restaurant. Oh yes, there are also a couple of cool gadgets and vehicles like the giant wheel hoover-bikes used by Agents J and K. On the whole, Agents J and K still provide the 'L'. - limchangmoh.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A shocking return to form after the sub-par second film, ""Men in Black 3"" is a fast, fun, quirky film and a surprisingly good sequel.","I remember back in 2002, after ""Men in Black II"" came out, there was chatter about a third film. And I was excited to see a third film, even though the second was a poorly-written, under-developed cash-grab that felt as though it was without identity. I was just too addicted to the chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, and I loved the world that director Barry Sonnenfeld had helped create in the first two entries.But as time went on, it seemed less and less likely. Sure, we'd hear a tidbit of news here, or a rumor there... But it was never anything substantial. After about five years, I gave up all hope that a third film would even happen. So you can imagine my surprise when this film was finally released in 2012, about 10 years after the prior entry.And you can also imagine my surprise that despite the second film being... well, pretty bad, this one was actually a very shocking and surprising return to form, and is actually a pretty strong and generally well-told sequel.Smith and Jones return as agents J and K, now having known each other for about 14 years. They have their usual tension and banter, but J is starting to notice some odd things about K, and wonders what made him the way he is. However, this is put on hold when a ruthless alien villain called Boris ""The Animal"" (Jemaine Clement) escapes from prison and uses a time traveling device to go back in time and murder a younger Agent K. J, somehow being one of the only people to remember who who K even was, is forced to follow Boris back to 1969 and stop him from killing a younger Agent K (Josh Brolin). J and the young K must also work together to stop Boris's other dastardly plans for the future in the process.The acting is a lot better this time around. Particularly in terms of the chemistry between Smith and Jones, which I felt was somewhat muted by the poor writing in the prior film. Their banter and dialog is almost as good as it was in the original, and both actors are great not only together, but on their own as well. Josh Brolin is also a bit of a revelation as the young K, who appears on-screen far more than the older, modern K. Brolin isn't just doing a Tommy Lee Jones impression, he's doing something different, since K was a different man in 1969. It's interesting to see how K evolves and changes over the course of the film due to what happens, and we can see how he will eventually become the man we first see in the original. Brolin just nailed it perfectly.The villain portrayed by Clement is also a lot of fun, and he has some great moments of not only comedy, but of intimidation and creepiness. (Although I will admit he's not a deep character and is borderline one- dimensional, I can forgive it because at least he wasn't terribly written as... certain other villains from a certain other ""Men in Black"" sequel were) And Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, a 5th dimensional being who is able to see all possible outcomes of all situations at once in the past, present and future is a LOT of fun. He's a major supporting character, and both his child-like glee and his darkness in being such an all-seeing character are both well played. He's almost the heart of the film.The production is a lot of fun, especially with the time-travel plot, which gives us two radically different visual aesthetics. The set, costume and of course Rick Baker's alien designs are fantastic in both time-lines. I particularly enjoyed how Baker and his team made the aliens in the 1969 New York look more like aliens from cheesy, old- school Sci-Fi flicks from that era as opposed to the more modern and intricate designs of characters from the modern day sequences.Sonnenfeld's direction is a lot more fluid and fun in this film. (Again, as opposed to the second... I really hate to keep comparing this film to the second, but it's hard not to when this is so much better) And the script written by Etan Cohen is funny, tightly-paced and has some unexpected and truly heartfelt moments that may in fact bring a tear to your eye.This film does lose a few points, however, in that some of its jokes are very hit and miss, and a few plot-related issues. In particular with the time-travel approach. I did notice many inconsistencies and changes to the ""rules"" of time travel throughout. And it did bug me quite a bit. However, not enough to ruin the film.Despite some flaws, this is still a very solid, well-made sequel and is a definite return to form for the series. And it has re-ignited that ""Men in Black"" fire, and left me hoping for a potential fourth film.I give ""Men in Black 3"" a pretty good 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"It's not perfect, but Men in Black III is a fun return for the series.","In 1997, the first Men in Black came out. It was something no one had ever seen before: a sci-fi movie crossed with the buddy comedy and action genres? To this day it remains one of my personal favorite movies. However, I was disappointed with its sequel, Men in Black II. The film felt like a almost a carbon copy of the original. Ten years later, we have Men in Black III. It's quite a surprise to see this franchise after it was pretty much left for dead. But is it any good? Yes it is. Men in Black III is a fun movie, a cool and nostalgic trip down memory lane. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it's still a blast.The film takes place in 2012, 10 years after the second movie. Agents J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) are still partners, working for the Men in Black, a secret government organization which monitors all alien life on Earth. But one day, J goes to work and finds out that K was assassinated in 1969. J must then go back in time and team up with a young Agent K (Josh Brolin) to fix the future and stop an alien invasion.The cast is rock solid as always. Will Smith looks like he's having a blast as the cool, wise ass Agent J. Tommy Lee Jones plays Agent K, the expressionless, relaxed veteran. Jermaine Clement plays the films villain, the vicious Boris the Animal, and Emma Thompson is just alright as the new leader of the MiB, Agent O. But the real star of the show is Josh Brolin as a young Agent K. The whole movie you forget he's just an actor and believe he's really a 29-year-old K. His performance is very believable and well done.The special effects and makeup, some of the most praised parts of the MiB series, are very good. Danny Elfman's score is also top-notch, sounding very Men-in-Blacky (Is that even a word?). The set pieces too are very cool. You feel like you are in 1969, with not only New York City, but also a scene later in the film with the Apollo 11 mission taking off.However, the flaws of the film are in the script. The screenplay is very funny, and is well written, for the most part. The problems lie within the plot holes and goof-ups. The relationship between Agent K and O could have been fleshed out more. I was left unsatisfied with that plot line. For the goof-ups, there's one instance where J is talking to Young K, and he mentions ""Jedi Knight Mind Tricks"". K then looks like he knows exactly what he is talking about. That part of the film takes place in 1969. Star Wars came out in 1977. Whoops.Another problem with the film was that it was just too long. At some points during the film I was a little bit bored. They probably could have shaved off about 10-15 minutes of the film and it would be fine.In conclusion, Men in Black III is a surprisingly fun movie. It's very funny, very well acted, and very cool. Unfortunately the script and longer running time prevent it from being a classic like the first movie. Still, if you just want some great fun at the movies, definitely give MiB3 a go.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Not bad... But disappointing,"Although MIB3 wasn't necessarily a 'bad' movie, it certainly wasn't as good as it could have been. It seemed, while watching the marketing plugs, like they were going to bring the big guns and bring back all the funny stuff and cool special effects, but they just fell short. The original was quite good -- Funny, a little scary, cool characters, good stunts, very original. Part II was just bad. So, if you are going to wait 10 years to do a three-quel that nobody really was dying to see because part 2 was so bad, then you better make part 3 REALLY good -- Right?Well -- It wasn't REALLY good. It was OK. I wanted to love it, but I honestly only barely liked it. It was lacking the things that made the franchise 'cool.' There was no talking pug, no funny pawn shop guy, no real interesting or funny aliens at all. The lead bad-guy alien was a somewhat interesting character, but no real personality. Nothing that made you want more of him. And other than him, there was hardly any other aliens in it. One little stint in a Chinese restaurant, but nothing rememorable. No funny ones. I just don't understand not making more characters like the ones that made the first such a hit. And even Wil Smith wasn't funny. He was funnier during his promotions on talk shows than in his movie. He just seemed to walk through the whole thing.ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to see it in 3D. None.I hate to say it -- But the special effects were awful. With technology today, most special effects are seamless. As an audience, we now 'expect' good effects. Half the time, it was very obvious when they were using backdrops and green screens and had super-imposed stuff. That's just a deal-breaker in today's movie-going world.The one truly redeeming quality it had -- and it was good -- was Josh Brolin playing the younger K (Tommy Lee Jones). He was spot on and did a great job. But even that isn't enough to carry a movie that wants to be a summer Blockbuster.Bottome Line -- Rent it. It's worth seeing if you have it lying around the house and have nothing to do, but not if you have to pay full price, and nothing you have to run right out and see.And this is from a fan of Wil Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and Josh Brolin.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A great ending to the trilogy,"What a weird film. Men in Black 3 started off incredibly poorly, yet somehow kept improving throughout and managed to end on quite a high note. In a way, it was the perfect ending for this trilogy and I think that it left a lot of people very satisfied.One might ask whether it was necessary to make an additional Men in Black film, especially so many years after the first two. But seeing this final instalment, confirmed that it was indeed a good idea to make one, despite all its flaws.After the first 10 minutes, I was ready to declare that this by far the worst film in the trilogy. Everything felt overly cheesy and the acting was awful at times. Yet, as soon as Agent J travelled back in time, the film really started to pick up. As you would expect from a Men in Black film, it started to be very fun and entertaining, and by the middle of the film, I had completely forgotten about how I felt in the beginning.Then came the ending. I was not expecting it at all. It was actually quite beautifully done and ended up being rather emotional. It threw a twist into the whole story, and I, for one, warmly welcomed it. As mentioned, it really felt like it was the perfect way to end things. It gave closure, especially in the context of this final film, and it allowed us to bid a warm farewell to the duo.If you liked the two previous films, you will like this one as well. It isn't as good as the first one, but it's certainly better than the second one. Men in Black 3 is an entertaining, fun, satisfying, and at times cheesy, ending to an iconic trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Reasonably entertaining,"While this film isn't very popular among critics I found it to be reasonably entertaining but completely forgettable. In fact, I have watched it a few months ago and I barely remember the plot now. Overall, I found it a solid film for the crowds. Solid entertainment for the masses. It doesn't reach the heights of the first film (which weren't that high) but it doesn't fall as low as MIB 2, which sucked, big time. This one is more solid and well executed.So what can I say about it? Well, I liked that the villain always said: ""Let's agree to disagree."" Which is the most memorable thing in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
At last a good sequel,"Once again our favorite MIB agents Jay & Kay are battling it out for earth. Quick action, colorful villains, beautifully designed settings and CGI, comic relief in the face of imminent destruction, all those made the first two movies great as well as successful in the box office. Could they better the formula in the face of all the other bad sequels we have been seeing for years?This is one of the reasons I had stepped into the cinema with trepidation. (Good grief, was it 1997 when I saw the first and ten years ago the second? How time flies). The other reason was the pitfall of time travel.Time travel is one of the favorite themes in sci fi movies but it needs to be handled carefully. My humble word of advice to the script writers: Keep-It-Simple. Avoid overtly complicated jumps back and forth and paradoxes that confuse the audience. Remember the eventual mess in the Back To The Future trilogy? I was then so pleased to see that they kept the time travel relatively simple and easy to follow. There was a small part when they crossed the line juuust a tiny bit when young agent Kay meets a certain father and son (don't want to spoil it). Even if traveling back in time was possible, you wouldn't necessarily bump into everyone you know in the present.Will Smith is in his usual good form in his character Jay which however needs Kay to balance him. It is then fortunate that Brolin gives a great performance as the young agent.Was it better than the 1997original? It was as good, without the novelty value obviously. Was it as good as the MIB2? I would say that it surpassed the second.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Alien Fun,"It is really hard to believe that it has been 10 years since the last Men in Black film. I have to say that this film was much better than the last film which was really just a regurgitation of the first one. This film had a lot more substance and managed to tie up some loose ends which I really appreciated. I think that this film works in 3D because there is a lot of falling through time, which my niece and nephew loved. I have to give major props to Josh Brolin (younger Agent K) who had the daunting task of portraying an actor portraying a role. Tommy Lee Jones (old Agent K) just basically had to be himself (smile). Josh was totally convincing and did an excellent job imitating Tommy's persona. I liked the introduction of Agent O (Emma Thompson) who had one of the funniest scenes in the film and literally had me laughing out loud. I also liked the fact that a women was in charge of such a prestigious agency. As usual Will Smith (Agent J) came up with very comical explanations of the weird situations that occur during the film. I think that my favorite character in the film is Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg). He was a psychic who could see into the various futures that could occur if certain things happen. I was a little confused at first, but as the film progressed, I finally got it. I related to this character because I have always believed that you always have at least two doors to open (e.g. you can pick up that piece of paper or not) and whatever you decide to do affects everything else. Okay, enough of philosophy class and back to the film. The one thing about all the Men in Black films is all of the different characters that the visual effect crew create. You have to appreciate the imagination of those folks. I also like to check out the aliens that they are monitoring at the agency, for example in the first one they were monitoring Michael Jackson and Agent J's elementary school teacher. Appropriately in this film you get flashes of Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber (appropriately). I wonder if they have to agree to that? Anyway, this was a very entertaining film and you will be glad that you saw it in 3D. I give this film an out-of-this-world green light. Enjoy!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"One highlight, Josh Brolin has perfected Tommy Lee Jones","Well it's been 10 years since the dismal MIB2 where Johnny Knoxville at the height of his Jackass fame was miscast as an obscure evil sidekick, so 3 is at the very least an improvement. However, the 3D is not worthy, while other than a few decent gags from the fast talking Will Smith, it's Josh Brolin who steals every scene he appears in as the young Agent K. Sending Agent J back to the swinging 1960's New York was cool, especially in a clever Andy Warhol moment and a few observational one-liners The non-event plot as it turns out could have been extended more and gets plain ridiculous at a NASA launch, but there is a nice emotional touch at the end, but too little too late. Certain scenes are expertly choreographed, effects are mostly cool, the bad guy here (both versions) is a waste of time and boring. Overall MIB3D works as popcorn entertainment for kids.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Saving the future back in time,"Love the first 'Men in Black', still find it an immensely entertaining film with lots of fun, thrills and excitement. Was far less taken with the second film, it was not that awful to me but it wasn't great.While not as great as the first film (a tall order), 'Men in Black 3' from personal opinion, and most others, improves quite a bit on the second film. Could it have been better? Yes it could, and it's far from perfect, nothing done truly terribly but there are elements that come up short. But considering as expectations were not exactly high watching the film, with the worry that despite the appetising cast, that it would be one of those sequel too far films, 'Men in Black 3' was better than expected.The script is hit and miss, there is some fun and witty humour but also elements that feel long-winded and stale. The time travel elements of the story sees some sloppy logic inconstancies, and while emotional the ending felt rushed to me.As talented an actress Emma Thompson is she is wasted here in a far too brief role that she doesn't look completely comfortable in. Alice Eve is pretty bland.However, 'Men in Black 3' is a good-looking, slickly photographed film with imaginative production design and make up and polished effects. The music is suitably adrenaline pumping and atmospheric while Barry Sonnenfeld directs in a way highly suggestive of him remembering what made the first film click so well.Generally 'Men in Black 3' is spirited in pace, while having a mix of funny, witty jokes and emotional heart and a story that, while thin structurally and not the most original, has well choreographed action (the time jump is spectacular), fun escapism and charming buddy film elements.Will Smith oozes cool charisma, while Tommy Lee Jones (despite being underused) is suitably curmudgeonly. Jemaine Clement is a menacing and enjoyable mix of the sinister and the camp, while Michael Stulbarg's Griffin is flesh crawling. Stealing the film is the revelation that is Josh Brolin.In summary, pretty good third instalment, not top form but hardly bottom of the barrel. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A must watch for the MIB followers,"Are you still confused on why Agent K recruited Agent J knowing his dumb wittiness? Get the answer in Men In Black III.The dashing duo, Will Smith and Tomy Lee Jones are black in their pristinely cut Men In Black suit for their third 'alienistic' adventure to protect the planet. But no talking dog in this one and you will probably miss him. What more? The viewers will see the emotional bond strengthen between Agent K and Agent J.Boris The Animal (Jemaine Clement) and Agent K has a dark past as a result of which the demon was locked up in a prison on the Moon. Years later, he escapes with vengeance over K and kills him by time travelling to the past.Men In Black III leaps back in time to 1969 just before the launch of the Appolo where Agent J (Will Smith) has to save the life of Agent K (Tomy Lee Jones) from the spidery hands of Boris by killing him from the past. There is time travelling several times that makes you confused. But you will not get messed up rethinking about it. And you guys are sure to enjoy watching the younger K back in 1969 who is wittier. You need not keep a track on the previous films to understand MIB 3.Will Smith, just like in the earlier parts, takes up the centre stage and rocks as Agent J. His spontaneous dialogues and witty jokes never get you bored. Compared to the earlier movies, Tomy has a not much of screen space this time as his younger version takes up the role as J's partner, portrayed by Josh Brolin.Josh Brolin has taken the special effort to be the young K. His impersonation of Tomy's character is flawless and the most convincing. Well, with a little wit of course. No wonder J keeps asking 'what happened to you?'The movie has less action and adventure with no high-tech machines compared to previous movies which might disappoint some of the MIB followers. Well, you can't expect 'neuralizer' and specialized guns way back in 1969 which K himself had invented later.The screenplay by Etan Kohen and direction by Barry Sonnenfield stands out and the 3D works for the movie. But the Stephen Spielberg touch is missed as he is not produced it this time. Danny Elfman complemented the movie with great music.The movie is a must watch for the loyal Men In Black followers and watch it for Will, Tom and Josh.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Fun and Worthy Sequel to the Original, Filled with Surprisingly Great Acting","There are a number of issues and questions that pop up when you set out to make a sequel or prequel to a franchise that hasn't seen a new entry in a while. Do you reintroduce the characters to those who haven't seen the previous films or do you dive in and pretend everyone in the audience understands the narrative? Do you jump the timeline forward a few years or start from where the last film left off? Do you mature your characters and plot points to reflect the years gone by or do you continue to harp on the same strings that worked so well before? Men in Black 3 wrestles with each of these questions and manages to come out relatively unscathed on the other end.It has been 14 years since Agent J (Will Smith) joined up with Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) as a member of the Men in Black, a covert agency that serves as both an embassy for alien visitors and protection from extra- terrestrial attacks. The dynamic between the two is much the same as it always has been: J still plays the part of the wise-cracking young upstart while K serves as the crotchety old-timer. Things take a turn, however, when an old enemy of K's, Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement), escapes from a prison on the moon and jumps back in time to kill K, an event which in turn leads to the destruction of earth. As the only person who remembers K in the present, J has to jump back to 1969 and re-team with a younger K (Josh Brolin) in order to track down Boris before he can accomplish his mission.The early scenes of MIB3, in which the audience is reintroduced to the characters, are at best misguided and at worst painful. This reintroduction is a necessary endeavor given that the first Men in Black debuted 15 years ago and everyone likes to pretend the sequel never happened since it is BRUTALLY bad but the execution in this phase is poorly written to say the least. There's a distinct disconnect between Smith and Jones and whether that was done purposely to show the distance between the characters or not, it doesn't work. At times during the first 15 minutes, it feels as if Barry Sonnenfeld and the numerous writers who worked on this project couldn't decide whether to set the film years after the original or as more of a direct sequel taking place shortly after the '97 film. As a result, the two main characters treat each other as if they've only been partners for a few months while the narrative is clear concerning the timeframe. I had a hard time getting past this disjointedness and began bracing myself for a disastrous 103 minutes.Thankfully, however, MIB3 finds its groove when J jumps back to 1969 and from that point on it's a fun ride. Throwing J into a drastically different environment brings about some interesting plot points and the film gets plenty of laughs based simply on the difference in technologies and attitudes. The hand-held Neuralizer (the ""flashy thing"") that J is used to in the present is actually a giant MRI-type machine in the early days of the Men in Black and of course J immediately gets himself into a spot of trouble pertaining to his race in a not-so liberated time period. The plot isn't always the brightest spot of the film but it does do an admirable job of managing its own time travel mythology, a task which often proves too difficult for many films that revolve around the concept.But as fun as the storyline and general hijinks of MIB3 are, the real value of the movie can be found in the cast. Sonnenfeld lets Will Smith be Will Smith and that boisterous enthusiasm that has marked his career plays well within this setting. At the outset, Smith almost seems rusty, though perhaps that's just my subconscious taking over given how long it's been since we've seen him on screen. As the film finds its groove, so too does Smith and before long he's giving off the old vibes that have made him such a treat to watch over the last 15 years. But with all due respect to Smith, he is thoroughly overshadowed by his surrounding cast. Brolin is, simply, put, incredibly awesome in this role. His impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones is flawless but through a few plot points, he is able to make the character his own in ways that I didn't expect. He demonstrates great chemistry with Smith that is wonderfully reminiscent of the original film. There are spots within MIB3 in which the novelty of Brolin being Jones working with Smith takes precedence over the plot but I found myself more than willing to accept this dynamic. Beyond Brolin, though, MIB3 is littered with strong supporting work from Will Arnett (brief but great), Bill Hader (whose appearance marks a strong turning point for the film), and most importantly Michael Stuhlbarg who steals every single scene in which he participates. Given his work here and his small role in last year's Hugo (one of my ten favorite performances of the year), Stuhlbarg is becoming one of my very favorite character actors in Hollywood today.It isn't always the smoothest ride and some of the jokes fall flat (though perhaps that's more a sign of my matured sensibilities) but the blend of action, comedy, and surprisingly good sci-fi makes MIB3 a solid, worthwhile film. Add in a thoroughly unexpected touching moment of genuine heart and it's even enough to make on forget Men in Black 2 ever happened, a sentiment I think we can all get behind.Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.com",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Excellent - Definitely would watch it anytime.,"I have been a fan of the Men in Black movies since the original released in 1997. When MIB-II was finally out in 2002, I wondered why it took so long as Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith seemed to work so well together, and their characters had that just right mix of complementing but contradicting personalities.Jones has long been a favorite of mine with some other highlight performances being the delightfully crazy villain in Under Siege (1992) and the hard nosed cop in The Fugitive (1993) and U.S. Marshalls (1998). His ability to make a facial expression the equivalent of the picture's 1000 words imho is up there with Humphrey Bogart.Smith has distinguished himself in action, comedy, and drama films alike. He is a quite versatile actor whose movies I will gladly check out just because he is starring.With MIB 3 coming another 10 years after MIB II, I once again wonder what took so long. While Jones's part as ""K"" is not so prominent as in the prior releases, he does well as the present day character. Smith follows the formula as ""J"" although the interaction with old ""K"" is a tad forced.The pleasant realization is that Josh Brolin performs admirably as the past, younger ""K."" Brolin is certainly a fine actor in his own right, but his effective portrayal of Jones' character is nothing short of remarkable. The key to the plot is that Brolin is ""K"" before whatever happened that turned ""K"" into such a detached curmudgeon.Also juicy was the villain's part done by Jermaine Clement as Boris (the animal).Besides all the action and suspense you expect with the good guys vs. bad guy alien stuff, and the touches of comedy here and there to break it up, there is a dramatic and quite poignant and touching twist that comes out of nowhere that answers why ""K"" appears to be such an unemotional person, and why ""K"" has such regard for ""J."" Top quality actors and performances, well done script, yeah, this one's a keeper.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Was not very Impressed,Men In Black 3 started off with a very uninteresting beginning introducing one of worse villains to ever be seen in film with the most annoying and fairly stupid voice. This was the beginning of a very poorly written script that relied heavily on the actors ability to make each and every scene work. The actors did a fantastic job. Pointless expensive shots run throughout the entire film. Expensive doesn't mean good. There was nothing really there in this film. It was not exciting and didn't keep me on the edge of my seat. If not for the actors performances this would have been a complete tragedy. Men and Black 3 is not even worth seeing in theaters. If you really wanna see it wait for the DVD/Blu Ray or better yet download it. Personally a very big let down.It is a pretty average film overall and is a good addition to the Men in Black franchise. It just didn't have enough oomph in my personal opinion.,6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Josh Brolin is brilliant as Tommy Lee Jones,"The 8 stars I give for this movie is mostly for Josh Brolins impression of Tommy Lee Jones character as a young(er) agent K.

Brilliant .. no reason to not see it,"You know me, and know how little i liked Will Smith's few last films, if you read my reviews; i was annoyed by Happiness, didn't like much of anything else he did since, especially the serious stuff. On the other hand i quite like Tommy Lee Jones, though i wouldn't classify him as a ""first grade actor""; also, i found MIB 2 quite lacking compared to the first, which wasn't perfect, but it was OK as a funny, spoofy movie and a good watch for Saturday night.. but MIB3 is excellent.No, i'm not gonna spoil the plot, there's no reason to. The story is not so important as to warrant a review; but the acting is very, very entertaining.MIB3 concentrates primarily on Will Smith, with TLJ being more of a supporting character than anything; Smith gives here a great performance, not simply as a comedy actor, but also in some (don't be scared now) touching, heart-felt moments (not talking about the cheesy ending, if you've seen it already).I have had the distinct feeling while watching this that MIB3 takes more than one lesson from many of the latest Disney animated comedies, such as Ice Age, Monsters Inc, etc .. to sneak in to our belly-laugh comedy films a few tricky feel-good, family-friendly moments, and the occasional very thin bit of adult humour (""O??"").But here is the thing: i hate feel good; it positively makes me puke, i'm the tough-as-nails wannabe who loves a good mutilation and bloodshed, possibly with revenge, and i would neeeever recommend a feel-good film. But MIB3.Oh this film is just sweet; maybe i just wanted Will Smith to not suck so bad anymore, but man did i get my wish - he's in top shape and this is his best film yet.And again, it's not just him, Josh Brolin (no idea who he is, had to look him up) is good in his role, the direction and pacing of the film is flawless, (ok, maybe the ending was a bit rushed, but hey, it's still Hollywood), the production is stellar (hmm.. Hollywood), soundtrack could have been better, but MIB3 is a film i can wholeheartedly recommend to *everyone* - young couples, girls, my mum, my flatmates, all my nerd friends, internet trolls, it's just so ... so..OK so, it's not perfect. But it's good. Enough with the compliments, go watch it already (not in 3d .. )Final vote: 8/10 - no reason not to watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Okay but could have been better,"Went to MIB III because it got a fresh ratings on Rottentomatoe.com (well just barely). This movie was just okay. It's too bad to since it has good actors in it: Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Emma Thompson and Josh Brolin. Speaking of Josh Brolin, he practically steals the whole movie from both Jones and Smith. His young agent K is one of the movie's highlights. The villain, Boris the animal is also a bright spot. What wasn't so bright was the humor. The jokes just weren't punching and no one in the audience was laughing. That's bad for a movie like this. The aliens were so so. The best in fact was the one who looked most human, Griffen. The special effects were all things we'd seen before and the time travel stuff also wasn't that innovative. Incorporating a certain historical event could also have been done better and it seems that in 1969 people weren't really very observant cause I might have noticed a few things and they didn't neuralize everyone who should have seen things.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""It's Gotta Have Heart""","This phrase is a cliché refrain a producer says when someone is pitching a screenplay. All those explosions and special effects mean nothing if we don't care about the main characters. Another issue, a very skeptical moviegoer is not interested in yet another space alien invasion movie unless it has something new to offer. One thing most people agree is that MIB3 should not look like the previous sequels. Reminiscent of another dormant franchise - Indiana Jones - were Agent J & K going to put their suits back on and fight another monster? It kind of starts that way, introducing a fairly engaging villain, but then surprises the summer movie-going audience by turning all touchy-feely. Will Smith, having honed his chops on the sitcom stage, is excellent with body language and cutesy reactions. So pleasantly enough we are taken down a different path, a path that still delivers the actions and effects. But thankfully de-emphasises all those side monster characters. The filmmakers were smart enough (especially the editor) to not fill it full of monster gags at the main MIB terminal like previous films. Not once do you feel ""Been there, done that"". Instead we meet one new fresh alien that has the ability to predict the future. This character almost feels like ""Rain Man"" and practically steals the show. So kudos to the filmmakers for steering their way into a script ""with heart"". This includes an engaging Emma Thompson as the next head of MIB, who oddly only appears briefly in this film.But Tommy Lee Jones should start thinking about retirement. Frankly it was hard to look at his aged face, and felt that even if agent K was a real career man he would've retired by now (wait didn't he?). My enthusiasm before going to see this movie was lukewarm, who was asking for another MIB sequel? And where the heck has Will Smith been anyway? The primary motivation was to see Josh Brolin, who worked with Jones in ""No Country For Old Men"". Brolin personifies Jones with lethal accuracy. Little did I know that the filmmakers had us the audience in mind and kept the story clicking along, while stopping along the way to have some pie. Good dialogue (rare), good villain, so is the third act any good? Turns out this film has the opposite problem that most weak stories have, it has a strong 3rd act, while starting with a relatively weak 1st act. One thing I am sick and tired of is a tentpole film that feels obligated to go into extra innings, and go over-the-top with the final action setpiece, where a series of objectives need to be accomplished in order to get to ""The End"" and we can all go home. MIB3, a comedy of sorts, follows the golden rule of comedy movies - keep the running time around 90 minutes. Any comedy that runs closer to 2 hours loses it's punch. MIB3 runs around 100 minutes, sparing us the obligatory drawn out finale action set piece. Although there is a prescribed resolution at the Apollo launch, it focuses on the character arcs, and provides a heart tug at the end in an unexpected way. Something that no tentpole film has done in a long time.With that successful examination of characters, this can be accepted as a worthy entry in the MIB franchise, and puts to shame other older franchises that have recently been dusted off. Let's hope that MIB franchise retires with dignity as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Liked the first half, 2nd half was mediocre..","...course, i've felt this way about all the MIB films. Ever since the first one, i remember going into it being super-excited and really wanting to love it, and i came out going ""Meh.""..Same for MIB 2....MIB 3 actually had a pretty good first half. In fact i made it to the midway point and felt like this was THE best MIB film.. Everything about the opening, the setup with the mystery of K and what he knows about J but won't tell.. Him disappearing.. The whole chocolate milk thing being an indicator for a fracture in the space-time continuum was out there and very neat.Heck traveling back in time and seeing MIB in the 60's was good, and Brolin nailed it as a young Tommy Lee Jones.Then along comes the 2nd half of the movie, that just feels SO rushed...The reveal of the mystery behind what K wasn't telling J was really handled poorly. That should have had more of an impact... Heck the whole bit at Cape Kennedy was just a real rushed finale with plenty of issues, and the father bit was really weak (not that it existed, but how he died.)Boris started off as the most interesting MIB villain, but by the end he was a sideshow.Once again, i walk away from one of these movies feeling ""meh"" about it.I do not understand why they are so popular.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This is Josh Brolin's movie.,"When a movie has a shallow plot, comic-book characters, overblown special effects, and lead actors who, due to the sheer passage of time, no longer seem right for their roles, something has to do be done to make the movie watchable, and this the movie accomplishes in the person of Josh Brolin. Mr. Brolin's performance saves this movie from a quick exit to DVD-land. He brings an intensity to the role that galvanizes the movie. The plot itself is so contrived as to render it ludicrous; its lack of substance is apparent throughout. Hence, the movie depends on strong performances which, with the exception of Mr. Brolin's, it does not provide. Reprising roles from the past can be tricky, and in the case of Will Smith, it does not work. He is a wonderful actor but not in this movie; his role is no longer the right one for him. This is Josh Brolin's movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The concept was pretty much what I remembered from the series: goofy aliens, scary aliens, sassy aliens, and men in suits.The twist here came with the time travel that allowed us to get some back story we never had before. And it worked.No, it's not deep. It's a general ""popcorn muncher.""

A Nutshell Review: Men In Black III,"It was 1997 when Men in Black first burst onto the big screen featuring a successful pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as unlikely partners in the protection of Earth against the scum of the universe, with action, special effects and generous doses of comedy rolled into one. Directed by Barry Sonnenfield, they returned five years later for a sequel, and chances for a third film got hovered around for the longest time, finally taking up to a decade before it materialized, taking advantage of the needless 3D format to deliver the latest installment of the popular series.And it's still a lot of fun with the return of Agent Jay (Will Smith) and Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) in a new adventure set around the break out of the villainous alien Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) from a lunar maximum prison to take revenge on Kay for the severing of an arm and its imprisonment, not to mention also wiping out its compatriots and protecting the Earth from annihilation. Yes, Kay is credited for plenty of work done back in his heydays of the 60s, and we're about to find out a lot more about his deadpan character, which is almost always the punching bag for Jay, who makes it his mission to reverse what Boris had set out to do, which is to travel back in time and taking out Kay.It's MIB meets Back to the Future with its time travelling element back to the 60s, armed with only limited knowledge of his partner's whereabouts, no thanks to information being classified over and above Jay's pay grade, despite 14 years of dedicated service. The story by Ethan Cohen, David Koepp, Jeff Nathanson and Michael Soccio proved to be a winner, steering clear of having too many cooks with potential of spoiling the broth, making that time travel bit pretty much a trip down nostalgic lane, filled with incidents and prominent characters from history, such as Andy Warhol (Bill Hader) and the Apollo 11 crew, and the tongue in cheek treatment with aliens being very much leaping from typical 60s television and films.This makes up more than its share of laughs and inside jokes that continue in the same spirit from the earlier films, even poking fun at the racial divide of the time, which provided a fair challenge for Jay as he meets up with the younger Kay (Josh Brolin) who has to be convinced that his new found friend is his partner from the future, and have to work together to rein in the 1969 version of Boris the Animal. Tommy Lee Jones made way for Josh Brolin to own the character of Jay, and in truth Brolin does a remarkable job of closely mimicking Jones, aptly adding a lot more to the back story of the legendary MIB who has his fair share of one liners, but being a little bit less stern than Jay had grown accustomed to.Characterization also got pushed to the forefront with a deeper exploration into each of Jay and Kay's characters, backgrounds and their friendship, and this helped the film tremendously, instead of being a mediocre effort relying solely on the actors charisma and washing everything down in CG glory. There are still some surprises from the effects kept under wraps from the trailers, so that's a good thing, and I suppose much of the graphics work went into recreating 60s USA, as well as earlier, more cumbersome versions of tools of the trade that MIB uses back then. Alien designs also got a spruce up, looking far more menacing, and disgusting even, with Boris the Animal possessing and using deadly force that I'm rather surprised at for a PG rated film.Will Smith shows that he hasn't lost his edge and still has what it takes, even after being absent from the big screen for some 4 years now (Seven Pounds and Hancock were his last outing in 2008), and still comes off as a natural, and likable as Agent Jay, with a lot more polish as an MIB veteran as compared to when he got first recruited. Tommy Lee Jones got only a supporting role this time round, with Josh Brolin left responsible to carry the role of the younger K for the most parts of the film. The Smith-Brolin pairing was also a winner, though likely to be one off only for this movie, but you can guess how any sequel made after this could go - either to continue with Smith-Jones in the current timeline, or having Brolin helm his own, partnering another Agent in adventures set in the past. And joining the cast in prominent, though limited roles, include the likes of Emma Thompson as Agent O, taking over as the new MIB Chief with the passing of Zed, Alice Eve playing the younger O, and both Michael Stuhlbarg and Mike Colter adding depth to the MIB mythos.Still, with every time travel movie, there are paradoxes that have to be consciously ignored for everything to work. While some aspects work in having being explained away, others necessary and crucial to the plot become glaringly obvious, especially in the finale where it showed some shades of similarity from A Chinese Odyssey. But all is forgiven for something canonical to be added to the adventures of the MIB, providing audiences with new appreciation for the leading MIBs Jay and Kay, rather than to rely on louder and bigger explosions for the sake of keeping up with the summer Joneses. MIB3 is a clear winner, and worthy of what the previous two films had already set up. Highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Griff,"When I started this IMDb-commented study 14 years ago, the notions of folded narrative were commonly used, but not so open in the industry. Now look where we've come, to a state where it is mandatory for a blockbuster investment. You know something has passed its freshness when even the common term for doing so has 'jumped the shark.'The folding dynamic I'm talking about is the simple trick of putting an audience member into the story. The theory is that this helps us get engaged with the story. It is not a dumb idea; with film, we really do have a body of evidence that this — in many varieties — actually works.But this particular device as handled here seemed a bit desperate. I suppose that is congruent with the general feel of desperation in the project, desperation to recoup costs.Our on-screen surrogate is a character named Griffin. He is from 'another dimension' and can watch and rewatch, coming to story knees that he likes. He announces when things are getting engaging. 'Touching' him allows sharing with his vision. Griff has control over his place in time, which place is the main plot point in the story —Why we know this came from a consultant and passed by dull investment types? Because it is so blatant. The actor was chosen because he plays this identical role in 'Hugo.' He is introduced to us at a party at the Factory, where Warhol is revealed to be an actor of the inner story, playing a role. He provides a device that locks and preserves the world of the story.Two other factors are possibly subliminal influences...I am writing this comment on a visit to LA, specifically to a neighborhood where these types of consultants live, 'observer consultants.' The area is 'the observatory area,' Griffith Observatory. In the comic 'Zippy the Pinhead' a character named Griff frequently looks down at Hollywood goings on with a telescope from the observatory.A deeper connection with the name is the griffin. This is hybrid creature invented by the Achaemenid Persians (Darius, Cyrus) whose culture was deeply folded. The Griffin (half eagle, half lion) was a symbol inspired by the Zoroastrian (the original Zoroastrians) notion of a being that can see and control itself, that good 'speaking' had both a story and a story about a story. The entire notion of two-worlds, two logics was destroyed by the Greeks and replaced with logic and truth. But the notion persists in folds in literature.Lewis Carroll reconnected the beast with the role in his Alice works. As I say, the level at which Hollywood works is more Zippy than Achaemenid, but that connection is there.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Comedy

As with most sequels it was alright but nothing compared to the original. The problem with sequels and prequels is that you already know a lot of the jokes or what the characters do. You know Agent J is the funny guy and that K is the serious one who J pokes fun at. At far as sequels go this movie was good, better then most and the back in time thing was neat.

Outdated but a Decent watch,"Not being a fan of the Men in Black franchise and finding the third film to being a slightly unnecessary addition to the franchise, my expectations were average. Men In Black 3 was basically what was expected. Some laughs, good use of special effects, decent action and a solid plot. I think more could have happened (especially towards the end) but it was okay. It has also been a while since I have watched the first two films of the franchise, seeing as my memory wasn't the best from watching MIB3.When Men in Black 3 was rumored to come out, I wondered why it took so long and why they bothered bringing the franchise back (save for the money). However everything seemed to be in place and the actors played their parts as if the franchise hasn't been off for a decade.I didn't care too much for the villain of Doris the animal too bad as I think it could had been more interesting. Time travel in sci-fi films is always a positive as it was well done here. The chemistry between Will Smith and Josh Brolin was great here.The supporting characters were neatly done. Along the way, Smith and Brolin seek Griffin (a mysterious man that is able to see in the future and eventually guides them as their journey goes on).

Men in Black Welcome back,"A fantastic movie with a fabulous plot and perfectly believable characters. Will Smith is the real entertainer and an incredibly talented actor while Tommy Lee Jones projects the best of subtle aging character of the MIB. The concept is amazing, the connectivity is thoughtful and some comic punches are really rib tickling while some make you laugh. MIB3 is such surreal that it actually succeeds in inducing a thought in the viewers' minds that Aliens do exist and MIB exists too.The special effects are good. A must see for all age groups.Not forgot to mention Josh Brolin as young K was perfect.Director Barry sonnenfeld has done a good job too.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Agent Jay goes on a mission to save the world once more.,"The Men in Black, one of the most timeless movies in science fiction, has returned. Now more than ever it has come with an inexplicably assorted cast of Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Emma Thompson in futuristic garb, fighting for earth once more. The trilogy dates back to 1997 with original characters Agent Jay (Will Smith) and Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) defending mankind from extraterrestrial forces, under the cloak of black Ray Bans, humor, and an excessive amount of artillery. In this conclusion of the Men in Black trilogy, Agent Jay gets caught in a web of events and secrets that leads him to time jump (quite literally) to 1969 to try and kill a grotesque Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement)—whose overwhelmingly unpleasant face could easily dole out nightmares—and save the earth once more from alien invasion.Within the first ten minutes, as well as throughout the movie, you can see the amount of special effects, laughs, chemistry of actors, and imagination engineered to make this movie live up to its legendary expectations. The most entertaining parts of the movie, however, were skin-deep (in this case probably horrendous, multi-colored alien skin): costume and makeup. Men in Black has had an impermeable reputation for creating some of the most odd and horrifying creatures in the past and third movie has only highlighted this, upstaging its predecessors. From Boris the Animal's monster-like complexion, the ""gold fish from the bags at the school fair"" at Mr. Wu's, and the jellyfish-blimp creatures topping off the skyscrapers of New York City for dessert, it looks as though all extra firearms will be put to good use. Costumes were also of good taste when Agent Jay rolls onto the streets of 1969 New York with hippies strolling around, with funny references to racism and famous people like Andy Warhol throughout.And what better context to set all of this in than the wide cityscape of New York City, a jail on the moon, and space? Use of all these familiar monuments (ex. Empire State building) and secret government organizations almost made me question the existence of aliens. Almost. The background music of the movie, with never-ending variations of the theme song, only made the mood more reminiscent of a James Bond high speed chase: sleek and intriguing with the occasional, disturbing alien voice. Another intriguing aspect was the use of camera angles, especially when Agent Jay leaps off of the Empire State building.All in all, seeing this movie made me feel like my seven-year- old self, in awe of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones for having excellent chemistry on screen and making me laugh almost every ten minutes. The whole movie was quite an experience—one definitely more enjoyable behind a pair of 3D glasses—although the romance between Agent K and Agent O seemed added in for the more mainstream viewers and mostly unnecessary. Appealing to most audiences, I believe Men in Black III deserves a wholesome seven stars for humor, special effects, acting, theme music/mood and an interesting use of Agent Kay doubles (who looked surprisingly similar to one another). Usually reluctant to watching most movie sequels, I was pleasantly surprised and found the third and last Men in Black is now my favorite and will recommend it to as many people as possible who enjoy a good laugh and plenty of alien guts.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
MIB spirit,"Before watching MIB3,i re-watch MIB1-2 and remind about the story and characters. It has been a decade since the last MIB film was released. Agent J is still Agent J (Will Smith) and ""Agent K"" divides into younger and older ones. Yet,the spirit of Agent K is still there that he works with other Agents to maintain law and order and even save the Earth.The sequel uses another perspective - a generic time traveling story like Source Code,The Terminator,Back to the Future and such like. Even though time-travel plots are commonly used by filmmakers, MIB3 combines this features with its original selling point - arrest villain and protect the Earth secretly. Use of neutralizer and black glasses AgentJ,K wear are retrospective of the MIB series.Aside from these features, MIB3 still keeps the background theme music played in MIB1-2 and the text at the beginning and the end of the film. More importantly, the charming smile of Agent J and straight-faced old Agent K still imprint on our mind.",,Anonymous,Comedy
My first and favorite MIB movie,"This was the first movie in the franchise I watched. It was at a drive-in and even though I didn't understand much, the film was incredibly entertaining and tear-jerking. I've now watched the other MIB films, but for some reason, I'm a sucker for time travel!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Smith Always Entertaining,"Ten years passed between MIB II and MIB III. The antagonist this time around is a Boglodite named Boris the Animal (Jemaine (sic) Clement). He broke out of LunarMax prison to go back in time and kill Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). Should he succeed it will doom all of planet Earth. To save K and Earth, Agent J (Will Smith) goes back in time to stop Boris.What was given a pass in 1997 couldn't be easily overlooked in 2012. I'm talking about the visual effects. They had the same cartoonish look like they didn't even try, or they just saved on the budget by reusing the 1997 technology.Visual effects aside, the movie was good. I think it was even better than part two. Time travel is always somewhat interesting and Will Smith is always entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A very entertaining flick that brings the trilogy full circle!,"I just saw this film here in Taipei and I must say it was brilliantly entertaining. I won't give too much away (Semi-spoiler alert) or over hype the film for anybody who has not seen it. All I will say is that it is full of laughs, edge-of-your-seat thrills, and even a few tears. This film truly brings the series full circle and has a surprise that will put a smile on any MIB fan's face! Don't expect the same characters from movies past to have any sort of dominant role (Agent J and K excluded of course). This MIB comes at you from a whole new angle! 1969, Apollo, Civil Rights, Andy Warhol, the list goes on and on. It's a fascinating re-mix of the well established franchise that is sure to delight many a moviegoer. I hope it entertains everybody else as much as it entertained me!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

MY REVIEW: Funny sci-fi with heart,"The movie starts as just some funny sci-fi but once the charming actor Will Smith has started his time-travel, there is no looking back. Like the first two, again the soul of the movie is chemistry between Agent J and Agent K even when Tommy is not playing the Agent K. As expected there are lots of funny aliens, lots of witty one-liners and more than expected jokes on blacks involving Will Smith. The evil guy is mysteriously funny. Climax is imaginative and heart rendering. New character Griffin also provides the useful edge to the time-travel idea. If you are looking for a funny thriller then this one is good choice for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pleasantly surprised at not being disappointed,"No, Men in Black 3 won't make its way into my list of the best movies ever made, but walking into it with very low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. A decade was enough to make me miss the world and characters of MiB, and while this third installment can't quite match the feeling of freshness and originality of the first one, it's a huge improvement over the disappointing second movie, which felt like a weak attempt to milk a cash-cow while it's hot - MiB 3 doesn't have that 'sequel' feeling, feeding on nostalgia rather than tailing a fad.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones did a lot of growing over this decade - Smith became one of the most sought after blockbuster stars in Hollywood, and Jones made some of the finest, most introspective films of his long careers (No Country for Old Men, In the Valley of Elah, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada) and they both seem to have a lot of fun being back in their black suits, playing those beloved, silly, flat old characters. Smith in particular seems to take in his stride the fact that he has to step back into 'Fresh Prince' mode after years of playing more serious characters, he even seems to enjoy it quite a bit.It's the supporting cast that makes the film, though - most notably Josh Brolin (Tommy Lee Jones' 'No Country for Old Men' co-star) who plays the younger version of Jones himself to truly terrific results. Jemaine Clement ('Flight of the Conchords') is a delicious villain (though the character is under-utilized), and smaller roles played by Michael Stuhlbarg, Emma Thompson and Bill Hader. It almost seems like memorable supporting characters is what missed most from MiB II - well, that, and a decent script. MiB 3's plot is a pretty senseless and illogical attempt at a time-travel story, with some elements of Terminator kicking in, but it doesn't matter much that it makes absolutely no sense - the script has heart and humor, and the movie is fast-paced and goes by quickly, not leaving that much of an impression but leaving a big smile.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
As good as the two previous movies of the franchise...,"""Men in Black 3"" is an Action - Comedy movie and the third movie of the ""Men in Black"" franchise, in which we watch agent Jay traveling in time and specifically in 1969 in order to stop an alien of killing agent Kay. He has to succeed and save him otherwise everything will change into the future.I liked this movie because it combined very well for one more time comedy with action. It had also a simple but interesting plot that allowed you to follow it and do not be distracted by anything else. As in the two previous movies of the franchise it followed the same way of presenting the story and what was going on in the main characters' lives. Barry Sonnenfeld did an excellent job for one more time on the direction of the movie and his touch was obvious through the whole duration of the movie. For one more time the interpretations of Will Smith who played as Agent Jay and Tommy Lee Jones who played as Agent K were very good. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Josh Brolin's who played as Young Agent K. To sum up, I have to say that ""Men in Black 3"" is an entertaining movie and I recommend everyone who has already watched the two previous movie to watch it because I am sure that you will enjoy it. If you have not already seen the two previous movies of the ""Men in Black"" franchise then I advise you first to watch them and afterwards return and watch this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A SWEET END TO A FANTASTIC TRILOGY. Agents Kay & Jay Are Like Seeing Old Friends Again.,"The 3rd part in this wonderful special trilogy is as spectacular & stunning as the first two films!!! First off MIB 3 looks stunning, the cinematography & details to the time period of the 1960's looks & feels Spielbergian somehow.Now i love the ""MIB"" films & this is 3rd part fantastic film & parts 1 & 2 i have watched a ridiculous amount of times over the years & now there's a 3rd film. Part 3 is very good & it's nice to see my childhood heroes again with Agent K & Agent J, i love the magic & chemistry of Smith & Jones & it's still here with the aging stars!!!There's a lovely meaningful heartfelt back story & origins that's explored about Agent K & J. The MIB world is explored more in this thrilling 3rd part, we get old fashioned MIB back in the 1960's & a sweet heart-warming backstory about craggy old Agent Kay. Great Director Barry Sonnenfield really put alot of thought into this movie & created something special. Will Smith is on top comic form but with is also full of heart. The chemistry between K & J is still the same, the only thing that's changed is they've aged. I miss the presence of Rip Torn as Zed but everything else plays well. The buddy-cop dynamics are still there, probably even more so as there's a strain of K & Jays relationship. Jay knows there's something that's made K the way he is & wants to dig into his past. At the heart of this big expensive sci-fi action comedy is the nice warm friendship between our favourite Alien detecting cops.The new threat is an old Alien villain called Boris The Animal who escapes from a high-tech maximum security prison on the moon. Boris is back & wants revenge on Agent K by going back in time to 60's to kill K before he shoots off Boris's arm & arrests him. The time travel theme is fun & clever & sets up lots of silly gags & visual treats, especially when J goes back to the 60's. Really how could anyone not enjoy stepping out once again with Agents K & J. Admittedly MIB 3 isn't as good as the first two films in my opinion, mainly because the first two films hold a major place in my movie-loving-heart as i grew up watching those two constantly on video. But part 3 is a lovely sweet bit of Escapism from our harsh cold world as we can get lost in the nice colourful fantasy world of the Men In Black.The performances are excellent especially from Josh Brolin who play's a young K from 1969, his performance is spot-on & perfect & he's having so much fun with the role.Emma Thompson is excellent as new MIB boss Agent O.Will Smith is obviously great again & is funny,charming & very heart-warming on screen & is like seeing an old friend again as i grew up on the MIB films from the very first Classic back in 1997!!! MIB is one of the greatest trilogies in cinema history in my opinion.I absolutely love this franchise/trilogy & have always been a huge fan of Will Smith my childhood hero & idol & once again he's fantastic as Agent J.There's a nice fresh time travel plot & some beautiful production design & sets of Coney island, the beginning Chinese restaurant & New York City back in 1969, it looks beautiful. The whole production is lush & money well spent on making the movie look gorgeous.There's lots of really fun moments & nice characters bits & scenes such as a lovely little scene where the young K sits in a Diner with Agent J & eat pie together & just chat, it's a lovely human scene.The legendary veteran Tommy Lee Jones is great again as the much older & craggy Agent K & is great on screen although he's not in it all as the younger k takes over the most of the movie but equally excellent. The time travel story in this one is done so well & as much fun as the Back to the Future films!!!This film ties it all up nicely & is very enjoyable even if it's not as great as the first two films, there's still alot to like & some good humour & fun along the way.Boris the Animal is a great designed villain & very funny at times as Well as evil & just a fun monster.This 3rd part has alot of Heart & is stunning to look at with it's detailed backgrounds & lovely cinematography.Men in Black 3 is just a beautiful sci-fi action comedy with a big heart & a nice end. Now, there is some bits i didn't like that much like the silly time travel bits at the end fight at the space launch where Agent J is fighting Boris the Animal. I felt it was too silly where J keeps coming back correcting his moves & dodging the shooting spikes from Boris, very stupid in my opinion even thought it is Fantasy. But the ending is very sweet & ties up the Trilogy nicely.Can could you not like seeing old friends again, Agents Jay & Kay are heroes i grew up watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Seeing Josh Brolin playing a young Tommy Lee Jones to Will Smith is one of several highlights in Men in Black 3,"I've previously only seen parts of the original Men in Black and don't remember too much of Men in Black II. So it was that I went to watch the latest one with my movie theatre-working friend with not too much expectations. As a result, I thought it was mostly funny if not hilarious the whole way through. Still, it was pretty entertaining especially when Will Smith went back to 1969 to meet Tommy Lee Jones' character as a young man, here played by Josh Brolin in an uncanny impersonation (though both me and my friend also noticed a bit of George W. Bush there). There was also a fine villain portrayed by Jermaine Clement and a reasonably compellingly amusing future-seeing sidekick enacted by Michael Stuhlbarg. I also thought Emma Thompson's part as the new superior was also quite chuckle worthy. Really, all I'll say now is Men in Black 3 is well worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Huge Disappointment,This has to be Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jone's worst movies. The jokes are not funny at all. The enemy or the arch nemesis is a joke and I wasn't sure if he was supposed to be funny of if he was just goofy. There are a few laughs here and there although the movie goes through about 1 hour with nothing happening. It is just people talking here and there.Even the special effects are very minimal and somewhat B-Grade at times. The lines in this movie are awful. Huge disappointment for me. This is the first time I have been let down by both Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones who have been done a disservice by the Director and the writers of this third edition of MIB.,2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lackluster overall but with quite an original ending,"The whole ""time-travel"" thing did not really work for me. I mean one must tread ever so lightly and delicately with great care when putting premises of time-travel on screen. The idea itself may sound interesting but it may not probably be a good idea even if you're a pure science-fiction purist or in the written words. For the H.G. Wells' classic novel, maybe but it did not even work well for its screen version of the 2002 Guy Pearce's THE TIME MACHINE. And it definitely did not work well for this one either. Thus, I was right to be skeptical about having time-travel plot in this movie. See the danger lies of the whole time-travel thing to be both tacky and cheesy if it was not done tastefully and it shows in MIB³. Though I must admit that this is after all a movie with great emphasis on visual effects and they were no doubt pleasing to the eyes; the storyline, on the other hand, was not quite as impressive as the first two films.This one appeared to display that lackluster performance on screen especially with the absence of Rip Torn as 'Agent Zed'. Perhaps, this is one of the aspects that MIB³ did not ""feel"" like MEN IN BLACK at all. And it was that conspicuous.I was also hoping that with Emma Thompson's appearance in this version would add that certain freshness to the film particularly a bigger credit to her range of roles where Thompson was usually typecast as playing a lady of prim and proper mannerisms in period dramas. Yet it did not happen for this third installment. Her on screen time was too brief and it seemed to be a little ""off"" for a female agent with a British accent in this supposedly a film about an American governmental organization. Moreover, there was almost no further development in terms of the romantic chemistry between her character and that of Tommy Lee Jones' 'Agent K' whom the former played Jones' love interest as told in the 1960s part of the movie as opposed to the rigid boss of the present day. Strangely though, I do appreciate her hairdo in this movie. It was sophisticated and good enough for a female corporate leader.As seen in earlier MIB films, there were scenes of cameos appearing in the movies like the late Michael Jackson (or perhaps his double) in MEN IN BLACK 2. This one is no less impressive with the voluptuous and buxom lead vocalist of the Pussycat Dolls, Nicole Scherzinger, at the start to whet any guy's appetite for the film; and trust me, she was hot as hell. There was also moments where you could see Lady Gaga appearing on an overhead monitor in the MIB Headquarters; and if you're attentive enough you would be able to spot a moment of renowned director Tim Burton (whose dull DARK SHADOWS certainly bore me to tears).All in all, although MEN IN BLACK 3 was so much better than the dull DARK SHADOWS it somehow felt nothing special to me.But credit has to be given for ending of the film, which was probably the most original part of the movie, as the real relationship between Will Smith's 'Agent J' and Tommy Lee Jones' 'Agent K' was revealed and it came full circle as to link their true relationship.Whatever it is if you have some money to spare and are dying to see MEN IN BLACK 3, see it for the blockbuster aspect of it. Other than that, do not expect much.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Entertaining If Not All the Way Good,"Men in Black 3 (2012)** 1/2 (out of 4)A dangerous alien (Jemaine Clement) escapes from a specialty built prison on the moon and travels back in time to try and kill a young Agent K (Josh Brolin). Still in present day, Agent J (Will Smith) has to also go back in time to make sure his partner, the elder Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) is still around for the future. MEN IN BLACK 3 comes ten years after the previous film, which was a complete dud so the good news is that this film is much better than that. With that said, the film will certainly keep you entertained but at the same time you wish they had done just a little bit more to make it more memorable. The film turns out to be one of those movies where it's fun while you're watching it but by the time you get to your car the thing is almost erased from your memory. As you'd expect, the special effects and creature design are extremely good and they blend in well with all the live action stuff. I thought the look of the new monster was rather creative and I especially liked his ""weapon"" which was pretty much a little creature that could crawl out of his hand and throw blades. I was surprised to see that there really wasn't too much room for all the sci-fi elements that were in the previous two films as this one here is really character driven by the humans. There's a lot more story going on this time around and this certainly takes the thing into a few neat and interesting directions. The majority of the running time takes place in 1969 so it's Smith and Brolin doing most of the action and I thought the two of them had some nice chemistry and they were certainly entertaining. I'd also add that Brolin did a very good job at playing a young Tommy Lee Jones and perfectly nails some of his mannerisms. As for Jones himself, he's really just limited to an expanded cameo but it's fun to see him. The same with Emma Thompson. Clement is good as the bad guy and Michael Stuhlbarg has fun as a future seeing alien. The 1969 settings made for some funny moments including Smith being pulled over by some racist cops but I felt that more should have be done with the setting. In the end MEN IN BLACK 3 should keep fans of the series entertained but I think a little more work could have made the film better. However, I will say that the twist at the very end of the film was incredibly emotional and I must say that I was highly impressed with how powerful the sequence was. It's certainly nothing you expect to see in a film like this but it's probably the best moment of the entire series.",,Anonymous,Comedy

A lot better than I thought it would be,"This one unlike the second one that was just a crappy sequel with mindless plot. This one is actually clever with some good amount of alien entertainment. Now although the first ""Men in Black"" is the most simple one from the three, I enjoyed that one the most when it came out because the idea was fresh. And maybe it's because I saw it in theater when I was a kid. But this one is close behind and is a good time that is action to action without any slow moments. The plot may seem simple at first with agent J having to go back in time to protect agent K and to save the world from destruction. But there is quite a bit of clever and entertaining bits throughout the journey. Now I wasn't overly hyped when I saw the trailer to this, but I am glad I finally saw it. Josh Brolin killed it as the young Agent K. I didn't have high expectations because of the second one in this franchise but the third time is the charm sometimes.7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This movie is made for the fans of the previous movies and by far the best of the 3 in my opinion,"Let us discuss the summer buzz of 2012 shall we? AVENGERS ASSEMBLE, THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN, PROMETHEUS & MEN IN BLACK III. These are the most anticipated titles this year. . This summer is Elysium compared to the horrendous motion pictures we had to sit through during the summer of 2011. Whilst these are the most anticipated blockbusters by no means do I at any cost place money with either title for wins at the Academy Awards 2013? Nolan and Scott may have potential but let's just wait until it is that time shall we folks? A decade later a movie is been brought back to life by the very duo who gave it her first breath and made the title the financially successful hit it is. When Steven Spielberg asked Barry Sonnenfeld to get on board the MEN IN BLACK bus I am certain a trilogy was not in the cards. The movie has been a whopping financial success and has in some extent redefined the genre of Aliens integrated with comic relief and Humans once defined by Sir Ridley Scott. The boys in black are back but do they have what it takes to open this summer following the mega hit AVENGERS? Whilst Tommy Lee Jones has been quite the busy body making movies Will Smith comes back after 3 years since making SEVEN POUNDS. MIB is unofficially one of the biggest hits made by the duo and this come back is the ultimate challenge of their careers; re-inventing MIB. Senior Agent Jay (Will Smith) is 15 years down the line after he put on his last black suit. Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) as we all recall went back to his lady after his memory was wiped clean since he took a trip down the gullet of the Alien roach who was trying to steal the galaxy off the hands of the Arquillians. Jay has never been able to settle down since he lost his emotion-less bland faced mature stud Kay. Jay keeps neuralising every partner he gets simply because none of them is Kay I presume. Tiny bit of an indirect bro-mance is what Sonnenfeld is working on.Lacking the laughter by more than half with comparison to the previous movies MIB III is focusing more on clarity of it story rather than being a comedy / Alien movie. Will Smiths fresh prince attitude has been restricted and a more serious department has been handed over to him this time as he needs to go back in time in order to save the life of Agent Kay and also thereby once again saving the world. Boris the Animal is the Nemesis who locks horns with Agent Kay who is called back into service and has his memory re-jogged back in. Agent Kay sadly does not have all the answers and neither does he leave Agent Jay with any clues when he literally disappears whilst sitting in his own apartment. With his disappearance the Agent we all know as Kay ceases to exist in everyone mins apart from Agent Jay. Agent Jay travels back in time to hunt down Boris and find out why Agent Kay does not exist in the present. Surprisingly he meets a rather lose and jovial Agent Kay from the 1960s who reveals a magical secret.The concept of time travel is the save line for MIB III. Media speculates that the idea of time travel was initially and idea of Will Smiths, however a righteous shout and nod is much deserved by writer Etan Cohen. What a magnificent comeback MIB III has been. In this enthusiasts opinion this is an absolute winner in terms of resurrecting a franchise.Josh Brolin should not be overlooked at any cost. It's amazing how Brolin and Jones are a smashing resemblance in personality. Josh Brolins talents are far more than what it was when he donned of cycling shorts in GOONIES. The resemblance of the younger Agent Kay and the older Agent Kay is uncanny. How Brolin has studied the characteristics of the older Agent Kay and play up to it is magnificent. With Precision delivery of Josh Brolin, with slap stick humor of Will smith and the presence of pure bad ass in Tommy Lee jones makes MIB III an indeed must watch this summer.This movie is made for the fans of the previous movies and by far the best of the 3 in my opinion. What it lags in laughter it delivers in depth of its plot. MIB III isn't the best movie of the summer and its certain, however it will for sure be one of the top favorites of 2012.Black Suits Coming!TITLE: MEN IN BLACK III DIRECTED BY: BARRY SONNENFELD STARRING: WILL SMITH.

Men In Black 3 is a much deserved sequel although doesn't quite reach the heights of the original.,"Let's face it, anything could've been better than 'Men In Black 2' in what is quite possibly one of the most boring sequels ever. A franchise hiatus and our beloved secret agents are back in another entertaining sci-fi adventure. Boris The Animal has escaped from a lunar prison and wants to take revenge on Agent K. What better way to do it than to erase him from time itself. However, Agent J still remembers him and must go back in time to save Agent K and the world from an alien invasion. Automatically have to deduct a point just for the use of time travel and not addressing paradoxical elements. It's a lazy uninspired gimmick and is only used decently in a quarter of good sci-fi flicks. In saying that, the 'Men in Black' aesthetic appeal still remains. It's as if this sequel was made in the 90's and I appreciated the need for continuity. It wasn't overly dark and depressing, t'was a light fun romp that everyone in the family can enjoy. But, that's all it is. Don't go into this wanting to be blown away by another revolutionary plot, it is something we have seen numerous times in the past. The narrative was good, very well paced. Several occasions of going to point A to B to C etc. which introduces an array of humorous characters like an undercover Andy Warhol. Boris The Animal was a memorable antagonist who literally could've decimated Agent K and J easily. Seriously. He kills everyone else with ease. But I suppose we wouldn't have ourselves a feature film then. Tommy Lee Jones needed far more screen time. Will Smith was Will Smith. The stand out, and most revelatory casting choice in years, is Josh Brolin as a young Agent K. He got Jones' mannerisms down to perfection. Thoroughly enjoyed his performance. Dare I say I wanted to see more of Scherzinger as well? The visual effects were fine, the human CGI has dated pretty badly but on the whole it is watchable. A good and enjoyable sequel, that for some reason addresses racial stereotypes...!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The addition of Brolin works as Icing on the cake,"Men in Black 3 is a science fiction action comedy film directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. The film stars Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and Josh Brolin.An Alien criminal escapes from Jail, now agent J has to go back in past and help the young agent K in the quest of capturing the alien.What an entertaining film and after a lackluster Men in Black II this film comes as a fresh breeze of air this film in not only funny and adventurous but also hilariously entertaining. The film will entertain you to the core.The plot of the film is good and the execution is superb, the funny scenes and hilarious punches will keep your funny bones tickling. The screenplay of the film is good and will keep you engaged throughout the film.Acting is superb by all three and Will Smith will not disappoint you anywhere in the scene. Tommy Lee Jones was equally impressive as in the previous two and the inclusion of Josh Brolin works as Icing on the cake.Climax of the film is hilarious and gives a great ending to the film.

Maybe We're Done Now!,"It may have taken fifteen years, but we finally came to a possible closing, although any other sequel would depend on how successful this installment can be.""Men in Black III"" is just what it's been since the beginning: a lot of aliens walking around in different shapes and sizes, plotting a pending attack on earth. Other than that, you get a bunch of special effects that can pretty much represent anything your imagination can fathom. It's fun, funny at times and, surprisingly, has an emotional ending. It is nice to connect the dots on some unexplained events and behaviors, but it all comes down to having a good time and enjoying your popcorn.

Is it worth the Time?,"It's been a few years since I saw a Will Smith movie that didn't involve him being bitter or depressed. However, this weekend Mr. Smith stepped back into his role as Agent J, the Man In Black with an attitude. Now although I love the first Men In Black and I was okay with it's sequel, I had my doubts about this third movie. After all not many sequels have proved their worth. Does Men In Black fall into the same category, or is it one of the few sequels that actually worth seeing in the theaters? Read on to find out.What could the world's best alien busting team possibly have left to do? Time travel of course, and Men In Black is full of time jumping goodness. In case you haven't seen the trailer, MIB 3 has J (Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) once again teaming up to investigate the extraterrestrial crime ring, while also ironing out their own personal issues. However, K gets taken for a little time trip and disappears from the world with only J having any recollection. J refuses to let his partner fade into the abyss, and instead decides to do a little time jumping himself eventually meeting the younger version of his partner (Josh Brolin).Call me a sucker for science fiction, but MIB 3 was perhaps one of the better sequels I have seen in a long time. Smith and Brolin did a fantastic job in this movie, both still recapturing the classic teamwork of the original MIB. When they aren't working together though both actors play their characters well. Smith still has the same sarcasm and one-liners to make you laugh, while Brolin captures that stonewall dry humor that is both funny and driving at the same time. Jones on the other hand has a more limited role in the film than I anticipated. Although he plays a key part in the story, Jones actually doesn't get that much screen time in the film, which is quite a shame as I really enjoy his role as the monotone agent who shows little emotion.Regardless of the acting though, the story was much better than the one we saw in MIB 2. Amidst the constant comedy of J's clumsiness and spunk, lies a tale that is heartwarming, sentimental, and quite fun. Now don't get me wrong this movie didn't have the most original plot, and it was fairly predictable with only the slightest twist here and there. Still this movie had a little bit of something for everyone. A few exciting fight scenes, some fast paced chases, and some witty use of technology are all in this movie, and should be quite entertaining to the audience. The team did a nice job bringing the extraterrestrial world to life, with all the gadgets, lasers, and alien goo looking fairly real. Yet one can definitely tell they designed their camera work to bring out the most with 3-D technology. However, another thing that helped keep this film interesting was the villain Boris (Jemaine Clement). Unlike MIB2's main villain, Boris had an edge that made him feel more of a threat. His personal vendetta with MIB was also a tad more exciting and better integrated that made a more exciting story. Boris though had a voice that was more humorous than threatening, which was probably exactly what they were going for. Though for this reviewer there will be no villain that can replace Edgar the bug from the first MIB.There are some things I was missing in this installment of the series though. For one thing some of the classic characters were missing in this film, or only had a few seconds in the movie. Although new characters like Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Agent O (Emma Thompson) are welcome additions, there are some characters that shouldn't have been removed. A second weakness is the 3-D shots, which were a little over-dramatic at some points. I really don't like this new 3-D obsession as too many movie focus on shooting in that style and sacrifice other areas of the movie. I guess those are really the only two weaknesses I could pick up in the movie.MIB 3 is definitely a fun adventure that many veteran fans will enjoy. The directing team went back to the roots of the original to correct the mistakes of the second installment. I definitely give this movie a recommendation for a trip to the theater, but I haven't figured out if it is worth the 3-D showing. For this sequel, I give the following scores:Action/Comedy/Sci Fi: 8.0 Movie overall: 7.0-7.5Until my next review my friends, this is Robbie K signing off.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Well, it's a big improvement over the last","I saw the first MEN IN BLACK in cinemas in 1997 and thought it was okay for what it was (a light, CGI comic book-style adventure). I recently watched the sequel and thought it was pitiful, a tired retread full of awful special effects. Thankfully this third film breathes new life into the series by adding a nice time travel plot and shaking things up a bit.Will Smith is less annoying than usual in his starring role here and the film works pretty well with him as the lead. The culture shock stuff of him arriving in the 1960s is what makes the movie fun, and Josh Brolin does a nice impersonation of the stiff Tommy Lee Jones. There are still some dodgy CGI effects in here, particularly the whole of the climax which seems to have been green-screened, but they're nowhere near as poor as in the last film.Once again I didn't care for the villain of choice, Boris the Animal, played by an overacting Jemaine Clement. For some reason these films always have the make the villain either gross or sort-of funny, or both; it doesn't work. Boris is better than the Lara Flynn Boyle monstrosity, but not by much. However, we do get a large supporting turn from the excellent Michael Stuhlbarg, who's the best thing in the film and who automatically lifts the enjoyment level a bit by his presence alone.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A completely unremarkable cotton candy movie,"I have to say that going in to this movie that I was expecting it to be absurd (how could it not given the other two efforts) but completely unremarkable I did not see coming. Along the lines of the first film but with less charm and really no solid action in my opinion, this film is a cotton candy and gas combination film. Bubbly sugar farts result and if that's what you're looking for then this is the perfect movie.On the plus side, Will Smith hits all the right notes. Still, the logic flaws demand that the viewer can't take the film seriously even for a moment and there's not enough humor, heart or action to carry the movie any higher than an average to below average rating. I have to call this one a big let down.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good, though no better than you could hope for","When Tommy Lee Jones disappears(he probably just forgot his way to set, they shouldn't worry so much), J goes back in time to prevent his death back then(and to get the plot going and improve the jokes, because they were really stretching it before then). When he gets there, the duo have to try to figure out how to ensure that what he did to prevent the outer space invasion that takes place without young K, played by Josh Brolin, whose performance(and in general, acting in this is marvelous) lives up to his casting decision: spot-on. And the character dynamic between the two is revitalized by this, and this aspect not only helps make this an enjoyable sequel(huh, I guess they did have that in them), it's just about the only original aspect to do so. Following the formula set up by Back to the Future(and barely focusing on maintaining the timeline), going into the 60's(because it's a different decade than ours, so it's funny! To be fair, like with Dark Shadows, actually to an even greater extent than that, it's just the backdrop and very few of the jokes and gags rely on that... they do the obvious ""the people around Andy Warhol were not from Earth!"" bit, but it doesn't take up much of this) and having someone be able to see things that haven't happened yet(can never have enough of those!)... that last one is genuinely likable, with his frailty and quirk(one of the aspects that made the first one great, that the second lacked(opting for being dumb, instead) and that this has relatively little of other than that). The villain is bland as they come(I am pretty sure he actually changes personality traits every time he goes off-screen), deep voice, ""scary-looking"", and several of the big action scenes(this is very much a Hollywood movie of today(seen in how worried it is that we'll lose interest if long passes without a fight or someone shooting at each other)... don't get me started on how this retcons stuff into the 1997 film that lessens that one), especially the first two, are completely pointless(fluff... if not poorly made at that). It's well-paced and definitely exciting, adding a sense of danger back into the franchise, albeit not getting rid of all the stupid MiB personnel. There is a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to those who want more of this series and like recent American cinema. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Men in Black Meets Back to the Future,"¨I promised the secrets of the universe, nothing more.¨It's been 15 years since Barry Sonnenfeld directed the first Men in Black film paring up the unlikely duo of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. This concept wasn't entirely original as we've seen these sort o pairings in films like Lethal Weapon with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover playing similar characters. What I do remember about the first MIB is that it was very entertaining and had some incredible effects for the time. Now we have grown used to seeing these special effects, but I still enjoyed this movie thanks to the performance from the cast and it also brought back a nostalgic feeling. I remember that I started falling in love with movies during the 90's and MIB was one that I enjoyed very much along with Independence Day so Will Smith was one of the first actors I actually knew by name. Of course today after seeing thousand of films I see those movies and I don't find them to be as great as I first experienced them. I've grown into a more grumpy critic who expects more from movies, but MIB III brought back some of those nostalgic feelings so I ended up enjoying this movie despite it not being perfect, and rather silly at times. It's been four years since Will Smith had last starred in a movie so I really was glad to see him back in action. He is a great actor and brought a lot of comedy to his role with his big loud mouth. Both Sonnenfeld and Smith were able to make a better film than the first MIB sequel, and it lives up to the original one thanks to a clever script from Etan Cohen.Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) are still working together guarding Earth from all the dangers of the Universe. They face a new threat when a villain from K's past named Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) has escaped prison and is looking for revenge after K shot his arm off and imprisoned him over 40 years ago. J had never heard about Boris until now and when he tries to do research about the event that happened that day he isn't authorized to dig any further. Boris gets his hands on some sort of time device and goes back in time to kill Agent K. J wakes up the next day with a feeling that something has happened to K and when he arrives at work and asks about his partner nobody knows who K is. At first Agent J thinks it's all a prank, but when Agent O (Emma Thompson) tells J that K has been dead for 40 years he realizes that Boris managed to go back in time and killed K. Now times have changed and Boris's race is invading Earth to destroy it. Agent J is sent back in time to try to save K. He ends up back in 1969 where he runs into a younger version of K (Josh Brolin) and together they try to stop Boris once and for all in order to save the planet once again.The highlight of the film is probably Josh Brolin's performance since he plays a very believable young Tommy Lee Jones. His facial expressions and voice is really on the note and it is just so fun to see him imitate Jones's character. This was really my favorite part of the film along with some of the cameos and the clever jokes and cultural references of the 60's. Another highlight was Michael Stuhlbarg's (from A Serious Man) performance as Griffin. He got most of the laughs in the movie. Tommy Lee Jones didn't have a very big role in this sequel and he is getting very old, but he's still fun to watch on screen. Men in Black III is not a perfect movie, but it's entertaining and brings back some memories. I liked the whole back in time concept and it reminded me of other great films like Back to the Future. If you are a fan of Will Smith or the MIB franchise than you will really enjoy this movie, if not you might find it too silly. I really enjoyed Brolin's comedic turn in this movie and he is the highlight of the film. MIB III is an enjoyable and well made sequel.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Brolin is amazing. The film is not.,"Let's just get this out of the way: Josh Brolin's portrayal of a young Tommy Lee Jones is freakishly good. It's one of the most amusing performances of 2012 so far. It's disappointing then that the film around him – which appears to have felt the effects of its well known production issues – is hit and miss at best, cringe-worthy at worst. The CGI is often horrible, Jemaine Clement's villain is underwhelming and Hollywood stalwarts Jones and Emma Thomson are criminally underused. However, there's still enough here to recommend for Dad's and sons looking for some female-free time. Will Smith is clearly relishing the opportunity to play Agent J for the third time and he slots back into ultra-cool, jive-talking mode like a second skin. A handful of the gags work too, most of them stemming from the fish-out-of-water premise having Agent J return to the sixties. Oh, and did I mention that Brolin is amazing? He's almost worth the price of admission alone. Almost.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best since Butch and Sundance.,"Agent J: Who are we? Agent K: We are no-one. Our mission is to monitor extraterrestrial activity on Earth.Summer Sci-Fi just got a whole lot more amusing with Men in Black III, an entertaining action comedy with the best duo since Butch and Sundance. Will Smith as Agent J is light-hearted and lithe while Tommy Lee Jones's Agent K is stone-faced and stolid. Together they are fun at their repartee and sweet in their affection. The two have chemistry.J must travel back to 1969 to save K from being murdered in the present. While time travel has been overworked in film, this case is at least carefully drawn: The late '60's are meticulously re-created, the action is credible, and Josh Brolin as the young K is spot-on with his imitation of Tommy Lee Jones. The chemistry between the early K and J is every bit as enjoyable as that of the older K.The now required female agents' boss, Agent O (Emma Thompson), fares well as a sympathetic head of MIB, and her 1969 self (Alice Eve) is an accurate depiction of a young O. Times sure have changed now that females rule the roost (see James Bond, for example).Bill Heder's intriguing cameo of Andy Warhol captures the ironic cool of the '60's, bashing the proletarian pop culture while at the same time adoring it. Baddie Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement) can be as mean as any villain in The James Bond canon.The sets are just as cool as they were in the first two MIB but less impressive given how used we are to CGI. The guns, well, they do grab attention.Yet it is the attempt at character development that most impresses me, the need to go deeper, even back in time, to develop character. I never thought I'd be praising that effort in a summer blockbuster.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"A Disappointing Start, Saved","""A miracle is something that seems impossible, but happens anyway."" One of the pearls of wisdom that comes from Griffin, an extraterrestrial ""unicorn"" that joins the familiar (but unfamiliar) characters of J and K in Men in Black 3.For the first 20 minutes of the film, a miracle was needed to save this film from being a complete embarrassment to the franchise. The dialogue between the partners was a caricature of that which entertained us so well in the first two films, as if they really had been doing the same shtick for 14 years—like an old married couple with none of the charm. Something had to change drastically, and fast.Luckily, Boris the Animal is looking to do just that. Escaping from a very specialized prison, he time jumps back to 1969 to gain the upper hand on the junior agent that imprisoned him—- Agent K. As soon as he does, the grumpier-than-usual K vanishes, the world changes ever so slightly, and J is given his purpose for the next few hours of screen time.This is at least the second movie where Tommy Lee Jones is portrayed in his youth. In Space Cowboys his voice was laid over a young man that looked almost completely nothing like him, but MIB3 enrolls Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men, W.) to take his place. And the result is creepy. From the look to the bearing, Brolin absolutely convinces as a younger K. The voice and accent are so spot-on it sometimes does seem as if Tommy Lee is providing it.He is joined by a cast of impressive characters, supported by even more impressive actors. Griffin is a 5-dimensional being, meaning he can see every possibility for the future, all the time and is suitably awed. He is portrayed by Michael Stuhlbarg (Boardwalk Empire, Hugo) as a meek but engaging character who might remind some of a teddy bear version of Robin Williams. Out to kill Griffin, K, and whomever else strikes his fancy is Boris, so convincing in his role as an otherworldly murderous biker that it seems near impossible that the actor behind him is comedian Jemaine Clement— best known for being half of Flight of the Concords.Missing, sadly, are a few familiar faces. Zed (Rip Torn) is no longer head of MIB, and Frank the pug makes only a few cameos in pieces of art. The Worms do get a few words in, as well as a bagpipe solo. All in all, the third installment of the franchise is different from the first two, but it ends up working out best that way. As we see in the first scenes, the status quo just no longer works. A new format saves the third movie from going the way most seem to, as bitter disappointments. And a twist at the end, though perhaps not completely sensical, is still sweet.A worthy weekend watch.Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

Black is definitely 2012's black,"The first Men in Black was a hit. For some reason the second one didn't live up to the first. I think the general consensus was that it was okay, but more of a rehash of the original. However, number 3 - the sequel that comes after a decade - shows that they're back to their best. Okay, so maybe not quite as good as the original, but definitely a worthy instalment of the light-hearted alien-bashing series.This time Agent J (Will Smith) has to travel back in time to stop Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) from being assassinated by a particularly nasty alien (oh, and save the world while he's at it, but that's a given for the Men in Black). Back in the swinging sixties (populated by more 'sixties style' aliens - if you've watched the original Star Trek series, you'll know what I mean) J partners up with K's younger self (expertly played by Josh Brolin).If you've seen the first two, you'll know what to expect. There's nothing that new here, but sometimes that's not necessarily a bad thing. Men in Black was never meant to be taken seriously. It's just a popcorn film that will probably appeal to most people who like a healthy dose of silly sci-fi.Just sit back, put your brain on hold and your dark glasses on... and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
far better than 2,"Free falling, time travel, interesting linkage, Men in Black 3 is the answer you have been waiting for when we wondered what good will come of the MIB now when MIB 2 was a flop? Will smith pitched the idea of MIB 3 to director Barry Sonnenfeld during the shooting of MIB 2 the idea was creating a back story for Agent K which will feature Agent J going back in time.Director Barry Sonnenfeld worked on the idea and with Steven Spielberg back as Executive Producer MIB 3 is one movie I will be seeing again.Josh Brolin plays young Agent K in 1969, he did such a great job at it you'll believe you are watching K himself. Shooting was done in New York and it began in 2010.This cliff hanging action packed movie tells a tale of what happens when you arrest instead of killing the villain. An alien nicked-named Boris the animal broke out of his prison (with the help of (Nicole Scherzinger) and travels back in time to change history and kill the man that put him in jail.By doing the above he will achieve the destruction of the earth will and the death of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones).So J (Will Smith) travels back in time to help Agent K (James Brolin) save the world again and also save his life.My high in all MIB movies is the alien characters; I have to applaud the costumes designers and the CGI developers on that. Also look out for the screenplay, as major events are happening on the screen at all times and there was never a dull moment.I like a movie with a good story depth, but here in MIB 3 the makers have one thing in mind...make a better MIB movie than the last one(Men in black two was a total blunder), you want story depth? Go watch Men In Black 1.This MIB movie does not have all the whole faithful present no Frank the pug, Jeebs or Zed.When it comes to a job well done, hey Will Smith has finally done something worthwhile in years. I am legend, Hankcock and Seven Pounds were his last movies before MIB 3 and they all lacked the things that made Will Smith a name to go queue up in the cinema for. Also a nice job by the casting crew, James Brolin was the perfect man for Young Agent K.There is talk of an MIB 4, I guess we will see. I employ you top go see this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The plot is what makes this a great movie!,"Here is the thing about this film. I had expectations like all ends to a trilogy just like the Godfather would be horrible. I went into the theatre with bad expectations and I was pleasantly surprised and at times shocked. First I thought the storyline of Will Smith going back in time to revisit an alternative universe to save his partner in crime was very unique. It was beautifully done and tied the entire series together in a way that made total sense and was unexpected. You get to understand how it all began. Of course my favorite part of the film is the ending. It's so powerful the way they tie an entire dramatic event to an article of clothing. The watch. Towards the end of the film when the two of them meet back together at the diner, when Will Smith's character brings out the watch again. The sentence he utters puts you into complete silence. I won't lie and tell you that my eyes began to water. It was truly a powerful moment in cinematic history.Some critics that I have read complained perhaps about the acting or at sometimes cheesy animated graphics that look worse than real costumes, but they are brushing over the fact that what makes this great is that the storyline is unique. In an era with endless generic sequels this was refreshing. You can tell a lot of talented writers and effort was put in to leave the series on an honorable note after the sequel left many disappointed. I definitely was unprepared for what I saw that day when I walked into the movie theatre. Overall I can't recommend this movie enough, although if you haven't seen the entire series I would recommend watching the first and possibly skipping over the second.

Men In Black 3...2.5 out of 4 Skittles,"The third installment brings the original cast (Smith & Jones) and director (Sonnenfeld) back together for one more romp of alien fun, and delivers exactly what is expected. If you are a fan of the MIB franchise, then you will probably enjoy this one. If you aren't a fan...then you might want to sit this one out.Was a third installment of this highly profitable film necessary? The answer is easily no. Completing the Men In Black trilogy doesn't feel very epic, but what it does do is send the franchise out on a solid note. It's obvious that Hollywood is cashing in its chips by making this movie in the first place, but at least it delivers a somewhat entertaining film for a couple of hours and provides an escape from the real world that most movie viewers are looking for in a popcorn flick.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones provide the normal banter they have developed throughout the franchise, and Josh Brolin (True Grit, W.) has good fun playing the spot on younger version of Agent K. Even Emma Thompson (I am Legend, Love Actually) gets in on the fun delivering a funeral eulogy in a high-pitched squeal alien language.I was pleasantly surprised by MIB 3's unexpectedly touching ending. It was the perfect way for this story to go out. Hopefully the franchise will resist the urge to ante up again, and walk away on top with their pockets full of chips.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ideal for those with low expectations,"It had to be done. There was an empty evening, a slot to fill in the blog and the potential of a fun, innovative film.The short version is that Men in Black III is better than the second outing but doesn't hit the originality or the highs of the first. The biggest issue is there just isn't anything terribly new on offer. There are no great surprises, no universes hiding in a locker, no shock revelations of politicians or celebrities hailing from worlds on the other side of our imaginations. Yes, there are hints and mentions but they feel like ticks on a checklist. So much of Men in Black III does.Will Smith is on good form, maintains his perpetually young appearance, gives the cheeky chappy performance we've come to expect and (mostly) accept and carries the film without inspiring us; Tommy Lee Jones is predictably miserable/stoical/deadpan – delete as you see fit; Barry Sonnenfield returns to direct using the same map and instructions; Danny Elfman revisits the series with his third score in typical, entertaining but, in this instance, not overly inspiring fashion.The surprises come, firstly and in a minor way, from Emma Thompson, who fills the gap left by Rip Torn's absent Zed as Agent O. She plays a familiar mummsy-with-a-slight-edge role but with the expected level of humour and sincerity we've come to expect. She's not going to increase her Oscar haul (two and counting) with this but it's a performance of the expected quality. The surprise is simply that she's in Men in Black III at all.More surprising is Josh Brolin's uncannily accurate portrayal of the younger Agent K. His voice, mannerisms and miserable/stoical/deadpan – delete as you see fit – performance is remarkably close to that of Tommy Lee Jones. It's not easy playing a younger version of a familiar character; just ask Ewan McGregor, although Brolin has the advantage of playing a part that is nowhere near as beloved and iconic as Obi-Wan Kenobi.I'm far less happy with Jermaine Clement's (he of The Flight of the Conchords fame) waltz through the film as Boris The Animal. It's not so much a case of scenery-chewing as Brian Blessed on crack and chomping everything in sight. For a while it's entertaining and one is left to marvel at how he manages to say anything at all with those teeth filling two thirds of his mouth, but it very quickly becomes tedious as he attempts to roar in a slightly different way.It's entertaining, it'll thrill the children with low expectations and the drunks with depleted brain cells but, actually, I think I'll give Wild, Wild West another shot before I sit through Men in Black III again. At least it boasts the former Mrs Thompson, Kenneth Branagh.Another film review from The Squiss. For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

If you just want an easy going science fiction movie with some good comedy then this hits the nail on the head. There were some boring bits, but overall the film had some nice twists towards the end and was just the right length. I think this will be the last in the series. Some parts of the film were very similar to the previous movies, but there was enough wit in some of the jokes to keep you entertained. In the case of MIB 3 it delivers what you expect it to - fun, aliens action and will smith jokes.

However , suffering from lackluster script with excessive silliness and too many monsters . In this bland follow-up Smith , Brolin , and Lee Jones are finely accompanied by a good cast of secondaries , such as : Alice Eva , Emma Thompson, David Rasche , Jemaine Clement , Emma Thompson, Michael Stuhlbarg , Nicole Scherzinger, Bill Hader , Will Arnett, Mike Colter , among others .It contains excellent make-up by the Oscarized expert Rick Baker and breathtaking digital visuals . Colorful cinematography by cameraman Bill Pope as well as lively and thrilling musical score by Danny Elfman . The motion picture was competently directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, though with no originality , because there's many scenes we have already seen in the previous and better films . After working as a prestigious cameraman for Coen brothers Sonnenfeld got his first work as a director from Orion Pictures on Addams family (1991), a box-office success released in 1991 followed by its sequel (1993) . He received critical acclaim for his fourth directorial effort, Get Shorty (1995). Produced by Jersey Films and based on a novel by Elmore Leonard, the film won a Golden Globe for best male performance. In 1996 Steven Spielberg asked him to direct Men in Black (1997). Producer Jon Peters then asked Sonnenfeld for direct Wild Wild West (1999), an adaptation of an old TV series with Will Smith again . He also directed the comedy Big Trouble (2002) , after which he made his most successful film sequel , Men in Black II (2002) and MIB 3. Rating : 6/10 , acceptable and passable follow-up, but repetitive, dull and tiring at times . Only for MIB saga enthusiasts. Quite fun as long as you know what to expect , but inferior than precedent ones .The MIB series is formed by ""Men in Black (1997)"" with Will Smith , Lee Jones , Linda Fiorentino , Rip Torn , Tony Shaloub , Vincent D'Onifrio, David Cross , Siobhan Fallon, it was a boxoffice big hit that should spawn various sequels : ""Men in Black II 2002"" by Barry Sonnenfeld with Smith , Jones , Lara Flynn Boyle , Rosario Dawson , David Cross , Rip Torn . ""Men In Black III 2012"" by Barry Sonnenfeld with Smith, Jones, Josh Brolin , Emma Thompson , Alice Eva. ""Men in Black : International 2019"" by F.

Surprising,"Really, this is a late review, but I just started reviewing movies and this happened to be on Netflix tonight.Overall, It is a solid addition to the MIB franchise. Really nothing new to add to what the first two films did. A few rehashed jokes, a few jokes to fit with the time periods, and a couple of extremely good jokes by the new additions to the cast... And that really is the focus of this review.Josh Brolin's performance of a young Tommy Lee Jones is unbelievably perfect. I have a feeling Jones himself praised Brolin's performance. Considering that he basically not only had to impersonate a character, he had to also impersonate a person, Brolin really steals the show here and his performance makes this movie worth watching.Jemaine Clement as Boris (Just Boris) the Animal was astounding. Considering that Clement falls more in line with being a cast member of Freaks And Geeks or even Bosom Buddies (yeah going old school)... It is astounding how well his ""geek"" stereotype persona translated into a character that was actually pretty creepy. For a mostly voice actor / musician, I really can't think of anyone who would have pulled off Boris better. Hopefully we see more of him in the future : this roll really showed that he can act.And well, Emma Thomas as K was good, but she seemed to be phoning it in as she has in a lot of recent rolls. She was good for a few good laughs but really, too much talent for such a small role.Overall, a very solid 6.5/10. One of the few Third entries of a trilogy that didn't completely fail, but also didn't really do much for the series. In general, MIB 3 is worth watching if you are a fan of the movies (or if you are a fan of the original graphic novels). Rounded it up to 7, but again, more like a 6.5.Good movie, not great, but not bad, and really just fun to watch. So grab the popcorn and turn your brain off while Brolin proves that he is one of the best actors in the last 20 years. Seriously, his acting range from comedy/ drama / horror / romance is really just astounding.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I have watched 100+ times.,"As good as the first, better than the 2nd.. Brolin performance was amazing, makes me hope that he ends up being brought to the future to help Jay. I understand Tommy Lee is getting on now. Very enjoyable movie. That myself have always loved and now my kids watch all 3 over and over.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very Underrated Ending,"The why behind K's motives for pursuing K as a partner were told so well, it made the movie.Young K is also portrayed perfectly by Josh Brolin just as well as he was by Tommy Lee Jones.The villain, Boris the Animal, needed a little more motivation other than just being evil, but that's just knit-picking.The character of Griffin keeps the middle portion of the movie interesting; an alien character who simultaneously exists in all multiple timelines, but doesn't know which one he himself is in. He knows all the ways he could die, but not if he will.More of a story connection between Boris the Animal and Griffin would have probably made the movie more perfect. Like a violent alien species warring against a peaceful pacifist alien species, yet the pacifists win by manipulating timeline events.Also, Michael Stuhlbarg plays Griffin so well. Check out how much of a 180 he can do in acting by watching Boardwalk Empire where he plays the sinister gangster kingpin of New York, Arnold Rothstein.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"MIB3, Alien Sci-Fi or an Action?","The movie is good, but I couldn't decide, is it a MIB film? Obviously it is, but it didn't have that many aliens that we had in the MIB series so far. The movie did great as an action film, but not so great as a Sci- Fi.The comedy was done perfectly, except I would have liked them to cut down on the jokes for my action scenes, some scenes where left a banded. The movie has an amazing ending, but has a really slow middle. I really liked the movie because it just had wonderful CGI, when you could get it. The 3D was OK, but instead of having it in 3D, they needed to spend more money on the scenery in the 60's part of the film, it looked like we where in 2009.The movie was great and very funny, but sometimes overloaded, and paced. The movie goes for 106mins, but I would rather have the movie go for 130mins and have some great action scenes, some more comedy, some more 3D scenes and some more Aliens. I have a feeling the movie was low budgeted.I will give the movie this though, it was fun, funny and SOMETIMES entertaining. It did have good action scenes, when you could get them (which was very rarely), some AWESOME CGI (which I felt like we missed out on), and a really great ending (Very heartfelt). But really this movie shouldn't be called a MIB movie. Sorry, it was still good though.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
No catchy song,"For some reason this didn't get a catchy song as the first two MIB movies did. Maybe Will Smith was too occupied doing other things (producing movies, looking after the career of his children and other stuff), but we don't get the treat of another memorable tune. Even if you didn't like the other MIB songs, you've got to admit, they stayed with you for awhile. But apart from this little ""omission"", every other ingredient is here. With a little twist on our beloved Agent ""K"" of course. If you've seen the trailer or read anything about the movie, you know what I'm talking about.Getting Josh Brolin here as a major player was a big thing and he really delivers. There is also a cameo of sorts, of a major character of the other two movies. But it's not a ""talking"" part. Plus the usual ""Aliens"" among us in-jokes we have to come to love (hopefully). But be warned of one thing: This might have a very strong beginning that stretched the PG-13 rating a bit, by being really brutal (for the rating that is)",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Do not worry to waste your time for this movie,Yes! It has happened. I've seen this movie and my rating is 7 of 10 points. If you want to know some details about agent J's past so you should watch this movie. Tommy lee Jones have appeared in this movie in the beginning (first 15 minutes) and in the final of movie (last 5 minutes). So totally you can see my favorite old school actor is 20 minutes. SFXs are 7 of 10. Actors Playing is 7 of 10. Story line and screenplay are 5 of 10. There are some stupid moments about Boris Animal in the end of the movie (Fight in Cape of Canaveral with agents J and K). I expected more of this movie but please do not worry it is not boring to spend a time for that.,7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Much better than #2 - solid and entertaining,"A significant upgrade over part II, Men in Black III offers a plausible plot, the usual engaging performances from Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, and awesome-looking aliens. It's a keeper.This time around, the taciturn K (Jones) finds himself the target of the nefarious Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement), a bad, bad alien who's just broken out of the maximum-security prison designed to hold him on the Moon. Turns out Boris isn't just out to get K, though; he plans to travel back in time to when K arrested him (and shot his arm off) and kill him there. This, of course, leads to a time-travel journey taken by Agent J (Smith), who must stop Boris before he messes up the future for K - and instigates a full-scale alien invasion in the present day.It's the kind of movie that doesn't need to try too hard to win an audience over. We know the characters; put them in an interesting situation, and everything works out fine. Some movies throw in the figurative kitchen sink, the better to confuse the audience into thinking everything means something - when, in fact, nothing means a darn thing. MIB doesn't bother with trickery. The personalities of J and K - well established and reflective of the public perception of Messrs. Smith and Jones - meld so seamlessly and are so symbiotic that the actual plot is almost (almost) relegated to the background.Remember, it can be difficult to create a decent third film in a series. There are no surprises with the characters, and presumably we know all about someone's backstory. In MIB III, though, we do learn a little bit about Agent K's past. But thanks to a vibrant script by Joel Coen, that past history is more complementary than front and center. I think a focus on just K's 1969 life would have made for a pretty dull movie. I mean, it's not as if he's Mr. Excitement, right?Clement is a terrific, terrible villain as the monstrous Boris the Animal (""It's just BORIS!""); he has this nifty parasite thing that lives in his remaining hand, and when he aims the hand at someone, a dart shoots out. Pretty cool. Emma Thompson is also on board as the new head of the MIBs (her name? O, of course. Get it? O and K?); former leader Zed (Rip Torn) has passed away. Alice Eve plays the 1969 version of O as well.An undercomplicated plot doesn't mean that the special effects are blasted in your face, though. In fact, they're kept at a minimum, again lending support to the charisma of Jones and Smith instead of supplanting it. There are some cool transportation devices in 1969 (but not in the current day, weird), and the time-travel device itself is wacky (it's a time JUMP, literally). The effects feel as if they're meant to be there, not that they're shoehorned in to make things look pretty. And that's a positive development.Men in Black III is a typical, solid blockbuster action movie. Not all action movies can stand up to much scrutiny, and if you're Michael Bay they don't stand up to any scrutiny at all, not when your third act is always Blow Stuff Up. This is an audience pleaser with a fascinating plot, amiable performances, good effects and set pieces, and some funny dialog to boot.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

But there is something great in this film - yes of course; Twisted plot, time travel, emotional & sentimental story line with a great performance.

Men In Black 3 (U/A) 3D-----------------Rating:3/5,"Thankfully there isn't much mumbo-jumbo about time travel that is thrust upon the audience and the focus - as expected - is much more on the camaraderie between Will and Josh. However, and to one's disappointment, it is this very area where the film fails to hold your attention, especially during the second half where neither the drama works, nor the one liners. Oh yes, both Will as well as the ones behind the dialogues and screenplay try hard to inject some humour quotient but frankly, except for a stray four-five points where you do get a smile on your face, there is not even a single 'bring on the laughter' moment.In such a scenario one would have expected the action to do the talking but even that never rises above the ordinary. Now that's a pity because the film is presented in 3D (seems like a conversion case and not really shot in 3D) but still there aren't any wow moments whatsoever. This means that whether it is the action sequence set in a Chinese restaurant or the one where both agents race on their innovative bike and follow a car, you don't really feel enthralled. Even the climactic sequence set around a rocket launcher station hardly arrests your attention. Men In Black 3 (U/A) 3D-----------------Rating:3/5It is an Sci-fi action flick.... 3D effects and visual effects were great.... Will smith has done a great job.... the monsters and creatures are very dangerous to be viewed.....Agent J travels in time to MIB's early years in the 1960s, to stop an alien from assassinating his friend Agent K and changing history.Of course the revelation soon after the climax is good and one can join the dots here. Still, the excitement is rather too later in the day because by this time one has actually lost good level of interest in the proceedings. Moreover the culprrit is also some of the repulsive shots in the very first 30 minutes of the film with aliens and their body parts making you look in a different direction.Yes, Will Smith does well but then he too is saddled with the kind of script that hardly allows him to bring on his characteristic histrionics. Tommy Lee Jones is hardly there, Jemaine Clement is always cartoon-ish and never quite threatening while Josh Brolin is decent, not exceptional.All in all, a film that you won't regret skipping this season.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

MIB lll is one great film that you can't miss!,"Men In Black 3 brings back the epicness of the first two movies.Although it has been fifteen years since the first movie, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones have kept the quality of their roles and Josh Brolin started his role fantastically also. You would actually think that Josh Brolin would have to be related to Tommy Lee Jones to pull off his role so brilliantly! Men In Black 3 kept me entertained from start to finish and had a variety of comedy and action which is one of the things that makes this a really great movie! Barry Sonnerfield came back with a bang and made this movie as original as the others. This was clevery written and has a great story vouch will hook anyone into this film! Overall,Men In Black 3 is a great movie to see with your family(the IMAX 3D is fantastic on this film by the way)and I would recommend it to be seen on the big screen!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Entertaining enough - but hasn't the franchise run its course?,"Film franchises normally churn out movies every two or three years, but there was a five year gap between ""MIB1"" and ""MIB2"" and then a ten year interval between ""MIB2"" and ""MIB3"". Maybe three-time director Barry Sonnenfeld was looking for another cinematic hit after spending most of his time on television work.This time, though, Tommy Lee Jones has clearly lost interest because he only appears at the beginning and the end, passing the role of his younger (1969) self to Josh Bolin in a caper which combines weird creatures with time travel. It's passably entertaining but I would have thought that the franchise has run its course if I didn't know that ""MIB4"" is in development.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Very enjoyable and brilliant cast,"Men in Black III was a very enjoyable film, although in my opinion it was the worst of the 3 i would still choose to watch it again in a heartbeat. Josh Brolin's character (Young Agent Kay) studied his character extremely well, all the way down to the voice, mannerisms, looks and even the lovable bickering between jay and kay. The only disappointment was that will smith's character (Agent Jay) did not have as much of a funny character as the previous films but yet still suited the part and related to the previous films well. I would recommend this to many of my mates and await the release on DVD. I would not miss out in watching this classic film of this enjoyable trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Three's a charm,"Last seen in ""Seven Pounds"", Will Smith is back after a hiatus of quality time with the family; time that he has clearly put to good use considering the projects he has lined up over the next few years. Also returning is MIB series (now a franchise) director Barry Sonnenfeld , who, given the flaws of the sequel, has evidently jump-started the MIB saga with this third outing. Together, Smith and Sonnenfeld work their magic, but the true measure of fresh blood comes from the unlikely inclusion of a new character, without which MIB 3 would have been on an outer-space trajectory into oblivion.Now a veteran, senior Agent J (Smith) and his partner Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) continue to lookout for illegal aliens and extraterrestrial threats to Earth. Their investigations lead them onto a trail left by 'Boris the animal' a dangerous alien K imprisoned 40 years ago. Now finding that K no longer exists, J learns that his partner has been murdered in the past, so travels back to 1969 to prevent Boris from killing K and altering history as we know it.Going into this third outing, I wasn't very hopeful that Smith, nor Jones, would have any space juice left to revive the interest of Will Smith fans or sci-fi fans. Bringing Josh Brolin into the series changes all that. As the younger K, Brolin adds a much needed tenacity to this third part while ensuring his character remains vital to the story. The real crowd puller is his unbelievable likeness in personality to that of Jones, in that you can be mistaken for thinking his dialogue is voiced by Jones himself. While the first half hour of the movie appears to be treading the beaten path of the previous film, it all changes for the better once J time-jumps to the past and is heavily aided with Brolin stepping in as the younger K. This is further tweaked with Etan Cohen's screenplay, rife with ample comic moments that seem tailor made for Smith and Brolin. In comparison, Brolin comes up with some funny lines while Smith is tasked with adding depth and heart − resulting in a clever and overwhelming twist where the premise is the destructive nature of secrets. Other plot aiding roles come from Michael Stuhlbarg as a clairvoyant alien called Griffin and Jemaine Clement as Boris – the darkest alien villain in the series so far. Emma Thompson as Agent O does not add much to the story, nor is her inclusion to the film remarkable, except suggesting that O and K may have had a close working relationship.Overall, Sonnenfeld vindicates the need for a third part by putting together a good story, juxtaposition-ed with laughs and cliff-hangers. However, considering the strong sci-fi flavor this year, MIB 3 suffices as pure entertainment for the masses and is unlikely to resurrect a cult following; at least not the type stirred by ""Back to the Future"". As reported, it may be another 3-4 years before Will Smith fans see him spurt out a few wisecracks. In the interim, ""Men in Black III"" is a decent choice if you want to experience a lighthearted sci-fi movie that does not require too much concentration.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Men in Black 3 (2012),"After the awful MIB II undid the powerful end of the first film, I wasn't hoping for too much where this third film was concerned. I was pleasantly surprised. The film follows J and K after the escape of a villain known as Boris The Animal escapes a high security prison on the moon. Boris goes back in time to kill K, so J must go further back to stop him. There he meets a young agent K, played by Josh Brolin. The time travel plot could be hokey and annoying, as they often are, but Men In Black III tries really hard to ignore the science, but make it a valuable part of the plot. Brolin is magnificent at his Jones impersonation, which is essential as it immediately creates the same chemistry Smith has with Jones. I never once saw Brolin in this film, just a younger Jones. There are a number of fun sequences and interesting ideas, including a character that can experience all time and all possible realities at once. Jemaine Clement is a bit confusing as the villain, as you can't tell if he is trying to be scary or funny. When it seems like he is trying to be scary he is actually funny and vice versa. The effects were very creative at times, but it tried playing up to the 3D a bit too often. Hopefully this will be the last as the ending did tie it together nicely. A good, fun sequel, that avoids just rehashing the exploits of the first or second films.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Men Are Back,"When an interstellar evil mastermind Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from LunaMax, a moon-based maximum security prison, he returns to Earth to seek both revenge on his captor Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) as well as a means to bring about a Boglodyte invasion. In order to do so Boris steals an illegal time jump machine and travels back in time to eliminate the younger version of Agent K (Josh Brolin). In succeeding in doing so the future alternates with only Agent J (Will Smith) remaining aware that the time-line has been modified. Thus Agent J retreads the path of Boris and goes back in time to avert the death of his friend and the inevitability of Armageddon.Lacking the novelty of the first episodes of the series, ""Men in Black"" remains one of the few buddy movies with true effortless charm between the main protagonists. The opposites of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith collide with sparkling results, thus making them a pure joy to behold, even more so when the comedy keeps in tow with the quality of their interaction. The risk of replacing Tommy Lee Jones with Josh Brolin as Smith's partner was therefore significant. But Brolin was truly remarkable delivering Agent K with aplomb (nailing each mannerism to perfection), to the extent that I actually checked whether Lee Jones and Brolin were maybe in fact related. Personal traits of Agent K are replicated with ease, whilst the appeal of the K and J pairing remained intact.Nonetheless, despite high levels of enjoyment, ""Men in Black 3"" came off a bit stale in the post-Archive X era, reusing certain motives making the movie feel somewhat outdated, as if an attempt to revive a bygone era. This naturally has nothing to do with creature design or special effects, which are first-rate throughout. Barry Sonnenfeld delivers a movie, which is exactly as promised, and herein lies the main issue: the lack of adventure and freshness, which made the first two parts such memorable popcorn flicks. That said ""Men in Black 3"" delivers an unexpected emotional wallop with its story, which comes as a surprise, but nicely brings the movie to a well-deserved close.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Well, I simply enjoyed it!","Seems that this movie is a case of you will either like or you completely won't. Surpsingly enough I quite liked it! Surprising, since I'm not even really a big Men in Black fan.I really do think that the reason why I liked this movie was because it was being less silly and over-the-top than the previous two installments. There still is plenty of fun and comedy present throughout the movie but just not too much of the silly kind. It lets the movie feel less forced, which all made it more enjoyable to watch. At least for me it really did!But having said that, it still is a true Men in Black movie, with some familiar moments in it, which the fans will surely appreciate. But really not everything is the same this time around and I applaud the movie for actually doing some new stuff, even though not everything works out that well of course.Even though this movie still has the same style and tone as the previous two Men in Black movies, some things still have really changed in this movie. For one, I feel that this movie is less about the aliens and science-fiction and more about its human characters this time. J and K are the true center of the movie and there aren't that many distractions from their stories. Another clear and big difference is the K character, who this time gets mostly played by Josh Brolin, who plays the younger version of the character that got and gets played by Tommy Lee Jones.The greatest strength of the Men in Black series to me had always been the chemistry and dynamic between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. It made the movies fun and memorable but let me tell you that Tommy Lee Jones isn't even missed! Tommy Lee Jones still shows up but really for a surprising short amount of time. But the reason why you won't miss him from the rest of the movie is because Josh Brolin simply IS Tommy Lee Jones. He impersonates him perfectly and even looks and sounds like a young Tommy Lee Jones.But really, like all Men in Black movies, it remains a far from perfect one. The one thing that is mostly keeping this movie down is its story. Not only doesn't it explore its whole time travel concept thoroughly enough but it also suffers from the exact same thing that all of the Men in Black movies suffer from; its villainous plot.Really not all that much wrong with is main villain but his plot is kind of weak and feels underdeveloped and even somewhat secondary for the movie. You never get a sense of treat or urgency, simply because you don't always exactly know what is going on and you basically already know beforehand what the movie is going to do and heading for with its main plot line. It's all some typical stuff and the movie offers very little surprises, even if you don't exactly understand what its main story is all about.The movie is nothing too great but it surely is a lot of fun and entertaining to watch, which does compensates a lot!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Did Columbia Make This Film Just For Me?,"I am gonna say it... This film is as good as the first one.It's a roller coaster ride from frame one. The production and writing teams don't make the mistake of being complacent, as can so often happen in a third installment. No-one messed too much with Elfman's engaging and original soundtrack, either.Old themes are revisited, but some clever plot twists, Sixties references (which I loved being a child of that Era) combined with fresh and interesting characters put MIB 3 on a par with the now classic MIB 1.The comedy dialogue is snappy too. I found myself chuckling through most of the scenes where Smith plays off Tommy Lee's deadpan style that worked so well in previous MIBs.Josh Brolin is superb as Young Agent K, adopting Tommy Lee Jones mannerisms and inflections with spooky skill. Jermaine Clement is a convincingly psychotic Super Baddie, assisted by outstanding CGI that the Special Effects Team have perfected on MIB films.The plot races along but I won't mind watching this film a few times to try and understand everything that passes. Right at its centre is a feel good story that ties up a few loose threads. I won't spoil the ending for those yet to see it, but I did shed a tear.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Surprisingly Good,"I wasn't really sure what to expect of this film, and in fact I was quite surprised to learn that it was coming out when I saw the trailers in the cinema. In a way I rolled my eyes and thought 'gee, not another Men in Black'. I had seen the other two, a long time ago, and in a way had pretty much left the actually knowledge of them sort of filter away. I guess I found the other two movies to be somewhat ordinary and a little silly. While they were comedies, I never actually found them all that funny.To be honest, I didn't really find this movie all that funny either, but I guess that has a lot to do with American humour. What Americans seem to find funny (and you can easily work that out by seeing what movies they go and see, though the best way would be to go into a cinema in America and watch a comedy, but that is something that I am not really all that keen to do) is not what I find funny. However despite it being not all that funny, and nothing a little too different from the other films, I still enjoyed it.Anyway, one day Agent J walks into the office to discover that Agent K has disappeared, and that was after J discovered that there were some secrets that K has not actually told him. J was a little upset because apparently he was going to be told all of the secrets of the universe, but as it turns out (and he discovers the secret in the end) this secret is not a secret of the universe but rather of a personal nature.Apart of me was wondering if there was any direct connection with the previous movies, and I guess one always thinks that when one comes in and watches a sequel years after watching the original, but it does come clear that this is not the case. Seriously, some sequels really do do my head in because I am always wondering whether there is something from the previous movies that are important in this movie that I may have forgotten or missed, but as it turns out this is not the case. I guess this is one of the dangers of sequels that people who have not seen the previous films will not see the sequel, however the benefit is that people who have seen the originals, will rush out and rent them to familiarise themselves with what has gone on before so that they are left with no nasty surprises.Somehow I also wonder whether there was a reason why they took this long to release the third movie, but there could be a lot of reasons. However, this is still a good movie, and I liked it, and no, you don't need to have seen the earlier movies to be able to enjoy this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
can the cinema today can get any worse?,"This is one of the baddest movies I have watched, but its nothing different from the other shallowness in todays cinema.. I mean the cinema this days doesn't even surprise me anymore, and yet it surprise me every time, probably because I still think, that there could be some 'light in the end of the tunnel', like Avatar has surprised me years before, because I thought things were finally moving forward.. Well, I guess I was wrong, because here we have the same ""crap"" again, only its make more shallower and more superficial than ever. Can the cinema this days get any worse?? And I would be surprised if it can..First lets take with the characters, well take the Jemaine Clement, which plays the main 'evil'-guy and gives probably the most convincing role, but the character he plays is filled so much with ""evil-shallowness"", and if it could just be at least something to laugh upon, but I don't find this the case through the movie.. Then its Will Smith, with no jokes upon him(which makes him shine in Prince of Bell Air for instance) and the character he plays is not convincing.. Tommy Lee Jones rude behaviour puts me waaay back. The only that I find at least somehow convincing is Josh Brolin, and I don't know why, but the parts he plays I find the best..And its not about the its the directing part in today movies that gives me the impression that there is somebody always laughing at me, making the 'best' crap of movies they can, and then smiling faces, myself realizing that people would bought that stuff. And I don't know what jokes is upon, but I just don't get it. Every time I see another movie I wonder what drives this people to the cinema(and I am sorry, but its true, and I really don't get it..) Every time I go, like today, I except something ""different"", only to be left down again. And thats over and over and over again.. I mean of course this is pop-corn, but its such a bad pop-corn piece of crap... And I am sorry about that but I think I just couldn't find a better word for it. And its its the case of all the Hollywood movies they make this day..I would give it maybe 2/10, or maybe 3/10, if it was for beginning to the close end of the movie, that part I find the most interesting, but it was such a dull experience, I just couldn't get it more than 1 out of 10..",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Here come the Men In... wait, de ja vu.","By throwing time-travel into the fray, this belated third-entry does something a bit different and is much better for it, never quite reaching the heights of the first flick in the series but still being an entertaining time in its own right. What helps 'Men In Black 3 (2012)' is an almost perfect performance from Brolin as the young Jones, who gels almost as well with Smith in this entry as his older counterpart did before (who, here, just seems tired). It also has a unique setting that injects life into a somewhat stale premise, which is essentially the same as it has always been. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Appropriately Shiny and Slick, But Never Approaches the Magic of the Original","The pieces are there, and they're moving in the right ways, but this long-awaited revival just doesn't feel right. That's partially due to a crushing lack of Tommy Lee Jones, who's relegated to a mere cameo appearance, but more thoroughly to a lack of conviction and casual, happenstance tone. It's okay for a comedy to be this thoroughly jokey and loose, but the formula that worked for this franchise in the past was a tight balance of those lighter moments with sharp, dramatic action sets. MIB3 may go through those motions, but the emotional punch that its predecessor had delivered so easily is almost completely absent here. Though the vast majority of the film is set in the free love sixties, the atmosphere also remains very modern, like attending a themed costume party where the host didn't get the memo. Excepting a few very easy sight gags and the eyeball-rolling location of the film's grand climax, this just doesn't seem to make much effort to ground itself in that era. Josh Brolin works an uncanny Jones impression during these scenes, but that act falls strangely flat when the real deal himself was on-screen only moments before, and in this case there's really no substitute for the real thing. Quirky and fun, but terribly thin and uncertain... worth watching for the effects and frequent nods to its genre-mates, but it's really no better than the underwhelming Men in Black II.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Much better than I remember,I watched this in the cinema when it came out and was so displeased with it I never watched it again - until 2024.Maybe I am mellowing in my old age but I really enjoyed this.It has a workable time-travel story with an interesting villan and lots of little side-jokes that mostly land.The action is low key but when things do happen the set pieces are energetic and the visuals standup pretty well considering the age.The character development is where this really shines and I loved seeing young K and O in action.This isn't an amazing movie but for a Sunday afternoon this is perfect viewing.,7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Josh Brolin is the best,"The first Men in Black movie I saw was the second one. It didn't really impress me, so I didn't rush to see the first one. But as part III was approaching I thought I should check it out and I was surprised, I liked it very much, but I still didn't go into the cinema with hight hopes, but again I had to realize that I was wrong. The movie's not a masterpiece, it won't change your life, but it's fun, and that's what counts. The story was good (I always like good time-travel in films), the action and the effects worked, Will Smith was funny as ever, but Josh Brolin's Tommy Lee Jones impression was the best.The interactions between J and K were well written and Jemaine Clement did a terrific job as the villain. But sometimes I found the alien elements to be too much. Boris's hand and those spikes he shot out of it were kind of ridiculous, and his motives weren't very clear, but that doesn't take much away from the experience. Also there were some plot-holes and things that weren't explained, but I guess time-travel is hard to write, because it doesn't exist. I don't want to pick this movie apart, so I won't talk about these illogicalities, see them for yourself.All in all the movie isn't the best, but it isn't bad at all. Enjoyable, funny and brings back nice memories. Oh and the music was really good too (Danny Elfman did the composing).Score: ★★★★",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pitbull Sucks!,"Written Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. AshlandI waited ten years for this?! This third installment of the beloved (yet seemingly forgotten) ""Men in Black"" franchise reunites not only Will Smith (The Pursuit of Happiness)and Tommy Lee Jones (No Country for Old Men), but also director Barry Sonnenfeld and writer Lowell Cunningham; in a film that leaves much to be desired when held side by side with the original. In fact, for the first forty-five minutes, ""Men in Black 3"" is almost unwatchable, containing relatively no laughs. So, is Will Smith to blame simply because, unlike any film in the series before, ""Men in Black 3"" is pretty much the Will Smith show? Well, the answer to that question is a resounding no. The disappointments here actually stem from not poor script structure, but an abundance of shockingly dull one liners. The sad fact is that Will Smith is given absolutely nothing funny to say for the first half of the film. And, of course, it doesn't help that during the final credits audiences are subjected to that God awful Pitbull song. It isn't until the arrival of Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men), nearly half way through, that things with ""Men in Black 3"" become even the slightest bit entertaining. And, as you can probably tell by my rating, this film does get better as the second hour hits its stride. But if what I say is true and only half the movie is worth watching, then shouldn't logic dictate that my admission price be cut in half? The Plot: This third installment follows Agent K (Jones) and (now veteran) Agent J (Smith) as they go about their Men in Black business; you know, protecting the earth from the scum of the universe and zapping people in the eyes with that memory eraser thing. But little do they know that an evil alien, with the very fitting name of Boris The Animal, has just escaped from intergalactic prison, and has the elimination of Agent K on his mind. But he doesn't plan on killing K in the conventional alien way (no probing). Boris plans to go back in time and kill young Agent K. So, when Agent J wakes up one day to find his partner missing, ""to find the truth, he has to do back in time"" (damn you Pitbull!).There are really only two reasons to watch ""Men in Black 3"": The first being the standout performances of Brolin, who is a shoe-in to one day play Tommy Lee Jones in the Tommy Lee Jones story, and Jemaine Clement (The Flight of the Conchords) who plays the witty and grotesque (best villain of the series) Boris The Animal. The second reason being, for how lackluster and ill conceived the plot of ""Men in Black 3"" seems for about an hour, the twist in the final act is one of the most pleasantly surprising payoffs in any sci-fi movie I have seen since the 90's. I hesitate to say that this ending is so good that it makes up for the rest of this below average film, but...it sort of does.Final Thought: ""Men in Black 3"" is a horse that starts the race off slow, but finishes strong. And while I don't see this horse winning any races among critics (and maybe I've just used one too many horse racing analogies for my own good) if you are a fan of the Men in Black series, ""Men in Black 3"" will be something worth wasting a Saturday afternoon watching. On the other hand, if ""Men in Black 2"" was in your mind, ""just OK"", then don't waste your time with this film.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

Wait for the DVD,"I like the principals in this movie Will Smith, Josh Brolin, etc., they're good in just about everything they've ever been involved in. It just feels like over-sequelitis in this third go around of the Men in Black franchise. In my opinion, each succesive installment has become less interesting. The story line here is lame, particularly the last 20 minutes or so. I saw it in 3-D and the effects are good but I would expect them to be GREAT given the very high cost of admission. Some of the continuity from the previous two MIB films has been altered and that kind of annoyed me. If I had it to do over again I would probably have preferred to wait for it to come to Redbox and rent it for a buck. That's about all it's worth.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
""" When chasing yourself through time, the question is, , ,do I ever want to catch up? ""","The Men from the Top secret Organization are back in this new film called "" Men in Black III"" and I mean Way, , ,back. Directed by Barry Sonnenfel this story was written by Etan Cohen. It seems a dangerous creature called Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) has escaped incarceration on a maximum prison planet and has a most diabolic plan to travel back in time to get even with the man who put him in prison. Will Smith returns as Agent J and Tommy Lee Jones reprises his role as Agent K with Josh Brolin playing a younger version of himself. Audience members have to pay close attention to this action oriented, fun-filled caper as the agents have to chase themselves through time, hoping that they can remember enough to save themselves and the world. The movie is exciting in more ways than one. What with super gadgets and speed travel in multiple frames of history to deal with, this movie unravels at the speed of excitement. For eye-candy we are offered Emma Thompson as Agent O and plenty of recoil as the movie progresses. All in all, this is a good film with heart touching scenes as friendship is put on the line. Great comeback for the principals. ****",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
belated sequel that could be better,"Despite being partners for nearly fourteen years, veteran MIB Agents J and K still don't seem able to communicate. However, the true value of their partnership is put to the test when K mysteriously vanishes, apparently the victim of a complex time traveling scheme. To save not only his partner, but all of humanity as he once knew it, Agent J must travel back to 1969 to stop a sinister alien from rewriting history. A good setup along with some genuinely clever ideas would have worked better without so much forced humor and phony special effects. Straight man Jones is still reliable, comic relief Smith (after a four-year absence) shows some rust, but there is a highlight in Brolin who perfectly embodies the younger, still deadpan version of Agent K. Acceptable, just not as much fun as it could be. **½",,Anonymous,Comedy
Men in Black 3 (2012) - I'm Agent M!,"It's been nearly 15 years since the original ""Men in Black"", which has always been one of my favorite movies, and it's been nearly 10 years since the disappointing sequel. Now after years of production issues, script problems, and minor casting decisions, director Barry Sonnenfeld brings us the third chapter in the franchise with ""Men in Black 3"", and even though I have a few pros and cons with the movie itself, this is still one of the more entertaining movies of the year. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles as Agents J and K, still fighting aliens and zapping people's brains. But let's face it, since it's been so many years, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are starting to lose a lot of the chemistry that they had in the previous movies, and I wasn't really buying their chemistry anymore, even if Tommy Lee Jones does make that annoying stone-faced look throughout, which looked like he had no interest in being in this movie (but he was hardly in the movie at all, so I'm not mad at him). This just shows why I absolutely hated the first 20 minutes of the movie. Throughout the first half, it was filled with cheap jokes that fell flat, dull and careless moments, and some weird plot holes that make no sense. I started to hate the first half, as it went on and on and on. Also, Jemaine Clement, from ""Flight of the Conchords"", plays the villain, named Boris the Animal. But, come on, Jemaine Clement's character is probably one of the most least interesting villains in the history of cinema. He had nothing to do, besides growl and growl and....growl! Seriously, I was disappointed on how the movie started. But, once we start the time-travel aspect of the movie, that's when I started to like the movie, and enjoy it. Agent K has suddenly been erased from time, and now Agent J has to go back in time, to 1969, to save his partner from being killed by Boris the Animal. That's when the movie started to catch up, and that's when I started to enjoy and love it. The time-travel part of the storyline really caught my attention, and it was pretty interesting and entertaining. Also, Josh Brolin delivers a top-notch performance, impersonating a young version of Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K character. I really loved how Josh Brolin was able to play a younger Agent K, in such a clever and stylized way. I also really loved the chemistry between Brolin and Will Smith, because these two really got along more, and I easily bought their chemistry easily. Also, Michael Stuhlbarg plays a friendly alien named Griffin, who can be able see the possibilities of the past and future. At first, I got a little annoyed by his character, but then later in the movie, you start to know him a little bit more, and then I ended up liking him. Yeah, this guy seems like a nice guy. It was around the second half where the jokes got funnier, the storyline started to impress, and I was more entertained. Rick Baker's alien make-up effects are still refreshingly brilliant, the special effects are perfectly clever, and there is a surprising heartwarming moment near the final act that will definitely warm your heart. So, ""Men in Black 3"" was such a fun movie to watch, and I was really entertained by what the movie offered at times. I would say forget the first 20 minutes, and then afterward, you'll enjoy the ride. So, go check out this movie, before I go to your house, and use that neuralizer to zap your brain, and forget about this review!

"Better than 2, but that's enough","After the delightful originality of the first Men in Black film, there was really only one way for the film series to go with the sequel - down. But no one expected the second instalment to be as woefully short of the first film as it was, leaving the franchise's reputation in tatters. This meant that MIB III had a major job to do to get the film series back into the black, critically speaking (pun intended). While the third instalment does repair some of the damage done by part 2, the lack of the dynamic between Smith and Jones for the majority of the film seems to leave a whole in the plot.Men In Black III's latest plot line takes a new (but probably inevitable) direction by using time travel to send Will Smith's wisecracking Agent J back in time to the time of the moon landing and to work with the earlier incarnation of Agent K, played with excellent Tommy Lee Jones impersonation by Josh Brolin. The usual hijinks that we have come to expect from the Men in Black ensue, including some terrific sight gags and pop culture references to famous people revealed as aliens. Meanwhile, while the Tommy Lee Jones-shaped hole in the majority of the film is felt, the refreshing new take on the partnership dynamic added by Brolin does inject some impetus into what would have been an otherwise ailing franchise. However, the replacement of Rip Torn's Z with Emma Thompson as new chief O seems one alteration too many, lacking the spark that made Z's character such a favourite. Mercifully though, Frank the Pug is notable by his absence.Generally, MIB III is much better than its predecessor, but still lacks the charm, wit, warmth and originality of the first film - although learning more about how K got to be such a crotchety old man does provide some interesting developments, and as always, the creatures are very effectively realised by excellent special effects and make up teams. However, Will Smith's Fresh Prince shtick is now starting to wear a bit thin after so many years since the TV show ended - his more grown up efforts in films such as 'I Am Legend' showed there was more to him than that, which he should pursue. He's outgrown this stuff - a fact proved by the lack of a Will Smith track on the film.Overall a relatively good film to enjoy, but let the franchise rest now - enough's enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This film knew how to honor and equal the first film.,"Despite their popularity, the first two MIB films, from the turn of the century, are films I don't really like to watch. The first movie, from 1997, is still worth it, but the second one was so bad that they had to wait more than ten years for this movie to come out, and even then, we still remember it. Good news: this movie is virtually as good as the first one and knows how to meet the public's expectations.The plot is reasonably simple, but it guarantees entertainment: over the years, the boss of the MIB organization became a woman. Meanwhile, the escape of a dangerous alien from the lunar prison will force J to travel back in time, to the beginning of K's career, to try to prevent planet Earth from being invaded by a destructive galactic force. The script does a reasonably effective job and there is a lot of movement and action.Will Smith shows that he has matured as an actor, and he knew how to imprint that maturity on the MIB agent he played: J is no longer a rookie or someone who accepts lessons, he is a senior agent with experience, who knows what he is doing and is sufficiently trained to deal with what you have in hand. Of course, K remains a veteran, and Tommy Lee Jones won't let that go by the wayside: sullen and seemingly unflappable, Jones' character will take particular pleasure in lecturing and lecturing Smith whenever appropriate. And, ultimately, it's the way the two actors interact that makes the movie funnier. The villain is worthy of our dislike and has some good jokes and tongue-in-cheek lines, but Jemaine Clement seems to have sometimes exaggerated things a bit. Michael Stuhlbarg and Josh Brolin do a very honest and committed job, and they help substantially to increase the quality of the film.Technically, there is a serious and substantial bet on CGI, computerization and computer-made effects. It's something almost predictable, nowadays it's a very widespread resource and sci-fi or action movies have learned to master it. However, the authenticity of real scenes always tastes good. So the ending seems to be a bit out of step with the rest of the movie, but that turns out to be a minor problem. The cinematography is quite well executed, the sound and soundtrack are effective, the visuals as well. The sets and wardrobe, as well as the props, are in line with what you would expect to find in a MIB film.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

MIB3: Time is Not Their Friend,"This film is not recommended.The successful Men in Black series has finally turned three this year, after a 10 year hiatus. It still tries to incorporate its winning formula of sardonic humor, otherworldly creatures, and top-notch visual effects. However this time, it throws in time travel as a plot device, making this installment all the more warped, yet somehow less entertaining.The plot remains simple: Agent J, with excessive mugging from Will Smith, travels back in time to 1969 to save the life of his partner Agent K ( an underused Tommy Lee Jones ), but more importantly, save the world from yet another alien invasion. Perhaps they should have save the time and money and reworked the screenplay instead.Men in Black III was plagued with many re-writes as the script was incomplete when production started. And this lack of cohesiveness shows. But, at least, this high concept blockbuster brings to its third sequel the clever concept of time travel and its most creative idea of casting Josh Brolin as Tommy Lee Jones' younger self. It is a brilliant move that pays off and elevates a film that suffers from plot lows and too many non-comedic highs.Barry Sonnenfeld, who helmed the original first film, still brings his inventive flair for direction to the series. Unfortunately, the script by Etan Cohen lacks real humor and peril. Interesting characters, like Emma Thompson's Agent O and Nicole Scherzinger as Boris the Animal's girlfriend, are introduced, dispatched, or are no longer involved with the plot mechanics. The production design by Bo Welch continue to have a creative edge, but the creatures, this time around, are not very innovative or as amusing as before. Plus, the CGI is rather unexceptional and humdrum ( as is the 3-D format ).The droll banter that was a comic staple in the previous installments is sorely missing and there are so many lost opportunities poking fun at the late sixties trends and ""vibes"" that could have made the film's reversal of time refreshing and nostalgic while it engages its movie-going audience. None of that happens.As for the acting, it's nondescript. Smith tries to be charming and hip and fails miserably. Jones seems to be walking through his role, adding no depth of character. There is absolutely no chemistry with Smith or his younger or older partner for that matter. The film's bland one-dimensional villain, Boris the Animal, played by Jemaine Clement, has no truly interesting traits, except throwing deadly stakes at intended victims and grousing in a studio- enhanced voice that reverberates too often and is merely artificial and annoying. The only two actors that come off unscathed are the aforementioned Brolin, who steals the film with his uncanny impersonation of Agent K which produces some needed laughs, and Michael Stuhlbarg who delivers some emotional heft and boyish charm as a new character named Griffin who can see the future.I suppose that Men in Black III may be a mindless diversion from some moviegoers. But, for me, it became a pointless exercise that regurgitated its formulaic sci-fi fantasy elements with no real payoff. The film ultimately disappoints and loses its own sense of originality and whimsy in this third outing.One doesn't need the memory eraser device used by the agents in Men in Black III. The film will do that very well on its own as you are immediately leaving the theater.

"Without a doubt an improvement over the second installment, which was kind of seen as the 'GHOST BUSTERS II' of the series!","'MEN IN BLACK 3': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their popular roles from the hit franchise based on the comic book of the same name. The film comes ten years after the last installment (which was a disappointment to fans and kind of seen as the 'GHOST BUSTERS II' of the series) and fifteen years after the original. Barry Sonnenfeld once again directs and Etan Cohen wrote the screenplay this time around (based on an idea by Will Smith, while filming the last film). The premise revolves around Smith's character Agent J traveling back in time to save his partner, Agent K (Jones), from an alien assassination that changes history and sets in motion catastrophic events which doom the present. Josh Brolin was geniusly added to the cast this time around as a young Agent K. The film is a little hit and miss but for the most part it works and should generally please most fans of the series.The film also casts Jemaine Clement (of 'THE FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS' fame) as it's main villain 'Boris the Animal', who is out for revenge on the man who took his arm and had him imprisoned for forty years: Agent K. After escaping his prison, on the Moon, Boris steals a time travel device that allows him to jump back in time to the day Agent K caught him (in 1969). With K now out of the way Boris is able to invade Earth with his alien race, the Boglodites, and no one is aware of K's former existence (over the last 4 decades) except Agent J. So Agent J travels back in time to stop Boris from killing K and invading Earth in the present. He teams with a young Agent K in order to do so.If you're a fan of Will Smith you'll love him here and he dominates the movie but Brolin does manage to steal his thunder with his spot-on impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones. Jones is great like always but his time is pretty limited in the film. Clement is great as the movie's villain as well and Michael Stuhlbarg (of 'A SERIOUS MAN' fame) is a scene stealer as well in a supporting role. The special effects are great and Sonnenfeld manages to keep the energy and fun going most of the time. It does get a little bogged down here and there and the script could have used multiple more rewrites but for the most part it's enjoyable. Of course it's not as memorable as the blockbuster original but it is without a doubt an improvement over the second installment. It delivers about what I expected from it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4CvTM3jrK4",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A return to fun,"After the rather soulless drag of MIB2, I wasn't expecting much from another sequel, but this grabbed me from the get go. It's occasionally clunky, especially early on, but it's just such good fun that I didn't really mind. It felt like exactly what a good sequel ought to be - character development for familiar faces, entertaining new characters, and above all recapturing the atmosphere of the original. This film did a fantastic job of telling an engaging new story, which did a good job of balancing the funny, the dramatic and the emotional, with a fine sense of ludicrous fun which paid homage to the original whilst maintaining its own independent feel. The story is not a mind-blowing narrative, but it's wacky enough to leave you satisfied, and its hilarious yet menacing antagonist drives the story to its surprisingly poignant conclusion.

Time traveling shenanigans,"First off: If they built the prison SPECIFICALLY for Boris, then why was it so damn easy for him to escape? I mean... no death-lazers on the perimeter walls? No land space mines outside? No space ships to stop him from getting back to earth? The whole premise seems to hold very little water... but OK, he escapes and makes it back to earth AND manages to remain undetected on earth long enough to do the time-traveling thing, despite the MIB (whose job it is, to locate rogue aliens on earth) actively looking for Boris, because they know he's escaped and exactly what ship he took.Anyway, despite the plot holes (there's MANY plot-holes in this one), it's still a fun movie and worth a watch, although small kids may find Boris a bit too much to handle, as he IS a pretty damn disgusting looking alien and he impales people against walls with spikes.Also, did I mention all the plot-holes?

I thought Josh Brolin did a decent job as the young Agent K and Will Smith played Agent J with his usual panache. I did feel they went for a few too many cheap laughs, but it was good to hear 'Pictures of Matchstick Men' by Status Quo in the Andy Warhol party scene.

The second movie had the setup, but it wasn't nearly as funny or active; it basically flopped.The third movie saves the day. It solves the second movie by ignoring it completely and using the same story in a better way: Agent J gets to save K again. The film also ties things up nicely and puts the original film in perspective. The villain acts a bit goofy, but is very well designed and positively scary. Brolin does a great agent K. It seemed Tommy Lee Jones had to be heavily made up in order to appear remotely interesting and his role was minimal. Even better are the introductions of interesting people in the cast: Emma Thompson as a romantic interest of K's, Jemaine Clement of Flight and the Conchords fame as the bad alien (the humans are not dead yet, Jemaine!) and lovely Alice Eve in a too tiny a role as young Agent O (and may I say what a perfect operative nickname they found for her).Bottom line: some people did not like it. I have no idea why. Probably it had to do with expectations that were set up 10 years ago and then took lives of their own. The script is subtle, but effective, the acting is good, the 1969 atmosphere is not really accurate, but it doesn't matter so much and there is real humour, not just weird aliens doing silly things. Will Smith was great in his first role in about 4 years. All in all, I liked the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Dumb fun.,"This movie is pretty good. Not as good as the previous movies, but its entertaining. Its pretty dumb, but I'd recommend it.Plot - The plot is alright. Its not a masterpiece, but if you don't think too much about the logistics of how time travel is used, it makes sense. There are a lot of good moments, but there are a lot more dumb ones. If you try to see inconstancies as jokes in of themselves, you're going to have a lot more fun than if you try to analyze this movie.Characters - The leads are the same as they were in the previous movies for the most part. There are a few good emotional moments, but most of the movie consists of them acting as a comedic duo. This movie is funny when it tries to be.Sights - Upon rewatching, I realized that this movie is shot really well. There are a lot of complex moving shots that are actually kind of impressive. This movie is full of long fluid shots and overall just looks really good. Some of the CG effects are a bit goofy, but nothing too bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What a Bummer,"I was looking forward to this film since the first one was great and the second one was OK...but this one was really boring for me. The script was slow and felt cobbled together. The movie started out pretty good but there were some moments where it really dragged and it just felt like it went nowhere. With all the good movies out there I was disappointed that I wasted my money on this one. Not even a good movie rental. They relied too much on their old jokes and didn't really offer anything new. This felt like a film where I studio was desperate for a ""safe"" blockbuster hit and so dug this off a dusty shelf and did a sequel. Poor script, bad pacing, nothing original to offer. Just watch the first one over or see a different movie, all together, rather than waste your time on this disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Did MIB 3 Insult The Chinese Community?,"After the battle scene in Chinatown, when 'J' a.k.a. Will Smith flashed his light in order to wipe out the memories of the Chinese actors, I swear I could see very clearly that there was a glow of watermark on their faces. This has never happened before with the previous 2 movies, and you don't get to see the same kind of glow on the face of other 'races' not even the aliens'! What does it mean? Does it mean that their faces were actually dirty and/or with germs and can only be detected under florescent light? The MIB franchise has a very highly supportive valuation and is very mush adored by the Asian/Chinese community since it first emerged in 1997. And if my claim is found to be true then MIB not only insulted those who have loved it but also betrayed the loyalty and trust we have invested in all the parties involved in the making of the movies.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Back in Black,"They are back to prevent Earth from alien threats once more. And once again they do it with style and fun! MEN IN BLACK 3 is a sequel of this franchising that doesn't disappoint because it has all the adventure, fun and great CGI we were used to in the previous films.In this plot there's a time travel back to 1969 what makes AGENT K to be played by a different actor almost the entire film, but Josh Brolin does a nice job playing the young AGENT K.

MIB3,"For a third movie, this one isn't terrible. It just... Feels like it suffers from threequelitis. Its still fun, quirky, weird and oddball antics flying about but it feels more fabricated, oddly polished and it lacks that perfect grime that the first two had. Beyond that, Brolin does a fine and admirable job. Really, love Brolin and he's doing everything he can here. He's not TLJ though and that absence is felt. I want that old, gruff, dry wit to bite back against Smith. I want the, ""I've seen everything you can never imagine slick, now get off my lawn"" mentality. Its still a fun movie and Clement makes for a great villain and I would absolutely watch it when its on, but I don't ever feel that urge to intentionally go back and check it out.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Was it even necessary to make another part to the dying series ?,"MIB 3 was an unnecessary follow-up to its previous parts which had entertainment material in it but was low on content.Agent J travels back in time to 1969 with help of time machine to stop a ruthless alien from killing his partner Agent J and saving the world from under attack.When I saw the trailer of MIB 3 for the first time , immediately the interest died upon me to watch the three-quel. The original part was so everlasting followed by a dead sequel 5 years later. My question was it even necessary to make another movie on MIB series ? Barry Sonenfeld ( MIB series , RV) gives you plot which is interesting but unfortunately was directed poorly. Screenplay is completely shabby followed by tacky visual effects and dialogues. However , above weaknesses are camouflaged by good performances by Tommy Lee Jones , Josh Brolin and Will Smith , in particular. I wish we had few more scenes between Smith and Jones. Will Smith as usual is superb in his comic-timings and facial expressions.Overall , a movie which was not required to made at all . But thanks to Will Smith , it can be watchable at least once .

Needs a New Direction,"A visual treat served with a modicum of hit and miss humor and predictable buddy exchanges. This is a rather inoffensive ride through the Universe of over the top aliens and thinly realized villains.The movie has enough entertainment value to be a successful entry in the Summer fun category, but is hampered by an unimaginative take on the save the world from an Alien invasion template. The otherworldly characters are typical CGI creations that have gone about as far as possible, attaining that in the first film, so what is left is a retread of retro looking rubber heads that have been around since TV's Star Trek.The story does have some welcome twists and there is some fleshing out of the Agents, but if this bit of fluff is to have any more life in the future it may need to get just a bit more serious in its fading flimsiness, and become a bit more of a ""Black Comedy"".",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
mib cash cow,i really don't understand the fact of movies cashing in from the first success. yes the first was great and the second was OK but this one could have had a better story on the plus side it had great acting by every one so it made it watchable. i have to say i was entertained with the action. i did not like the bad guy in the movie he was not tough enough last fighting scene was too short too quick. Brolin was perfect for the fact Jones acted a small part and even then it felt like some one was holding a gun to hes had to be in this film. film will entertain almost all ages but not a film i would run to a store to buy unless it is a bargain shelf,7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Again,"The third in the series now, traditionally most sequels start suffering from lack of good story, poor screenplay and lamentable acting, but not this, the original was very good, the second was a little down on that but not by much, but this is up there with the first.The storyline is a bit confusing, but it works as a film, acting ok, particularly Josh Brolin as a young K, and Jermaine Clement as Boris The Animal, Will Smith is his usual Will Smith character, the same one he plays in all his films, but is very watchable, Tommy Lee Jones by way of the story is not used as much but as usual is good. Nicole Scherzinger is deliciously stunning at the start as Boris's girlfriend, she does not say much, but looks fantastic.The 60's scenes are well made, CGI is excellent good direction and good pacing, music not as good as the first but OK.Overall it is another excellent addition to the series, well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Movie,"It is the one of my favorite movie. It is SF and comedy movie. I enjoy watching it unlike previous series. In this movie Will smith save his partner by getting back the future. Needless to say this movie makes me excited and laugh. I watched it in the theater and I couldn't help laughing from beginning to the end. However I think that this film is different from other movies which treats time travel. In other movies, when characters goes to the past, they often goes by an year unit. On the other hands, Will Smith can goes to the past by a minute unit. I think it is too convenient. I was disappointed in this point. But I like the story line. It is simple and the tempo of story is good. Also, this film has many funny scene, so everybody can enjoy it a child to a senior. If you have not seen it, you should so by all means.

Will Smith discovers Agent K's secret,"Director Barry Sonnenfeld's Men in Black 3 had some production issues throughout the years and that's why it took until last year for it to come out. Because of a stoppage and a script rewrite, the beginning, middle, and end were not really put together, but it really didn't show in the movie. The film began when an evil alien known as Boris The Animal who is played by Jemaine Clement manages to escape from a maximum security prison on the moon. Boris wants to take revenge on Agent K who is played by Tommy Lee Jones.Boris uses time travel and goes back to 1969. The year that his plans for world domination were disrupted and kills the young Agent K, leaving Agent J played by Will Smith living in a future without his longtime partner. After discovering what is going on, Agent J travels back in time himself to both stop young Agent K who is played by Josh Brolin from being murdered and save the world from Boris. This movie almost makes you think that everything happening in the movie is happening in real life. At the very least the script does give a good platform for the film's uniformly great performances.Will Smith shows that he still has plenty of spunk and chemistry left with Jones, verbal timing and physical humor. Though it's a tad gimmicky, I thought Josh Brolin did a great job using his impression of Tommy Lee Jones as the young Agent K. Josh Brolin wasn't the star of the show, Michael Stuhlbarg was the star. Playing an alien known as Griffin, a being that can see all possible time lines and variations of universes at once, Michael Stuhlbarg is a thrill to watch as he thinks out loud about what's going to happen next and worries about the most negative of outcomes.It's a wonderful performance backed with an interesting character design and the highlight of the movie. Once the movie finally travels back to the late 60s, the story actually gets interesting and is just clever enough to keep the audience's attention. As with the other films in the series, there are many mysteries hidden throughout such as Tim Burton and Yao Ming play aliens on monitors in the Men in Black headquarters, and Bill Hader plays Andy Warhol, who is just an undercover MiB agent out of ideas. This is the best movie I have seen and is going to be a classic. Just having Will Smith should make you want to watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Both help the movie along with their great comedy and a bit of action to help fill in the time. To me this is, save your money kind of movie and watch it if it's on for free.

Coming to the second half the movie went out fast and more action filled the thrill in the audiences.The concept of Apollo mission was good,though seemed somewhat foolish.The second most important thing was what agent j discovers his crux in his childhood and how the agent k was helpful to him.The whole outcome is that this movie is a onetime watch",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Special K,"I'd never seen ""Men in Black 3"" before, despite having been a reasonable fan of the first two films. My son was born around the same time so chances to go to the cinema at that point were few and far between. Because of that, I'd rather assumed that it wasn't going to be very good - particularly having seen the disappointing ""Men In Black - International"" subsequently. Actually, though it was at least the equal of the original two films.Boris The Animal (Jermaine Clement) escapes from his prison on the Moon, swearing revenge on Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). After escaping an encounter with K and J (Will Smith) Boris leaps back in time to 1969 and alters the timeline, killing a younger version of K. The only one who remembers K as a contemporary agent, J also travels back to 1969, arriving before Boris and teams up with the younger K (Josh Brolin) to save both himself and the future.It's tempting to just write, if you liked ""Men in Black"" this is more and be done with it, but I think I can do better. It's another fun and reasonably funny action comedy. The whole dynamic is slightly different to what has been before, as Agent J is alone a little more than previously and his partnership is split over two versions of K. Tommy Lee Jones isn't in the film that much, but Brolin is a fine replacement and is ably portraying a younger version of the same character.I liked the time travel aspect of the plot and enjoyed Michael Stuhlbarg character, with the ability to see all potential futures and his worries about whether a particular one is coming to fruition based on certain indicators.I don't think that this was an amazing film that I'll come back to multiple times, but neither was it the disappointment I feared.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I usually like sequels but this took it too far.,This movie annoyed me. It had none of the charm of the first nor any of its darkness or brutality or wit.You get very little Tommy Lee Jones which is a cheat and an excruciatingly derivative and mawkish time travel narrative that feels for like it's from the cartoon (which was on average much better than this).What is even with the time travel mechanics of this movie? A life for a life? Is this MiB or Merlin? And I hate that guy in the hat. Just be quiet!!Tim Curry does what he can in viciously malevolent alien but his make looks fake and we only get a small glimpse of the non-human side very close to the end.And past K is annoying .

"Decent as a Popcorn Flick, But a Poor Entry for THIS Franchise","I was never too intrigued to see ""Men in Black 3"". After hearing about all the problems during the production of the film, I wasn't too hopeful about how the final product would come out. So I skipped watching it in the theatre, and had no real plans of seeing it in the foreseeable future. The only reason I did end up seeing it was because my mom spontaneously bought it. And should I have given this movie more credit? Yes. But maybe not as much as I've heard other people give it.The whole plot of this movie is that an alien criminal named Boris escapes from prison and time travels back to 1969 to kill Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), before the Young Version of K (Josh Brolin) can shoot off 1969 Boris' arm. So J (Will Smith) travels back as well to save Young K's life and stop Old K from disappearing from the timeline. There's a whole mess of a lot more but since it's time travel, it's hard to talk about it without spoiling a lot of stuff. I know from just that it sounds very cliché and boring, but trust me it's much more interesting than just that.Now as far as acting goes, it's a sci-fi action/comedy, don't expect Oscar performances. Will Smith headlines, as always, and I don't think I can say a lot about him except its Will Smith being Will Smith. Now, Will Smith can deliver amazing performances like in ""The Pursuit of Happiness"", but when he's in a mainstream comedic action blockbuster, you know what you're going to get from him.Now Josh Brolin plays the young Agent K. All I can say is that Josh Brolin as young Tommy Lee Jones is the equivalent of Joseph-Gordon Levitt as young Bruce Willis in ""Looper"". If imitation is a form of flattery, then Tommy Lee Jones is the most complimented guy in the world. Brolin not only nails Jones as K, but Jones overall, throughout his entire acting career. He reflects Jones back in like the 90's where he was taking serious, but not too serious roles where he could be occasionally really funny and Brolin revisits that. It's so cool that even though Tommy Lee Jones is in this one for a total of about 8 minutes, you feel like he's still there the whole time and you're not mad he got cut.The special effects are a little bit more polished than the previous movies, but they still end up looking pretty bad and cheesy. Now some of it works because of the 1969 setting and I'm willing to just fool myself into thinking they're trying to pull the whole nostalgic throwback that ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" did with its alien and the 1950's setting. I know that's not at all what 'MiB 3' was going for, but I'll convince myself that they were so that I don't just write the effects off.Now while it's not as apparent as I thought it would be, you can still see the slapdash way it was reported that the script was put together. Throughout this movie you watch all the characters go to a ton of places and through so many situations, it feels like they came up with a bunch of random scenes and just said ""Ok, take these 12 and make a movie out of it"". It doesn't feel like there's any reason for some of these except to remind you it takes place in 1969 and the pace of the story once they get to 1969 feels so weird, there just doesn't feel like there's much cohesiveness. It feels so cut and paste, it honestly detracted a lot of the fun from the movie. While some of these scenes are funny, their reasons for being in this film feel non-existent.Now the tone of this film is so, (forgive the pun), alien to this franchise that it feels like a brand new movie. The first two films have a steady tone, but this one feels like it's trying too hard to fit into a new generation, it's almost like the film has forgotten its fan base. I didn't feel like I was watching a new ""Men in Black"" movie, I felt like I was watching some awkward reboot with the same actors being used just to bring the fans of the original to see this new one while the filmmakers seemed to want the fans to forget the old movies. This movie's target audience is not the fans of the original movies, it's just the mass general public, and that really bugs me with franchises that have had a certain fanbase in the past.Overall, ""Men in Black 3"" is very enjoyable with an imitation performance that matches Joseph-Gordon Levitt's in ""Looper"", some fun moments and classic time travel mind games, but it's definitely not the strongest in the franchise. It's sadly obvious that the script was slapped together, the tone is completely off from the old movies, and it abandons its fans and tries way too hard to appeal to the general public. I'd say it's worth a rental and if you do like it, don't buy it for more than $10 on DVD. Paying the extra few dollars for the Blu-Ray is not worth it.

A Step Above Mediocre,"So the men in black are back and as vigilant as ever in their quest to maintain order among Earth's secret population of extraterrestrial beings. Only this time we're going back to 1969 to stop our villain Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement) from killing Agent K in the past and from destroying Earth in the present.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones fill their usual roles as Agent J and Agent K, respectively. However, this film sees the addition of Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men, W., Milk, etc.) as the younger Agent K in 1969. Brolin is brilliant in his role as the younger Agent K, and he picks up Tommy Lee Jones' characteristics very well, almost making it look too easy. However, for some reason I just felt like with Tommy Lee being an official senior citizen these days, his character should have looked considerably younger than what Brolin was able to portray for the 1969 scenes. Based on Tommy Lee's age, if I do my math right, that means Agent K would have been around 23 years old in 1969. Brolin at 44 years old, is much too old to play Agent K in 1969. That's a huge age difference that can't be overlooked. Otherwise, Brolin did an excellent job.As usual in this franchise, the aliens are overly exaggerated and the special effects are comical, but the plot is decent enough and Smith and Brolin have great chemistry. There's also a touching plot twist near the end, if not highly unlikely.I hear there is another sequel in the works. If so, I think Brolin should take over for Tommy Lee Jones... Maybe taking place sometime in the late '80s or early '90s, a time period more age-appropriate for Brolin as Agent K. He looks great in this role and maybe it's time for a fresh start. Hey, we could even get Jaden to take over for Will... Well, maybe not.Anyway, I'm not a big fan of the franchise but I did like this installment. It's worth a look.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
1960's Agent K is about the only thing this movie has going for it.,"MIB 3 is not very good. The humour is missing. Tommy Lee is not in it enough and when he is in it I feel he doesn't want to be. It is not a bad movie just not a good one. Will Smith is the same old wisecracking fool but lately I feel Will Smith is not enjoying acting. A lot of his movies rely on that wisecracking youngster but he's just not that guy anymore. Will Smith is a different person and you can see he tries his best to get into the ""Hell No"" thang but his heart is just not in it and it rings hollow. The best actors were Griff and 1960's Agent K.The general idea is good. Go back in time to save the day. The goofy looking aliens are still there but it doesn't work. The action scenes don't add up, there is no drama or tension at any point and the humour is hollow. And really there is only a single gadget.The charm of the MIB 1 was the fish out of water element. The surly Agent K and the continuously amazed Agent J playing off each other in a kind of buddy movie. In this kind of movie you need to see someone experiencing the magic for the first time and you need to have two good buddies.As it stands it's not bad. It is a monied film with high production values and it does stay true to it's own aesthetic but it loses the heart. It loses the buddy thing and it loses the wonder of discovery.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Review - Men in Black III,"It's been fifteen years since the entertaining first Men in Black film, and ten years since the flawed yet still slightly enjoyable sequel Men in Black II. Now comes the third installment in the series, Men in Black III. Of course, this sequel, like any sequel of this kind, especially having been made a decade after its last predecessor, gave me a few doubts before watching it. However, I finally saw it in the theater today, and I enjoyed it. Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) have returned to the screen, and they deliver some nice and witty entertainment.The film starts out on a prison on the moon, called Lunarmax (which is next to the original lander and American flag from the Apollo mission), from which the antagonist, Boris the Animal, escapes. In 1969, Boris encountered Agent K, who shot his arm off and had him arrested, and also set up some sort of defense system to protect the earth from any invasions by Boris' alien race. Boris, having escaped from prison, travels back in time to this incident and kills K, altering the MIB agency and putting earth in danger (the protection system no longer exists - Boris stopped it from getting set up in the past). So now, in the present, Agent J must travel back in time to prevent Boris from causing all this and restore the real timeline. There's more to the story, but I won't spoil it.Luckily, Men in Black III isn't just a typical modern generic blockbuster. I even had a feeling that the movie was going to try and skate by with great effects but a thin story, but luckily it didn't. Yes, it is a blockbuster, but it does retain the imaginatively and wit of the original Men in Black. The movie has a lot of the tone that the original MIB films had, and some things haven't changed, and a lot of things have. For example, the character Zed has recently died, and female Agent O has taken his place. Even Danny Elfman's music is a bit different, although it does retain the main themes of the series. The special effects are better than ever, and we even have a few new things of technology, such as interesting and awesome single-wheeled vehicles (as seen in the still above), and (obviously) the time travel technology. And best of all are the characters and their relationships and interaction, which is where the real magic, and humor, of the movie is. In his journey in this movie, J meets the younger K of 1969 (played by Josh Brolin). Another character that I like is Griff, an alien who is able to see 4-dimensionally, and can see the many possible timelines that the future can follow. We even have a brief scene at the end of the film that adds a new and somewhat emotional dimension to the relationship of J and K, but I won't spoil it.Like I said in my review of The Avengers, I'm now going to the theater more often. I started of my summer with The Avengers, and now I've seen my second film for this summer. Men in Black III does have a few flaws, but they're not worth discussing, and they really didn't bother me. The 106 running length of the movie pretty much flew by. The film is not great or anything (it's definitely only a three-star film, in my opinion), it's only okay, but it's pretty entertaining. Performances are good, and the actors really bring out their characters. Danny Elfman's music score is good. And, like I said before, the special effects are great, and they contribute effectively to the story and the film overall. The technology in the film is nice, and the aliens and monsters, especially the villain, were well designed and excellently goofy and bizarre, like they're supposed to be. And yes the film is a comedy, and it lives up to that name - the humor is good and smart. As for the time travel, it's not completely accurate, but that's typical in this movie, and it can be forgiven because of it's wit and likable characters, among other things. This sequel is unnecessary, yes, and it could have been disappointing, but luckily it wasn't.It may sound like I loved the movie, but I didn't. I just though it was okay. But still, it's funny, goofy, entertaining, witty, and, in my opinion, just as good as the first Men in Black movie. I'm glad I saw it in the theater.My Rating: *** (out of ****)For more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A fair to middling effort,"Men in Black burst onto the big screen in 1997, with a catchy title song by star Will Smith at the height of his fame, it was a huge hit.Five years later in 2002, the magic had dissipated with a lacklustre sequel that received lukewarm critical reception but still did well at the box office.Jump forward another ten years, we have a belated possible final instalment in the trilogy. After a troubled and delayed shoot, is the magic still there and using simple multiplication, will MIB 4 arrive in 2032.Will Smith returns as Agent J, it has been a while since we have seen Smith on the big screen. Joining him of course, is Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), grumpy, uncommunicative and not on the screen for long. Emma Thompson takes over from the missing Rip Torn, again almost a cameo due to the way the story pans out.In case popular culture is not quite popular enough, a quick recap. MIB are the secret team tasked with defending the earth from the ever present Alien presence on Earth. The general populace know nothing of this, if they witness any event their minds are wiped and implanted with new memories, using a cool neuralyzer.The sharp suits are back, the RayBan's are there but Director Barry Sonnefield has decided to keep Smith and Jones apart by creating a time travel story. This introduces Josh Brolin as a young Agent K back in 1969, complete with a very passable Jones voice impression.The story centres around ""Boris The Animal"" (Jermain Clement), a character so bad they built a prison on the Moon to house him. Clement (Flight of the Conchords) is almost unrecognizable in extensive make up, heavily augmented with very effective CGI. Despite the animals and creatures being first class, not that all the effects works well, several scenes appearing somewhat false.Whilst enjoyable enough, the film feels like a connection of adequate scenes stitched together without combining as a seamless story. Later scenes are saved with the introduction of a great character ""Griffin"" (Stuhlbarg), able to see endless permutations of the future.The film flags at times and Jones does not appear fully engaged, although he has only a limited screen-time to impress. Will Smith does his thing, again his heart does not seem to be fully in it, although he does get to play a couple of good gags against the racial stereotyping of the day. Brolin has fun playing the younger Jones, whether such a radical deviation from the partnership was really necessary to bring a fresh approach to the franchise, remains debatable.The story wraps up in an unexpected and rather touching way, indicating perhaps that the franchise has no more gas in the tank. The Studio might be wise to stop at this point but with a worldwide box office take of over $600 million, there will be many reasons to continue.SummaryA fair to middling effort, not a patch on the original which it could never hope to match. Fun in parts, weak in others but colourful and designed to offend no one.If you enjoyed the previous films, this will do for now as a reasonable couple of hours entertainmenthttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Love It!,"I really enjoyed this film. The first thing that came to me, was it brought me back to my childhood. I am 19 now, and a visual effects student, and i noticed the old things, like ""oh! they used the same font!"" and me and my friend sitting there singing the theme tune.If you loved the first two you will certainly love this one, as its a blast from the past, but mixed with the new technology makes it a great viewing in my opinion. I think it was great to learn all about Kay this time, and find out why he is his sinister self, and it brings back your love for all the characters.I thought the VFX were particularly good, which gave this film more aesthetically pleasing look compared to the previous ones which obviously, technology has advance to help them improve. I personally don't have any faults with it, though i think maybe i would pick up on something when i see it again, but the non stop action of it just, for me, keeps you engaged so well, that if there are any slip ups or faults, you don't really see it straight away. I feel that this film, was particularly great in 3D. Sometimes i feel films don't need 3D like Harry Potter was just pointless ""oh that tree is moving"" but for this i thought it really made the viewing experience better and brought the feeling you should get, that you're about to get a spike through your face! Although i was surprised that it was a PG, but i guess with the alien fiction nature its fine!A Great family film, and a very good revival!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Much better than expected.,"I was watching various site ratings on this film since the beginning of the week wondering how it would be received by the critical movie base, and was surprised when it jumped from 40 to 140 reviews that were positive. I did not read them, but it did change my mind about going to see it, and I must admit it certainly helped the franchise dig out of the rut it was in when MIB 2 came out. What a flop that was! That one is NOT in my movie collection.I have to preface this with the usual movie experience. I have stated previously that I am not a huge fan of 3D... most of them remind me of those halo-postcards and knee deep in lackluster. So I bought tickets to the 2D showing. Entering the theater, the sound was that of previews but there was nothing on the screen. Sat down and munched some popcorn and waited. Every now and then there was a flash of light but eventually, one by one, people left the audience to complain. I would normally do this, but seeing the amount of people who left I felt my complaint would have been useless. At last I heard someone down the hall say ""The projector has a burnt out bulb and will take about 10 minutes to replace. For those that would like not to wait, we will let you into the viewing of the 3D showing and give you all the glasses at no charge"". Looks like I would be seeing this in 3D anyways, and as I suspected... putting on the glasses really made things less clear and darker.To start off, there was a real familiarity for the movie. It was all comfortable. Characters we knew; aliens we were familiar with; even the look and feel of the camera and music was all Men In Black (which Bill Pope, from Matrix trilogy, Spiderman fame, Steven Spielberg and Danny Elfman from the original movie), the story started out with new character development that made this sequel at home. Yes, the characters have aged... almost to the point where you want to say ""ENOUGH! PLEASE RETIRE OR DO SOMETHING MORE YOUR AGE"". It is OK though, the movie was crafted around the character ages... cept maybe Will Smith needs to move on from action films. The movie makes it plain that it was already many years since their last screen presentation. It is believable in the fiction it is portrayed in. The wit was there. The characters where there. And the plot was there, so lets continue with the fun.Yes, K and J have gone on in their years. Yes, they keep aliens in their place but it is obvious that there is (as with all convicted criminals, galactic or native) some criminals can not just let things go by without payback. If I say ""time travel"", I would be giving away a lot, but we have seen time travel before and it is not new. Star Trek, Time Machine, yadda yadda have all played with this and most times messing around with timelines and parallel dimensions is never a safe thing unless you have really nothing to loose. Right? I mean, what does a criminal have to loose that will never have parole? Specially if that alien lives for enormous lifespans? It gets messy, needless to say, and life as we know it once again becomes a key pin the the events that follow in this movie.Josh Brolin play a young Kay, and he sure did a good study on Tommy Lee's character even down to the inflections of the voice. It was entertaining. Young Kay was more human, sociable and open than his elder counterpart. What happens to make the older Kay and the younger Kay is really what this movie is about. I didn't find the FX all that new. Actually, I felt the 3D portage was lacking and not necessary. I wish I could have seen it in 2D to be honest. With all the banter, action and blocking, this sequel plays more along its original roots as the first movie than the second, plus you will be smiling when you come to the ending scenes. It makes all the difference in the world.I'm glad there were no kids in the audience, but it is tamer than most scifi flicks. You really should plan this viewing as an adult tho, it leaves you free to enjoy it as it should. B",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Exciting and entertaining, with nice reconstruction of 60's","J and K return to another adventure—this time with time travel involved. This sequel keeps some of the same energy that characterized its prequels and adds a bit of color by being partially set in the 60's.Yes, there is time paradoxes. And yes, there are some plot holes / points where the main villain, Boris the Animal, doesn't act particularly smart and you're wondering about his actions. But all in all the story works and adds some depth to the relationship between J and K, as well as quite some nice revelations towards the end that round up the whole Men in Black trilogy.Special effects are o.k. to good (sometimes the CGI looks very CGI) and the action is entertaining. All in all a successful follow up to the prequels.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just one word... Disappointed,"I am a huge fan of spielberg's alien invasion movies..and Men in black series is my fav. But this sequel fails to deliver in every possible way. No only the story line is crap and hopeless, the dialogues are also vague and unnatural. I mean, considering the two awesome parts of this movie, i went in the hall with huge amount of expectations but MIB 3 turned out to be a huge low-blow.A nutshell- start was a bit good, but what happened to the story writers. MIB franchise is well known for its messy and ugly creatures from outer space. Those were no where to be seen. We love the chemistry of Agent J & K, not the chemistry between Agent J & young agent K. small role of Tommy lee also added to the negative points. The story line along with the dialogues were also not hilarious at all- at least for me they weren't. All & all i was very sad when i came out of the screening. Thumbs down to this sequel of MIB.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fun followup to a series that has a firm spot in my childhood even if Will Smith is turning into a grump.,"I was always a big fan of the Men In Black series when I was a kid, the first film was already on auto-repeat before the second film came out and then that swiftly joined the rotation. It's been a while now and revisiting them recently shows how they reach a much bigger scale than they are clearly shot on, which is impressive, but they are nostalgic. This belated sequel is definitely just as entertaining, even if it's hit and miss and sometimes on the fence. The hits are definitely Josh Brolin, who's predictably fantastic as a young Tommy Lee Jones and a surprise character of which they really should've marketed it more heavily on as it's rare on a blockbuster this scale that I care for a character based on cute reasons (and by care, I mean, don't want him to die yet). This character being an ageless alien played by Michael Stuhlberg called Griffin, who's reminiscent of Robin Williams particularly his eccentric role in The Fisher King, who sees the future in two possible timelines. It wasn't exactly original, but it was approached in exactly the right way to give the film some heart. As always, the score by Danny Elfman brings it together in a truly cinematic package and the visuals are mostly good, the makeup being better the special effects. I'm glad I saw it in 2D as the 3D trailers did not convince me at all. A definite visual improvement on the second film too, which can't patch up its cheapness.The things that missed for me, although it did work eventually as a role reversal, now both Agents J and K are equally disgruntled, which reminded me of the aggression in mainstream ""R rated"" comedies since The Hangover, in which all the characters are needlessly vicious and not intended for character development. It was hard to watch their relationship until Griffin came in, filling in the role J used to fill, but in a completely different way. The villain was also incredibly unconvincing. Boris The Animal, played by Jemaine Clement, which was unnecessary casting, is a mesh of all these horrific ideas that refuse to gel together coming off awkward and excessive, with his features severely lacking purpose to bring it together. Many of the scenes themselves were hit and miss themselves, with some great sequences of very efficient jokes but also cringe-worthy misses, particularly a scene featuring Bill Hader as Andy Warhol. The time travel comes off as very contrived, and there's a ridiculous amount of plot holes here there and everywhere, but it's not worth thinking about too hard, but it's the sentimental twist ending that I'm truly on the fence about. While it did trigger something emotionally with me, it just didn't ring as true, perhaps I'll have to see if it's part of the canon or just tacked on. They really should establish that. Either way, it was an entertaining film and that's all it needed to be.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fun second sequel to the 1997 classic,"MIB3 is a fun second sequel to Barry Sonnenfield's classic 1997 comedy about a secret government agency that handles all things extraterrestrial. In this installment one of Agent K's (Tommy Lee Jones) past enemies, Boris The Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes his lunar prison and goes back in time to eliminate K's existence and stop the deployment of an Earth defense shield. Now that K's is been wiped from the timeline and Earth open to attack, Agent J (Will Smith) has to travel back to 1969 and stop Boris and return K and the timeline back to it's order. And to do this he needs help from the 1969 version of K (Josh Brolin). While it lacks the magic of the original MIB, part 3 is a lot more entertaining then the forgettable part 2 and it's fun to see the team back in action after 10 years. The film is obviously not perfect. The villain is a bit bland, there are a few slow spots and the plot does keep Smith and Jones apart for a good portion of the film. In fact Jones' part is almost an extended cameo with Brolin, who is very good as the young K, getting most of the screen time. But, there is a lot of fun to be had and the cast, also including Emma Thompson as new boss ""O"" and Alice Eve as her younger version, all have a good time and Will Smith even gives J more of an air of now being a veteran in the organization then the rookie we last saw. The FX are top notch and Danny Elfman returns to scoring duties as Sonnenfield returns to the director's chair. Not a classic like the original but, a fun enjoyable sequel that makes one forget the misstep that was MIB2.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just as good or better than the first one,"(2012) Men In Black III
SCIENCE FICTION ACTION COMEDYThird ""Men In Black"" film Starring Will Smith as Agent J who has to travel back in time in the year of 1969 to save the existence of his partner Agent K played by Tommy Lee Jones who was eliminated by a time travelling device operated by a dangerous alien criminal called Boris The Animal played by Jemaine Clement. And upon going back in time, he meets a younger version of Agent K played by Josh Brolin acting in Tommy Lee Jones expense as they both become accustomed with one another as partners. Now, even though I don't quite remember any of the other Men In Black movies except that they're agents with a purpose to eliminate criminal behavior among the aliens who coincide with the planet of earth, I can safely say that this film still holds well enough on it's own without the other ones even watched first. I mean, one of my brothers even have less time to watch movies than I do, who barely even remembered seeing ""Tokyo Drift"" which is the only one he's seen and he's still able to enjoy ""Fast And Furious 6"" for what it is, even though he didn't see ""Fast Five"" or the very first one which I still think is the best one of the series so far. A percentage of the film's tone itself is identical to what one can see from a ""Spy Kids"" movie where the CGI is applied around the actors all the time whenever they use fathom futuristic devices. And there's also some funny laughs too, except that many action scenes are way too over the top even though they're CGI it is still reminiscent of the crazy and over the top Spy Kids films except that this one is balanced with some real unexpected genuine moments toward the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My favorite of the series. Still a good family comedy but felt more adult and I enjoyed that more. Worth watching. I say B+,"""There's no other way for this to work. K has to be the one to go. K is the only one who can save the world."" Agent J (Smith) and K (Jones) are back and saving the world from aliens. When an old alien criminal that K arrested escapes from prison then goes back in time and kills K Agent J must return to 1969 and save K or else face the end of the world. I will start by saying that I did like the other two movies but was never a huge fan of the series. When I first heard about this third movie my first though was...why...doesn't seem like a new one is needed. After watching this I have to say that this may be my favorite in the series. While the others were OK this one seemed to have a real plot and felt more grown up then the others. There is still quite a bit of comedy and kids will still enjoy this but the overall feel was more adult based and I think that really helped me enjoy this one more. Overall, this is still a good family comedy but will appeal to adults more then the other two did at least I did. I give it a B+.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Better The Second Time Around,"I watched MIB 3 for the second time today and it was well worth the second chance for this movie. I never got to see it in 3D, but I'm not really sure that would be better or worse. The special effects are all good. I had previously rated this at 7 stars, but upgraded it this time to 9. Josh Brolin did a great job as the young Kay and Tommy Lee Jones as always came through with an excellent performance. Will Smith carries the movie, of course, doing Jay at his best. Don't believe any of the negative reviews (professional reviewers or others on IMDb). Make up your own mind about this one, and keep an open mind about time travel and all of its problems.

"I was not expecting much, so this MIB was a pleasant surprise","I had heard nothing of this film except negativity, so I did not rush out to see this film in theaters like I had the previous two films. I was not really crazy about part II anyway, so I figured this one would be more of the same. So I finally got around to viewing this film, and suffice to say it was actually pretty good...better than part II. I am a bit puzzled as to why this film did create such bad buzz, I mean if people enjoyed part II, this one should have been a blast. Will Smith is back as is Tommy Lee Jones. There are a few other originals from the previous films, though absent in this one is Rip Torn, who was having a spot of legal trouble at the time this film was being made.The story has J and K doing their normal routine. Only something seems to be up with K, something on his mind...especially when an alien escapes from a maximum security prison on the moon. This alien, known as Boris, has a plan to not only destroy the earth, but also get revenge on the man responsible for stopping him in the past and taking his arm, agent K. J will have to go back into the past to assist his MIB partner, as K's younger self will not only have to take on the Boris of the past, but also that of the future.Tommy Lee Jones is not really in the film all that much...he kind of bookends the film. However, Josh Brolin does a very good job of imitating a younger K. Will is his usual self and puts in a pretty good performance, honestly he just has not done much in the last 5 or six years. There are a few sight gags that refer to characters who are not present and a few from the earlier installments who make brief cameos.So, while not as good as the first film, it was better than the second film and seemed to carry a bit more weight than the previous film too. There was a bit more interplay between J and K and it helped this film along. It is a shame this film was so poorly received, I cannot foresee there being another film. This one had a huge budget, so while it did not do bad by 1990's standards, it did not work well for today. However, if it is the last film...it ended on a rather good note.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Nothing Special, But A Huge Step-Up From The 2nd Film","While it's still nowhere on the same level of the first film, Men In Black III is a huge step up from the second film and works good as a fun popcorn flick.Will Smith does a good job reprising his role as Agent J, but who really shines is Josh Brolin playing the role of a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones character Agent K. The story here is not anything we haven't seen done before, but it actually works for the most part and the film is entertaining enough to keep your attention for most of the runtime. While there are some very funny moments in the movie, there's also a lot of moments where the humor just falls flat and feels very outdated. The villain in the film also had a lot of potential, but seemed like he was just wasted in the end. The film has a good start and really picks up once the time traveling aspect comes into the film, although there are some parts in the middle of the film where it really drags. I did really enjoy the ending to the film though as it had a really good and heartfelt twist that I thought was a nice way to wrap up the trilogy and was a good payoff.Overall, Men In Black III isn't a great film or even a memorable one. But, it's fun and works as a popcorn flick and it's worth seeing if you are a fan of the first two films.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Brolin is brilliant, Smith.. not so much","Brolin could've been nominated for an Oscar for his turn as a young Agent Kay. On the other hand, Smith made me wish that had cast Jay Pharoah as a younger version of Agent Jay, 'cause at least Pharoah is funny. The '69 Mets tie-in was great also.

With bopping tunes from the Smith Meister, this movie will chill out the most stoic fan and provides that ultimate feel good chill out movie. Griffin, our new found hero is an amazing addition and I felt enchanted watching him. The story line was a tad unconventional which added to the effect that MIB movies always have, managing to surprise you again and again with random facts (or are they?) action packed fighting and hilarious hilarity!

"""Where there is death, there is death no matter what""","MIB3 lived up to the expectations of what MIB is all about. Aliens galore, this time with antagonizing Boris the Animal reeking havoc all over the place, and action packed sequences cut with just the right amount of comic relief really is what MIB is all about, right? Throwing the time traveling in to find out Agent K's dirty little secret adds more excitement to the mix. Agent J travels back in time in this movie only to run into a young Agent K and Agent J try to erase the damage that Boris the Animal cause in 1969, only to be sabotaged in every way possible along the way. Great graphics, great plot line, great acting as usual. There are no better two actors that can play off of each other like Jones and Smith do. After the first two smash hits that were out of this world, MIB3 leaves us with what could be the most shocking ending of all the films. With all that being said I personally believe this series is beginning to lose steam with this installment and should hang it up while it's ahead.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Closer to Men in Black 2 than Men in Black,"Ten years after the disappointing Men in Black 2 and fifteen (really!) years since Men in Black, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are donning the black suits and Ray-bans once again. Agent J (Smith) and Agent K (Jones) learn that the alien murdering Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement) has escaped his maximum security LunarMax prison cell on the Moon, 43 years after K arrested him in Florida. Boris gets hold of a time machine and goes back to 1969 where he murders K. J has trouble understanding what has happened and goes back to 1969 himself where he meets a younger K (Josh Brolin) and the two of them attempt to apprehend Boris before he kills K and sends an army to attack and destroy the Earth.I'm a big fan of the first Men in Black film and will watch pretty much anything Will Smith is in so I was excited at the prospect of a third instalment of the franchise. Unfortunately I left disappointed. Quality wise this is much closer to Men in Black 2 than Men in Black. My two main problems were that it wasn't funny enough and that it was really boring. Will Smith is a naturally funny man and has bags of charisma but here his jokes fall flat and he doesn't seem cool enough. Jermaine Clement, who I travelled over 400 miles round trip to see perform as part of Flight of the Concords was also a little bit disappointing although his accent was very good he was neither funny or scary enough. I only laughed twice and these were both at jokes regarding the differing racial attitudes of the 60s and now. As for the story, yes there are alien bad guys and the threat of the Earth's destruction and the time travelling stuff was good but I wasn't gripped.Where the film is successful is with the addition of Josh Brolin. He does a fantastic Tommy Lee Jones impression, getting the voice and mannerisms down to a tee. He injects a bit of life into the story as his K is slightly (very slightly) more at ease than Jones's incarnation. I also thought that the character called Griffin played by Michael Stuhlbarg was brilliant and I'd happily have sat through a whole film about him. Also, as I said the time travelling stuff was good and they managed to avoid either making it too complicated or full of holes. If anything it was all a bit simplified and too spelt out. Another thing I appreciated is that the film didn't go over board in its 1960ness. It didn't bombard you with jokes and characters and felt much more natural.The CGI is very good although I felt that it was relied on a bit too heavily. I've always though that Men in Black is at its best when its human characters were on screen and sometimes it felt like they were looking for excuses to show off their CGI aliens. Another disappointment is getting to the closing credits and discovering that Smith isn't rapping. Instead it's someone called Pitbull with a terrible song.In the end there isn't enough in Men in Black 3 to warrant a sequel and it doesn't come close to matching the original. The action is slow and dull and there are very few laughs but there are some good performances, especially from Brolin and Stuhlbarg and it's nice to see J and K back again. That being said, I don't think there is a need for Men in Black 4.www.attheback.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Men In Black III Carries On With The Fun,"I really did enjoy this film equally as much as the first two. Good plot line and there were only a few exceptions I would have liked to have seen. Emma Thompson was fine as Agent O, and the story line with her involved was a good one, but I did miss Rip Torn. He made such a cool curmudgeonly commander. If Agent Frank, the dog, was in there, I must have missed him in the excitement. Since he became one of my favorite characters previously, I was hoping to see him in this one. Josh Brolin was completely phenomenal as the young Agent K. Unbelievable how much like Tommy Lee Jones he came across. And I adored Michael Stuhlbarq as Griffin. What a cutie! Altogether it was a fun film experience and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone who liked the first two in the series. This one won't disappoint. It didn't me.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An Imperfect but Appealing Movie,"This movie needed some work. It should have spent more time with Borris the Animal, gone more in depth with the '69 culture, J & His early love interests' relationship and a little bit more with Will and Josh's relationship. More work should have taken place on the jokes that took place during the early part of the film as well (they weren't bad, just not exactly laugh out loud material.) This film should've been a little bit longer. having said that, I still found this film rather enjoyable and like most people I really enjoyed Josh Brolin's performance. This is a good movie (barely) and not an excellent one. It is possible that one will forget about this movie not too long after seeing it.P.S.

I laughed so much when Josh Brolin first started speaking, he nailed the voice and facial expressions.I loved the idea of time travel and seeing aliens in the past, and Bill Hader made a hilarious portrayal of Andy Warhol.Men in Black 3 has a solid & clever plot and a lot of great special effects.

Will Smith doesn't look that convincing either The insults to late 60s idealism are cheap and unfair. The whole thing reeks of a cheap attempt to make a few more bucks out of the franchise. The time-travel thing is a bit of a cliché. Shame really because TLJ and WS have good chemistry. They need a fresh scriptwriter.

a one time watch......,"Maybe it does not have the best action sequences in the world, nor possibly a great story line, but that doesn't mean that Men In Black 3 isn't worth watching.Men In Black 3 packs a delightful punch down the pleasure nerve, with quite a few rib-tickling movements and weirdo aliens that are the movie franchise's trademark. Though, I must admit that this movie rides on the back of Will Smith only. No one, in the whole wide Hollywood, would come close enough to Mr. Smith when it comes to smart ass dialogues and 'Hey- mister-I-can-be-sarcastic-as-well-as-humorous-at-the-same-time' attitude.Be it I Robot, Independence Day or Men In Black.The storyline is not quite upto the mark. Plus, there is hardly any surprise element in the movie except at the very last. The Aliens are indeed weird and all god-awesome strange, but they are sparse. The last fight, just moments before launch of Apollo 11 with Neil Armstrong jet- setting himself for 'the giant leap', was short.In short, the movie had little activity. But this is not to say that the movie wasn't gripping. Though more activity would have been a vital shot in the arm, the movie wasn't slack. It was a steady paced movie, could possibly have been tout, but it wasn't lumbering- of course mainly due to Will Smith.I must say that Tommy Lee Jones as 'Agent K' had interesting past.The villain 'BORIS ANIMAL' was grotesque. That spider-in-the-hands- throwing-darts was awesome. Man, this guy had huge potential to wreck havoc. But unfortunately, they didn't use him in the same manner as they utilized the 'cockroach man' in the first movie.The 3-D experience was great. Overall it was a good movie.But instead of being eccentrically awesome, it was quite balmy.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Not at all bad for the third in a series!,"When MIB first came out, the premise was brilliant, funny and really different. Usually second and third installments don't live up to the expectation of the first film and in this instance that is still the case, but only by a short way. This, as a third outing for the MIB duo, lived up to the trailers and is one of the best sequels I've seen for a long time. It's not as good as the first one, sure, but isn't at all bad. The jokes aren't so funny, or new, and Will Smith isn't as ""Will Smith"" as usual but the content of the story makes up for that.This is about time travel, which I always like. The SFX were excellent - especially all the different aliens - and the homages/references to famous people always make me laugh. Did you know all models are from the planet Glamouria? Anyway, I digress. Time travel. It's about time travel and that part of the action is cleverly done. I liked how there was more heart and soul to this one, and we learn a little about Agent K. Emma Thompson was rather good, but I think my favourite character was the charming and cute Griffin, played by Michael Stuhlbarg, as an alien who sees many future permutations all at the same time. I think he brought the comedy to the film instead of Mr Smith! I don't know whether this is the last one that is being done, but if it is it ends well. There is scope for another one, of course, but I think it's a little tired now. The jokes and the patter has been done and there was little that was new, particularly. Yes I enjoyed it, and would even see it again but it's not brilliant but certainly a good evening's entertainment. Now, where is Bad Boys III?",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Well Worth the Wait.  Kudos,"The MIB team is again in the process of saving the earth from alien invasion, but this time Agent J (Will Smith) needs to go back in time - 1969 - to prevent Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) from being assassinated by Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement).This was definitely worth the wait. We see excellent CGI with aliens interacting nice with each other and with humans, but we also see the bad CGI aliens fighting with humans; There were good acting performances all around, and a lot of comedy within smart dialogue.A nice touch in the beginning was when there was a moment of silence and a sort of (read: really bad) eulogy by Agent K for the former head of MIB, Zed (Rip Torn), who had passed away. Zed's replacement is Agent O (Emma Thompson). We are not sure why Rip Torn was not in this movie.A younger Agent K - back in 1969 - is played by Josh Brolin who steals the show, and nails Tommy Lee Jones' voice and cadence. That combination helps put this MIB (better than MIB 2 and on a par with the first MIB) over the top. Kudos.Now for the question you may have: why didn't Agent J see himself when he went back to 1969. Well, that was 43-yrs ago and Agent J was either a kid or wasn't born yet. See?We get a good script, plausible story, some good comedic lines, as well as some philosophical discussion when Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarj) comes on the scene with his predictions of what is about to happen. Griffin lives in all 5-dimensions and sees all possibilities and the outcomes of all realities (Yes, he has that Robins Williams look about him). He can transcend time as he appears in 1969 and in the present. We may learn more about him in future MIBs. BTW: when is the next one?Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Soft stuff and not much of it.Rating: A",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Third time's a . . . nother movie,"Josh Brolin.It really all comes down to him; he's the reason to give this movie a shot as well as a future rewatch. His is a note-perfect impression of Tommy Lee Jones that really sells the younger version of K and there's a winking charm in every line he delivers.Outside of that, ""Men in Black 3"" is a decent way to round out this series; doesn't have the corporate-mandated sequel feel as the last movie but also never reaches the comedic heights of the first one.Will Smith is always excellent in this role, and J & K feel like space cops again, but the film just seems to bound from one CGI joke to the next.

Very boring and nowhere near funny enough.,Didn't enjoy this one bit. Very middle of the road with not enough aliens and effects in it for my liking very dull I couldn't even begin to imagine what the 3d version must've played out like there weren't many scenes that I thought 3d would come into play. Give this a miss and wait for the DVD - waste of time and money 1 out of 10. I think men in blacks time has ran its coarse. Will smith wasn't stretched at all in this film he is a lot more talented than what this film allows and he should turn down any follow up to this franchise even though he won't ! Probably should have gone seen Prometheus instead. This is as far away from men in black 1 as you can get. Rubbish.,1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Worthy and Entertaining Return,"Men in Black 3, directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, is a refreshing and highly entertaining addition to the beloved sci-fi franchise. Released a decade after its predecessor, this third installment successfully recaptures the charm and humour that made the original film a hit.The movie follows Agent J as he travels back in time to 1969 to prevent the assassination of his partner, Agent K, by an alien criminal named Boris the Animal. The time-travel element adds a dynamic twist to the storyline, injecting new life into the series and providing an intriguing backdrop for the film's events.Josh Brolin's portrayal of the younger Agent K is nothing short of brilliant. He seamlessly channels Tommy Lee Jones, capturing his mannerisms and stoic demeanor while adding a fresh dimension to the character. The chemistry between Brolin and Smith is a highlight, bringing depth and emotional resonance to their partnership.The film's production design and special effects are top-notch, blending 1960s aesthetics with futuristic technology. The attention to detail in recreating the era is impressive, enhancing the immersion and believability of the time-travel premise. Danny Elfman's iconic score once again perfectly complements the action, adding a nostalgic touch for fans of the series.Men in Black 3 balances its comedic elements with heartfelt moments, exploring themes of friendship, sacrifice and the passage of time. The screenplay by Etan Cohen is sharp and witty, providing plenty of laughs while maintaining a coherent and engaging narrative.Overall, Men in Black 3 is a delightful and satisfying continuation of the franchise. It pays homage to the original films while bringing something new to the table. Whether you're a long-time fan or new to the series, this film offers an enjoyable cinematic experience that is well worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Men in Black III"" is a film that is a little light on the comedy side but a valiant piece of entertainment.","One of the few things that I love more than movies are movie franchises. That is, the handful of times where a sequel or set of sequels is not only acceptable but almost a requirement. Now I seldom like every single entry in a movie franchise, but I can settle for liking the majority. The first ""Men in Black"" film, released in 1997, was one of my childhood favorites. ""Men in Black II"", despite some redeeming features that unsuccessfully prompted me to give it a pass, was a disappointment. The third and possibly concluding installment in the franchise, titled – what else? – ""Men in Black III,"" dragged Will Smith out of a three-and-a-half-long year hiatus, and I'm glad it has. For the end result is a film that is a little light on the comedy side, but a valiant piece of entertainment.The movie is also a testament to the versatility and outstanding talents of Josh Brolin, playing the younger version of Agent K. Tommy Lee Jones does reprise his role (quite well) as the sarcastic, deadpan agent with whom Will Smith bickers again and again. However, he's just sandwiching Mr. Brolin, whose performance really is the meat of the movie. The screenplay obviously supplied all of the quipping one-liners and the makeup department clearly took care of the physical appearance, but Mr. Brolin was on his own in setting down on the Tommy Lee Jones personality: the firm dialogue delivery, the Texan accent, the squint eerily akin to George W. Bush, and most remarkable of all, the ability to win an audience over by consciously underplaying the role. Mr. Jones made an instantly memorable character in the first Men in Black by keeping his character's emotions contained and Mr. Brolin imitates it immaculately. Now I'm sure there are some acting professors and critics who would claim this is more of a case of mimicking than acting, but as far as I am concerned, this is a winner of a performance. Acting, to me, is about manufacturing a character that the audience can, on some level, come to associate with and understand. Mr. Smith still has the charming personality that made him a star in the 1990s. He is also owed a great deal of credit for the success of this picture. In recent years, and movies such as ""I Am Legend,"" ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" and ""I, Robot,"" Will Smith has developed a deeper delivery tone and a drive to pursue deeper, more solemn performances. It's been 11 years since he last attempted a performance of quite this nature, but it's a valiant return. He recaptures his lighter voice, quirkier mannerisms, and joyful qualities that made audiences fall in love with him when he was throwing out one-liners in a Bel-Air mansion.I liked ""Men in Black III"" more than the second one, but it still is not quite the success that was the original film. The reason, I think, is that this new picture is a little top-heavy with the gross-out elements that were only half of what made the original movie successful. What made the original so special was its genuinely effective sense of humor. This new ones has jokes, but I would be lying if I told you that most of my reactions to them were not just token-laughs. Actually, my biggest grin was when I got another look at the Men in Black headquarters screen. In the previous two entries, we learned that folks such as Sylvester Stallone and Dennis Rodman were in fact visitors from outer space; but when I saw Lady Gaga displayed upon that monitor, I wanted to bust a gut.I was a little skeptical at the beginning of the picture and not really enjoying it. Not only were the laughs a little sagging, but the violent parts were a tad overproduced for a part-comedy. Early on, we see Will Smith rip out an alien fish's heart. Imagine if we had actually seen the alien cockroach of the first picture devour all of Vincent D'Onofrio's insides instead of just seeing the results; it would have been harder to laugh when he started asking his wife for sugar water. The new villain, a bearded scumbag whose flesh is composed of crablike joints, is played by Jemaine Clement. It's a really good performance; a moment where his character travels to the past and starts bickering with his younger self is absolutely priceless! However, the digital tweaking done on him goes overboard. Our first clue of his disgusting capacities is when we see a crab-like critter crawl inside of a hole in his hand and we get a close-up view of the process and see all the red insides of the hole. If director Barry Sonnenfeld had shot this from below, and allowed us to use our imagination (as we did in that cockroach scene I mentioned above) the effect would have been for the better.Nitpicks can go a long way, but not when you look at the big picture. Yes, ""Men in Black III"" is uneven, it takes about a half-hour for the movie to clarify its plot and intentions, Will Smith's acceptance of what he has to do in the movie seems rushed, and two of our favorite characters from before do not make a return, but the movie overall is very clever. The way time-travel is explained here is a little hazy—and not very funny—but the way it is utilized and played with his a lot of punches and a lot of heart. I don't want to spoil anything, but we do get a huge emotional payoff after the climax. I would have preferred to have laughed more than I did, but ""Men in Black III"" does deliver as a summer sequel. And two out of threethat's not bad for a franchise. History is full of bigger duds that followed a smashing success. Do you remember the three sequels to ""Jaws""?",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The sequel nobody asked for.,"Agents J and K are back...in time. J has seen some inexplicable things in his 15 years with the Men in Black, but nothing, not even aliens, perplexes him as much as his wry, reticent partner. But when K's life and the fate of the planet are put at stake, Agent J will have to travel back in time to put things right. J discovers that there are secrets to the universe that K never told him -- secrets that will reveal themselves as he teams up with the young Agent K to save his partner, the agency, and the future of humankind. (Columbia Pictures)It seemed that MIB3 was going to be all kinds of horrible. All signs pointed to it: The troubles during production (I believe Will Smith had problems on set, and the script wasn't finished when they began shooting), the horrible mess that was MIB2, the bland trailer, the lack of creativity going into the posters, having a sequel nobody asked for being released 10 years later, etc. Imagine my surprise when I had a huge smile on my stupid face when the credits rolled!The key to the film's success is Will Smith and Josh Brolin effectively playing off one another. Brolin, in particular, gives such a fantastic performance that you think Tommy Lee Jones might have had his voice dubbed over Brolin's. Seriously, Brolin looks and feels like a younger Tommy Lee Jones, and it's not an impersonation. It's a performance. The rapport between Smith and Brolin is more entertaining than any amount of explosions would ever do for the film, and it's a good thing that their relationship IS the film. Unfortunately, Tommy Lee Jones isn't in the film that much, but he was good for how long he was in it. I would also like to praise Michael Stuhlbarg, who plays such a fascinating character called Griffin, and he is able to hold it on his own with Smith and Brolin. I also liked Jemaine Clement as the villain, who is virtually unrecognizable under the heavy amount of make-up effects by the great Rick Baker. I consider him to be my favorite villain in the series.When you take a look at the good sequels throughout the past few years (Spider-Man 2, The Dark Knight, Kung-Fu Panda 2, Toy Story 3, etc.), you see that they don't try to outdo their previous films. Their success lies in their characters and expanding their emotional arcs. At times, too many summer films focus too much on the special effects and action scenes while adding too many characters and too many subplots. MIB3, however, focuses on the characters, while the action and effects stay in the background. Sure, the action and effects are good, but what makes the film good is the way it humanizes Agents J and especially K and the way it gives them an emotional pathos. Of course, nobody would ever expect that from MIB3, which makes its payoff have more of a profound effect than anyone would have ever dreamed of.One would argue that the unexpected critical success of MIB3 has more to do with the very low expectations from people after several years and less to do with its actual quality. I'm here to say it isn't that. MIB3 is a genuinely good film. Is it an amazing film? No. While MIB3 won't go in my top 10 of 2012, it's a damn good sequel nobody ever expected to be any good after MIB2. Despite the troubles during production, MIB3 somehow gets it right. Sure, there are big plot holes in the script dealing with time travel, but it's a rare threequel that actually doesn't suck. Indeed, it's a miracle. In my opinion, it's the best film in the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A worthy sequel,"The Men in Black series was surprisingly brought back with this film, it is at least a decent sequel and one that outperforms the second film in every sense. The film at least tries to change direction with Josh Brolin taking the role as Agent Jay's Partner. Tommy Lee Jones role in the Men in Black 2 seemed very tired and unnecessary for the character, in this it was worthwhile that Lee Jones took a back foot. Will Smith of course plays Jay and expect the exact same performance as before. He does at least find himself in a new environment as the film does bring at least some originality in taking it to a new time period where Jay goes back in time to save Young Agent K from murder. Josh Brolin does a brilliant job in the role of Young K as he actually delivers a fantastic Tommy Lee Jones impression. It does seem that it is about as close to what a Young K would be like and turned out to be great casting. There are not a huge amount of laughs in the film and it seems to be played more as an action with 'Boris the Animal' working as the best villain in the series since Edgar, although he is no where near as funny. The action is played out quite well and the effects never look too fake. While trying to avoid spoilers the film plays out how you would expect. I will say that Smith and Brolin made a good pairing and a good alternative the to the Lee Jones and Smith partnership. All in all a decent entry into the series and one that at least partially makes up for the mess of Men in Black 2.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"to understand the future ,we got to go back in time.","Men In Black III is a enjoyable film.This may be the most emotional one of the three and by far the best one story wise.The movie begins with the escape of Boris the animal from the lunar prison colony. Boris has only one thing in mind. Killing Agent K for taking his right arm 40 years ago and spoiling a invasion.Boris is the last of his kind thanks to K spoiling the invasion.There is only one way to make things right again Boris goes back in time to kill Agent K.Meanwhile Agent J is wondering at why K is so distant and cold. 14 years together and being friends hasn't shaken that stony Armour so J begins to work on K who simply tells him. ""Don't ask questions you don't want to know the answers to.""They got their work to keep them warm but J is worried about K.Meanwhile MIB has a new commander in Chief a agent by the name of O has replaced Z.O will not give J any information on K's background about why he'so moody and distant. She repeats K's line and it bugs him.K's background is classified and J can't find any answers that way.Then the impossble happens. Agent K disappears it seems he was murdered 40 years ago and for some reason only agent J remembers him.Agent O believes J has lost his mind until he convinces her he isn't crazy. She then tells J there is one way and that is time travel. Go back in time and save K.There is only one person in Manhattan who has access to a time machine and when J goes back in time and Meets a young Agent K played remarkably well by Josh Brolin. In fact Brolin's performance is one of the film's highlights. We get to see the MIB operate in the late 60's 1969 to be precise. And it's a treat. And for J to be teamed up with a Young Agent K is fantastic. Needless to say K and J are successful mission accomplished and J finds out about K's deep dark hidden secret and his greatest failure.We find out more about our favourite men in black and that's just fine.This movie has to be the best one yet in the series.

Men in Black 3,"Well it took ten years to try and recalibrate this franchise after the disappointing sequel, and to be fair - they have at least had a think about the story before rehashing the theme of the detective agency charged with policing the earth of our visiting friends from planets far away. Clearly, ""J"" (Will Smith) has become much more experienced since the days of the talking dog, but suddenly he finds himself ill-equipped for this latest trauma that is gong to need him to engage with his partner ""K"" (Tommy Lee Jones) and even travel through time to work with his younger version (an uncannily similar Josh Brolin). All of this is now under the leadership of new chief ""O"" (Emma Thompson). The plot is all a bit old hat - they have to save mankind from imminent annihilation, but at least this time around there is a bit more humour - usually more effective from Thompson - and a bit less of the constant diatribe from the over-powering Smith. At times it's a bit ""Dr. Who"" and the action scenes recycle themselves as they pursue the eminently un-menacing ""Boris the Animal"" (Jermaine Clement) towards a predicable, but colourful, denouement. Could Andy Warhol have been in on the whole ET-thing? It's better than the second but nowhere hear as much fun as the first one. Maybe we should stop now.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A fantastic summer movie with a heart.,"After a sequel like Men In Black 2 (2002) I wasn't looking forward to watching the third film. Men In Black (1997) is one of the must-see films of the 1990s, but the third film was released 15 years later. Most people know that sequels are usually disappointing. However, Men In Black 3 is a thrilling science fiction comedy. This one runs on a full tank of gas, and in my opinion it's a little better than the original. Will Smith hasn't been in a film for four years after the poorly received Seven Pounds (2008). Here it's good to see him again as Agent J, who has to travel back in time. An additional treat is that there are two wonderful supporting characters, Josh Brolin as Agent K and Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin. The humor comes often and not only because Brolin is so effective in his role. Yes, Tommy Lee Jones is still here. The setups are funny; one of the best being what happens at the factory. The imaginative action scenes are exciting too. Jemaine Clement, playing Boris the Animal, is a terrific alien villain with creepy crawly things that just have to be seen. Most of the credit should go to director Barry Sonnenfeld and screenwriter Etan Cohen. Cohen wrote the best screenplay of any of the Men In Black films while Sonnenfeld provided the film with a vision. Sure, the first twenty minutes are entertaining but they're spent mostly on finding a footing. After that though the film is a blast. It's a touching as well as action-packed experience. I definitely recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"This film should not be as good as it is, but the sheer gusto and bluster with which it embraces itself means, well, IT WORKS.","For many people this film had a lot to live up to, as a sequel to two well-beloved family favourites , and in my opinion Sonnenfield played this film perfectly. He doesn't dwell in the past, even if he based his plot round the concept, and try to reignite a story on hiatus for ten years. He takes the well-known, well-liked characters of his first films and plunges them into a new plot line, with a ""fresh"" antagonist, new allies and a new setting.Men in Black 3 is, in one word - ""absurd"". In two, ""absurd"" and ""brilliant"". Having conquered space travel and extra terrestrialism, the Men in Black series has turned its attention to new dimensions; time travel in 3D. Hollywood has a long history in time travel, a concept with which many director's have grappled and come off worst. Convoluting plot lines with infinite ""butterfly effect"" ramifications until the whole film becomes ludicrous - a sheet of holes being desperately bound together with unsatisfactory explanations, leaving all other facets of production to fall by the wayside. MIB's success is in its wholehearted embrace of absurdity; it is conscious of its convolution and ridicules itself for it. Griff (Michael Stahlberg) an alien who sees all possibilities is an ingenious dramatic device. He soars over the usual issue of timeline changes with interjections explaining ""Oh it's this one"". Griff is the centre of the film's self-awareness and his interludes of wonder at the implications of small events on the wider scale, expertly capsulated in the ""Ball park"" scene, are a valuable addition to the piece.Almost the whole film is performed with as much tongue in cheek as a hoarding hamster; even the often delicate subject of race in 1960s America is broached with a light hearted comic approach - resulting in some of the most amusing moments of the entire film.Will Smith, the heart and soul of this film, blends his more recent, mature, emotionally delicate performances from ""Ali"", ""Seven pounds"" and ""I am Legend"" with his signature boyish quips from ""the playground were he spent most of his days"". Agent J is the Fresh king. An emotionally intelligent performance loaded with ""tch'all know what I'm saying"" wit and impeccable comic timing. The relationship, familiar to all those versed in the two preceding films, between agent Jay and agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin) is integral to the film's success. For all the impressive action sequences, laser blasting, one wheeled motor bike chases and general running around in fully rendered 3D, Barry Sonanfield recognises the importance of human story and maintains this focus.In a moment the adrenaline fuelled, absurd laugh riot, gives way to a truly unguessable twist, a rarity in cinema today, and then a genuinely emotional sequence. Time is expertly utilised in this film, both as a plot device, and as a piece of film craft. Comedy timing was beat perfect, lengthy verbal appeals cut short with snap camera shot changes to our never-out-of-their-depth heroes face down in the dirt, handcuffed. Fight and chase sequences are interspersed with typical 1960s domestic scenes, intensifying the pace and gravity of the situation and simultaneously helping to create the clever self-awareness of ludicrousness. Revelations are revealed at pinpoint moments to spur the action on and prevent too long a lull in the narrative. Soundtrack runs almost throughout this film guiding the audience in their perception of pacing, becoming noticeable by its absence to create comic effect and reassure you that you've pressed the red button and are now driving on the roof in the sleek black movie vehicle.The Men in Black series has always been light, and quick on its feet and in its heart and this has seemed to most its appeal, however Men In Black 3 gears this enjoyable creamy lightness and intersects it beautifully with a heavier emotional layer. As Jay stands still on the beach, finally fully realising his past, the series stands still for an incredibly rare moment and allows us to gulp it down like ""chocolate milk"" to cure our ""temporal fracture"" headache from the mile-a-minute film. It is at this moment that the motif of time, physically embodied in a sentimental stop-watch, comes to realisation.Although perhaps the drawback of what ultimately is a clever, funny and entertaining family film written by a comic-book writer – characters may be endearing and emotionally delicate but they are not complicatedly layered, despite the clear attempts...",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My Favourite Men In Black Movie,"Men In Black 3 (2012)Will Smith took an unheard of 4 years off (something he had never done before) after Seven Pounds, to help promote his children in show business. His daughter had a hit single with Whip My Hair and his son Jaden started in the remake of The Karate Kid and dabbled in music too. When he returned to the big screen, he played it safe and went with a sequel to one of his biggest hits.Plot In A Paragraph: Agent J (Smith) travels in time to M.I.B.'s early days in 1969 to stop an alien from assassinating his friend Agent K and changing history.4 years is a long time between movies for an actor, and it's pretty much like American audiences didn't really care when he returned. Even in a big budget sequel, he couldn't crack the top 10. It is the highest grossing entry in the MIB series globally though.Personally this is my favourite Men In Black movie, it's vastly superior to the second and more touching than the first. Josh Brolin totally steals the show as a young Tommy Lee Jones, who doesn't really have much to do. I'm not sure why Nicole Scherzinger was hired, what is nothing more than a cameo and some close ups of her boobs. Another nice performance for me was Michael Stuhlbarg who plays Griffin in what can only be described as a Robin Williams esque performance. He is a joy.Men In Black grossed $179 million at the domestic box office, to end the year the 14th highest grossing movie of 2012.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Movie Review : Men in Black III,"It has been a decade since the guys in black dazzled the cinema goers with slick action, dizzying aliens and tongue in cheek comedy. It was indeed fascinating to see whether the director, Barry Sonnenfeld with the same crew but a débutant screenwriter, Lowell Cunningham will be able to reignite a dormant franchise and make the cash counter running by delivering a blockbuster.Agent J (Will Smith) and agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) have been together since last 15 years. They account for the safety of our planet, throws in slapstick humor against each other and take care of the extraterrestrial activities happening in our realm. When a long lost enemy, Boris the Animal, played eccentrically by Jemaine Clement, goes back in time to kill Agent K, Agent J decides to take a trip down the same lane and stop the inevitable.The obsessively detailed aliens, enormous set pieces, spectacular action sequences and the eye popping 3D, the director and our duo has scored a home run. But the most enthralling of all the achievements is the balance between the technical aspects and the human heart. The two veterans shine with an electrifying chemistry all the way and are in top form.Where the movie falters is in its script. It leaves the viewer with a been-there-done-that kind of feeling. It never justifies its existence. It definitely is better than the limp sequel, MIB II (2002), but does not quite match up to the heights of the very first outing. A bit more creative climax would definitely have given more juice to the proceedings.Men in Black III works in parts. It will keep your popcorns churning, but will leave you wanting for more. And when the curtains go down, you definitely won't require neutralizing your memory. It deserves a watch!Rating- 3/5",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Men In Black 10 Years Later. Or 40 Years Earlier. Or Something.,"I didn't like Men In Black II. I thought it was entirely dull and unoriginal, so I can't honestly say that I had high expectations for the third instalment of the series. But I have to give credit to director Barry Sonnenfeld, who put together a worthy sequel to the memorable original - much better than II, which I would forget, if I only had a neuralizer!One thing that gave this a fresh feel was introducing time travel. Yes, time travel has been done a lot in movies - and maybe overdone. But it was nevertheless done pretty well in this. In the story, an alien criminal named Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from a prison on the moon to seek his revenge against the human who captured him - our old friend Agent K (again played by Tommy Lee Jones.) His revenge involves going back in time, killing K and setting in motion a series of events that leads to a massive alien invasion of earth. To prevent all of that from happening, Agent J (Will Smith) takes himself back in time, where he encounters a younger Boris and a younger Agent K and becomes involved with trying to plant a defence net that will prevent any future alien invasions on the Apollo spacecraft about to blast off for the moon in July of 1969.The story was decent, and had its share of humorous moments, very much in the MIB tradition. I thought perhaps a little more could have been done with J trying to fit into 1969. What really made this movie work, in my opinion, was Josh Brolin's performance as the young K. He was almost a dead ringer for what you would have expected K to look like 40 years ago. He captured the role perfectly.The movie goes for a little bit of a sentimental ending as J relives his very first meeting with K (a meeting which is totally unexpected) and then everyone moves back to the present.This is a worthy sequel to the first Men In Black - maybe not enough to put the memory of Men In Black II out of your minds, but it does leave a better taste.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best of all 3,"Going into this film, I was unsure what I thought about it. I enjoyed the first film, yet didn't care much for the sequel. I was also unsure about Josh Brolin. Normally, he's a great actor, but when it comes to adapting a character from a book, Brolin's got a pretty bad track record *cough-Jonah Hex-cough*. The thing it did have going for it was that the trailers for this one looked good and Brolin looked pretty impressive, not to mention Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones. It didn't disappoint. The first 5 to maybe 15 minuets of the film start off slow and boring. At that point, I was hoping it would at least be as good as MIB II. Boy was it. Not only was it better than II, but it was better than the original itself. Josh Brolin plays a young Agent K to total perfection, and Will Smith turns in his best performance since I Am Legend and The Pursuit of Happiness. The main villain of this film also truly feels like a good villain, better than the original two probably combined. The story is good, the acting is great, and this film delivers quite a twist. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Sci-Fi films and wants a fun film. An easy 7/10 which, if I could, in my books is a 7.7/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The first rule of MIB3D is:  Don't Talk About The Ending,"The second rule of MIB3D is: Don't Talk About The EndingThe other rule I like to follow is: Don't reveal what happens in a movie - talk about why people should or should not see it. If you want to know what happens in a movie, pony up the ticket price, go see it and find out.You should see MIB3D if you like:the first two movies - Will Smith bouncing off a morbidly surly Tommy Lee Jones - your sci-fi to be funny - good 3D - weaponry you wish was available in real life - conspiracy theories - Josh Brolin - dead sexy costuming - inventive aliens that make you wonder if your popcorn has been spiked with a psychotropic drug - a villain with really intriguing dental workYou should not see MIB3D if you don't like:the first two movies - Will Smith doing what he's done before - deadly serious science fiction being polluted with (ugh) humour - 3D - fantasy shiny weaponry that could not possibly work - conspiracy theories - the extreme convenience of a Neuraliser - a low percentage of screen time devoted to spacey female fleshI love the MIB franchise and shed a tear in the 3D film that is the third in the series.Josh Brolin is one of the greatest male actors on the planet.And a round of applause for Flight Of The Conchords kiwi, Jermaine Clement, who has done a terrific job as the Boglodite villain, Boris.Another incredibly good actor is Michael Stuhlbarg who has taken a 180 degree turn from his Boardwalk Empire character, Arnold Rothstein, to become a pivotal freak in the funny freak show that is MIB3D.The theme music for MIB has been consistently outstanding and I might even invest in the soundtrack for this flick too.I give it 7/10 alien thumbs up.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"A more energetic, simple and fast paced addition to a faded franchise","Fun, energetic and the time travel gimmick did work. Josh Brolin was a fantastic addition making K his own with a subtle impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones that does wonders. As a plot, it is still as thin as the first two editions with no new innovation to the special effects, gadgets or weaponry.Boris The Animal, an alien assassin who was captured by K (Tommy Lee Jones/Josh Brolin) escapes from a maximum security prison on Moon. Boris vows to avenge his loss of limb caused by K. He plans to go back in time before K does the damage and kill him. When K goes missing from the present, it is left with Agent J (Will Smith) to correct the past.What it does to best is to sticking to its basics on what worked before and adding a fantastic addition in Josh Brolin. I get it that Apollo 11 is one of the most remarkable milestones in human history, but the Hollywood's obsession to revel on this period makes it a little been there already so many times feel. Maybe it allows them to add those loopy bits of music in their soundtrack which otherwise might not fit in contemporary stuff. The main antagonist has the required buildup and motivation but lacks the superpowers to make him formidable. Emma Thompson and Alice Eve who play older and younger Agent O respectively had very little to do going by what they can do.A more energetic, simple and fast paced addition to a faded franchise",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fail with Men in Black 3,"To start of with I have to say with all of the spoilers in all the advertising MIB3, was a totally politically correct movie, the way it was made. The first start of the movie the introduction of the lady walking with the cake and the it hand jumps out gross factor. I have never seen so much tongue in all of my life. It is easy to see why the movie makes you become disappointed as you watch the other series it was more fresh and different to other sci-fi movies.As been a fan for over 10 years of Men in black its clear to see that the last movie MIB3, in the series is only been made to profit from the end of world and sci-fi atmosphere created by the mass hype the end of the world. They even copied a scene's from the war of the worlds with the alien robots The only thing I liked about the movie was the year that it was set in 1969 flash from the past.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I do not remember 69' that well; l now I know I have been neuralyzed.,"They always tried to tell me it was the drugs or the war but know I know the truth; it was Agents J (Will Smith).Yes, it was more of the same as the first two productions. It is not easy trying to top the original movie let along making something coherent and excel with new one-liners.Yes, why not time travel, revenge, and evil. Who would ever expect something hidden in a cake being brought into the jail?I will not go into detail as that is the fun of the movie as secrets review themselves. I was really surprised to see anyone pull off a young agent K; Josh Brolin pulled it off quite well.If there be a MIB 4 I'll be there. Probably is by a different title.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
MIB are back  they actually never left us  so what?,"Men In Black are back. 15 years after the first (and best) film in the series Hollywood tries to squeeze some more dollars from the same idea.Sequels are never easy to do. You need both to ensure continuity and bring back what the audiences love in the original and invent so that the repetition does not bring exhaustion and disappointment. Best examples of success like The Godfather or Star Wars were complex stories spreading over generations, developing memorable characters and bringing to screen new emotions and passions in each one of the new installments, even if they not all were as best as the initial films. Well, MIB is no Godfather or Star Wars, neither is Barry Sonnenfeld a Scorsese or George Lucas. Men In Black III has more downs than ups.The good news first? Well, it's available (also) on 3D. Don't forget to order 3D tickets as I did, as many of the screenings are banal 2D. Hint - the tickets on 3D are even more expensive that usual. Two new actors join the team - Josh Brolin doing a fine job as a young version of Tommy Lee Jones' character (yes, good guess, there is some time travel involved) and Emma Thompson who is always lovely to see, even when she has a too thin part as here. The less than good news? Well, there are no surprises, no new jokes to remember, no ideas that make the film really different or funnier or scarier than the previous series. The retro parts are very much the same we have seen in scores of other films since Back to the Future, the bad guy has bad teeth, and the story has holes as big as the cosmic warps with a touch of melodrama that does not add really anything good.Is it worth paying the ticket to see the film in theaters? Well, maybe yes, if you are in 'just' for entertainment and you are ready to accept conventions and to put logic to rest for a couple of hours, than you have chances to enjoy the film. If you are a MIB aficionado you will go and see it anyway, so I can just wish you to have fun!",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Welcome Back, Men In Black!","Now it seems like I am one of the few whom actually enjoyed the second installment in this franchise when it came out a decade ago, so I was looking forward to this film. Even though no one in particular was asking for Men in Black 3, it's nice to welcome them with open arms. This film has all the elements that made the first film so genius. It has the duo of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, great, offbeat creature designs, some wise humor, and a villain who is not only menacing, but has some punch lines.Barry Sonnenfeld returns at the directing helm and he directs a film in a franchise that put him on the map. Agents K and J return and J has to travel to the past where he must prevent the younger K from being murdered.I'm glad both Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones returned because it's not Men in Black without them. They still have excellent chemistry and I still love how Agent J gets to poke fun at Agent K's non-changing demeanor. However, I have to mention Josh Brolin. His portrayal of younger K is uncanny. I felt like he was actually Tommy Lee Jones for a second. Jermaine Clement makes a convincing and pretty scary villain.Overall, this is a great welcome back to our Men in Black. As critics pointed out, this film largely improves on it's predecessor. It also helps there are several emotional moments that give us some clues on the younger days of J and K. I really liked this movie thanks to great acting, a good story, and something just to keep my childhood fresh. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Boring and unimaginative....,"Seriously? You have three massive acting talents in this movie and you can't even write a meaningful scene. I understand this is supposed to be lighthearted summer fare, but when your script doesn't even allow Wil Smith a laugh, you are in deep, deep trouble. The interaction between the two main characters, whom we know so very well by now, is not dynamic, playful, or engaging. It is abrasive, annoying, and toxic. It doesn't make you laugh, it makes you cringe. Fourteen years of working together to fend off alien menaces and these two don't can't engage one another. Shabby writing beefed up by expensive effects. The plot...what plot? We sat through this movie so that we could find out along with Agent J that hid dad was murdered by an alien during a rocket launch? and K hid this from him why? I sat through Green Lantern's entirety and yet I almost walked out of this ""film"" if I may use the term so poorly. Terrible to see someone as talented as Tommy Lee Jones in another horrible movie.

"far too little, far too late",I can't believe that this is being released so long after the disastrous second instalment. Men in black 2 was a sequel too far and I genuinely hoped that it would be the last we would see of these characters.However certain people are in need of a career boost and so the tired old franchise is dusted off again. I have no enthusiasm for this.It seems that Tommy Lee Jones has no enthusiasm either as he isn't in this much. He is replaced by Josh Brolin who does an excellent impersonation of him.I feel sorry for Brolin as he keeps giving good performances in horrible pointless sequels. Remember Wall Street 2?There is no reason to watch this in 3d. NONE. I wished I'd found some way to see that without paying big screen prices.

MFields Review: Men in Black 3,"This is definitely an improvement over the last installment. I think what's great about this particular one is seeing Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones back together and the inclusion of Josh Brolin playing Tommy Lee Jones. That pretty much made the movie for me.Okay, there are some things that bothered me about this movie, though. So the whole movie centers around time travel, right? Well how come when Tommy Lee Jones is ripped through time and everyone says he's been dead for forty years, wouldn't Will Smith be thinking the same thing? What makes him different from anyone else? Also, if Tommy Lee Jones' character was the one who recruited him, wouldn't Will Smith still just be a cop rather than being a part of MIB? Why is he working there if he never met K? It doesn't make sense! And how is it that very quickly people start believing in his time theory? It's like saying that someone went through time to steal my Rice Krispies because it magically disappeared right in front of me and the cop automatically believes me and tells me to go find a time machine.But hey, I enjoyed the Josh Brolin scenes, though.While I'm complaining, though, I have to admit that this is one annoying villain. I don't know, he just comes off as a bad guy that the main bad guy of the film would send to you when he doesn't feel like getting out of his chair. This Boris the Animal character just comes off as a mentally challenged bad guy.But the action scenes (albeit short) were good and I enjoyed the chemistry between Will and Josh. Oh yeah, and there's this Griffin character too that knows everything about life and he's pretty annoying too. I know I complained a lot but I did enjoy the film. I wouldn't call it the best of the summer or anything but I'm glad I saw it. Oh and I can't stand 3D so I didn't see it in that.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A well structured movie but depends on how you look at it,"Being a 17 year old, I watched the first two MIBs when I was quite young. I'm a Will Smith fan, but I still didn't watch the first two immediately prior to this one hence I had these Deja vu moments whilst observing, for example,the ""neuralizer"" and certain other specific aspects specific to the Men in Black series.I rate this an 8 primarily because of the structure of a ""proper"" movie. Although it may not be a direct sequel,it was quite well knit with the MIB back story and the basic background of the whole trilogy (not that there will not be any other MIB, but let's see).I missed Will Smith as I was watching the movie. He reminded me of the Will Smith I was acquainted to when I was young, characteristics that most of his new work does not explicitly express.MIB 3 was definitely better than I expected. There was flow as mentioned implicitly before. Dialogue heavy at times, it makes one wonder ""Why?"" but it does make the whole atmosphere of the scene more profound.Casting wise, the original lead cast members were intact (which in my view was a definite USP for the movie). The casting in general permitted a fluid experience hence it is redundant to say ""it could've been better"" as this is not exactly the case. The script was interesting with certain ways of making the audience try to understand what a character was saying which only made the experience a better one. Mind you, MIB 3 does not make one think too hard whilst watching the movie, but intrigues one really.The 3D viewing, honestly, wasn't a big point to stress on. Yes, one or two scenes of course make it worthwhile, but with a 1 hour and 40 minutes duration, I highly doubt that two and a half minutes of screen time which utilized the 3D effect to it's potential is worth skipping the opportunity of a 2D viewing to wait for a 3D one.Two words: Time Travel. The concept, new or old, does obviously impact the story a significant amount. To revolve about this concept may not appeal to some but hey, it all depends on you.The movie does have it's moments but not a surplus amount like in ""Harry Potter 7 Part 2"" or ""The Avengers"" for example. In other words, MIB 3 does not appear to try that hard, which in reality, only helped give the movie a serene atmosphere, and again I stress, one that flowed smoothly.Ultimately, I recommend this movie, and if some of you are wondering, no you do not need to watch the first two to understand this, but it definitely helps. Worth a watch, maybe two if you're that big of a fan. I would not watch it twice immediately but that's just me.Interestingly, I want to watch the first two now! 8/10 suggests that it's worth it,so have fun!

1)Old.  2)Tired.  3)Boring.  (Pick any three),"Let me explain. No, there is too much, Let me sum up.10 Will Smith shoots a bug.20 SPLAT!!!

Will Smith, slime, joke, not laughing, get it?I'm pretty sure we get the not laughing part.The audience I was with to watch the movie sounded as if they had been stunned with a cattle prod.This seemed to go on for about 5 or 6 centuries, although I checked and the run time is only 103 minutes. So, I may have suffered a fatal brain aneurysm somewhere along the way.This movie seemed to feel that world was clamoring for another go at the first MIB movie except with the all of the humorous bits removed or made so painfully self aware that you feel like gawkers at a comedy ten car crash scene.We also got to again revisit the joke that every weird looking or weird acting person on the planet is a space alien. Because no matter how many thousands of times you do that joke, how could it ever NOT be funny? Am I right? Am I right? Am I right or am I right?Will Smith has apparently decided that he is such a bouncing off the walls, superfly, laugh-a-minute, comedy machine, that what has been lacking in his movies is not enough boring, uptight, straight white men to fail to laugh at his jokes.So both Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones get to play the steely faced, no nonsense, all business partner people types who will play total non-reaction so well when Will lets his full wacky out of the cage.We also get a love interest along the way. But it doesn't really matter who or when or where or why. Since the people and the plot points have become completely interchangeable and irrelevant at this point. The scenes play with all the raw animal magnetism of a flight attendant giving the seat belt lecture before takeoff.I like Will Smith, I like Tommy Lee Jones. I like Josh Brolin and Emma Thompson, I do, I really do.I enjoyed the first ""Men in Black"" movie quite a bit and while the second one was not good, the reviews seemed to indicate that they had gotten back on track here.But the experience of watching this moving was like paying to watch oral surgery when there isn't enough knockout gas in the whole world to stop the pain.Check please!",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The jokes are just not funny and even embarrassing. watching this in the theater, in some point i was just surfing on my mobile facebook, wandering when will it be over?? i really loved the first MIB film, which was breath-taking and sophisticated. the second one wasn't near as good but still entertaining enough, the third is just stupid. seems like all they want is our ticket money, so i recommend you NOT to watch this in the theater. find other ways to see it, it just doesn't bring any justice to the franchise. i give it 5 out of 10 for some stunning special effects, the best i have seen since Avatar(2009) which by the way HAD A STORY!!5 out of 10 for the secret agents that protect us from the scum of the universe!",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
as good as the first one,"It has everything that the first one had. The second I did like too. I was a bit reluctant to see this one because of the time travel but as the premise a bit unrealistic"" anyway it did not hurt. They did not make a mess out of it which is good.The actors played very well, the direction was good, the story good enough although due to time travel a bit inconsistent with itself. Still it worked perfectly. I really loved it.This is a side and more general note. When I was a young boy I always wondered what would that be if the stories were more complete and one could see more sidelines of what happens while main characters go along the main story. The film industry delivered quite a lot of that recently with 3h monsters that have a company strong main characters fighting the evil. This one is more of a normal movie - it is not even 2h long and you do not feel exhausted when the movie ends. I think my old dream of seeing the ""full story"" would be better left a dream. This movie stays with the original idea while adding on top of it without going OTT. I appreciate that.Back to the movie - the only thing I did not like were the small inconsistencies here and there.

"If you are expecting a fun, family friendly movie, this is not it.","I watched this movie thinking it was to be another fun Men in Black movie... Something that could be enjoyed by the whole family, young and old. I was wrong. Besides being boring (it may have picked up later in the movie, but I stopped watching half way through), it was full of racism, bad jokes and a dubious representation of the time most of the movie was set (the late 60s). Needless to say, I didn't laugh once and was probably more annoyed than amused.The Fresh Prince has gotten old and I would have hoped Will Smith matured beyond this kind of role. At 44 he's still acting like a juvenile for the cameras. Still, it was ultimately the writers and director's responsibility to make the movie palatable for its target audience (??). It's been 10+ years since the first movie was released, you'd think they would have tried to mature Agent J's character a little...or hire somebody younger to fill the role.Tommy Lee Jones was bland, but what would you expect? Etan Cohen and Barry Sonnenfeld are probably to blame most for this stinker, as they wrote and directed it.To summarize: If you are expecting a fun family friendly movie, this is not it.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Back in Style,"It's been nearly 4 years since Will Smith appeared on the big screen and an even longer time since the last Men In Black sequel (2002 if memory serves me right) but here they are, back in style.While it may have been some time since Will Smith's acted in an action film (where he should stay, in my opinion), he proves that he's still got it in the third part of the memorable MIB franchise. He pulls off the wise-ass Agent J perfectly (just like old times) and he didn't fail to amuse me over the course of the film's running time. The whole cast did their parts well (especially Boris) but it was Josh Brolin who surprised me; the man was the spitting image of a younger Tommy Lee Jones. He pulled it off so well I honestly thought there had to be some sort of CGI magic or dubbing done but no, it was all Brolin and he pulled off a younger Agent K good. My only problem was that Tommy Lee Jones, who's as important to the franchise as Will Smith is, barely got enough screen time. Yes, it's part of the story that J meets a younger K and yes, Tommy Lee Jones is getting a bit too old for these kinds of movies but I just miss seeing him alongside Will Smith for an entire MIB movie. This however, does little to hinder the film's enjoyment factor.The story is well written. Time travel is one of the more complicated story devices to use since if messed up, plot holes will appear everywhere. Thankfully, the movie writers took their time (10 years is no joke for both fans and producers), edited the crap out of their drafts and ended up with a good time travel movie along with a nice surprise ending. As usual, the comedic banter between mostly everybody and Agent J was done well but everybody gets to say something witty that isn't out of place in the story's setting. What really got me was the emotional factor that was added into the leads' partnership. Sure, we've seen them fight aliens and save the world in the past two movies but it's only now their partnership has become this emotional. Part 3 of the MIB series returns to the series roots and uses what made part 1 so great in the first place; a healthy balance of action, sci-fi, comedy and emotional content.The CGI, to some, would look outdated (and to some extent it is) but this wasn't a problem for me. Instead, what the CGI did was usher in a feeling of nostalgia since it really looks like something from the late 90's when movies were just starting to incorporate computer graphics. Though for an MIB movie, there were surprisingly few aliens but that's just a minor problem. I guess that this time around, the story was really centered on the two main characters and not so much on what makes the universe so weird and cool (though I do miss the talking dog). Again, I dodged the 3D screening so I can't say anything about the 3D version.MIB3 is a good watch; it returns to the series' roots and not only succeeds in making a movie so reminiscent of what made the 90's action films so great (balanced comedy, action and drama... and no fancy camera tricks like ""shaky cam"") but also threw in a new dynamic between the two main characters. I'm not sure if this will usher in a part four (and part 3 feels a bit like a series finale to me but that's just my opinion) but if it does, I hope the writers, again, take their time in perfecting the script since even if part 3 took an entire decade of waiting, it was well worth the wait.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Entertaining summer movie,"This is a perfect summer movie, wouldn't you say? It's got aliens (lots of aliens), time travel, futuristic technology, great special effects and 3D, a fast pace, a wisecracking Will Smith, cool chase scenes and wild shoot-outs.For those of us older than 14, it's a well written, well acted film with a few good characters. Michael Stuhlberg plays an interesting character who can see ""fifth dimensionally"". The villain played by Jemaine Clement (Boris the Animal) is hilarious and frightening at the same time.The movie lacks some of the more annoying, childish aspects of MIB II. MIB has always been a buddy-movie franchise, but in this version this aspect comes to the foreground. This movie is actually about a relationship, in spite of it all. Josh Brolin is quite good. The movie is very much focused on Will Smith. This movie is perfect for him.Much of the movie is staged in NYC in 1969 so some of the background and humour relate to that. The alert viewer is rewarded with allusions and references of all kinds, including to MIB I and MIB II. The movie is richly planted with these Easter eggs. (I think the director more or less assumes you've seen the first two movies.)",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Men In Black 3 - An un-funny 1 hour and 46 minute joke,"First of all, I want to thank the Danbarry Dollar Saver cinemas for showing this terrible film at a low price because had I paid full price for two tickets (one for me and one for my wife) I might have given up going to the movie theater altogether. So Danbarry, I thank you for keeping my cinema watching hobby alive!It's not often my wife and I sit in a theater and consider leaving before the film is over. If I recall, we've only had this conversation twice during a movie (I can't remember the last movie because it was so long ago). This morning, however, it is clear as day to me this very real conversation my wife and I had last night while watching this film. She strongly recommended we leave so she can get to bed and get more sleep (in retrospect, this was the best course of action). I responded by saying that we should at least try and finish the movie in hopes that we'll find something about it that we like. 1 point for my wife: For those keeping score at home that's my wife 102, me 4. Her instincts are seemingly much better than my logic!With that said, let me share why this film was so awful:First of all, where is the unique writing that we saw from MiB 1 and some from MiB 2? The concept for this movie is interesting but the writing makes it flat and 1 dimensional. At some point, we lose interest in the concept and simply watch the characters (Smith and Brolin) go from point A to point B in a monotonous fashion. It's like the writers reached into a hat for plot moving sequences written on slips of paper making it rough on the viewer to not only understand what's going on (the ""Griffin"" character is completely frustrating and useless) but to really even care. The only time I became interested was the Cape Canaveral scene, but even in this climactic scene, it eventually falls flat.Secondly, Will Smith isn't funny. His jokes are child-like knee slappers that, you guessed it, the kids in the movie theater found hilarious. To be fair, this is mostly due to the bad writing: Smith is supposed to throw out his usually funny contextually driven zingers and they normally come off as spot on comedy. In this film, however, because the writing is so bad, the jokes come off as flat and Smith kind of looks like a circus clown. How many adults out there find circus clowns comedic?Third, the character development downright stinks. Boris, Griffin, young and old Agent O, and even Tommy Lee Jones character is awful. All of these characters are boring and one dimensional (like this film). Some of the aforementioned characters such as Agent O, Griffin, and the Andy Warhol character are pointless. I hate when films add pointless characters because anything they do doesn't contribute to the moving of the plot. Josh Brolin is the only one who has any real character development, but eventually, even he becomes useless to this film's pointless plot.Now to be fair, this film would be pretty cool if you were a kid, which I""m not sure if that's who the film is directed to? It's confusing because you have child-like plot advancement with Will Smith punchlines laced throughout but inserted with adult contextual humor. It's really awkward. Children watching this film would love the action scenes and the one line zingers but would be confused about most other things in this movie (especially the 1969 references and others).The film can best be described in this dialogue between Will Smith and some guy (I'd tell you his name but I forget and he's a worthless character anyway) who has the time control device. I'm paraphrasing almost all of this because I don't have enough respect for the film to find the actual lines nor do they even matter:SOME GUY: I have the time control device but in order for us to use it, we have to get really high. SMITH: what? No! no way! SOME GUY: on the roof....it's called a time JUMPaudience reaction: *crickets",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Yes, Men in Black are Back!","In ""Men in Black III"" Will Smith's Agent J travels back in time to 1969 to prevent his beloved mentor Agent K, present day Tommy Lee Jones, from being murdered and avert the future destruction of the world from extraterrestrial invaders. Josh Brolin is awesome as the 29 year-old K, and younger version of Tommy Lee Jones. Brolin's performance authentically captures the Young K and essentially young Jones, in a way that is distinct homage and moving on its own right. His amazing performance wonderfully enrolls us in MIB3.Screenwriter Etan Cohen's story possesses an unsuspecting poignancy and narrative twist. In one of the best scenes, Young K (Brolin) quietly confesses to J (Smith) in his southern drawl, ""You're a good man."" J gets it, and you see this touchingly in Smith's eyes. Realizing that this K is not the gruff Jones K, he replies, ""What happened to you?"" Will Smith is back in awesome form as J—all swagger, looking trim and fit in his black suit and tie. Smith is a master at balancing the smart ass bravado with palpable decency and humanity. Smith's historical sweet bromance with Jones transforms into something special with Brolin. That coherence solidifies Director Barry Sonnenfeld and Cohen's vision. I had seen an interview with Will Smith on ""Good Morning America"", where he said that he came up with the idea of MIB3 when they were filming MIB2 10 years ago. He wanted to connect up all 3 movies in some catharsis.Don't misunderstand: ""Men in Black 3"" is hysterical, and action packed with ray guns vaporizing dozens of evil aliens. I didn't opt for the 3D, given that the movie was post production 3D. Though it is visually stunning with the retro 1969 MIB look, and the cool motorcycle chases.Cohen's writing is a brilliant mix of hysterical and subtle gravitas. Back in 1969, Andy Warhol is really Men in Black Agent W, played with comic genius by Bill Hader. While Young K and J talk with Warhol (Harder) about killer alien Boris, he tells his assistant, ""I'm taking a picture of a man eating a hamburger that is so transcendent"" I was laughing so hard. Back at headquarters, J tells Young K, ""A wise man once told me, don't ask a question, you don't want an answer to."" Brolin says, ""I said that?"" Smith and Brolin's partnership has a genuine worn comfortable feel. Just watch Young K order pie with J at a local diner—Smith and Brolin are hilarious.The Men in Black (MIB) is a super secret organization that keeps peace in the world with the coexistence of alien beings and humans on Earth. Some of the aliens are people we know like Lady Gaga. Since the last movie, compassionate and strong Emma Thompson as Agent O is the new Leader of MIB. Thompson is great—too bad she isn't leveraged more. J discerns that the cantankerous K may have had a past romantic relationship with O. Anyway, as MIB3 opens one armed murderous alien Boris The Animal (comically hideous Jermaine Clement), breaks out of the convert lunar penitentiary. He aims to exact revenge on K (Jones), who shot off his arm and imprisoned him, by traveling back in time and killing him.J (Smith) distinguishes something awry in this current alternate reality, where K was never his partner. Agent O helps J isolate the glitch. Apparently, K was killed over 40 years ago in an attempt to avert a world crisis. So it is up to J to go back in time and set things right by killing Boris. However, back in 1969 J and Young K befriend alien ally Griffin (innocent and gentle Michael Stuhlbarg), who cryptically warns J that death can only replace death.Granted there are way too many aliens on the verge of distraction, and a lot of visual eye candy in ""Men in Black 3"". What keep us engrossed are the human characters and bating narrative—what is the source of J and K's relationship? Josh Brolin is the amazing standout. Will Smith has the star charisma to be in flow, and be the cohesive force in this funny and strangely touching tale. MIB3 may be a great as the first movie, and I hope they make MIB4. I think this story is worth continuing.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Men in Black III best MIB movie with great actors: enjoyed it a lot!,"Men in Black III is by far the best Men in Black Movie. Men in Black I was bringing the concept and the story about the 2 ""Men in Black"". Men in Black II more like a follow-up movie without a big blast. Men in Black III is great and I would say a nice surprise! My wife and I went to the cinema with the intention to go the movie ""The Avengers"" but that one was not at the time we arrived so we went to Men in Black III. Men in Black III was great: the characters, actors, special effects, aliens and the overall storyline were splendid.I don't want to tell you much about the story because It contains some nice surprises I appreciated a lot and I don't want to ruin your joy of watching this movie. The review who is on top right now contains spoilers according to my opinion: I wouldn't like to know the things he has written in advance.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are both great actors. Josh Brolin as the ""young Tomme Lee Jones"" was also great. As usual you know Will Smith will control the movie. Will Smith remains to be the best actor who gives you positive energy. You can clearly see Tommy Lee Jones has aged and his grumpy face is great: I love him! His character remains to be the one of sarcastic grumpy man with a good sense of reality: he thinks before acting. Will Smth remains to be the humoristic positive man with a bad sense of reality: he doesn't think before acting. I really like these personalities.Storyline, characters and especially the originality of all of the aliens: a big 8! Jemaine Clement as ""Boris The Animal"", the bad guy was great: he must be the best bad guy I have seen in ages because you really feel this guy is a big troublemaker.What's bad? I think there could have been more 3D special effects in this movie or do I expect to much from 3D? At the end I pay more to see a 3D movie but I was disappointed on the amount of 3D scenes.It was clearly a movie where both the actors as well as the director and his crew were trying hard to make this movie a enjoyable movie: it was not 'the best of the best' but a very nice movie with great actors, storyline, aliens.. you will certainly enjoy it....

Could off been great!,"10 years after critics seriously bashed the second ""Men in Black"" movie. The Same Director and stars give it another shot. The Result being another mediocre sequel. Though one that is trying a damn-sight harder than the last one.Now, I'm not going to say which off the two ""Men in Black"" sequels is better, because too be honest, I don't remember the last one all too well. But this one is at least destined to be remembered as the time travelling one. Ye Will Smith has too go back in time too save Tommy Lee Jone's life in the 60's, and the younger Jones is perfectly played there by a great Josh Brolin.I like the new direction this movie went in, but it's still a diminishing sequel. There are some laughs but just as many off the gags are embarrassing. Plus the effects don't quite work without the 3D. It could off still been saved by its ""out there"" plot.

I Am Not A Licensed Psychiatrist,"Specifically this movie is crap, and I as the reviewer should not try to link it to the human condition (insane, we are all insane). If I center my review solely to the movie, I'll be less likely to go off on a tangent. This movie and this movie alone fails for it's own personal reasons, the way other movies fail is irrelevant to Men In Black 3's way of failing. For instance this movie chose substandard writing and plot to try to make it successful. Also egomania is an actual disease, narcissism is a mental disorder, now when I watch Will Smith movies all I see is someone who is very probably mentally ill. It's weird for me. I think, shouldn't someone help him he's obviously sick, but Will Smith is a Hollywood superstar, he's made a fortune being sick. He does not want to get help. Can I say I'm any better?",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Lives Up To The Previous Films,","Men in Black 3 is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot a stellar cast that balance out the films dramatic and comedic undertones perfectly. It is a very fun follow up to the previous two movies, they clearly went out of their way to come up with a plot line that could not possibly match the other Men in Black movies, and they found a perfect one. Time travel was a great scenario to put these characters in to, it further establishes the complications of this universe, as well as giving us a new setting, entirely unlike what we have seen previously.The only thing that did bother me is that this movie was released in 3D, which I myself am not a fan of, and in watching the 2D version, you can see a lot of moments that were clearly only made for the enjoyment of people paying the extra bit of cash. There are parts were something fly's straight past the screen, as well as plenty of moments where the actors face is directly in front of the camera. 3D should not define your movie, and I do not think any scene should be made specifically for it.The cast is dazzling as always, Will Smith is still in great form as Agent J, playing the character with great charisma and ease, as if it has not been ten years since his last portrayal of the role. Tommy Lee Jones still brings in great screen presence as K, Emma Thompson steals every scene she's in as O and Jemaine Clement is absolutely stellar as the films main antagonist, Boris The Animal is without a doubt my favourite villain of the series thus far. One of the highlights has to be Josh Brolin, who is absolutely stellar as Young K, boasting an excellent impression of Jones, fitting in to this universe very nicely.Great fun from start to finish. A terrific adventure that is funny and sweet, Men in Black 3 reinvigorates the franchise, with an original new story, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action comedy.Agent J heads back in time to 1969 to stop an old nemesis of Agent K from murdering his younger self.Best Performance: Will Smith",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The men in black are back and still fun,"As a young child I watched the first Men in Black countless times and remains to this day one of the most fun films that has remained with me. The second one was nothing special, and after a ten year-absence, the MIB return. I was surprised to see just what approach the film took: make it fun, entertaining, and also a little heartfelt. As a second sequel to a film, that's exactly what it should be. One last point to make: Josh Brolin should really be considered for a nomination for Best Supporting Actor after such a realistic performance as a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones. A great third film that was quite better than it should have been.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very Surprised!,"I did not want to see this movie at all, since I saw the first preview. I expected it to be a terrible movie, but my Mom wanted to give it a try so I caved in. During the previews I kept telling myself, ""This is gonna suck"". Boy was I wrong! I still think that the 1st movie is best one, but this one is definitely a close second.Plot (No Spoilers): Agent K encounters an enemy from his past known as ""Boris the Animal"" who Agent K arrested in 1969 which resulted in Boris losing his arm. Boris goes back in time to the year he was arrested to kill Agent K. Agent J then goes back in time to 1969 to stop Boris from killing his partner and from changing history.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are great as usual, but a special nod to Josh Brolin who plays a younger Agent K, because he looks and acts exactly like the character. Jermaine Clements as Boris is amazing, and quite freaky also. The things he does with his hand made my skin crawl. And finally Michael Stulbarg, who plays ""Griff"", was out of this world! His character had these extraordinary abilities such as being able to see the future/possible future scenarios, and the way he said things like, ""unless it's this"" or ""it could go like this"" left me in awe.The story (again, no spoilers), not much I can say but while slow at first, it got very interesting when we got to the 1969 scenes and I really liked how it had the 1960's feel. Special note: I'm a huge Rolling Stones fan, and I laughed at the scene where Agent K tells J about monitoring Mick Jagger (lead singer of the Stones), since he was a possible alien. Also without spoiling anything, there's a shocking twist in the final act that I don't think anybody saw coming.Men in Black 3 is a really good and entertaining movie and a great improvement over the second one. Yes it is a bit cheesy in moments but it's a lot of fun. I recommend this to anyone who wants to give it a try.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
No K hence should be No J,"I need to let it out of my chest. J was recruited by K so if K is not around then J should not be an MIB agent. This is a big plot hole and happen in the beginning which I find hard to accept it along the way. It's kind of ruining the movie for me.Actually the solution for this enormous hole is easy, just get another agent like agent O, hires J again, since her colleague (K) ask her to keep an eye on him - for the reason explained in the end of the movie.So, in my alternate script, the next day after the disappearing of K, J in his black tuxedo (explain later that at that time he's a cop just having dinner with GF or any other reason why he wear a black tuxedo - so we the audiences think that he's an MIB agent) is hunting down a guy (similar scenes to MIB 1 but of course more spectacular) which then turns out an alien, but J feels it's like a deja vu, then when agent O recruited him (like K did in 1st installment) and somehow mentioning how she were monitoring him as requested by K (which make us, the audience more curious about what happen), J has this urge to dig out about who is K and what happen to him since K feels very familiar/close. He's digging his way around - of course in a bad way - until he finds that timekeeper guy, who explain what might happen and then J decided to do the time jump, and we go back to the original script.However, although Josh Brolin's act as younger K is superb, the story/script is not getting better (do I have to make another alternate script?) since what we see is this 2 agent hunting a criminal with minimum twist. They didn't make their way by trashing the alien community in the 60s upside down to find Boris. I think a lot of audience including me are expecting J to make some serious mess.Instead they find a super mentalist alien who tell them everything they need to know and help them get to the place they need to be. It's like watching the Mentalist TV series or Twilight and not the good episode one.So 4/10 from me, better watch it at home.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Why was this green-lit?,"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Dialogue is repeated due to lazy writing. 'Funny' moments are always awkward and never funny. Action- packed moments are filled with paper-thin CG. Tommy Lee Jones is utterly under-utilized, his part in the film is essentially a cameo. Emma Thompson's part has the same problem. Josh Brolin delivers a good performance as always, but there's only so much you can do with a poorly- written character. The story is as ridiculous as it is contrived, and while that was one of the great things about MIB (the original), surprising your audience with a story so insane it's simply fun only works once; you can't repeat that practice and expect good results.

"Men in Black 3 does manage to do some things right, but fails to really do anything special enough to leave an impression that this franchise is worth reviving.","What would a sequel to Men in Black look like? This is certainly a question we wish we wouldn't have asked when the 2002 sequel was released with a flat story, an unnecessary revisit to characters whose story arcs were wrapped up, and an overall hit or miss version of the great comedy from the first film. It's been ten years since the underwhelming sequel hit theaters and fifteen since the original. The new questions are does this series deserve to be brought back? Is it something that people really want? Most of all; can a third movie to a fifteen year old franchise that was never really that special make the series relevant?

Agent J goes back in time.,"Fifteen years after the first ""MiB"" movie was released, the story with revolting aliens and evil monsters continues.In this explosive third installment to the ""MiB"" series, Agent J is forced to go back in time to stop an evil alien, (Boris the animal), from killing Agent K and destroying the world. Agent I ( will Smith) is forced to time - jump (literally) jumping off the top of the, Empire State Building, in to New York in 1969, fighting to save the friend (Agent K) and fighting to stop an alien invasion. Will he succeed or will he fail? You are in for a surprising but yet great ending.The acting in this movie was brilliant especially by Josh Brolin who played the younger Agent K. He had an uncanny ability to sound and act exactly like Tommy Lee Jones making the viewers forget that Brolin is not actually Jones. Brolin also looked a lot like Jones and this enforced the idea of Agent J traveling back in time.All in all, it was a great movie which accomplished it's aim of entertaining its audience and if Boris was replaced by a scarier character it would have made the movie much more successful. Also, if the movie had been released around 2007, it's present quality would be sufficient but, since there is a 10 year gap between ""MiBII""and ""MiB III"" I expected a higher quality.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

There was a decent amount of fighting in different places some witty references, all around just the goofy fun you would expect from this series. However I don't feel that it lived up to the rest of the series it just seemed like there was a little too much whining and not enough actual witty banter to even out with the rest of the series and as a result it kind of made it monotone in comparison.

As Much Fun As You'll Ever Have At The Theater,"The first two ""Men In Black"" movies were successful because of a simple Hollywood ""formula"": fun. By combining goofy aliens, cool gadgets, great acting, funny sight gags, wise-cracking humor, and enough of a plot to actually make you care about all that is transpiring, those movies were so genre-diverse that one almost can't help but find something to like. After a ten year break from the action, however, there was no guarantee that the lightning could be caught in the bottle once again for MIB3. Luckily, this film not only proves itself worthy, but actually clocks in as the best installment in the series to date.For a basic plot summary, MIB3 sees a rogue alien escape from captivity and, through time- travel, wreak havoc on the MIB organization by causing Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) to no longer exist. As such, Agent J (Will Smith) must travel back to 1969 in order to set things straight, along the way meeting up with the younger K (Josh Brolin).Like its predecessors, this movie is just pure fun, through and through. The time spent watching it will fly by (no boredom here!) as every scene contains some interesting nugget, whether comically, emotionally, or just plain exciting. Essentially, MIB3 is the perfect balance between ""summer popcorn flick"" & ""film series you truly care about"". While humor, action, and adventure are present throughout the film, the ending of the movie even takes an emotionally-charged tone that will likely have you completely stunned and perhaps even pulling out a tissue or two.Of course, the acting within this film is probably what truly makes it a great experience, though. Will Smith slips effortlessly into his old ""black suit"" role, while Brolin is spot-on as the young K. Jones is, well, pretty much the same old Jones, but with an added character twist that really does help explain his character's gruff exterior.Simply put, MIB3 vaults this trilogy into serious consideration when considering the ""greatest trilogies of all time"" debate. It is pure fun, but with enough emotion to make you care about the characters. Even after 10 years away, the black suits are indeed still as fresh as ever!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The next day Agent J(Will Smith) goes to work at the Men In Black office, But K is not there, and when he asks, nobody knows who K is. Only to find out, that K was killed in 1969, that old enemy has traveled back in time to killed K. So J must travel back in time and save K, and put things back to the way they where, but will he?I had fun, like I did with all the Men In Black films,regardless what some critics say. They never take themselves seriously, and that is alway what I like about these movies. Will Smith is back and still got it, after three year vacation. Tommy Lee Jones is still good. So is Josh Brolin has young K, he was good, I started to think he was Tommy Lee Jones, and the camera De-aged him. And the effects don't disappoint either. And the look of the 60's are also good.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Action, comedy and SCI-FI, check, check, check","Extra terrestrials are now going back in time to get the Men in Black. Boris (Jermaine Clement) is an alien that has the ability to engulf and emit out a weaponized spider-looking sub-creature capable of firing better than any legend cowboy. Boris wants another chance at bringing his allies brethren to earth, so he must go back in time and change what agent K ( Tommy Lee Jones) had done many years before.One delicious looking birthday cake is ruined and Agent J, ( Will Smith) goes out on a limb to see how he can change the present.

The Men in Black Return 10 Years After Their Last Movie,"Men in Black 3 is the latest installment in the alien-hunting movie series that started in 1997. It's starring Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin. It's about an evil alien that goes back in time to kill Agent K, erasing him from the present time. Therefore, Agent J travels back a day earlier to stop the alien.Now, Men in Black 3 got some pretty negative reviews, but personally I liked it very much. I thought the story was fun, the humor was good and the creatures were great. Another thing I liked is the turn the movie takes near the end, which was surprising and very touching.So you might be wondering, is Men in Black 3 the next Toy Story 3? No, it is (obviously) not. It is however better than the first two films (in my opinion, mind you). I liked the story more and the action scenes were good.The movie also has a brand new cast of characters. Very few characters from the previous films make a return, which I actually think is good. The new characters are good. We have the villain, Boris the Animal, which is just a really cool and funny villain. We also have a supporting character called Griffin, which can foresee every possible future. He was funny and charming.Men in Black 3 is not without its flaws. First of all, the lack of Tommy Lee Jones is a bit disappointing. He's just in the movie for about 20 minutes. For the rest of the movie, Agent K is played by Josh Brolin, who plays his younger counterpart. The reason I don't actually mind Tommy not being in the movie too much is because Josh is JUST LIKE HIM! Another flaw is that there are numerous plot holes in the story, which is to be expected from any time travel story, but it's still very noticeable.Overall, Men in Black 3 is a great way to end the trilogy. Any Men in Black/science-fiction fan should see this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not bad but still not as good as the first one.,"For the most part this movie was entertaining enough. Much better then the second one was however not nearly as good as the first. The addition of Josh Brolin was a nice change he played his part perfectly however he plays a 29 year old so he was a bit old. Will Smith is back and he is talented and funny as usual as well as your typical Men in black story line. Evil alien trying to take over the world. Its up to the boys at the Men in Black to stop it.The reason this movie was not as good as the first is mainly because it felt sort of cheesy. I mean this movie was made 14 years after the first one and I swear the CGI in this one is somehow worse. Despite it having an 130 million dollar budget for some reason they can only make CGI that looks cartoonish and childish as if its trying to appeal to young children which I don't think it is because it is rated pg-13 and there is some parts in it and I quote ""You are a piece of sh!t"" said directly at someones face. So- I think they cheaped out majorly on the effects and the story line was very typical and predictable.Overall Fans of the original probably wont enjoy this one too much. I think it would be perfect for perhaps a ten year old and his friend to watch. Im thinking they would have a blast with it but for me I rate it simply average.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
MIB 3 - A must see,"I saw this movie yesterday, that being the second day after the premiere. I've been waiting for it since December and it didn't disappoint me. It's got action, it's got drama, it's got comedy. It's a well rounded movie with subtle fun facts that bring back memories (after all it's been roughly 10 years since the Mib 2 was released). I couldn't help myself laughing as i heard J say ""may i have your attention please"" as he is pointing the neuralyzer towards a crowd. Great performance by Will Smith and Tommy Lee and a surprisingly good performance in depicting young K by Josh Brolin. There have been discussions whether it is better or not than The Avengers and I must say nothing compares to the atmosphere of Mib and although both are very good movies, i'd give the edge to MIB. It's an 8+ movie (i'd say 8.5) that you would enjoy seeing two or three times.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Sweet Bromance, good sequel","With all the wannabe haters out there who bash everything because what Hollywood comes out with does not meet their narrow minded standards, I am happy to report that Men in Black 3 is a return to the original. Okay, so there are no worms or Frankie, but rather an emotional human drama that is sweet, tear jerky and a damn good science fiction film.Josh Brolin is brilliant as young K, and the back story between him and Jay is explained slowly and you will cheer for them both. Frankie, my favorite alien, no longer alive makes sweet cameos and by far and away you will fall in love with the wise Doctor-Who/Luke Skywalker inspiration Griffin, the movie's best alien and the best helpful guide since Yoda.In between Andy Warhol and some lingering racism, this movie while light years better than the second installment, does not rise to stardom like ""The Empire Strikes Back"". All in all however, a good science fiction bromance is worth seeing. 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Superb Third Entry,"Faster paced than the first and more entertaining than the second, Men in Black III is a worthy addition to the strange franchise, and lead stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones step back into the roles of Agent K and J like they it was yesterday. This adventures puts Agent J back in time to prevent a deadly plan that could very well change the fate of the planet. Josh Brolin nails it playing a younger Agent K, he's got the grunting and moaning right, the facial expressions, the blunt line delivery and empty emotion that Tommy Lee Jones brought to his character originally. Barry Sonnenfeld's style is in your face and nifty, the actors get right up to the camera and scenes jump from one to the next with energy, but the first twenty odd minutes before the time-jump are slower than the rest. I loved the opening featuring Nicole Scherzinger's debut role as Boris' girlfriend, she's actually very good and sexy as hell, as with Alice Eve's excellent performance as younger Agent O, but Emma Thompson is the scene stealer as the present Agent O. The 3D effects are impressive, most noticeably at the time jump sequence and the Cape Canaveral sequence which is just a technical marvel as the main characters battle it out above the launchpad. You'll be thrilled, entertained and left with a big cheesy grin on your face.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A good Time Travel Movie MIB Style,"I have to say that when I saw the flick that it was a good one. It has some moments that were great and there were some that was not great and slowed down the pace of the move. There is a great twist and revelation in the movie and once you know what it is, it will clear up many questions that you might have had or just wondered about.All together it is a well made movie and it was well worth the cash that you will plunk down. The 3D was post production and thus it is a gimmick to get you to spend more money, see it in standard and save the money.Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Men In Black 3 Review,Men In black 3My Opinion I didn't enjoy any of it; I disliked everything because it was too unbelievable. The acting was terrible and storyline was absolutely rubbish. I've had better entertainment whilst vomiting. I think they should have stopped making films after Men in Black 2.Target Audience The films target audience would be for teenagers and adults between 20 and 55. Will smith goes back in time to stop an alien assassinating his best friend (Josh Brolin) in 1968.Actors and Actresses Will Smith – Agent J Tommy Lee Jones – Agent K Jeffery Clement – Boris the Animal Emma Thompson – Agent O Josh Brolin – Young Agent K Mike Colter – ColonelSpecial Effects I think the special effects were OK but I've seen much better effects in Skyfall.Recommendation No I would not recommend this film to anyone I know but that is only my opinion.,2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Sequel With Depth,"The first Men In Black Movie was a classic. And let's face it, MIB 2 stinks. But MIB 3 offers something we have yet to see in either of its predecessors.Depth.There's a lot more here than witty banter between Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) or Agent J, (Will Smith). The creators are done with making the oddities of the aliens as a major focal point of the story and humor, though there is plenty of it in MIB 3. This time we get to delve into the characters of both Agent K and Agent J, and the result is refreshing.They do this by time travel. In order to save the life of his partner, Agent J must travel back in time and rescue Young Agent K (Josh Brolin) from Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement). Here we learn a lot about Agent K and how he might have become the hard-nosed stickler for rules that he is.Being about time-travel, you can expect there to be a lot of twists and turns, and quite frankly a couple of scenes that will blindside you. (But in a good way.) I obviously can't get into specifics because I don't want to give anything away, but there were several moments throughout the movie where I had to ask myself if I was still watching a Men In Black movie. Though it is still classified as a comedy for sure, the elements of action and suspense kept you on the edge of your seat, while the tenderness of some scenes nearly brought me to tears - something I would have never expected from a Men In Black movie.The acting was superb. Will Smith is at his best, and Tommy Lee Jones is always a delight, but he is only in the movie for twenty or thirty minutes it seemed. I would have to say that the real credit goes to Josh Brolin for portraying Young Agent K. I'm not sure they could have picked a better actor for the job.Starting out, the movie seems that it was only adding to the poor job done on MIB 2. I went in to this movie thinking that it HAD to be better, because if it wasn't, I don't know why they would even try. (Sorry for those of you out there that really liked MIB 2...Please let me know what I'm missing there.)If you haven't seen the first two MIB movies, where have you been? But seriously, it would be good for knowing the background of the characters. I would say this one trumps the first two by far. Fantastic movie.The McDandy Rating: A MUST SEEFor more reviews from McDandy, Visit: http://mcdandyreviews.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best among the series....,"The men in black series have improved as it goes on. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones returns as the world'd most favorite MIB agents. But now it is more than that. Agent K is not found missing and Agent J finds him dead for over forty years. At the same time he is found to crave chocolate milk and even snatches one from a four year old kid without even saying please. Then with the help acquaintance he goes back to 1969 where agent K is actually supposed to die. How he prevents it and mystery behind forms the rest of the plot.The movie has the suspense element that keeps the audience hooked to the screen till the very end. Plot is bigger and better. Each and every scene has something or the other going. The final fights scenes are a lot better compared to the other men in black films. Movie is a lot funnier too.Will Smith is still the old J that we all know. The person who says funny things when he opens his mouth and all. He is very lively and witty. Everyone will love agent J.Tommy Lee Jones looked very old. He also appeared less impressive compared to superb performance in men in black 1. His character is shown very vulnerable and fragile.Josh Brolin was dashing as young agent K. He was spectacular. He talked and moved just like Tommy Lee Jones. His way of dialog delivery was really like Tommy Lee Jones's duplicate.Others were also good.The 3D effects were lot better in this film compared to many other best (Avengers, Resident evil afterlife, Wrath of the titans) It is indeed very enjoyable and has to be experienced in 3D at least even once.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Waste of time,"I have no idea how movie that bad can have a above 7 rating on IMDb.com OK, as a matter of fact I do have idea. People who watch this movie are either brainless or are aliens or have some kind of parasitic alien controlling their bodies. I am not going to take 100 min of your life as this movie, instead I am going to give you an advice (which surprisingly works on all new movies from Hollywood). My advice: Watch the first 10 min of the movie. It is going to tell you (99 out of 100) if you want to continue watching or quit/leave/go get drunk/do whatever else you want to do but do not waste a second more on this movie. So take it or leave it, the choice is yours. For me this movie is a total waste of time thus 1/10. Period.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Not the sequel I was expecting, but it is a worthy one, for the most part","Let me get this out of the way:I love Men in Black. I think the first movie is perfect. Very few movies can combine a gripping plot,strong performances,great special effects and makeup,a fun score,creative aliens,and some of the funniest movie moments in any film ever like the first film did. And this all this was accomplished in less than two hours.The second film was not as strong. I actually thought it was had more good than bad parts in it. I mean, it still had some funny moments,some good effects,the chemistry between the leads was still present,and I like the twist at the end. But let's not kid ourselves:it was pretty repetitive,was not as funny as the first,and had a weak villain to follow up the great villain of the first. Still, I think it is better than is reputation,especially after watching it again recently.So,when I heard there was a third movie coming,ten years after the second,I was more excited than worried.Come on,they had ten years to make a proper sequel;they wouldn't make an equally entertaining but disappointing sequel like MIB II again. And with each new trailer,I got more and more excited,and after seeing it last night,it was worth the wait,but it was not as good as the first. Why? Read on.The film picks up ten years after the last film. We open with the introduction of our villain,Boris ""The Animal"",an alien who is escaping a prison on the moon. The last of his kind,and missing his arm due to a previous MIB encounter,Boris is coming to Earth to get revenge on the MIB agent who took said arm:K. Meanwhile,J is at a crossroads at his life,feeling like even after fifteen years,he still doesn't have much of a idea of who his partner really is. After a brief,but brutal encounter with Boris at a Chinese restaurant,K puts him partner on probation to keep him safe from Boris.The next day,when J is coming up to work,he finds himself facing a horrible truth:K is now dead,and apparently has been for forty years!After discovering why he has not been erased from the time-line(why is kinda clever and funny,so I won't spoil it here)J learns that Boris has gotten hold of a hand-held time travel device and has traveled back to July 16,1969 to kill K, which means K never prevented the invasion of Boris's species by entering a shield into Earth's gravitational field which will protect the entire planet from an alien invasion.Now J must go back in time to July 15,save K,and along with K and an alien named Griffin,who can see pretty much every possible future at once, find a way to get the shield into space so Earth can be saved.This movie would fail without the chemistry of its three leads,and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones both still have terrific chemistry as J and K,respectively.Hard to believe,ten years later,they still click wonderfully and both are as fun to watch as they were in the first two.Michael Staulburg is a great addition to the cast as Griffin,having some really funny moments with his powers, and his dry delivery. Jemaine Clement is a great villain as Boris,menacing and fun to watch,and his character brings a real sense of darkness this time out.The supporting cast,including Emma Thompson,Alice Eve,Will Arnett,and Bill Hader,are give good performances,with Emma being a real standout.However,the best performance belongs to Josh Brolin,who nails Tommy Lee Jones' mannerisms and delivers a worthy compliment to Jones's K.It is worth seeing just for him. Very special mention goes to his final scene,which really touched my heart as a fan of this trilogy.You will know what I mean when you see it.Men in Black has always had cool tech,both from the gadgets and technical achievements from the production design and the makeup,and the standard continues here.The MIB headquarters looks different than the proceeding films,and there are actually are two different variations of it:2012 and 1969.Both are impressive,as is the makeup and computer effects for the aliens. Boris's makeup and computer effects are particularly noteworthy and very impressive. There are new gadgets as well,such as these one wheel bikes that J and K use in a great chase scene,the hand-held time travel device(which was a great effect when utilized)and even jet packs! How awesome! The writing here is much better than two. Scenes lead logically to the next scene and the lead characters' souls remain intact. And the final revelation is a very nice way to further tie the bond between our heroes together even closer than before.And don't worry:the film is still quite funny.Griffin gets some very funny moments,you get to see the worms sing amazing grace,and Brolin captures Jones's deadpan delivery very well.I particularly like the scene where K is delivering ""SPOILER ALERT"" Zed's(the original MIB chief) eulogy.In typical K fashion,it is very deadpan and very funny.My problems with the film are these,however:the film does lack the pace and humor of the first.It is the longest of the three,and it felt like it around the beginning of the third act.Also, it lacks the heart of the first,and some scenes don't hit like they should. I hate to bring it up. I have nothing but love for this trilogy,but why is it so hard to outdo the first? It was so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Still,I did enjoy it,and my disappointment mostly just comes out of this writer's love for the first. But with some great humor,a smart script,great performances,some fun tech,some wonderful feelings of nostalgia,and a great scene near the end tying the entire trilogy together,MIB 3 is what we should had gotten ten years ago,and this writer is very pleased that the franchise has been redeemed!

"""Men in Black 3"" a well done, fun sequel","I am not a big fan of sequels, I saw the original ""Men in Black,"" but skipped number 2. I did go to see ""Men in Black 3,"" however, and I am glad I did.Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are back as the super secret agents keeping the alien visitors on Earth in line. In this script, something happens in the past that comes back to haunt Smith's Agent J. J must go back in time to 1969 to save his partner, Agent K, played by Jones in the present and Josh Brolin in the past.First good thing here is the addition of Brolin. It is uncanny how well he plays a young Tommy Lee Jones. I was convinced Jones had dubbed his voice, but no so. Mister Brolin did it perfectly.Second good thing is Smith and Jones back as the perfect couple, and third is a script that was well written and well executed. The filmmakers resisted the temptation to overdo the effects and gadgets, but had a good time with them in the 1969 scenes. Adding to the fun is Jermaine Clement as Boris and Emma Thompson as Agent O, along with Michael Stuberg, Bill Hader and David Rasche.In addition to the plot, you will learn things about Andy Warhol, Mick Jagger, some Chinese restaurants, fashion models, and why you should never flush a goldfish you won at a carnival down a toilet.This is a great 2 hours to escape and enjoy. ""MIB 3"" gets, appropriately enough, a very good 3 out of Fordyce.Credit Check: Nothing happens at the end of the credits, so feel free to leave.

"Funny and enjoyable with great makeup effects, Brolin is superb","Men in Black 3 is the second sequel to 1997's Men in Black. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones return as Agents J and K with Josh Brolin playing a young K, Jemaine Clement as vengeful villain Boris the Animal, Emma Thompson as Agent O, head of the MIB agency and Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, an alien with precognitive powers. Barry Sonnenfeld and Steven Spielberg return as director and executive producer respectively, with the amazing Danny Elfman returning as the scorer. Behind John Williams and Hans Zimmer, Danny Elfman is the third best film composer ever in my opinion. It has been ten years since Men in Black 2, the previous instalment.Alien Boris the Animal, who K apprehended back in 1969, escapes from a high security prison on the moon and vows revenge on K by going back in time and killing young K. On Earth, in present day, J wakes up to find that no-one knows who K is, he was apparently killed in the 1969 Boris incident at Cape Canaveral. He too travels back in time to save K and kill Boris before he could be imprisoned.Will Smith returns to acting after a four year break, and he does his usual Will Smith-isms. Tommy Lee also plays his jaded, old, craggy self, with Josh Brolin acting so much like Tommy Lee that had I known better I would have thought it was Tommy Lee Jones with younger makeup. Talking of makeup, Rick Baker's makeup is spectacular. Despite the movie's budget being the first and second film's combined, the aliens are mostly makeup, and it is all great, nice to see a change from the endless flow of CGI that infests Hollywood. The film has some funny moments and some cool action, as well as a side character, Griffin the alien who reminded me of a young Robin Williams. It feels a little dull and original in the first twenty minutes, but the film really picks up after the time travel. Overall, a fun, exciting sci-fi comedy with great effects and a superb Tommy Lee portrayal by Brolin.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Unfortunately strained and lacking...,"I couldn't give this one more than a 5...while the original MIB was brilliant in its imagination and presentation, MIB3 felt smaller by contrast. MIB2 was much more fun also, but the story behind this outing just didn't hold together. Both Will Smith and Tommy Lee looked like ""What am I doing here, and their performances showed it.The CGI was pretty good, but thrown together to take your mind off the meager story line. Let's face it, somebody decided, 'hey, let's make a third MIB but not too juicy..."". I mean, is there some rule that says sequels must degenerate in quality. Other than the CGI, so much was lacking that I lost interest rather fast, and that doesn't happen that often to me.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Awesome movie with incredible special effects that look even better in 3D!,"Men in Black III continues with the adventures of Agent K(Tommy Lee Jones) & Agent J(Will Smith) who are part of the secret government agency known as the Men in Black. The Men in Black mainly protect the Earth from deadly aliens all over the universe that somehow find their way to Earth. K's arch enemy Boris The Animal(Jermaine Clement) who is an alien, escapes from his prison, which is on the moon. He swears revenge on K for chopping off his hand. So, Boris goes back to the past using a time jump time machine & kills a younger Agent K(Josh Brolin) which means that he ceases to exist in the present. J is baffled by K's disappearance. He asks Agent O(Emma Thompson) as to where K is & she tells him that K's been dead for 40 years. Now, it's J's job to go back to the past using the same time machine Boris used & save his partner.To be honest, I haven't watched Men in Black I & II. Fortunately for me, you can watch the third one without watching the first two and you can still understand what's going on for the most part. Since I haven't watched I & II, I don't know much about the great chemistry shared between Tommy Lee Jones & Will Smith. However, whatever little I've seen of it, it's absolutely spot on. This is mainly because of their differing personalities and attitudes. While J is a happy go lucky agent who destroys aliens with a smile and also manages to wise crack every now & then, K is a serious agent who always has a grim expression on his face(most of the time at least). This has been brilliantly done by Josh Brolin who plays a younger K. The facial expressions, the accent, the tone, and the soft interior as opposed to the hard exterior has been perfected by Brolin. MIB 3 is mainly about the back in time to save the future sorta thing & how J travels back in time to save K's life. So, this third addition is mainly about the chemistry between Josh Brolin & Will Smith. Do they pull it off? Yes! Brolin & Smith share the same magical chemistry that Jones & Smith share. In fact it's hard to believe the younger K is not played by Jones himself. Brolin is that spot on as K. A note on the performances. Will Smith is outstanding as Agent J. Tommy Lee Jones is brilliant as Agent K(though he has limited screen time). Josh Brolin is spectacular as a younger & more fun Agent K. He perfects K so well that, the viewer doesn't miss Jones even for a second when Brolin is playing K. The aliens are innovative & creative as always in an MIB flick. The variety of aliens & their differing appearances is jaw dropping & awe inspiring. The gadgets are slicker & cooler than they were in the first two films. The 3D really enhances the visuals & special effects of the movie. It has been used intelligently throughout the movie. MIB 3 is worth a watch, especially in 3D!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A far better improvement over MIB 2,"After MIB 2 came out, it seemed like for the longest time that MIB 3 wasn't going to go anywhere. Both movies were treated the same way as the Ghost Busters franchise: the first, everyone liked, and the second just totally faltered and had fewer fans than usual. The first film had a nice intro that brought the audience to grips with its characters and story. However, the sequel didn't bring anything new to the screen. The character roles were just switched and a new villain was inserted and had the same intentions of invading earth. But by comparing this film to the first sequel, the first sequel is nowhere close to this one story wise.Coming back to the screen is Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as the alien crime-fighting duo. Both actors retain their personalities from the previous films, which is always a good thing. Their mission? To stop a Bogladite named Boris from returning to the past and killing Agent K. If Agent K is killed in the past, a Bogladite invasion will begin on Earth in Agent J's time because there is a certain key that will be missing that allows Earth's protection from a Bogladite invasion. Returning for another run is composer Danny Elfman who provided the music to the last two films. However, the score has a little more guitar in it. I'm not complaining though. The music still sounded great, it just sounded a tad different.Jemaine Clement plays Boris, which is weird because every time I saw Boris, I saw Tim Curry. I guess because of the way he spoke? I really can't explain it but I felt like I was watching him and not Clement. But all that has to be said for this character is that this is one tough villain. Boris is not just ugly, he's fierce and unforgiving and that's perfect. It was even funnier when the future Boris met with himself from the past; even he wasn't nice to himself. Watching Boris recalled to how the villain from MIB 2 just wasn't good enough. The character of Serleena played by Lara Flynn Boyle just didn't seem make her character mean enough. But this is only one character of the film.Audiences will find Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, quite an interesting and entertaining character because of his range of probability fortune telling. And then you have Josh Brolin who gives an undeniably excellent performance as playing young Agent K. Brolin's mannerisms, facial expressions and word use show how long Brolin studied the character of Agent K. However, the only thing wasn't pleasing was that some of the characters from the first two movies didn't reprise their roles for this film. But why? These were the characters that helped make the first one a hit and the second a mild hit (for some). A few characters were explained to why they didn't show up, while others were just totally unmentioned. Where was director Barry Sonnenfeld when that happened?The action, dialog, and sci-fi effects are still great to look at in this film. But the idea of going back in time was an interesting take. It was fun to see what kinds of things MIB used back in the mid 1900s. I got a big laugh when J was about to get an ""eye exam"", compared to what it was like in the first movie. This kind of material shows how ridiculous and over the top MIB was as a growing corporation and it's funny to watch, especially the way J handles the issues. The best thing about this movie though, is the story. The plot explores so much of the two main characters. It explains to why K is K. Even more interesting is how it reaches into the background of J, which is new because MIB 1 & 2 didn't bother to dig into this area before. In the end, I was almost just as satisfied watching this film as to the first. I guess waiting 10 years or so can really turn a franchise around.Men In Black 3 is far better than MIB 2 because of its in depth story line and how it focuses on its characters from a different perspective. However, it is not as good as the first because it lacks the supporting characters from previous installments. But after watching this second sequel, viewers will understand much more about the MIB duo than the first two films could ever try to explain.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Somewhere between the second and the first in terms of quality,"I was cautiously optimistic when I heard that they were going to make another MIB movie. The first movie was extremely good in my opinion and even the lackluster sequel had some good things in it. Plus, it's hard not to like Will Smith in pretty much anything. The man is the definition of likable. Add in the chance to see young Agent K, some jokes about the late 60s and more of those comically weird aliens - it all seemed promising.And the movie delivered beautifully. I got pretty much what I expected. It wasn't as good as the first one, which had the novelty on its side and could really work all the good jokes in, but it was definitely better than the sequel. The stupid jokes had been dropped, the dog was thankfully kept out and as a whole the tone was kept closer to the original. It's still lighthearted and family-friendly, but it didn't treat its audience like we were mentally handicapped idiots.And at the same time all the good things were kept in and focused upon. Will Smith's Agent J was still as good as ever, yet he had been given the opportunity to develop as a character. He's a senior agent now and thankfully the movie realized this. Agent K was good as well, and his younger counterpart was played brilliantly by Josh Brolin. Very good role performance in my opinion, he absolutely nailed the character.Plus, the supporting characters were very strong, the villain, while nothing special, still welt like a genuine threat and had character, the imagery didn't disappoint and the tired time travel plot avoided the most obvious pit falls.Still, I must admit that the plot was probably the biggest fault in this movie. Nothing was obviously wrong with it, but nothing in it was all that special either. It's your run-down-the-mill time travel plot to stop the bad guy, who has gone back in time to change things. If you're seen one of them, you've seen this movie. The movie manages to keep its viewers from getting bored by focusing on the characters and the somewhat dark, yet goofy atmosphere, but one could still see that the writers hadn't had any new ideas.Final thoughts: If you liked the previous MIB movies or even just the first one, this one is definitely worth checking out. It's a decent action/adventure film and well worth your time as long as you don't expect it to be as good as the original.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worst of the series... Unwatchable,"I took a weekend to watch all the movies in the Men In Black series, really enjoyed all of them except for Men in Black 3. From the very beginning it was way less engaging the jokes weren't funny the actors didn't seem to be enjoying it, the alien characters were just gross and not interesting-to be honest I couldn't really watch the whole movie. Feels like they had to make a third one & they wanted to do something different so they made it grosser and chaotic but not better in any way. I see some folks liked it best out of the 4 MIB movies, so if you didn't like the other movies, this is the movie for you, lol.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Rare Occasion in Which the Three-quel Surpasses the Original.,"Yes, the title is a true statement; everything that was good about the original ""Men In Black"" is done better in ""Men In Black 3"", which is quite a surprise, considering that the third movie in a franchise is usually the weakest. Now, I've never been the biggest MIB fan; I enjoyed the first movie for what it was: a flawed, but nonetheless, entertaining sic-fi comedy. The second, although I don't hate it, failed to live up to the bar that was set so high by its predecessor.And now we have the third, and best, installment. First, the bad things. I found the whole time travel plot, although it does have its fun moments, a bit too clumsily handled. It seems a bit too clunky and interfered too much with the laws of space-time-continuum that have been set by previous movies.The first twenty minutes of the movie seems too reminiscent of what made the second movie a flop. It's self indulgent, full of lame one-liners, and it sort of prevented me from enjoying myself. I feared I just paid to watch another bad MIB movie.But after Tommy Lee Jone's Agent K is erased from time, the movie really steps it up. First of all, the villain is really good. The villains from the first two movies were...well, I don't remember. So I know a villain lacks charisma when I can't remember a single thing about him/her. The villain from this one is a lot of fun. He looks bit like Randy Savage and sounds like Tim Curry. He's got some good one-liners and a couple of cool fight scenes with the heroes.While we're on the subject, the action in this one is a lot better. This is sort of a weird thing to point out, but the first two MIB movies are ugly movies. They look gross and dirty, which I think is what the filmmakers are going for. But there's so much grime and muck that the audience can take, so it's nice to see a cleaner MIB movie.No doubt you've heard how awesome Josh Brolin is as young Agent K. His control and surly attitude capture exactly what Tommy Lee Jones brought to the table, but there's hints of emotion to him as well. ""Something hasn't happened to him yet"", so Brolin's allowed to show some happiness with Agent K's former life.Final verdict: With the exception of the first twenty minutes, it seems like the filmmakers were able to go back and get rid of all of the snarky stupidity of the second movie. They've found their roots with the first movie and managed to make an even better movie. It's a good summer action movie, plain and simple.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"No spoiler, but this movie was not too good.","Let me start by saying, I had low expectations for this movie and the movie turned out to be worse than I expected. First thing first JOSH BROLIN did a Phenomenal Job as a young K, PHENOMENAL!!! Will Smith, I am a fan, but you failed to provide the comedic relief in this one. I will not lie, yes I did laugh, but for the most of it, the only jokes I really found to be actually funny made most moviegoers at our showing(white audience) cringe due to the racial nature and historical facts of most of the punch lines. While I have definitely seen worse, what upsets me the most about this movie is that we supported putting this movie ahead of THE AVENGERS!!!!!! The Avengers was an AWESOME movie from the corny jokes to the story, action, acting, everything about the Avengers was great.I do appreciate how MIBIII attempted to fill the holes in time traveling deaths, but at the end of the day, they failed at that as well. Put it this way, if you're over the age of 10, turn your brain off and enjoy because even my 11 year old twins were left unsatisfied by this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
men in black 3 review,Men in Black I liked the humour and the special effects. This film would appeal to adults and young adults. The plot is about aliens trying destroy the earth and will smith is trying to stop them.Will Smith- he did act very well.He has great comic timing and his facial expressions have to be seen to be believed. Tommy Lee Jones- he did a brilliant job. The special effects where very cool. I liked Boris the animal the best because I liked how he pulled the small spider out of his hand.There were also some fantastic scenes involving a rocket and an interesting twist in the plot towards the end of the film. Yes I would recommend this film to my family and friends to watch this film.,8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Back is the fun charm of the first movie.,"Did you love the first Men in Black? Me too! With its razor sharp writing, awesome visual spectacle, brisk pacing, and the hysterical chemistry between stars Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, it was the Sci-Fi genre's ultimate answer to the buddy comedy. And even if you wanted to neuralyze the second film right out of your memory, fear not. Men in Black 3 recreates the same unabashedly campy, slightly gross charm of the first movie, adding up to one surprisingly satisfying whole.In this third movie of the MIB - a top secret agency whose primary objective is to monitor extra-terrestrial activity on the planet earth - J and K are still kicking alien butt and taking names. However, due to a strange warp in time, K is killed by Boris the Animal, who travels back in time before K can shoot off his left arm and arrest him. J now has no other choice but to travel back to 1969 to work with a young K and help him stop Boris' evil plans once and for all.Aside from some massive gaps and inconsistencies in continuity, this is a delightful movie, and what I think the second film should have been. By returning to the roots of the first movie, Men in Black 3 anchors itself with solid pacing, and a fun story, and even if the humor is definitely not as successful as it was in the first movie, it's still funny enough, and even the bad jokes are still tolerable to a degree. As you would also expect, it continues to play up the seamless chemistry between the two leads, giving them plenty of shining comic relief, but also adding a surprising heart to their back stories. And to back all that up, plenty of great visual eye candy to go around. Specifically, makeup design legend Rick Baker is seriously deserving of Oscar attention for his really cool alien designs.Will Smith, aside from managing to make the film fun on his own, has a big task in the chemistry between two different actors. Tommy Lee Jones is absent for most of the film, leaving Josh Brolin to take his place as young K. Brolin is so uncanny in his mannerisms and deadpan delivery that one must assume that Jones gave him lessons on the role while the two were filming No Country for Old Men together. Jemaine Clement plays Boris the Animal with sinister relish. Not as humorous as Edgar, but nowhere near as flat and dull as Serleena. Michael Stuhlbarg and Emma Thompson also make the most of their small supporting roles.**** / *****",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A fond farewell,"It has been a long time since the first two movies, and I still can have laughs over those. So I look upon this as sort of a farewell to the franchise. The CGI is done very well, especially for Boris the animal, and he really is the alien focus of the film, which allows for a more personal story of K and J and how things developed between them. J has to go back before K even met him, traveling in time to prevent a disaster for the earth. And Josh Brolin does a good job of playing a young K. It is a very entertaining movie and simply is fun to watch. Nothing seems to phase K, and when he has to try and use the belt battery neuralyzer that was funny. I also liked J's comment about the goldfish being flushed down into the sewer, and adding Griff was a great idea.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Strong Basic Plot With Benefits,"27 May 2012. The basic premise of this story with its unexpected dark but at the same time light twist at the end was a scene to be savored along with a new trans-temporal personality make for a great entertaining show. The third time out, the emotional heart of this movie is in even greater display, Josh Brolin following up with another strong performance from his earlier W. (2008) portraying former President George W. Bush along with a nice dramatic dual relationship between agent J. and K. There are the same nice one-liners, along with the dry humor. Somehow off putting was the striking portrayal of violence at the beginning of the movie and Tommy Lee Jone's appearance at the beginning of the movie that seemed strikingly older and weathered, and in some ways tired performance which after the first scene picked up greatly into his smooth Agent K. Emma Thompson, as Agent O for all of her star charisma seemed somewhat underdeveloped and under-scripted, an opportunity lost. Nevertheless this was a solid movie with the action, humor, and compelling storyline making for a fun, enjoyable movie, one worth the money. Certainly no disappointment at all.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pictures of Matchstick Men,"Greetings again from the darkness. Uninspired sequels often prove quite annoying for a true movie fan. However, dedicated followers of a franchise often overlook the flaws and are just happy to see their familiar heroes back on screen. Back for a third time in 15 years, Agents J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) show they can do this in their sleep ... Mr. Jones may have actually dozed off a couple of times.Fortunately there are a couple of things that make this one entertaining enough. Josh Brolin's spot on imitation of Tommy Lee Jones may be better than the real thing. Brolin seems to be enjoying himself and realizes he is the featured attraction here. There is also a very creative segment that takes place at Andy Warhol's Factory ... with Bill Hader pulling off the Warhol look and voice quite well.Obviously with the Warhol segment, time travel is involved. That's the real disappointment here. Outside of the Apollo 11 segment and listening to Status Quo play ""Pictures of Matchstick Men"", the trip to 1969 is really a wasted opportunity for plot and humor. Also scarce is the use of aliens that were so prevalent in the first two. This time around, we get an overdose of Boris the Animal played by the always interesting Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords).Also back is Emma Thompson in a couple of brief scenes as Agent O. In addition to Brolin, we get new life from Alice Eve (a young Agen O) and Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin ... a less annoying version of Joe Pesci from the Lethal Weapon series. Director Barry Sonnenfeld has stuck with this franchise for all three entries. Let's hope it's now allowed to rest in peace.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

And to top it off it was hilarious enough to leave the wife, kids, and even myself laughing all Friday night.

old and nothing new. just plain boring.,"The continuity is as crap as crap can be, and that is something you don't see much in big budget films. J and K bicker like they've only been working together for like 14 days or so when in fact they have been working together for 14 years. It's not the bickering per se that I can not take but WHAT they bicker about, making it seem like J is a nooblet who just started.Another continuity problem is how K has this big secret room and some huge personal plan to defend earth from aliens that no one else knows of, something that anyone with average intelligence would share with others or at least SOMEONE before going into retirement and erasing his memory like he did in MIB 2.Other than that the story feels like a mix of the two previous movies and adds nothing new, interesting or exciting. Also, I was expecting to see K going into retirement once again but that didn't happen which doesn't feel logical at all having a guy in his eighties running around chasing bugs and I honesty thought after watching K and J fall down from the roof and seeing K's face afterwards that his career was going to be over.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Something to learn here,"I really enjoyed this movie. Many films which move between time zones can get very confusing. These time jumps were clear and well directed. I loved the character of Griffin. I study a lot about the new World Shift in Consciousness that the Mayan Calendar brought a lot of media attention to. It won't all happen on December 21, 2012 necessarily. It's a big process and has already started. We may not see the most dramatic changes until early 2013 but they are inevitable and they will be mind-blowing in a good way.What I've learnt about moving from a 3D perspective to a 5D perspective is exactly what Griffin's character has correct. It's about seeing all possibilities and probabilities as well as all circumstances that brought you to where you are now on any given topic. From there you can calculate what scenario is most likely but you can also bend fate in the direction of the ending you'd prefer. Pretty cool.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I miss Frank,"When Boglodyte alien Boris the Animal escapes from a maximum security lunar prison, he sets out to get his revenge on Agent K who arrested him and shot one of his arms off 40 years ago. Boris travels back in time to change history so that he carry out his planned attack on Earth. Armed with this knowledge, Agent J must also travel back in time and find young Agent K in order to make sure Boris isn't successful in rewriting history...One thing, MIB3 has, which the previous 2 films didn't particularly possess was a slicker story. It's clear that some thought had been put into the narrative and despite time-travel being the crux of the plot it isn't overly complicated and is fairly straight-forward to follow. I also found it interesting looking back at Agent K's younger years and seeing how and why he became the curmudgeon that we saw in his later years (viewers will understand his character much more by the end of the film).Tommy Lee Jones is side-lined for the majority of the film leaving Josh Brolin as Will Smith's sidekick for pretty much all of the film. Thankfully, the 2 men work well together and Jones' absence isn't quite as noticeable as it could have been. Josh Brolin does well in the role of young K taking us nicely through his journey and the chemistry between himself and Will Smith was also pretty good.I think what lets things down slightly here is that I didn't find it to be quite as funny as the previous 2 films; perhaps part of the reason for this lies with the darker and slightly more emotive plot line. A lot of effort had been put into the story, but I felt that this came at the expense of some of the dafter elements that made the previous films work.MIB3 is still not a bad film and given that this is the second sequel this really should be taken into context. It remains watchable without being particularly great.Final note; I did miss Frank the dog; he was funny.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The action scenes are well-executed, and the humor is clever and often hilarious. The plot is engaging and keeps the audience invested in the story, with a few surprising twists along the way.What sets Men in Black 3 apart from its predecessors is its ability to explore deeper themes about regret, redemption, and the importance of relationships.

Josh Brolin/ Tommy Lee Jones works,"The third outing for Men In Black burst onto my cinema screen last night and had me hooked right from the start.A vastly superior sequel to the second film,( and longer too )this film succeeds in that it is n't just another MIB formulaic outing.Time-travel needs careful handling in films and here, it makes it necessary to the plot. Josh Brolin stole the show for me though and made a hilarious and well voiced youthful Tommy Lee Jones. Not sure about Emma Thompson's 'age'in relation to Tommy Lee's.

After all These Years They've Still Got It,"Fifteen years ago Men in Black introduced us to agent's J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) of the Men in Black, a secret organization tasked with monitoring and policing alien life on earth, and keeping knowledge of it from the population at large. It was original, action packed, and oft hilarious. Five years after that came the sequel, which although having its moments was nothing to write home about. Now after a decade comes the third entry in the franchise, which exceeds not only expectations, but perhaps the original Men in Black as well.One of the better parts in the overall lackluster Men in Black II was that we got to delve, however briefly, into K's past. This time round, we don't just get flashbacks to his earlier adventures; we get to go there thanks to the magic of time travel. Because when Boris the Animal, one of K's deadliest enemies, busts out of prison and goes back in time to kill K and prevent his incarceration, the only hope of saving the earth and setting the timeline right is for J to 'time jump' back to 1969 and prevent his partner's murder. Once there, he finds that young agent K (Josh Brolin) is a completely different man from the one he knew, and that they'll be facing not one, but two Boris the Animals.First off, I just want to say that Brolin's imitation of Tommy Lee Jones is downright uncanny. His speech, his mannerisms, even the way he walks and shoots are nearly identical to the older actor's. I imagine that Brolin must have spent hours watching Jones' performances in the previous MIB films. The only major difference between their versions of the character (aside from the age gap) is that the younger K is more open, more upbeat, and seems to enjoy life more. At several points J asks ""What on earth happened to you man?"" to which K can only reply ""Don't know, hasn't happened yet."" The filmmakers must have had lots of fun with the retro elements of this movie. The hippies are worth a few laughs, as is the 1969 version of MIB headquarters, with the rows of typewriters, miniskirt wearing secretaries, and massive early versions of their modern gadgets. Even funnier is what happens when J is pulled over by a pair of New Jersey cops. Now I understand that the racial shtick can often be tiresome, or even offensive, but in this case the pay-off is golden, not least because the officers were partly right about J. I also enjoyed the brief references to Lady Gaga and Mick Jagger, and the 'truth' about Andy Warhol is pure genius.I sorely missed the presence of Frank the Pug, but I must admit that their new sidekick Griffin is really something else. He's a bit goofy, extremely nervous, and very much on the talkative side. His race experiences all possible futures at once, which is pretty handy, but also something of a drag since many of them don't end well and you can't always tell which will come to pass. And Griffin has plenty to be nervous about, what with Boris the Animal coming for him.And what really makes Men in Black III worthwhile is the ending. It's suspenseful, has great action, and puts an interesting new twist on the Apollo program. But best of all is the human drama. When the revelation comes of what made K the way is, it was highly touching and completely unexpected. More thought went into this scene alone than most Hollywood shoot-em-ups.Men in Black III is a solid action flick and comedy, with a surprisingly complex story and more character development than your average summer blockbuster. I would consider it equal to, if not better than, the original. If only they'd had the talking dog it would have been perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Casey's Movie Mania: MEN IN BLACK 3 (2012),"When we last saw MEN IN BLACK II (2002), that was like 10 years ago. So what's been keeping off MEN IN BLACK 3 to arrive sooner back then? To begin with, this long-delayed third installment of the successful MEN IN BLACK franchise has gone a treacherous journey to finally make it to the big screen -- troubled shoot without a finished script, production delays, and a particularly controversial Will Smith's 53-foot trailer (nicknamed ""The Heat"") which angered Manhattan residents during the filming process last year. And thanks to all the delays and hiatuses, MEN IN BLACK 3 costs a staggering $215 million budget to complete this notoriously-difficult production. When this movie finally came out, I went in with a low expectation (after all, a big-budget tentpole movie with so much negative buzz is always a disaster). But to my surprise, MEN IN BLACK 3 proves to be quite a decent sequel. The good news is, this third installment is a huge improvement over the messy MEN IN BLACK II. But the bad news is, this movie doesn't quite matches the entertainment level of the first MEN IN BLACK (1997)...Read more at http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2012/05/men-in-black-3-2012.html",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Men In Black III,"Saw the film in cinema with a 2D version, after 4 years absence from the screen, Will Smith eventually returns with his most tailor-made MIB suit as Agent J (with his craggier partner, Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K and the director at the helm of the franchise, Barry Sonnenfeld), the third installment keeps flourishing with all kinds of extraterrestrial creatures which serves its purpose to marvel the audience, that is, a chief achievement not only for this film but also for the entire series.Another requisite component is the wisecrack-gimmicks between J and K, the young Vs. old/ black Vs. white pair scrupulously sparks in the first half until the time travel gizmo operates, a straight-face Josh Brolin as the younger version of K (he is only 29 in the film? Nobody buys that, right?) doesn't register any screen chemistry with Mr. Smith. So with an ambiguous testimony for the sake of time-travel and aliens attack, the film has lost its beacon and the villain (Boris the Animal) is so airheaded and doesn't even has any kick and weight throughout (Boris' revolting kiss with Nicole Scherzinger has forewarned the film's scurrility and slackness) !Several passable gags like the O, K quip, a Andy Warhol mockery, Lady Gaga and Ming Yao's glance among the E.T. files are the gist of its integral viability as a summer blockbuster, the visual effects are just too standard compared with any other mega-budget productions. Among the supporting cast, a genie-like Michael Stuhlbarg as the hyper-intellectual Griffin who has a superpower to foresee the future and a M-in-the-room stance from Emma Thompson are indeed scene stealers.A gimmick of going back to 1969 has its intentionally retrospective charm has a and its plot fabrication with moon-landing also shows some shrewd wit in re-igniting the zeal from the modern-day audience (after all there is a 10 years gap between), but in the very end, especially after a saccharine father-bonding finale, it is only a wishful thinking, I hope at least it could revive Will Smith's screen presence, which should be the minimum favor and purpose of its own genesis.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

How they tie everything together is annoying and ruins the previous films, the worst kind of sequel.Overall this one provided little joy and a lot of annoyance, and in a mediocre franchise.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Back In Black! - And better than ever!,"I was extremely skeptical about this movie... so much so that I was going to refuse to watch it. The last MIB movie was absolutely terrible and had forever tarnished the franchise's reputation in my eyes.A couple friends of mine were talking about the movie and were interested in seeing it so I thought, fine, I'll give it a try (it wasn't MY money I was wasting!).Coming out of the movie, I was very impressed! This third installment reverts back to the roots of MIB, recreating all of the elements that made you fall in love with the boys in black to begin with.NOTABLE: Josh Brolin's performance is outstanding!; both the plot and subplot are amazingly well written. I always appreciate intelligent quips and little hints to major revelations; Loved the addition of the guide! Great character!; The villain in this movie is another great character and also well performed; the time travel scenario utilized in this movie was a big risk that could have gone terribly wrong. Instead, it was a brilliant move and well played. My appreciation of the MIB franchise has been revived.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best of all parts,"The entry into past and the interesting role of Boris, his escape from prison; meeting of Boris of past and future are all worth watching. The wit shows by J and his role in saving the life of K goes well. Above all the best part was the Griffin and his secret powers. He helps J&K in the most difficult situation and makes prophecies that hold true. Also worth noting was the rescue of J by K after his father gets killed in the encounter.

A Time Tale of Two undercover agents!,"A drag into the plot had proved sufficient enough to hold the nerve of the audience. Creepiness in the very beginning of the film strikes the gist of the film, provided for the nutty girls screaming next to me during the time of the show!Its a Will Smith show! Low and behold one can easily get the humor in his character and the timing of the jokes and manipulation of his character was good. This third installment is a sort of ""Struck with luck when Stuck in work"" kind of thing for him indeed. Josh Borlin and Tommy Lee Jones, two look-alike,act-alike,speak-alike personalities did add the essence and fragrance. Compared to the second installment, decade ago, the obscure plot was slightly smudging the transparency of the full length film. Provided the action and comedy clubbed together one can feel at ease and jot down ""it was fun while it lasted"".The break in the space-time continuum, the crazy nemesis Boris and his arm, an agent K, with boyish looks- grab you to a new step from the normal mode of fabrication of the MIB series. Despite of a few goofs, the film is good enough to be a day's replenishing errand. its a vision treat. Nevertheless this could be your light- hearted unforgettable weekend",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It's the ending and the beginning.,"I didn't write ""It's the ending and the beginning."" to seem cool. It's the summary of the movie as I understood it, you will understand why I wrote so when you watch the 3rd and 1st movie in the series.I didn't like or dislike previous movies because I had no reason to. Men in Black story doesn't interest me at all. Aliens could exist (a very likely possibility), watching stars make me see we are not alone in the universe but I have no idea if aliens would improve or destroy humanity but I have no reason to care about aliens because I have no alien in my life (as much as I know) to make them be useful or avoid them but to be honest some people seem like an alien (I'm joking). Men in Black life is very boring for me so if they had tried to recruit me I would just say ""hell no"". I'm no hero or villain. I have no noble or vulgar wishes, I just want to have fun in my own safe way for my life but Men in Black life is being a cat and jumping into a hole without caring about the possible dangers therefore I have no interest in Men in Black story per se. Also what if aliens live on Earth? It's not actually interesting. For me controlling aliens and hiding that fact from people is usual way of how society works. So in our world we control people and hide dangerous facts from people. There are people who serve their country and the world from the shadows because it's their job so being Men in Black is nothing different therefore their story is boring. But I've learned this movie is a time travel movie and I'm a sucker for time travel so of course I would watch this movie but the time travel aspect of the movie had no effect on my score.I liked this movie because of the character development of K and J and the way this movie link itself with the first movie. I enjoyed how the characters changed and the certain cycle of people is very realistic. K is a very interesting character to observe his character development while J being annoying sometimes but he is a good kid. Which this movie made me see J will be like K at some point and J realized it too therefore it made me glad and like the movie more.Do you remember D, the literally old partner of K in any way ""old"" means from the first movie? You watch K being like D in this movie. Being old and therefore having a sense of not doing anything unnecessary because you lack the energy and a wish because life is so boring and you cannot have fun. You even lose your sense of humor. Then you just go on doing what you should do. I can relate to this so much watching K made me realize as I get old I becoming more like K and it makes me afraid. I was like J when I was younger and now I'm like K in the first movie so my future is K in this movie. It's a rather personal 10/10 most people wouldn't care but here it's.This movie is more and better even when we sum up the first 2 movies. This movie made me care about the first movie and enjoy them actually. All I can say is if you didn't like the first 2 movies you better try this one. Or you can actually start from this one if you never watched a Men in Black before or you watched only the latest one. It's a movie that deserves a chance to at least start watching. I had lots of fun because of its humour and how smart the movie is. In fun scale this movie is most fun movie than 1st and 4th movie and 2nd movie is the most boring one in the series.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
written for a 12 year old,"I think this movie was written for kids. It's too silly for adults to enjoy. The aliens are so silly in this,ie the big fish at the restaurant, and the jokes seemed to be geared for kids. And there is a sentimental lesson learned in the end.Agents J and K are back and J must go back in time to save K from an alien, which in turn, saves Earth. J teams up with a young K, whom has the same characteristics. Josh Brolin pulls off Tommy Lee Jones' accent perfectly. Also, J leans what great, sentimental thing K did for him when he was a kid.FINAL VERDICT: Make it a movie night for teens.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Men in Black finally gets a second sequel - but with so many possible pitfalls, MIB III is surprisingly enjoyable.","It is not often that one has the privilege of reviewing a second sequel to an almost 15-year- old franchise and actually liking it. At this point in the film industry, it is commonplace to become jaded with the onslaught of sequels, chalking the lack of new intellectual properties to the cursed dearth of originality in Hollywood. And indeed, Men In Black III doesn't make any real effort to distinguish itself from its most successful predecessor - but in this case, with the first Men in Black having achieved such monstrous success and its sequel being such an awful follow-up, this close-hewed threequel is a much more welcome addition to the franchise.When I suggest that Men in Black III calls heavily on the original film, I mean that it does so in its tone and nature, not in plot points or story beats. No, MIB III steers well-clear of the simple rehash trick that MIB II attempted, following a twisting narrative arc which echoes the charming novelty of the first film by confusing, tricking, and ultimately pleasing its audience with its central mystery. In the end, I believe the fact that Men in Black III began shooting without a script might have been its greatest asset, because while the film clearly has a beginning, middle, and end, it feels unstructured in a very positive, well-paced, organic sort of way.I admit I have never actually sat down and read Lowell Cunnhingham's Men in Black comics from which the first film was adapted - I am told they are sport a much darker tone and incorporate not only extraterrestrials, but supernatural beings, as well, and killing is often the favored alternative to a simple neuralyzing. Having grown up with the more lighthearted, charming take Barry Sonnenfeld has had on the property, I have to say I really couldn't have expected MIB III to be any different than it is. It is a silly film that appropriately sports snappy dialogue, and lots of fun comedic interplay between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones/Josh Brolin.If there is one thing that the critics' circle seems to agree on, it's that Josh Brolin's performance is solid gold - as a younger, warmer version of Tommy Lee Jones's Agent K, he adds significant dimensionality to the latter's characterization. In a risky move, Sonnenfeld makes a point of illustrating K's 2-dimensionality at the film's opening, leaving the audience thinking that, in fact, K is actually quite a boring protagonist. However, this initial downplaying works well as a set-up for the surprisingly deep character study filling the rest of the film's runtime. Once the mystery about K's past is revealed and Will Smith's Agent J is returned to the present, we have a restored and renewed appreciation for the deadly serious Agent K.Will Smith benefits from his clear adoration for the MIB universe; he exudes happiness at returning to one of his most famous starring roles, quipping and mugging like the first Men In Black came out yesterday. As aforementioned, Tommy Lee Jones's character feels hollow until the end of the film, but this is not at all the fault of the actor - taking up minimal screen time and handing most of the character development to his younger counterpart were necessary sacrifices for the sake of the plot. A new side character named Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg) is also introduced in MIB III whose role I won't spoil, but I will mention that I found Stuhlbarg's neurotic performance to be strong and interesting and his character's design to be quite fascinating.The storyline of Men In Black III focuses on the mystery of K's past, using the mechanic of time travel for the first time in the franchise. I certainly felt as I watched the film that this time travel element paralleled the ""Orion's Belt"" puzzle in the first film, while K's enigmatic past seemed to mirror the novelty of our introduction to the world of the Men In Black in the opening scenes of the first film. In this way, the movie made a significant and well-conceived departure from the formulaic approach of the first sequel in favor of becoming a more spiritual successor to the tone of the original film. On that note, MIB III includes several subtle references to elements from the first movies, particularly Frank the Pug, which add to its familiar atmosphere. It is also certainly worth mentioning that seven-time Oscar-winner Rick Baker is back for a third go-round designing the aliens for the film, and every creature that is introduced feels completely germane to the MIB universe. The effects are more than sound, as well, which help establish that ever-evasive believability factor.Most people did not have high hopes for this threequel. I know I didn't even include it on my list of 2012 films to see because of the horror show that was Men in Black II. Nevertheless, I found Men in Black III to be a mostly funny, light, and even heartfelt revisit with Agents J and K, who at this point feel like old friends. I didn't know how much I wanted to see a fourth entry before, but having been exposed to the deeper characterizations of both J and K in this film, I think the opportunity for more adventures with this oddball couple wouldn't be the worst thing to happen to the franchise... provided they remember what failed miserably in II, and stick to what worked in I and III.Verdict: Movie WinIMDb Score: 80% (86%)~ SørenA Note on Graffiti Aliens - I know I saw a graffiti alien in the first trailer for Men In Black III, but he seems to be absent from the film. I know the design got a lot of flack around the interwebs for being too silly, so it may have been removed.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very imaginative - Prequel / Sequel,"It has been over 10 years since the last
MIB Movie and MIB-III was definitely a
worth the wait. Calling this film as a sequel
is injustice, It partly a prequel too. The film
is about Ajent J (Will Smith) exploring the
past of Ajent K (Tommy Lee Jones, Josh
Brolin). Yes, there was an antagonist Boris
the Animal (played by Jemaine Clement).But at no point of the movie audience feels
that that he is going to triumph. Pussy Cat
fame Nicole Scherzinger does a cameo as
the villain's side kick.Josh Brolin does an exception job of fitting
into the 1969 version of Ajent K, the char-
acter Tommy has built over the previous 2
films. He has wonderfully accomplished the
hard job of tickling the funny bone, with-
out the license to go crazy like Will Smith.Michael Stuhlbarg plays the friendly alien
Griffin. Griffin is a 5 dimensional being and
is able to experience all the possibilities at
any point of time. I found his dialogues im-
aginative and unusually funny.MIB is all about action and comedy; Often
story in such movies take a beating. But I
loved the way that this movie's story was
woven into real human history; to me it is
a sign of some thought put into the story.In this movie it was about the connection
to Apollo 11 launch. I also tend to like Sci-
Fi stories that involve time travel; it gives
room for a lot of creativity but makes the
job of the writer harder. He has to make
sure that there are no loose ends and still
keep the story simple enough. I would say
it was a job well done.3D technology has become the order of
the day, but don't get excited too much.MIB is no Avatar. You will enjoy the movie
equally with or without the 3D glasses. I
would actually prefer not having to wear
the annoying 3D glasses.For MIB fans, It is a must watch for this
summer holiday season. For those new to
MIB, you will definitely enjoy it as it is. It
will make you come back home and watch
the previous 2 movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Weak Film,I do not know at all what the crew were thinking or trying to do when they were creating this weak film. This weak film did not make any real sense at all and did not have any real direction at all. The storyline of this film was too awful and bad and basic and poor and simple and straightforward and weak. The cast selection could have been a whole lot better and stronger. They did not at all commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. There was not any sign of real chemistry at all displayed throughout this entire awful and poor and weak film between the cast members.,1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Meh...,"I can't say I loved this movie. It lacked the wit and the charm of the first two. Tommy Lee Jones was sorely missed throughout most of this movie as his character as a younger man was played by Josh Brolin (who did a decent job imitating Lee) throughout most of the film. The problem was there was no chemistry between Brolin and Smith as there was with Lee and Smith and that is what ultimately takes this movie down to 4 stars for me. That chemistry was sorely missed and made the whole movie a bit ho-hum for me.One thing I did like was the ending, but a good surprise ending was not enough to save this move for me. I actually would have turned it off half way through but it was movie night with my husband and he seemed to be enjoying it so I stuck it out. But it's not one I will watch again unlike the first MIB which I have watched at least four times over the years.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Outstanding movie! This is so Genuinely FUNNY!,Genuinely funny means you don't have to think about or anticipate or expect to laugh as you watch a comical title like this. It is just so hilariously funny with lots of substance and you will most definitely enjoy it like so many others and I have. It is much better either of the last Men in Black. Best watch in 3D as there is lots of action and lots of scenes where outstanding use of 3D technology is presented. There is lots of situations where the characters have to just be themselves and it blends in with the whole plot very well. The transition in the old and young agent K was amazing. There was so much thought put into the detail involved with making these two pre and post characters a delight to compare and contrast. I guarantee you will like it :),10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Chix Chat on Film Review: MIB back to the future.,"Men In Black 3 takes us on a journey into the past that was very enlightening because you recognize that you are given answers to questions that you did not realize you had asked. It turns out that we witness a fourteen year partnership has transpired between Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) that brings about the realization that the first MIB was fifteen years ago! We see that some of the original favorite characters real or otherwise like the worms are still around and others real or otherwise have moved on. The series has always had great villains whose endeavors will bring about the destruction of the planet, and the only reason we can continue in our daily lives is that we don't know about it. Thank you Men In Black for keeping me safe in my naiveté. This time around our villain is Boris The Animal (Jermaine Clement) who prefers plain Boris, who is over the top mean. It took me a moment to recognize who he is and then I thought Flight of the Conchords and Dinner For Schmucks, the make-up was done very well and I should also mention the special effects. Boris had an interaction moment that took me back to Time Cop, but I won't get into that since I don't want to give anything away. We know from the trailer that Agent J travels into the past to save the future and this adventure allows him to interact with a younger Agent K played by Josh Brolin. It was truly amazing how well he channeled the Agent K persona, if I didn't know that they were two different people it would have been hard trying to convince me that it wasn't actually a younger Tommy Lee Jones. The story has a lot of interesting dynamics taking place in the past all centered around Agent K and some surprising connections, the Agent K and Boris history is where the plot thickens. There were so many funny moments in this film and as with its predecessors there is a pulling at the heart strings moment. As always the special effects give these films such a realistic feel. I'm still impressed by how young Will smith still looks and how old Tommy Lee Jones looks. I hope that since the MIB helm is now in the hands of Agent O (Emma Thompson) that this won't be the final installment. The film gets a green light from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The best in the series,"When I first heard they were making a new Men In Black movie I was extremely exited, then I found out that this one would feature time travel then I was even more exited, and finally after viewing the film I was more than pleased I walked out of the theatre with a smile on my face.The film sticks to true Men In Black style they are after one particular alien, and this alien was by far the best alien villain in the Men in Black series and definitely the most intelligent in the series, to go back in time to erase Agent K from the future.I have to be honest, I was a tiny bet worried when I first heard that Josh Brolin would be playing Agent K for most of the movie, but while I was viewing the movie you can hardly notice because Josh Brolin did an amazing job at acting like Tommy Lee Jones, But Tommy Lee Jones don't have too small off a role he still has a fair bit of screen time.The special effects in this movie were also great they really outdone themselves with this one, it by far has the best effects out off all the Men in Black movies, I also love what they did when Agent J(Will Smith) travels back in time and they actually did a fantastic job at making the background look like the 1960's.Also, you can't have a Men in Black movie without the comedy, this one does not disappoint when it comes to comedy, this is the funniest one yet. Not only is it funny but this one actually has a very beautiful ending but I'm not going to give it away.Best Men in Black movie yet, highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Fun to watch, even if it is the third M:I:B","The success of the first ""Men In Black"" mostly relied on the wonderful chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. The second M:I:B wasn't that great, but the magic between the two actors was enough to keep the film together. A third M:I:B makes one wonder whether another collaboration between Jones and Smith could deliver another nice flick in the series. The answer is yes. The one-liner exchanges and witty humor that the two share is once again fun to watch.This ""Men In Black"" does not just rely on the wit of the two stars. There is a surprisingly good story that involves time travel, the 1960s, and a Young Agent K. Josh Brolin plays Young K to the hilt; his mannerisms and blunt attitude are dead-on. Jemaine Clemente does a tour de force as the villain, Boris The Animal. He is a mean, deranged nutjob that kills without a thought and shows no compassion. Like with the Bug in the first film, the make up artists make his appearance look all the more grotesque and menacing. The master in this movie is Michael Stuhlberg as the alien Griffin. His performance reminds me of a savant that is very gifted in foreseeing things. It is hard to not like his character. He has a wit and mild sense of humor that he delivers flawlessly.Like the other M:I:B films, there are good special effects, comedy in the face of destruction, and a new vast array of alien species. The only problem I had with this M:I:B is the gratuitous violence. It is nothing that surpasses the PG-13 rating, but the body count and amount of destruction is much higher than both of the other films combined. And there are some pretty unpleasant scenes involving aliens, specifically in regards to food. This is just a fair warning in case anyone brings popcorn or sodas to their viewing of this movie. You'll never think of fish and dough the same again.M:I:B 3 is a treat to watch. It is better than the second, but it is sacrilegious to say that it beats the original.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Comedy and drama unevenly united.,"This film insists on the leading role of Will Smith, limiting the spirit of the work to his histrionic capacity. It is known that his acting conditions are not as superior as those of Brolin or Lee Jones and there we find a big mistake. The development of the film takes us to a future where we foresee a tragedy (something not welcome in a family film) while from time to time we are offered the usual humorous sequences. The villain is almost invincible but his weakness lies in his frustrating human condition (seeking revenge) and that disqualifies him as his superior entity. For this reason, defeating him becomes simple and the end, despite being predictable, does not stop touching your heart. Should one feel sensitive in family comedies? My answer is no.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Really entertaining!,"I was young when the first Men in black hit the big screen, and I loved it. It was fast, funny, action-filled, lots of cool stuff, good CGI, it took me, and the world, by storm!Then some years later the second one came, and it was kind of a disappointment. The ending was crappy. And the series died.. For a while. But then! Men in Black 3! Suddenly!And you know, I was really entertained through out the whole thing, pretty much. I love that both Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles, and Josh Brolin is an excellent addition. I guess it has to be said that when a movie has time travel, I'm pretty much sold. At least it really helps. I just love time travel. Love it.But the action in this is really good. Will Smith is just the right amount of Will Smith. It's very nicely paced, not too long, I just think they did it right with this one.It does not reinvent the wheel or gun powder, but no movie ever does, and when people think movies do, they don't really. And it doesn't matter if we've seen stuff before, as long as it is done well. And this is just entertaining.I know I totally overuse the word entertaining in my reviews, but hey, entertainment is what I am looking for in a movie.

ET phone it in,"A decade since the previous film and fifteen years since the first, was anyone really looking for this film to be made? Well – apart from the accountants I mean. Despite this, MIB3 came to be this year and I could not have cared less as it entered the cinemas as yet another blockbuster seeking to carry a franchise on for longer than it probably should (although the previous film did that already). The plot here sees Tommy Lee Jones doing as little as possible while Will Smith goes back in time to work with a younger version of him (played by Josh Brolin). The story (such as it is) allows for the usual alien special effects and reasonable set-pieces but there is a common thing that runs through every aspect of the film: it really does just dial the whole thing in.It is hard to describe but it does feel like a film that has been made because somebody calculated what it would cost against what it would make due to franchise legacy, retro-bump and good old fashioned blockbuster appeal. There isn't the energy and fun there was in the first film; it has its moments and it does seem to have the best intentions at heart, but it just doesn't come off. The comedy rarely drew a smile from me – the noise distracted me from my ironing but it didn't do more than that. The action set pieces are so-so despite the effects and generally I wasn't sure what was supposed to hook me into the film because it didn't make me laugh, didn't thrill me, didn't intrigue me and really didn't entertain me. It doesn't have the decency to be bad though – it merely goes through the motions in a way that did very little.The cast involved mystifies me too – so many of them have no need to be in this film unless they had contractual obligations or the pay check was huge (which, given the budget, I guess it must have been for the majority of them). Certainly Will Smith has no need to do this film and he never seems comfortable doing his late 90's routine here – he has grown beyond that and he cannot make it work. Of course he looks like he is hitting every mark when you put him next to Tommy Lee Jones, who looks like he really would sooner be anywhere else if it were for the million or so dollars he is getting for this. Brolin does a good impression of his older version, but it is never more than an impression. Clement is never given anything of note to do while Thompson is just wasted without a doubt. Other faces are in here too, but nobody does anything worth mentioning.Men in Black 3 is the result of a series of business meetings from a studio looking for a profitable summer movie; there can be no other real reason for it existing. This genesis infects the whole film and from acting to writing to set-piece delivery, it all seems to feel like it was dialed in and that the creative juices never flow. Distracting but really nothing more than expensive noise designed to extend a franchise for the sake of extending it.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Fresh Blast From The Past,"Agent J travels in time to MIB's early years in the 1960s, to stop an alien from assassinating his friend Agent K and changing history.I saw the first trailer of this movie and I thought,""here we go again, another boring sequel"" and then the second trailer came out and was good so I thought it was worth a shot. I went to the Cinema with an open mind as I also really wanted to see Will Smith on the big screen after such a long absence. Also having enjoyed the first movie a great deal, I just wanted this movie to exceed the second and that was all I asked for so my expectations were relatively low.My, was I surprised. It is no secret that the second movie is a disaster but MiB3, though not quite the first due to plot holes, still strongly holds its own. The Cinematography is beautiful and quite exceptional too as the depiction of the 1960s setting was breathtaking; and even the celebrity Cameos are a delight to see. I still wonder how they consented to appear in this picture (I won't spoil the fun and mention their names). The sequence of agent Jay falling through time is beautiful as well. Perhaps as any in Hollywood Cinema.The movie still isn't perfect due to plot holes like some references Jay makes in the past that do not coincide with the time line. In all, what makes this movie fresh and is also its heart is its well written script and its cast. Of course Will Smith returns as Agent Jay and is allowed to just be his enthusiastic, spontaneous and charismatic self that has endeared us to him over the years delivering a lot of comic wits. Tommy Lee Jones could do no wrong also as the stern and serene Agent Kay. The Jay and Kay dynamic didn't quite work well in the first ten to fifteen minutes of the movie and it still seemed like they were first time partners even though the movie time frame in the present coincides with ours which is a decade after their first meeting. All this boredom were put to rest as soon as we jump to the past to meet with the younger Agent Kay as portrayed by Josh Brolin and he is quite easily the superstar of this show. This performance is as close to perfection as any can get with his accurate impersonation of the serene but quick wit expression of Tommy Lee Jones that we have grown accustomed to over the years. His performance was so great that it made the character of a young Emma Thompson/Agent O seem a lot out of place. He made his character work so well that you could see how this 29 year old agent Kay could well transform into the present Agent we well know. And even with this impersonation, he did well to make the character his own in a lot of ways.The dynamic between Agent Jay and the younger Agent Kay really carries the movie and this could be the one out of the three with the most heart in the MiB franchise. It seemed to focus a lot on character development and this is a huge plus for the movie. Some of the humor did fall flat but a lot of it works. The supporting cast were not left out as their performances were impeccable both for drama and comedy and did I fail to mention Jermaine Clement as the Evil Boris the animal.If you were a fan of the first MiB movie, you should go and see this. If you hated or weren't quite fond of the second, you should really go and see this.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Hallucination,"There is a good enough story here, which is the first surprise.I will just tease here the main narrative thread, never-mind for a moment that this is for a MIB movie. It is anchored in two spots, a surly old man has regrets over something that happened a long time ago and we are told, regret is the biggest 'force' in the universe, regret as memory as the ability to envision an internal space. Indeed, the switch to the alternate timeline happens in the middle of a phonecall to his partner, as he is (we presume) about to unburden himself.What happens in that alternate reality? Time-travel, we literally go on to visit the old man in his youth. Inside that remembered past, there is an alien visitor who has the ability to similarly open portals of vision to alternate narrative threads. So this is pretty good, the rift between two friends as the rift in the cinematic time-space continuum.So why isn't this much good in the end?Sonnenfeld is simply filming without focus. The decision, e.g, to set the past story in the time of Vietnam and Barbarella is great, it could be taken in so many directions, but instead lazily milked for flat jokes.Josh Brolin is great though, someone give the man his Lonesome Dove.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Men in Black 3,Men in Black 31. Give your opinion – highlight elements you enjoyed and elements you disliked. I disliked Men in Black because it is not my sort of thing. 2. Say what audience you think the film would appeal to Teenagers and adults who enjoy humour.3. Brief outline of the plot. DO NOT give away the surprise ending! Men in Black is about escaping from prison to the moon. It could be science fiction because it has a rocket (Apollo 11) and aliens.4. Actors – who are they – did they act well? Will Smith is the main actor because he is a senior agent. He acted very well. Tommy Lee Jones was the other senior agent.5. Special effects what did you think of them? The special effects were very impressive but the part where the man caught on the alien's tongue made me cringe.6. Summary – would you recommend this film? I recommend it to anyone who likes science fiction and has a good sense of humour.,,Anonymous,Comedy
A persuasive argument for the continuation of the franchise.,"It isn't exactly a persuasive argument for the continuation of the franchise, but Men in Black III is better than its predecessor and manages to exceed expectations.",,Anonymous,Comedy
