A Beautiful Unforgettable Masterpiece that shows the true cost of war.,"I decided to watch Grave of the Fireflies yesterday. My friends told me it was extremely moving and sad. I hesitated at first, but then I said ""Oh well, I'll give it a try."" At the end of the film, I was crying my eyes out. This was the best animated film, I've ever seen.This is a moving depiction of the fates of cast-off children who become casualties of war.This movie isn't your regular Animated Film. Pixar and Disney put films out there with happy endings. I'm not saying there bad films at all. They are also great pieces of work. But Grave of the Fireflies tells you the truth. This movie isn't trying to entertain you. It wants to inform you about how war is really like. There were many moments in the movie, that just brought me to tears.I am kind of upset, that this movie didn't get many awards as it should. In that regards, it is VERY underrated and it is kind of thrown apart. When it should really be respected and praise it. If this movie was made in our time period right now. I would be 100% sure this would of Won an Oscar for Best Animated Film. This is Studio Ghilbi's best movie they have ever released.I truly advice you to bring a handkerchief, cause chances are that you will cry.An Emotional Epic Animated Film, that I recommend everyone to watch.Quite Simply 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best movie you'll never want to see again,"I had the fortune of being able to see Hotaru no Haka on the big-screen in Seattle a couple of years ago.  It was truly the high-point of my film festival excursions.  At the end of the movie, there was silence, absolute and total silence in the theater - and then, only an occasional sniffle until the end credits had finished rolling and the house lights came up.  It would've seemed almost disrespectful to profane the silence with words.Seeing a movie like this really changes attitudes about war - about who really suffers, and that the honor and glory is shallow comfort when you contemplate what has been lost in the struggle.I've made the comment to my friends that if you ever see someone who isn't moved (usually to tears) by this movie, you've found someone without a soul. As difficult as it is to watch, turn off the phone, dim the lights, and immerse yourself in the film with ones you love - you will be a better person for it in the end.There are many other reviews of this movie, and most of them are probably far more comprehensive than my own - I'll conclude by saying that this movie should required viewing at some point (as should the peace museums at Hiroshima and Nagasaki) for everyone.When you see war and conflict in the news or read about it in the paper, think back to this movie - your perspective will probably be broadened, and your eyes opened a bit more.I've only watched this movie about 4 times - it usually takes a year or so to ""decompress"" after watching it.  To see it too often would lessen the impact, and that would be the worst possible thing to do to this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Haunting,"I was warned this movie would be emotional, but I had no idea just how understated that was.  By the end, my friend and I were huddled together, pouring out tears I've never shed for any movie before.  It was a mix of horror, empathy, sadness, and so many more emotions I can't even begin to list.Visions of this film have haunted me since first watching it, and I would find it hard to watch again, simply from it being so heart-wrenching. Only one movie has ever hit me hard enough to keep me from subjecting myself to it's strong emotions again (The thief, the cook, his wife and her lover).I strongly urge all to watch this, as it rises well about any films I've seen, anime or not.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A powerful film that shows the true cost of war,"""Grave of the Fireflies"" is one of the most ambitious, depressing, and quite frankly, best films that I've ever seen. I was nearly moved to tears by this film's brave treatment of such critical subject matter. Yes, it's an Anime' piece, but surprisingly, it came out in 1988, during a time where most Japanese animation films were either relentless bloodbaths, borderline pornography, or both.As a fan of the Anime' genre of film-making, many great pieces have achieved some sort of cult status here in America, yet none have really reached mainstream success. Some have broken through the barrier and have gained acceptance with American critics, like Katsuhiro Otomo's ""Akira,"" or ""Princess Mononoke,"" or ""Spirited Away"" (both films directed by Hayao Miyazaki). One that I've seen and has been barely mentioned by most critics is ""Grave of the Fireflies.""What we have with ""Grave of the Fireflies,"" is a story of innocence lost and two children who ultimately face a losing battle with trying to survive in a small Japanese village in the closing days of World War II. WWII was the costliest conflict in world history, with millions dead and thousands left to pick up the pieces.In the center of it, are the aforementioned two children, who are pretty much left to fend for themselves after their mother is killed in a bombing raid. Because their father is off fighting in the war and they have no way of contacting any other family, they're sent to live with their aunt, who is at first warm and welcoming to them, but eventually becomes very cruel and the children are forced to live in a nearby bomb shelter. From that point on, the two children embark on a journey that is every bit as unpleasant and difficult as the grim realities of the world around them.Very easily one of the best Anime' films that I've ever seen (or any animated film for that matter), I find it difficult to believe just how truly overlooked ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is. The animation is beautiful, though certainly not dated by any means (even though Japanese animation has progressed well since this film was made).We get a sense of the dread of the two lead characters, who watch as the world around them crumbles into heaps of ashes, and aircraft loom ominously overhead, dropping their deadly, incendiary cargo on unsuspecting Japanese villagers.The director, Isao Takahata, obviously has a special resentment of the war, but manages to avoid condemning it outright. The director instead lets us focus in on the conflict as seen through the eyes of the two children, who watch unflinchingly as the realities of their world begin to falter before them.""Grave of the Fireflies"" is a bold statement on the condition of the human soul during conflict. I probably shouldn't say this but I am anyways, but this film has to be the ""Schindler's List"" of animated pieces. It's brave, it's not overly sentimental, but it is relentless in its dramatization of a dangerous reality. It should be required viewing in any high school world history class.A beautiful film; not to be missed by anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
More moving than you could ever expect,"This film is utterly emotionally draining whilst being rewarding at the same time.The animation is both realistic and stylized but that's not the point, the main focus of this film is the character development of the brother and sister protagonists. Their relationship is nothing short of beautiful and touching.And without spoiling anything I have to say that this film touched me in a way no other film has ever touched me in my adult life. One or two films have upset me and reduced me to watery eyes but Grave of the Fireflies had me in fits of sobbing despair. I was a mess! I'm talking total emotional breakdown. Couldn't talk without sobbing! One of the best films I have EVER seen, animated or not.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brutally honest and heartbreaking,"Being my first Anime review I thought I'd start off with my one of my favourite pieces of work from who else but Studio Ghibli. Ghibli have rarely produced anime that doesn't fall short of great but Graveyard is something different indeed.Set in the aftermath of World War II, Graveyard is focused on the lives of a caring brother and his young sister (Setsuko and Seita) and how they struggle against both the elements of wartime and a depreciating Japanese empire. The most striking thing about Graveyard is probably how real everything seems. The animation is very unconventional to the likes of say Spirited Away or Laputa but in a good way. The horror of war is beautifully realised through the animation, whether it be the American destruction being shown or the bleak outlook on peoples lives, namely the two main characters. Thankfully it earns every shred of emotion it conveys through these two sympathetic characters that only the coldest of hearts wouldn't warm up to.Avoiding any Hollywood sentimentality, it is often a bleak and depressing perspective depicted but all the more brutally powerful in the process. With my eyes welling up through the duration of the film, it occured to me just how well the Director understands what raw heartfelt emotion is and how to play the audiences heart strings. Nevertheless nothing is shown in a heavy handed approach, no empthasis is put on the Americans nor is there any special attention taken to the war details. If anything the citizens of Japan are shown in the coldest light often giving little help to the plight of others, but demonstrating furthermore what desperate situation everyone is in.Takahata instead decides to focus on the plight of it's title characters against the background of war. With the empire of Japan in crisis and food shortages everywhere it is heart breaking to see a brother struggle to meet ends meet for his sister. Due to the approach taken it borders on being horrifying but fortunately the tone is changed with the spirit put into Setsuko's character. Much like 'The Pianist' the issue is not the war but the struggle and will to survive in it. This is clearly displayed in a plot that revolves around the downward spiral Setsuko trying to feed himself and more importantly the younger and more vulnerable sister Seita. The animation though detailed and indeed beautiful in some sequences (namely relating to the title), is not by any means flashy but captures emotions and interactions between the characters perfectly. It's the perfect mixture of such animation, realistic and highly likeable characters that makes the whole film one tearful experience. Dealing with such difficult issues it's very hard to imagine this being a film and if it was I don't think it would of been done as well.Part of the brilliance also comes from symbology and the association to many different worlds in such a understanding depiction. The child, Seita, is nothing short of perfection in child like behaviour happily oblivious to the desperate situation, amusing herself with simplicity and the quirks of nature and the outdoors. The older brother Setsuko who must carry the burdon of everything is also perfectly portrayed and to watch there decent is painful to say the least. To struggle is one thing but to have shock, shattered dreams and be depended on is something anyone can empthasise with.There may be some people who will shy away from Anime, disregarding it as a mere cartoon. To those people and everyone else I recommend Graveyard as the tonic, which can be appreciated by anyone with a heart and soul. Among the finest pieces of Anime created and one of the most touching war films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Heartbreaking...,"This film proves without any doubt that animation isn't just suited to tales of fantasy, sci-fi or cartoon comedy and violence. This absolutely heartbreaking Japanese anime tells the story of a young boy, Seito and his younger sister, Setsuko, as they attempt to survive the American bombings on Japan in the last year of World War II.The story itself, based on a true story, is powerful enough but the decision to animate the film truly elevates this film to a higher level. This would have been a powerful enough live action drama, along the lines of Spielberg's Empire of the Sun or even Schindler's List. However, the Studio Ghibli team, have brought an extraordinary amount of life to all the characters, but especially the young siblings. Now we're not talking realism as such here - the characters are in no way photo-realistic, they do have the usual characteristics of Japanese anime humans, large eyes and exaggerated expressions. What this achieves however is a heightened level of subtle nuances in expression which are arguably more powerful and provocative than anything a real-life actor may achieve. Some may claim this is overly manipulative or sentimental, but coupled with the characters movements and actions, it gives the characters such a strong, and very human, presence. You truly care for these kids, which is an astonishing achievement. The voice cast (original Japanese) contributes significantly here also.It is the tiny moments which give this film so much power and emotional depth - from subtle expressions to brief scenes showing Seito playing with his sister at bath time, attempting, unsuccessfully, to cheer her up when she misses her mother. The painted backgrounds are works of art in themselves, just beautiful. And of course the scenes with the fireflies bring a touch of pure magic - a heightened innocent reality to contrast the horrific realities of the war.The greatest achievement of this film is that, apart from a couple of obviously sentimental scenes, such as Setsuko's sobbing or illness, it doesn't force any false emotion on the viewer. It really comes from your involvement with the characters. It's completely honest to it's own story and even cuts off scenes abruptly, which could potentially have been milked for cheap sentiment. It often seems to say - This is what happened, you don't need to see anymore. Another of it's strengths is that it really doesn't comment on the politics of the war in any way, just the effects on innocent people.This is an intensely moving film and a masterpiece of animation. If you aren't moved by these characters, you really need to check your pulse. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
All around depressing yet it's well executed,"The story opens up strongly having the ending shown first, and letting the main character to tell the rest of the story. All around we see people trying to be strong, to be tough in the middle of the harsh environment of war torn civilians. We also see every scope of human nature manifested in this kind of environment, in which people tend to seek their own survival, whatever the means may be. Those can also include how the aunt cheated on the kids about the food and that the aunt's daughter eventually did nothing to help them. What I like from the movie is that there's no depiction of depressed desperation as to leading to suicide. This convey the message to be strong. I watched the Japanese version with English subtitling; the voice acting is very nice. Setsuko's voice are very much the standard cute Japanese little girl, While Seita's voice can really make the character relate to how brothers defend for their kid brother/sister.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Greatest War Film?,"A tragic film covering a young boy and his little sister's struggle to survive in Japan during World War II.Apparently people, including Roger Ebert, consider this one of the greatest -- or perhaps the greatest -- war film ever made. Now, that is interesting because it is a cartoon. You never expect that, and this might not be something you want to show kids. It is pretty bold, with wounded people, maggots, and anyone can die.Even more interesting is how it takes place from the point of view of a Japanese youth during World War II. He is not nationalistic, he is not anti-American, he is just a kid. And is that not the truth of war? No matter who is right or wrong, millions of kids become the victims.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Respectable effort, but I wished for more depth to the characters, as well as less frustrating character actions!","(SOME MAJOR SPOILERS) Animation is often a favourable genre as far as I'm concerned regardless of the maturity of the content. 'Grave of the Fireflies' tackles a tough issue, and is pretty much an animated film for adults or older children. As the content deals with the children who are left behind during any-given war, and how they become adjusted to a new way of living.Naturally, being an anime film, it takes the Japanese perspective of World War II, and how the American fire bombings affected the civilians, particularly from the viewpoint of teenage boy, Seita, and his extremely young sister in Setsuko. In the opening scene of the film, it displays the tragic outcome of the lead character, so we immediately know that this isn't going to be a very happy film! The journey of Seita and Setsuko is an interesting one, but also, a frustrating one to watch.I found myself a little annoyed at some of Seita's actions, although it can be related to youthful rebellion and ideals of being able to survive in the wilderness on your own. The conflict between the Aunt towards Seita and Setsuko seemed extremely harsh, and there could have been more depth to the Aunt's intense dislike of her relatives, cause I think it was needed. Although, I did like the play on the Aunt's use of provisions, and her sense of worthiness when allocating them to her immediate family- even though Seita had provided those provisions. It was a subtle way of showing something deeper to the relationship. The Aunt seemed to think they were ungrateful, yet she was equally ungrateful for what they had sacrificed! The scene where the Aunt asks Seita about school is priceless in displaying the undertones of her manner towards him, revealing the nature of her contempt for him- but I still wish there was more exploration as to why she disliked a young boy and his four-year old sister so much. It seemed a little harsh that any person would treat children like that after a horrendous aftermath to their living situation, and especially during wartime survival, and that's why I think there should have been more exploration of that family unit's history. There was a subtle hint at the Uncle's cowardice, but again, his character was hardly in it to be given depth.The other problem I had was Setsuko. She was far too young to be realistically left in the care of her brother, and she seemed to be able to comprehend far too much for someone so young, and as a character, I found her slightly annoying. There was some touching moments between her and Seita though, especially when she follows him to the police station, as well as when he's trying to shield her from the horrors of war. 'Grave of the Fireflies' really gets over the desperation of trying to cope with hunger, shelter in the aftermath of war- but it just lost me with the lack of humanity of Seita's closest relatives, and with the irresponsibility of his later actions. Even during the first bombing, I seriously doubt any mother would leave her youngest daughter out of her own sight. So, while some people may say this film is the essential war film, or more precisely, ""anti-war"" film- I personally think that is tad overstating its importance. A good animated film that is anti-war- and shows the aftermath of it in a realistic manner-- then perhaps that is fair! However, it's not the essential anti-war/war film, and if you can cope with the characters, then this film is pretty rewarding and somewhat haunting! It is, however, a tad overrated in my book! A reasonably good animated film for adults showing the repercussions and the aftermath of war! ***½ out of *****!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beautiful, haunting and emotionally devastating","What an amazing film! Very rarely have I been moved this much by an animated film. Watership Down yes, Bambi yes, Secret of NIMH yes, Beauty and the Beast yes, Land Before Time yes, but Grave of the Fireflies is in a different league. A film that is once seen and never forgotten, a film that is beautiful, haunting and emotionally devastating. It is slow moving perhaps and ""depressing"" but it is very poignant as well. I find it very difficult to fight back tears at the film's end. The animation is amazingly detailed, the backgrounds and characters are drawn with such care and you just marvel at the detail that goes into it. The music is both haunting and melancholic and one of the main reasons why the film is as it is. The story is harrowing, as it details Seita and Setsuko's hopelessness. The characters are easy to relate, Setsuko isn't precocious or obnoxious, instead she is quite cute, and Seita shows real love for his sister as well as being a strong protagonist. There are many memorable sequences, but one that springs to mind is the one with the nocturnal fireflies, which is something of true melancholic beauty. Overall, a masterpiece, pure and simple. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Depressing, but a must see","One of the great animated films of all time Grave of Fireflies tells the story of a couple of kids as the try to survive in war time Japan. What happens to them should be seen by anyone thinking of starting a war since it tells very graphically what happens to those often forgotten, the children.Like its companion piece, Barefoot Gen, which tells the story of survivors of atomic bombing and the horrors that were experienced by those unlucky enough not to have been killed out right, this film proves that war is hell for everyone, especially the children.Its very hard to send anyone out to see this unhappy little film (The previously mentioned Barefoot Gen spawned sequels, this has not) but at the same time you owe it to yourself to experience, however distantly what sort of monster we unleash upon the world every time we go to war. It helps that however depressing this is, its also a damn good and incredibly compelling story.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A magnificent piece of work and one of the most heartbreaking tales ever told,"Animation is often seen as a childish medium, and for good reason as kid's films often are animated. However, every now and then an animated film comes along that extends it's boundaries and manages to deliver a very adult story, and Grave of the Fireflies is one of those films. Through it's well observed and very real characters, Grave of the Fireflies portrays a story of loss, heartbreak and the effect of war on civilians in a manner that is more effective and more firmly based in reality than many live action films about the same subject are. We follow Seita and Setsuko, a brother and sister that have lost their parents in the war and are now forced to fend for themselves in the war torn country. How the two go about doing that and the boy's development from a child to a (somewhat) responsible adult due to the change in the surroundings makes up the spine of the movie.I'm not a big fan of animation, but there are some films that are so great that a person's personal preferences are irrelevant, and this is one of those films. The animation is beautiful and certain scenes, including the air raids and anything with the fireflies are amazing works of art. The way the music blends with the images on screen is haunting and beautiful, and helps add to the tragedy of the story. Because we are able to care for the characters, the tragedy is increased ten fold and the story on the whole is a sad one, but few movies have ever matched up to this film's ending in terms of pure despair. The conclusion is absolutely gut wrenching to an extent that few movies have ever matched, let alone animated pictures. The fact that it's so plain and blatant, with no attempt to console the audience takes the tragedy to a whole new level and I don't doubt that many audience members will be holding back tears upon the film's conclusion.This film is a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Make a grown man cry like a baby!!!,"Now I'm usually your typical Die-Hard, Guns Blazing, Sword Swinging, Magic Wielding Anime fan! So there shouldn't really be any surprises when I say that ""Grave of the Fire Flies"" is not ranked among my list of all time favourites. And the prospect of watching it didn't sound too appealing to me at first, considering the rather subdued DVD case cover...(I know, I'm ashamed)That said, this film is a masterpiece of story telling, the calibre of which my current favourite films pale in comparison. I don't think I've ever been more moved by any other films, period!!! I've vowed never to see this film again, as I think revisiting it would lessen the emotional impact of the first viewing. In any case I don't think I need to re-watch it as it's been burned into my memory forever.This is a film that I hate and love at the same time. The beautiful story and the capturing of facial expressions which only a hand drawn animation could fully realise. On the other hand the film reduced me to sobbing wreck, a bitter sweet ending which left me so depressed it took me another two days to get over...Its a must see, but be sure to have lots of tissue paper on hand.

A well done War movie,"This is Isao Takahata's very first movie for Studio Ghibli.It was shown along with My Neighbor Totoro back in 1988.What unique about this anime movie is it's more like seeing a live action film than an animated film.It shows how much the Japanese suffered during the WW2 period.Those who think anime is just for kids will be proved wrong with this one. It's just as good as an Accademy Award movie.This movie is tempting in a way. Reason why is that it has allot of deaths, sad moments, and bombings in Kobe.Please know this is not something for little kids to see. I recommend 13 and older.

It has allot of people that die from the bombings and a few moments of blood.I recommend this movie to those who like powerful/serious animation.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Utterly devastating,"It's better not to learn too much about this film before watching it, for fear of spoiling it. I'd heard it described as the saddest film of all time, but even that didn't prepare me for what I saw.Speaking from the point of view of somebody who avoids animation as much as possible, I found this to be a piece of exceptional film-making. Use as many superlatives as you like: amazing, engrossing, compelling, outstanding, it all boils down to one important thing - this film tells a story that grips us with its exploration of the human condition. I imagine virtually everybody who watches it will be able to identify with it in some way or other.So forget this one's a cartoon and just go into it expecting a tale packed with emotion and feeling.

Soul Breaking,"This is a film about the sad reality of war. When war is waged, we often think of it as this army against that army. Lost in the mix are the civilians who die horrible deaths--not just from the weapons of war but from disease and starvation. We give great power to the power structure that makes the decision to wage conflict. Often their words sound good and we embrace those words. This film shows what happens to a small, seemingly insignificant pair of children, trying to get a roof over their heads and have a bit to eat. Their mother has been killed in a fire bombing and their father is in the Japanese navy. It shows the efforts to maintain dignity and the cruelty of those who could help but don't. Japan paid a huge price for trying to expand the Empire. The leadership convinced the populace that they were driven by a higher power that wanted them to crush their enemies at whatever cost. But here we see the price. Fire bombings, air raids, and, of course, eventually Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is the saddest of stories, shown in spotless animation. It is a story of hope and hopelessness. Outstanding.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"a combination of Rome Open City and Wiesel's Night (and like both, an extreme, personally felt story)","In 1988 Grave of the Fireflies was placed on a double-bill alongside My Neighbor Totoro. Two of the most endearing films ever created- animated of otherwise- were paired alongside one another, more than likely to balance each other out; after being submersed in a pure tale of innocence and delight like Miyazaki's great film, there could be accepted such a bleak, heartbreaking story of survival. And both films, incidentally, were based on true experiences, and while Miyazaki's story wasn't without some sadness in real life (his mother was really sick with TB in the hospital), Akiyuki Nosaka's story is one drenched in the worst horrors imaginable for a child. It's basically about two siblings, an older brother and younger sister, who are left practically orphans in a Japan completely devastated by the constant barrage of bombs falling all around, and with very little hope in sight. This lays the groundwork for their relationship, a bond very fragile and incredibly endearing.Not since Rossellini and De Sica had a filmmaker, in this case Isao Takahata, touched a nerve so deeply etched out in deconstructing the horrors of wartime. By leaving us with these two characters, who piece by piece are stripped of their innocence in just the simple task of fending for themselves in a shelter (they at first stay with an aunt who considers them freeloaders) and scrounging for food any way possible, we're left with nothing else but their struggle, essentially. The backdrop itself almost becomes abstract, something so huge that we don't even know that it's Americans dropping the bombs, as it's already too much to grasp that a child's parent is no longer with them. Like Elie Wiesel's book Night, the backdrop and horror is used to pit these people in an untenable situation, and it can only end, honestly, without compromise.So, indeed, Grave of the Fireflies is bleak as hell, but compelling because it doesn't stray from its path with these characters, and that in many scenes we're connected to them without the overbearing heart-tugs of a common Disney feature (though, ironically, as Ebert points out on an interview with the DVD, the big eyes in most anime is based upon those in early Disney films). The animation is exceptionally refined without being excessive in violence; images are visceral for just what is briefly revealed, without the extraneous shots that one might see in a work not meant in a G-rated film (i.e. when Seita sees her mother, dead and wrapped in bandages with the maggots and bugs crawling all over), and at the same time there's a sense of wonderment as the two children watch the fireflies in the shelter. The voice-work, too, doesn't strain credulity- these sound like, if it were a regular live-action feature, the kids who would play these parts (and, speaking of neo-realism, the two credited for Seita and Setsuko never worked before or again).Most often, the film is heart-rending because of how things build with the situation. It's tragic enough to see the loss of the mother on the son, but then to hide it from the little girl becomes a greater challenge. Each time a layer of emotional defense is peeled back, it becomes harder not to connect strongly with these characters, such as when Seiko casually says she knows her mother is dead as she buries the fireflies and Seita finally cries out for the first time, or when Seita is left broken and humiliated after being beat up by the farmer for stealing food for sick Setsuko. And, finally, there's the last ten or so minutes, which I won't mention here. Suffice to say it's one of those times in movies where the opening of the film- Seiko dying homeless and famished- is explained to a perfect degree by film's end. It's a harrowing experience, and one of the very best animated films.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I Have Been Deeply Affected,"I cried watching this film, something I haven't done in years.  It's been two days since I saw it and I still can't get it out of my head.  My wife and I have talked much more about this film than most others and I have spent some time researching the film online.  Never has a film hit me on such a personal level.  I am the father of two small children and after seeing this film I went into their rooms while they slept and kissed them and whispered that I love them.Having done some research on the author and the truth behind the story I realize it has lots of symbolism and literary and cultural references which I as a Westerner cannot understand, so I'll keep my comments on the personal level.  The film gets its message across that in war, it is the most vulnerable of society who suffer the most. It troubled me because as an American I don't see the daily struggle for existence in regions torn by war and hunger(Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Balkans, and possibly Iraq to name a few of many conflicts).  It also troubled me that my country really doesn't care either.  As a father of a 5 year old son and a 2 year old daughter, I want the suffering of Seita and Setsuko to stop and someone to acknowledge and help their emotional pain as well as their hunger.  As a parent, I dread the thought of my children being without anyone or being in their situation. As a kid I read lots of WWII books and knew that we had firebombed several Japanese cities and that Navy fighters were strafing small towns.  This film made all that history seem very real and present. As an evangelical Christian, it also reinforces for me how cruel and how kind people can be and how lost we truly are.I read Roger Ebert's review of this film and I agree with him that it is one of the best I have ever seen, because it troubled me deeply on a personal and external level.  I can't look at my daughter now and not think of Setsuko and her beauty, sadness, and innocence.  See it, but don't see it alone.  Remember it's not for children since it's more than a cartoon.",,Anonymous,Animation

Time from another point of view,"Before watching the movie, and after reading all the reviews, I had built very high expectations. A very moving and intense movie. I was almost opened up a position for it, among my best ever movies.I don't know if it was the high expectations, or just the movie, but I rate it as average. Slow rhythm, average plot. But most of all, got the feeling that the movie ""pushed"" it a lot to be ""moving"" and ""touching"". With several ""tearful"" cliché. Didn't make it for me.It has some good moments and I liked the way that the main character ""presents"" the story.It is not a bad movie but definitely not one of the best I have watched.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One for the unknown victims.,"Just marvellous! This hearty masterpiece of Japanese animation is incredibly moving, sincere, haunting and captivating in detailing the special bond between brother and sister caught up in the horrifying and unforgiving face of war. It guides us on one really tragic, but rewarding trip where it truly has an impact. Never does it get overwrought or push itself onto the viewer, but still it manages to leave a lump in your throat and have you emotionally drained when the credits begin to roll. This one is not afraid to stay gloomy, and because you know the outcome at the beginning, this makes the significance of the story's journey more potentate in its increasing pain and devastation. By that alone, the wonderfully textured plot doesn't take the easy way out and the reality of the situation is never lost because it's animated.Staying simple and focused, kept it rather flawless in its in-depth story telling of emotional pride and lasting effects. Slow it might be, but there's too much subtle richness within its characters, premise and visuals to really bother about the loose pacing and lack of action. Isao Takahata adapts the novel of Akiyuki Nosaka, and gets us deeply involved with the civilians, and the mere war stays in the background. A contrast between two different worlds, one being the war itself and secondly the one the two children find themselves in to forget it. Namely those scenes where they're experiencing the beauty and freeness of nature (at if they might never get that chance again) and those sequences with the fireflies admirably paint the feelings of what's to come. The budding relationship between Seita and Setsuko is tremendously done, innocent and full of colour. Even capturing the Japanese citizens and families in this cold plight is believability achieved, as it throws questions, issues and metaphorical messages. These people (including our two central characters) are doing it hard, but their wills won't collapse after what they've been through, but things do take their toll when everything you ever care for can suddenly vanish and the heartache turns to utter numbness. Because what kept you living, is no longer there to hold you.Breathing heavily on the mood is the soft, lovely musical score that certainly weeps with its melodic tone. The vivid animation is gorgeously crisp and enchanting, and the background scenery is profoundly vivid and convincing. Many beautiful, striking illustrations are framed with a sincere touch, where darkness treads neatly together with the lighter moments. What a delightfully effective and soulful meditation piece of sublime art by director/writer Isao Takahata. This one has plenty to say on the topic at hand, and it gets even more relevant everyday.Magnificently heart-wrenching and sensitive war-time story on the people who find themselves dealing with the unbearable consequences of war.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A brilliant piece of work...,"I made the mistake of sitting down to watch this movie thinking it would be your basic anime flick, replete with scantily-clad women with hypertrophied hooters.  Shows you what I knew. I spent the rest of the evening weeping about the cruelties of war, and all the innocent people who get winnowed out in the aftermath.  My American education tells me we had God on our side, and whatever we did to the Japanese mainland was justified in the name of sovereignty.  I'm not a politician or a general...I don't know.  But the story of Setsuko and Seiji (sp?) caused me such grief inside.  What is right, anymore?  Is this right?",,Anonymous,Animation
'She never woke up',"I am crying right now while writing this comment. It's my birthday, and I wanted to seen a movie that was a definite masterpiece, and I found this one. Never wanted to cry on my birthday, but couldn't help it.A tale of a brother and his kid sister in WW2 Japan, which actually tells you the suffering of a common man had a family, a life, a smile and a future, but lost everything for no fault of his own. It's so touching that you cannot help breaking down to tears. I won't reveal the plot here, but I'll suggest you watch the Japanese version with English subs. This is surely the one which will move you to the core, it felt like I lost something too, when the movie ended, and 'she never woke up'.Great stuff - 10/10 (or even 11/10 - as an anime moved me more than a human film)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I finally stopped crying and decided to write this review (my first movie review) and typing these words thinking about the movie brought tears into my eyes again. I'm a pretty tough guy and I rarely get emotional, but boy did this movie hit me hard.I think everybody should see this movie, even though it's such a heart wrenching emotional experience.

I can hardly see through the tears. Great drama anime.,"This is a war time story and, while it has a slow pace, it couldn't have been told any other way. It's like a knife being slowly inserted and twisted in the wound.Everything begins with a ""La Vitta e Bella"" atmosphere: mother dead, father at war, brother and little sister going to a distant relative, brother sheltering the sister from the realities of war as much as possible. But the end of the film (which again, doesn't come abruptly, but gradually) is nothing like happy.This has no action scenes, no fight or physical violence scenes, no sci-fi and no fiction. It's an anime harsh reality that makes you cry your eyes off at the end of the movie. The movie is great, it's a must see for anime lovers or anybody else.I recommend to see again the start of the film after you have seen the whole movie.-- update 2023, seeing it againI watched it in the cinema this time, as part of a Japanese festival. People were sobbing at the end of the film. I liked how the story unfolded without a particular judgement. Yeah, war is hell, but even the most disgusting people in the film can be sympathized with, while the best can be criticized. Anyway, prepare your paper tissues for the end of this film.

once upon a time in Japan,"Hiroshima may have been the most famous bombing of Japan, but the air raids were often just as destructive. One such firebombing is the setting of Isao Takahata's ""Hotaru no Haka"" (""Grave of the Fireflies"" in English). It looks at both the struggle for survival and loss of innocence that accompany war. I've never seen any other anime, but is one movie that should truly be required viewing for everyone. Not only in looking at how the brother and sister try to maintain their hope amid hardship, but two lines in particular stood out. One is where someone mentions that the war is eating up Japan's resources, making it harder and harder to feed the people. Another is when the brother learns that Japan has surrendered. Long taught that the Japanese Empire was invincible, he now has to realize the unpleasant truth. These are important reminders for everyone. The fact remains that the common people will suffer the most in any war, and the movie makes that very clear.Like I said, a movie that everyone should see.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Greatest animated film ever.,"I was a geeky teenager in the 90's who loved anime. The thing I liked about anime was that even though I was getting too old to watch cartoons, I could make the claim that in Japan cartoons were made for grown-ups and justify my love for them.I would go to Tower Records and rent every single anime as they came out and then copy them with two VCR's (90's version of torrenting) and this was released by Central Park Media (one of the three American companies releasing anime back then) so like all the others I rented and copied it. But oh my God this blew all the other stuff I was watching out of the water. IT made me cry, it made me feel. I HAD to show my parents this film to justify my love of anime.And I did, and my parents who really don't like cartoons both cried. Bawled. My dad says he still remembers it and that it haunted him.Anyways, fast forward to the present day, I am now an adult approaching my 40's, i have a family of my own, I've outgrown anime (let's be honest the majority of it is garbage) but my dad reminded me about this film, so I decided to watch it again all these years later to see if it would still hold up.I cried even more. Once you become a parent, as many other reviewers have said here, you put your loved ones faces on the animated characters and it makes it even more powerful. I don't know if this could have been even more powerful or more heart-wrenching if it was live action. You can watch it and because it's animated you can project onto the animated characters and setting even easier than if it was live-action. You can see war torn Kobe as your hometown, you can see it as Iraq, you can see it as Afghanistan, it makes the film all the more powerful.Being a dad now I watch a lot of cartoons, and all the Disney ones, and Pixar etc with my own little Setsuko...this film blows them all out of the water. This is indeed, the greatest animated film of all time if for nothing else than the fact that it is able to transcend the genre and shows the full unfiltered power of what the media is capable of showing.If you are a parent, or have little ones in your life this film will hit you harder, but even as a teenager it hit me hard. I think it shaped my views on war, and had a very profound affect on me. I don't understand the people who say they wouldn't watch this again because there is something strangely cathartic and beautiful about being able to bawl your eyes out. I guess people are afraid of their own vulnerability but I have to say, I enjoyed getting back in touch with that empathetic part of myself. It's strangely relaxing. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"much greater than the godfathers,batmans and pulp fictions","This is my first review for any movie and the feeling is paradoxical...on one hand I feel impelled to write this review and on the other I also feel that my review will be inconsequential considering the greatness of the work..To start, this is not merely another movie...it's much more than what we know as Cinema. It shows you the mirror...not just any ordinary mirror..one in which you see your soul. This work truly penetrates the material being and reaches your soul where the epiphany of being a human occurs. Being a human means the one who feels, the one who has emotions...In today's stressful life we often feel that we are emotionally invulnerable..In fact to succeed in your life today..you need to forget that you feel and act like a machine. This movie wakes you up. I can say that because there is no one person who would not cry watching it. It's not a shame. It's not a weakness. It makes even adults cry because it hits your soul of whose existence even you might be unaware of before.To consider it a movie will be doing injustice to the effect it generates. It's a soul-stirring work which we usually tend to associate with archaic literature. As a piece of Art, it is one of the best tragedies ever written...not only on the silver screen but in the entire human history. If you think I am exaggerating, you have to see this movie and it will have the same effect on you as Romeo-Juliet or Hamlet or Macbeth will have or maybe more since it's presented through the modern and hence, more understandable modes of communication.In my opinion the top rated movies and so the greatest movies are about gangsters, murders, bad guys. No disrespect to them, I am a movie buff and those are my favorites (The shawshank redemption#1, godfathers#2,3,and others like pulp fiction, goodfellas,the good,bad, ugly), but honestly, ask yourself..how many gangsters you know...or superheroes for that matter. Those are great works but they are fiction in the truest sense. you cannot relate to them. Those are fantasies. While 'Grave of the Fireflies' lets you relate yourself to the protagonist through the HUMAN connection.I have seen most of the top rated movies and without being a braggart,can safely claim to have developed a taste and an eye for great works and to me this is the greatest work of cinema. Astonishingly simple but powerful like an A-bomb(ironically) which devastates all your beliefs and ideals about War, Human Relations and Life in general.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Heart breaking animation,"This animated movie starts with young boy Seita dying on the floor of a train station after Japan surrenders in WWII. His spirit leads the audience to his story with his little sister Setsuko. During an air raid on their home town, they lose their mother. Their father is away with the Navy. The siblings go to live with their unsympathetic aunt. Seita clash with her, and the siblings go live by themselves in the bomb shelter next to the waters. It doesn't go well as their lives deteriorate to the point where Seita dies alone on the floor.It is the saddest of tragedy. The animation is the perfect foil to the subject matter. The animation style is children's story but the movie is all too realistic. The characters are not cartoons. It is ripped from the pages of history.

It's very well one of the best animated films I've ever seen, no question. The film also makes its intentions clear by showing these characters' fates in the beginning, and so we're not concentrated on hoping they survive or anything but just witnessing the deep pain and suffering that befell so many people during this time. Definitely a must-see film, one that isn't easy but very well reminds us o the tragedy that people went through and the human suffering, and how lucky the rest of us are for not having gone through it.",,Anonymous,Animation
A Hard Film to Watch,"I honestly don't know how I feel about this movie. It wasn't at all like I expected; very, quiet, subdued. A lot seemed unoriginal, flat, just played out for dramatic effect. I didn't like the unrealistic animation; at times it seemed to be out of sync with real movement.But then there are moments that completely contradict everything I've just said. The quiet combined with the very unchanging surroundings at times produced some amazingly subtle and beautiful imagery like at the beach scene or the strafing fighter. The first bombing is so much more effectively surprising and horrific because of the empty, quiet streets; when Seita is confused by the napalm sticks, so are we.Perhaps the most confusing thing about this film is the emotions it raises. I did not cry and yet after finishing it I felt empty and cold. I felt like this film is like watching a slow death and it's horrible. It ends on a whimper and a whisper and it is truly tragic, despite what I said above :)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An Interesting Story, but a Little Unclear and Predictable","Grave of the Fireflies follows a boy and his little sister as they try to live on their own after losing their family to the war.The story itself is interesting and well presented, and there's lot's of twists and turns throughout that only increase this aspect.There's not a whole lot to say about what's good. It's an interesting story and I think it deserves the rating I gave it, but as far as specific things it lacks in those.Maybe this was because I watched it dubbed, but the voice actors really bothered me. Not because they didn't suit the characters, but they just read their lines with little to no expression. The city is being bombed, for crying out loud! Sound a bit more worried voice actors, come on.Some aspects of this movie were a little confusing, specifically the air raid/bombing scenes. There were multiple points in the story where characters would go to a bomb shelter, then come out and live life normally. So, did they get bombed? Did they not? I don't understand. I eventually kind of figured it out, but regardless it was pretty unclear for a non-history junkie like myself.Everyone says that this movie is super sad and all that, but I didn't think that at all. The ending is super predictable, and I kept wondering if maybe there'd be some crazy twist that proved why the movie was so sad, but nope. It ends exactly how you think it will. Sure, the events leading up are unfortunate, but I was never legitimately sad about any aspect of this movie, save for the lack of ability from the voice actors.Overall Grave of the Fireflies is pretty good, but that's it. The voice acting is subpar, some aspects are a little unclear, and the ending is very predictable. Next time I'll definitely watch the subbed version. In the end I'd still recommend it, just go for subbed. It can't be any worse than the dub.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Possibly the best film ever?,"In my opinion, Grave of the Fireflies is the best film ever made, animated or otherwise. I have never been so affected by a movie for so long afterwards, and I have watched a lot of movies. It stuns you with its truth. I purchased this movie not knowing anything about it 2 days ago, and sat down to watch it with my 20 year old daughter. I expected good things, but this was something else. The story line has been well documented on this site, so I won't dive into that. Needless to say, it will affect you for days after watching it, no kidding. We are both still sniffling. It's the attention to the subtle detail that makes you identify with the charecters. Everyone knows a toddler like Setsuko, and the quiet strength of Seito. There is a scene where Seito and Setsuko are watching the stars at night (after going to the toilet, no less) and he tells his younger sister about the days before the war. When he looks over, she is asleep. He goes to put his arm around her to cuddle up. I thought the would have panned out on that scene and left it at that for emotional impact. But no, what does the little girl do but throw his arms off her (much like my own toddler would do). The whole movie is like that. The ultimate message about the real casulties of war, the innocents, who suffer and endure events not of their own making, is heartbraking. Buy/rent this movie and be haunted forever. It will change the way you look at things and you will be a better person for it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Wants to make you cry just a bit too much,"It's not an unpleasant experience overall: a simple story, cute kids, good scenes - just trying to be too dramatic without actually much content.If you've been watching any recent movies, you can see the art of making you feel has been improving considerably: good timing of dramatic music, paused dialogue and close-ups, etc. Even if you were not particularly caring for the characters, suddenly you find yourself feeling ""this is serious"" and maybe even your eyes water up - only to ask yourself why a few minutes later.Grave of the fireflies takes the basic formula: sad setting (war) + likable characters (cute children) and lets it unfold, adding cardboard characters as needed (cold portrayal of Japanese society, impolite or uncaring neighbors for no reason, etc).There is a senseless ""flashback"" from the main characters watching themselves which adds nothing. Character development is a bit limited, as you see the survival strategies ramp up a bit, but no real effect or reason on why that is. In fact, the conclusion arrives for lack of awareness, not lack of resources.

The most important animated film ever made?,"I ordered this movie from Amazon expecting a shameless exploitation of the destruction and death wrought upon a defeated Japan near the end of World War II. What I did not expect, but indeed found, was a shockingly personal story with some grounding in real events, one that focused much less on the wider war being fought (and not at all on the politics behind the war, thankfully) than on the battle of a teenage boy to simply keep his young sister and himself alive.Consider this the antidote to the typical American war film, particularly those set in the Pacific theater of World War II. This story is one that lays bare the real consequences of war in the modern age. Nobody is spared, not even the youngest children. The film's heavily sobering nature is, however, intermingled with scenes of a happy brother and sister, striving to live their lives together in the face of the worst possible occurrences. This is likely what makes the film all that more difficult to watch; it is beautifully portrayed through its backgrounds, simple musical score and detailed animation, which are alone enough to set this apart from the average anime feature.I might have been flirting with pacifism before I watched this film, but it certainly pushed me over the cliff; one knows before seeing it that most of the casualties of war are the truly innocent, the civilians in their own homes, but such a fact is much easier to ignore when it's not visible in such a concrete portrayal.To put it simply, Grave of the Fireflies ought to be shown to every American social studies student, as it strips the glory of war away to reveal the true suffering it brings, not through a callous and gory festival of horrors, but through the love of two siblings for each other in the face of their earthly demise.

The creators don't even try to present the then Japanese empire as something magnificent, on the contrary.

"Beautiful images, sad/sentimental story, lacks depth","So, there's this boy and his little sister, and they go through a lot of suffering during World War II, after their mother dies during a bombardment. However, that's not really the reason for their suffering.They have no place to stay, because they don't want to stay with their evil aunt. But that's not the reason either.They suffer because they're starving. Ah, they have no money for food, and that's why they're suffering! Well, actually... Let me try again.It's tough to lose a family member, during war or anytime else. You could have made a perfectly good film around that alone. Then there's the aunt. How is she evil? Oh, she's angry that the boy hangs around home all day, doing nothing. She also sells the clothes of the boy's late mother (her own sister, I take it) for food, and only gives half to the boy. That makes her evil. (Who wrote this script, an angry teenager?)And then they've got no food.Let's face it, there's really no good reason for them to go through so much suffering, except to make the audience sad.Making innocent characters suffer is a sure way to engage the audience -- however, it's a cheap trick, and a shallow substitute for proper characterisation. The only character we get to know is the protagonist, and by the end of the film, he still seems like a bit of a cipher. Okay, so he loves his sister a lot, briefly mourned the death of his mother, and kinda looks up to his father... but mostly, he just loves his sister. Oh, yeah, and he's going to die (we learn this from the beginning). The next hour and a half is his slowly drawn out death sequence.All other characters are ciphers, easily summed up in a word or two: The sister? (Sickeningly) cute. The aunt? Evil. Farmer? Wise. Their late mother? Nothing less than perfect.The film sucker-punches the audience to cover for its outrageous characters and aimless plot, with the sole intention of making the audience sad. I guess it worked.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
An emotion-filled film,"This is one of the most emotional films i have seen. Do not make the mistake of thinking that this movie will not be as emotional as some have told you, many make this mistake because it is an animated feature. This is a great film, and the fact that is animated, i think, only adds to it's realism.This is such a great film because it contains much more than the story of a boy and his sister, it illustrates the tragedies of ww2 and what many Japanese people had to suffer trough. the emotions that you will experience during this film prove to be but a glimpse of what the Japanese went trough. Very quickly you forget that these characters are animated, you become involved in their world and get to know them as people. you will suffer trough their tragedies and will hopefully come out of this experience knowing not only more about them, but knowing more about yourself as well.If you have ever wanted to experience a film that will move you and not only show you a different perspective on ww2, but also help you learn more about how you relate to others, i highly recommend this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Finding Love, Compassion and Solitude In Even The Darkest Moments","There is no denying that Studio Ghibli is the finest animation company ever and have made some of the most stunning pieces of cinema ever. The fact that they never fail to craft some of the most beautiful and compelling masterpieces proves the brilliance. Ghibli animators make films that are intelligent, fulfilling, complex and burst with joy. The animation is one that can appeal to people of all walks of life and perfectly sums up what cinema is all about. I've never once been disappointed by a Studio Ghibli work.Grave Of The Fireflies is certainly far from easy viewing and is one of the most harrowing war films ever made. When released in America Grave Of The Fireflies caused controversy because some people felt it was anti-American and the fact is that it's not. The film doesn't take sides to anyone and understands that everybody did awful and horrific things during WW2. One thing that is obvious when watching the film is the fact it's anti-war and shows how the innocent are the people who become the most effected.It's not easy to make films about subjects like this one because they become very emotional and hard to make realistic. Yet Grave Of The Fireflies succeeds in every way other war films don't. The story is a magnificent tale of love and friendship between an older brother and his young sister. The loss of innocence and the real-life brutality that these children see are something that nobody would ever want or be prepared for.The cinematography is beautiful and every frame of animation holds so much substance and inner beauty. There are very few films that manage to play with my emotions as easily as Grave Of The Fireflies because it remains a haunting study of a brother and sister's friendship. I found it hard not to cry and I'll be honest I did cry towards the end of the film. The fact that you fall in love with the characters and become attached to their personality, surroundings and situations is why it remains so provocative. The film's style is excellent and helps set a perfect mood. I love the use of operatic music at the end of the film as it was profoundly effecting.A genuine masterpiece of cinema, one of the greatest animations (anime), one of the greatest war films and one of the greatest films ever made. Recommended for anyone of any age, a film with mass appeal and wide range. Holds a wonderful message and a genuinely inspiring story. Sheer brilliance for what is such a daring piece of film-making.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unbelievable,"Grave of the Fireflies is quite an experience.  I've seen the movie two times already, and the emotion it brings never changes or decreases.  As many times as I see it, I will never get numb to the melancholy mood of the story.  I've tried so very hard not to cry, but it's hopeless.  This movie is an unbelievable piece of work.  The animation is done extremely well, and the soundtrack increases the somberness of the movie. It is an all around outstanding movie, much better than any live action movie I've seen recently.  This is definitely one of Japan's gems, and should not be missed. Rent it at your local Blockbuster.  You won't regret it",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The movie is soberingly honest which is a very refreshing change from the whole modern ideologically infiltrated movie culture.

Due to my uncertainty about the rating of this movie, I will make a specification here: 6.7 rounded up to 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Underrated, Grossly Misinterpreted Ghibli Masterpiece","Grave of the Fireflies is a underrated, grossly misinterpreted Ghibli masterpiece of a film that you never wanted to see again.not going to make review about it as there are hundreds of reviews already Just to make some points: Grossly Underrated - The fact that it is not even considered as a mainstream Ghibli title when it deserve to be placed as one of the greatest animated films (or just films) of all times shows that it is grossly underrated.Grossly misinterpreted - many critics and reviewers interpret the film as an anti-war movie. Cant be further from the truth. Graves of the Fireflies is about the story of a siblings and their hardships in life, thats it plain and simple. The story is the authors confession of guilt and desire for atonement after her young sister died in his care in real life. It just so happen that the setting is WW2.In reality it can be applied to any situation where human hardship, particularly children hardship, are involved.Right now there are millions of young desperate Seitas and little innocent hungry Setsukos all around the world that are abandoned, dying from malnutrition and hunger, being unable to afford medical care, being sold into slavery, physically and sexually abused... and yet people like us (who were torn by the feeling of not being able to help Setsuko and Seita character in the film) are not making any effort to help these millions of real life Setsukos and Seitas out there.. is what i believe the true tragedy of this film.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Heartbreaking, Upsetting, Beautiful, Brilliant.","To describe the emotion of this film in words is like trying to describe how food tastes to another specie, it just cannot be explained without experiencing it yourself. This movie will literally bring you to utter sadness within minutes and will continue to do so for 90 more. It will bring out a range of emotions throughout the film but most of them being heartbreaking scenes of turmoil and complete shock towards the events that unfold. But it is just beautiful in its delivery. The animation and dialog of both Seita and Setsuko makes you feel so much for them and this is why this film works so much. It will move you like no other movie and to that I applaud it. The animation is superb, beautiful landscapes, masterful drawings and an incredible use of color to which it is a visual masterpiece.The story tells of a brother andhis small sister in a fight against poverty during WW2. It is most definitely anti-war, but it does not point fingers, because it doesn't need to. It does not want the viewer to feel anger towards the circumstances of the war, it wants you to feel strong emotions for the consequences and effects it had on people DURING the war.This is an unforgettable piece of film that shows the sheer honesty Japan has towards the past events and I recommend it to anyone.Powerful, heartbreaking, upsetting, beautiful and utterly brilliant.Amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Everyone's right: This is one of the best war movies ever,"One only has to look at the rest of these comments to see that this movie really affected people. It affected me as well. I've never cried so much during and after a movie so much in my life.Roger Ebert and another famous critic (I forget his name) compared this movie to Schindler's List. That's an apt comparison. This movie is so human. So very human. It will make you want to hug all of your loved ones just to make sure they are safe and happy.That this movie is animated doesn't hurt it a bit. In fact, it makes it better. Instead of connecting the characters that are so well-developed in the movie with an actor, you only connect them with the idea of a person you've created in your head. It's like reading a book. Without explicit visual cues to go by, one has to create the images in one's head. It makes the characters that much more powerful and moving because instead of being on a screen, they are in your head. That said, I could not get them out of my head for days.

"Go home, get some ice cream, find someone you love and, with them, watch these 89 minutes of story-telling mastery.","Studio Ghibli's Grave of the Fireflies is a lesser-known anime from the creative studio responsible for the Oscar-winning Spirited Away. The lack of fame is understandable due to the sadder side that Grave of the Fireflies brings to the table, but don't let that difference dissuade you. This masterpiece is arguably a more well-rounded story and should be on everyone's list of anime films to see.Starting off with a family in Japan during World War II, the bond between brother and sister is instantly there to see and is the main focal point of the feature. This is a relationship that everyone can see in their own lives, if you have siblings or not there will always be someone who in that situation you would protect and do absolutely anything for.After the death of their mother and the terrible treatment their relatives show them, they have no choice but to go it alone. Surviving on scraps of food, morsels they can steal and barter for. All seems to be going well for a while until the plot takes us down a slippery slope full of turbulent emotional conflict. Complications in their lives quickly arise, and without substantial nourishment and proper shelter they struggle to stay well.The end is expected but nonetheless manages to still bring a tear to the eye of any human—however, strangely, it is not entirely out of sadness that you cry. Their horrendous ordeal to survive is over. I have yet to meet someone who it hasn't touched and wholly convinced them how important family and friends are in their lives.Films depicting family bonds and sibling dependency are not uncommon but where some only scratch the surface Grave of the Fireflies brings a whole new side to the idea and will leave you with a lasting impression.Even if you don't enjoy films that leave you in tears this is a must- watch Ghibli classic. Go home, get some ice cream, find someone you love and, with them, watch these 89 minutes of story-telling mastery.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Touching but not a classic,"Grave of the Fireflies is based on a true story. The central characters are an orphaned brother and much younger sister in WW2 Japan. The city of Kobe has recently come under Allied fire bombing and most of the wooden houses have burned down including that of Seita and Setsuko. The children first live with a family friend who quickly becomes very nasty. They then move to a bomb shelter and try to survive the war.I like the fact that this film is anti-war and it does tell a touching story. But, I don't consider it, on first viewing, to be quite the classic it's made out to be. To be honest, I couldn't get into the whole anime thing. Even the faces were not realistic. If this had been a real movie with real actors, it would have been tougher to make, but the impact (for me) would have been far greater. Some of the plot points didn't make sense either. If Seita could access all that money in his mothers account, why did Setsuko have to reach a point of starvation for him to get his hands on it.Please don't let my views on this film discourage you from watching it. Overall, it is a good film and very well perceived by critics and IMDb voters.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A big salute to Hotaru no Haka,"Hotaru no Haka depicts the most grueling side of war, wherein the innocents of society are the most devastated. Especially during the downfall of the Japanese during the Second World War, the film depicts the darkest times of the common people during the different bombings. Not to mention the apathy and individualism prevailing among the people. Also, it tackles on how life may be unfair for some people. There is still a face of hope, dreams, and life amid the many horrific faces of tragedy, death, and suffering. This film is extremely tragic and depressing, but very meaningful and realistic. Though it may match the quality mainstream anime, it, more often than not, goes beyond the boundaries of commonplace anime. There are no exaggerations, just real-life situations.Kudos to the makers of this film!

Animes can be this better!,"Most of the time some categories of movies are limited to express a certain kind of typical story lines. When it comes to Anime most of the movies are related to fantasy or science fiction. If you want to see half human half robots , or dragons from distance mystic lands or vampires from the east and Gods from the forests; anime are the best place for it.But time to time there is a movie which comes out that breaks the trend. 'Grave of the fireflies' is one of such great anime movie which speaks of a different purpose. It speaks of humanity and living. Rather than being super natural it has a story which makes you think twice or maybe thrice about life and what we really do to our society. Occur in the times of the great world war 2 a young boy named Setsuko and his kid sister named Seita are refugees after their city is bombed. Grieving their mothers death Setsuko tries hard to take care of his sister amongst many difficulties. Ultimately neglected by their relatives the brother and sister seek shelter in an abandoned bunker. Not having much to eat and running out of supplies Setsuko does things that he himself is not proud of because he wants to keep her little sister happy and alive.The story is wonderful and so moving that you may forget that its actually an anime. Heartwarming at times and depressing 'Grave of the fireflies' makes most of the Animes look like child's play.

This is the most touching animated feature I've ever seen,"This is the most touching animated feature I've ever seen. I truly cared about the characters and was saddened at the tragic events they had to deal with. A young teen boy and his four year old sister are orphaned while their father is in the Japanese navy and their mother is killed in a fire bombing. Though there are a few small bits of humor as a way for them to cope with their situation, I caution you not to think this is a typical Japanese Anime story. It's as gut-wrenching as any live-action war movie and shows the attacks on Japan in a way I've never seen depicted before, from the personal point of view of two children.

Not my style,"Grave of the Fireflies is a good film. I will say that first. It is a pretty film and incredibly moving. The relationship between a brother and sister during WWII Japan is not only the main focus, but done incredibly well.

So Disappointing,"Perhaps because I had such high hopes for the movie, but I was so utterly disappointed by this movie. The kids? In a deplorable situation, abandoned by all. But as the relative pointed out, the boy could have tried to find any kind of work to afford things to eat. Before the strike in his neighborhood, he had worked at the local factory, after-all. He kept on waiting for his father, lamenting his sad state of affairs, but in effect, not doing anything about it. Also, the voice of Setsuko really started to get on my nerves about twenty minutes into the movie. Oh, boohoo. The boy was so obviously in denial about everything, the death of his mother, no contact from his mother, his sick sister. I got quickly sick of this movie. To me, the stubbornness and denial of the boy character represented the Japanese Empire's attitude towards reality before, during and maybe even after the war.

Grave of the Fireflies,"Grave of the Fireflies is known as one of the saddest animes ever made.

Saddest film ever (in a good way),"I've never cried so much while watching a movie. This cinematic masterpiece undoubtedly stands as one of the finest wartime films ever created. It can make you truly appreciate the good things in life and remind you how much your family and life itself mean to you.The film revolves around two siblings navigating the harrowing aftermath of war on innocent lives. With moments of poignant poetry and a consistently somber undertone, it delicately balances a few glimpses of lightness amidst the pervasive darkness. Yet, ultimately, it shatters your heart into a million pieces.I've observed people raising questions about Seita's choices, yet the essence of the movie doesn't lie in expecting a 14-year-old to navigate flawlessly through decisions. Just like real life, making mistakes is an inherent part of it, and it's important to note that Seita's decisions weren't driven by selfish motives. Each decision he took was guided by his love for his sister, and he embraced the immense responsibility of safeguarding her, regardless of the cost.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

This film by itself is a masterpiece, but its ending ... well just remember everything I cried with this and the words I wrote here are useless.

Not a compelling story,"I am a sap for tragic war stories so I had high hopes for this one, only to be a bit disappointed. The story was simplistic, it basically just follows one character's actions, and his irresponsibility - while understandable since he is a child - makes it a little difficult to empathize with him. It's not a big story about the devastation in Japan, it's mostly just a tale of a child who can't afford any food. There were nice elements as other people say but the story just didn't bite.Agree with the content of Galcian's review (although he only gave it a 3), go check it out, I especially agree that it's silly to call this an anti-war movie. For a movie to have a genuine anti-war message it has to do something more than merely show a tragic event that is the consequence of a war. This movie does nothing to interrogate or even acknowledge the motivations and moral choices made by anybody involved in the Japanese and Allied war efforts, it just presents a snapshot of the end result. ""Sometimes war leads to starving children and that's very sad"" is not a novel political message, it's a basic fact that people have known for thousands of years.I mostly liked it because I still like sappy tragedy movies and as other reviews have said, there are nice elements to this one.

"Beautiful, amazing, stunning","Set during WWII in Japan, 14-year-old Seika is the only one to take care of his 5-year-old sister, Setsuko, after their mother is killed in an aerial firebombing of their village, that also destroys their home. Their father is off fighting, and they have to go to live with their aunt, who scolds them at an increasing rate and level. After a while, they move out, into a shelter. This follows their struggle to survive, on dwindling food supplies and sudden plane raids. In the way of a classic tragedy, this hints at its inevitable conclusion from the very beginning. This doesn't make it ""predictable"", as the point is not to surprise; it renders it even more powerful, as we find ourselves losing the battle in trying to deceive ourselves of where it is headed. I have not read the novel and can draw no comparisons. Like the other Studio Ghibli pictures, this feels very true to life and natural. The astonishing attention to detail, the immense realism, the tiny little human aspects, these have you forgetting that you're not watching live-action(the mood is spot-on, and you're transported directly into the situation). And the animation is impeccable. This is deeply moving and engaging(and it is more focused on this than the plot). If it does not tug at your heartstrings, you are officially a robot. At the same time, it isn't manipulative, and your sympathy and empathy are awoken in an honest manner. The sound design is excellent(and it uses the absence thereof, silence, to fantastic effect), backing up the visuals in recreating something very close to the real world. While there is stylization, and not everything in this is what it appears, it doesn't betray this objective of credibility. This builds and maintains atmosphere extremely well. Whether it's the siblings having trouble getting by, them playing together, an explosive assault from above, it comes across as genuine. The pacing is perfect. At about 90 minutes, this is not in a rush, and it lets you absorb the individual parts of what's going on. The acting is phenomenal. I base this on the original version, not a dubbed one. There is a bit of highly disturbing, bloody, violent, gory and brutal content in this. The DVD comes with a feature-length track of alternate angle storyboards(and another 10 and a half minutes of extra ones), two interesting interviews(one with the writer/director that comes in at 17 and a half minutes, the other with film critic Roger Ebert, that has a running time of 12 minutes), an informational 12 and a half minute documentary (""Historical Perspective""), a 6 and a half minute Japanese release promo, a 4 and a half minute DVNR featurette, a 3 minute art gallery, one US trailer and one Japanese(both 2 minutes).

There is so many reasons to see this.,"I am 15 years old. I am a boy. I have a younger sister. I have never really thought of the effects of war on countries like Japan in World War II. I watched this on my own, Thursday night, not knowing much apart from the basic plot. I was moved. On Sunday afternoon I watched it again with the rest of my family. I cried. Both times.This movie is so strong, anyone who wants to not be able to sleep tonight, who wants to be kept awake judging their own morals, the effects of war and evaluating their own relationships - watch this movie! If you don't, watch it anyway - it must be seen.I shan't spoil anything but it will touch you out of the sheer cruelty of our modern world and the stupidity of warfare. If I was Japanese or American this movie would make me feel somewhat guilty for the events of the film and it becomes even more poignant to learn that is based on true events. The relationship between Seita and Setsuko is so amazing, for the first hour it is not only extremely realistic but heart-breaking by the end. Even if you don't feel morally different about war, the emotional impact is enough to put me in a state of confusion and feeling so sad ... for days. The single greatest thing is the relationship, it is the most realistic and saddest thing I have ever seen in cinema.If you're between 12 and 25, this is must see. You need to watch it, either to question your own morals or to re-enforce them. And although the creator claims the movie is not an ""anti-war"" film but one about the relationship then watch it anyway - the relationship makes this movie so magical and the war themes just give it context. If you have a sibling - watch this. If you want to know about war - watch this. If you're between 12 and 25 - watch this. If you want to see something so powerful you'll be moved - watch this. If you want a war film - try something different, watch this.Just watch this movie.Why do fireflies have to die so young?",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Possibly the most beautiful and touching movie I've seen in my whole life,"I am going to start out by saying that this was one of the most depressing movies I've seen in my entire life. But it was definitely one of the most beautiful animated films I've seen also, a film typical of the late 80s anime films by Studio Ghibli. What I liked about this film was the fact that it wasn't fantasy like say, Spirited Away. This was real, based on a true story, based on events that were definitely not just limited to one pair of children during wartime Japan. That's what makes it so heartbreaking: the fact that this is based in reality and that life is cruel and does not always have a happy ending. But the story of Seita and Setsuko is beautifully told and Setsuko is one of the most heartwarming little children I have ever seen in an animated film, she's just that convincing. The music fit the mood perfectly and the voice acting was top-notch: if you get the chance to watch this, watch it in the original Japanese. On a side note, this film made me appreciate the things I have, the fact that I have food to eat everyday and the fact that I have a place to stay and am not caught in some war.

"Not as stirring as it might have been, nor as worthy of its praise; the film is, I'm sure, an accurate depiction but durge after durge only goes so far.","I suppose I enjoyed Grave of the Fireflies about as much as I enjoyed something like 2009's ""The Road"", a film with an atmosphere and a 'look' more-so a character study; a narrative arc or an actual spine. The comparison to a film set post-apocalypse is somewhat fitting here, since Studio Ghibli's 1988 effort often has the feel that the world is coming to an end; that there isn't much hope left and what the central characters have is the best they'll get lest they be dead. What IS coming to an end, however, is not the world itself but The Second World War – something which, if you're in the likes of Berlin; Paris; Hiroshima; Tokyo, or anywhere else synonymous with the conflict, is going to be a lot less pleasant than if you're situated in the United States, or even parts of Great Britain. As a result, towns are flattened; people are fending for themselves; food is hard to come by and to escape the threat of further dangers; one appears to have to flee to the countryside: this is a post-apocalyptic drama if ever I saw one.Like most of its ilk, story and character sputter to get going out of the fact it's the end of most of what's left in the world and there isn't much left with which to interact. Grave of Fireflies is no different; its elevated status in the popular eye is born out of the fact it's an animation first and foremost, and people often grade such things for its appeal to a child – thus, when something as adult as ""Grave"" comes along, hysteria and praise will follow. Additionally, it is a Japanese film and a Japanese film tackling Japanese life at the end of The Second World War; a sum often enough for people to see films from certain countries in regards to certain issues sensitive to said nation as being a bit better than what is normal.As for the film itself, and following on from My Neighbour Totoro, the gleefulness and the ambiguity of the situations young children found themselves in as monsters and supernatural elements ruled their breakaway roost has been replaced by a starker, darker reality. Grave of the Fireflies depicts children veering away from their parents or guardians and into a realm not populated by mythical creatures, of whom are little to no threat, but into the unremitting world of street life in which the reality of actual starvation is very much a threat. We are a long way from the flights of fantasy abound in said example, wherein interaction with monsters and such took kids out of living with parental protection and forced them to fend for themselves.Here, The War is coming to an end and young siblings Seita (Tatsumi) and Setsuko (Shiraishi) suffer the death of their mother during a Kobe bombing raid that additionally destroys their home – thus, they are forced out and about onto the already dangerous streets of Japan. In Japan right now, the skies are red; ash rains down; the rain that falls in black and they have a mere tin of fruit sweets between them in terms of food supply – they must, however, troop on in an attempt to find father who's with the Navy. To an extent, the film is reminiscent of the preceding year's Empire of the Sun; a superior film in its depiction of a young infant caught up in Japan's spree of invasion through the Far East at around this time, events which eventually gave way to the Pacific theatre of World War II. On top of this, there is a burning amount of inspiration drawn from a lot of what Italy was producing in the immediate fallout of the war; these neo-realist pictures about an individual (plus, on occasion, a companion) trawling through the proverbial debris in order to get somewhere that may or may not be anywhere in particular.Seita adopts the role of the lead from Setsuko, on account of being much older; their tale in a late-war Japan, a Japan losing two separate wars to China and the Allies, is an interesting snapshot of life at that time, but no more – a piece not offering as much as one would like beyond the thirty minute mark, by which time we've understood all that's been provided and wait to be challenged with something more. Throughout, the Japanese are resentful and full of spite towards the children; a depiction of aunts and doctors, those of whom you would have thought would show compassion, an instance of few punches being pulled by the makers in what appears to be a set of depictions designed to sync up with the merciless nature of Japanese attitudes at that time.Grave of the Fireflies is no doubt a brave project, with well-constructed, oppressive atmospheres of hopelessness and decent cinematography, but this will only get you so far. The effectiveness of films such as these, projects with later significant deaths and a series of scenes not propelled by narrative but by survival, are often determined by the creativity behind the uncanniness of the scenario, with the likes of 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead scoring highly. Grave of the Fireflies, while competent and well designed, is not a horror film per se; its drama is wearing, its runtime tiring, in spite of it being below ninety minutes and its characters two dimensional (they might be of any age and of any background). Its droll repetition, instead of capturing the desperately sad and desperately slow paced nature of survival, instead creates the sense we're being dragged down the same scenes over and over again – and this is precisely what happens.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bleak but Excellent.,"This is a remarkable film. The sort of animated move that would never be made in the west. An animated film that deals with adult themes and achieves it with excellence. This is the story of a brother and sister orphaned by the second world war in Japan, who end up having to fend for themselves. Everything here is achieved with excellence. I watched the subtitled version (which I always feel is best) and was really taken aback by the great little film. This film deals with the harsh realities of a civilization under siege and also with Japanese culture superbly and the director here must tack a huge amount of credit. There are scenes of great emotion as the film works it's way to a hugely emotive ending. Superb. One to be viewed again and again.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but overrated.","Studio Ghibli's magic recipe is visually stamped everywhere in Grave of the Fireflies. But Miyazaki's absence is noticeable. This story is heartbreaking but for some reason it feels like a typical, constant emotional blackmail for the audience. Fortunately, the emotion is quite believable, as it comes from a context and a group of situations that are taken from reality itself, although of course, with some tweaks to make the entire experience more cinematic.Returning to the aesthetics and visuals, the backgrounds are good, but they lack life and movements. They are static images that only serve as a basis for the atmosphere of each sequence. The animation is fine for a 1988 film, but it doesn't stand out much. The best point of the animation is the reference taken for each scene, especially those involving the human figure.The music is austere, but effective. The sound editing is austere and falls short. The voice acting is very good.Grave of the Fireflies is an oriental animated classic that is worth revisiting, although it doesn't come to revolutionize or shake more than a couple of hearts susceptible to moderate emotions.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

This movie is so harsh, realistic and sad, that you'll stay shocked for quite a while. It shows that war is deadly beast taking lives of Innocent people, especially children.

He started crying just telling me what it was about! I started crying A because my dad was crying and that scared me and he shouldn't cry alone no matter what reason, and B because the description was so moving ( he didn't even give anything away!) This movie touched us both to the heart. Just writing this review is bringing me to tears. The movie is stellar, especially for Japanese anime coming out in the later 1980's!

This should be required viewing for all who lead a country.,"I don't cry at movies.Sometimes I am sad. Maybe I even feel a bit wet in the eyes. But I don't cry.This movie devastated me. Literally had me in tears during and destabilized me for days afterwards. It has probably been ten years since I watched it. Regardless I still tear up reading reviews or seeing the title screen.The fact that it is animated is irrelevant. The movie lays out the sad reality of the real victims of war.I wish that every world leader would be required to watch this before assuming command of their respective countries. Sometimes I think that it is too easy for them to look at objectives and forget the realities and suffering that come with armed conflict.So many reviews already summarize the plot of this film.

Well worth the view,"Grave of the Fireflies is, probably one of the most touching animes I have ever seen. The story takes place in Japan during the end of the WW2 and we get to meet a brother and his sister, trying to survive during the hard times and misery Japan faced at the bitter end of the war. The anime, who is from 1988, feels like it's delivering an old vibe of the anime style, and with a smooth roll the story develops and tightens up into something you never would've imagined before you pressed ""Play"". Too bad though that I had such big expectations on this piece. I've heard it's ""so sad"" and that you're about to cry for a lifetime, but hey it's a piece that won't get you to smile but it won't ruin your mood forever either!

Beautiful movie about a murder/suicide.,"(Possible spoiler, though you know about a character(s) death in the 1st 15 seconds anyways)This is NOT a story about 2 kids fighting for survival in war-torn Japan. This is not about kids begging for food. This is not about kids scrounging for food. This is not about kids staying with adults who feed them. This is not about kids who line up to get their rations. This is not about kids who go to an intact city with their money and buy food.This is the story of a moron who unfortunately had the care of his kid sister. The social commentary here is that society was so broken down that it did not notice the brother abusing his little sister.This got a 4 for story and animation. It did not get a higher rating because I really do not like stories about helpless morons who cannot do what it takes to survive but who refuse to see they are unable to care for anyone else. I also did not like that most of the reviews make the moron/murderer into a hero and seem to admire him. I felt deceived by the reviews as I was expecting a sad story of kids who TRY to survive but are unable to. I did not expect a story of a kid who refuses to survive except on his own terms and who makes his loved one live those same terms. He must have been a clueless elitist. Other Japanese were/ are quite good at survival.Within about the 1st 15 minutes, you can tell Seita is a moron and too good to work. It just takes awhile to get to the murderer part. I should have followed my instinct to stop watching the movie when he puts his sister in danger gawking when planes are flying overhead. I really wanted to bash his head in at that moment --- Let me think: save sister vs shoes; save sister vs. watch planes, save sister vs talking to people...hmmm. Perhaps there is another statement in the movie -- that Japanese males were/are like this -- shoes before baby sister.Mothers will starve for their children . . . why do so many reviews seem to admire Seita and call this a struggle to survive? I thought the movie was more a statement that in war, some people will always choose to die, re: Seita, but most of society moves on. Unfortunately, the deathwishers will also sometimes take other people with them, usually those they love the most. Ah...I finally figured this movie out -- this is a drawn out story of a murder/suicide.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

What makes a movie great...,"I think often times one knows the value of the movie they watch through the effect it has on them. That being said, this is one of the greatest movies ever made. I watch movies from many cultures and of many genres. Though I usually prefer a good action flick to any kind of sentimental rubbish; that tends to be because most movies which try to be sentimental fall short of creating a reaction. This movie creates a reaction, a big reaction. One of the ways I test a movie's greatness is to re-watch it, a lot later. As time passes and the movie sinks in, it loses its power to effect you. I watched this movie in 1998; a month ago I tried to watch it again. I did not make it past the movies opening scene. I do not easily come to tears, but I could not watch this movie a second time, I could not bear that kind of pain. That is level of power this movie evokes, and that is the level of strength the story conveys. There is no way my words can properly express the feelings which this movie creates, do not be afraid because it is in a foreign language or because it is animated, what this movie touches transcends all that. There is no more to be said, watch it and find out for yourself what I mean.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unforgettable,"The story of survival of two Japanese brothers, little Satsuko, a 4y.o. girl, and her brother Saita, a 14y.o. boy, at the end of the Second World War in Japan, based on the semi-biographical novel of Akiyuki Nosaka.Grave of the Fireflies is one of the saddest stories and movies I have ever seen. It puts face to the the children in any war, those who lose everything and have left with nothing, those too easily forgotten and so easily neglected. What makes the movie sad is the verisimilitude of the story, that something like that happened and is happening any time that there is a war.The animation is marvelous, colorful, attentive to the detail, scenic and intimate, with a lyricism that only Ghiblin Studies are able to create. The drawing of the Japanese countryside is simply superb, and the same can be said of the drawing of the city environments and destruction; the best from Ghiblin to me. The atmosphere is great. The colors a little more saturated than usual from Ghiblin studio, and really precious. The music by Michio Mamiya is extremely subtle and beautiful, perfect for the story. The characters of the two brothers are wonderfully drawn and performed by the Japanese actors. Some of the intimate scenes of the two brothers are really magical, especially the ones involving the fireflies that give tittle to the movie.What is great about this movie is that, very soon, you forget that you are watching animation, as the story is so strong, captivating and engaging, that those drawn characters become real as you and me.A classic animation movie difficult to forget, soulful and marvelous in every possible way.The best animation film I have ever seen and one of the best ever made.

Until this point, I had only watched a few animes but this heart-rending tale isn't your typical animated film. No, it is SO much more. It has unexpected depth. It has soul. It has a genuine message that shan't be overlooked.This is an extremely poignant and moving story about a young boy and his little sister struggling to survive in Japan during World War II. Above all, it is based on experience, situation and exploration. And this film offers us a tragic look into real atrocities, real horrors from the perspectives of two joyful kids, Seita and Setsuko. They share a magnificently uplifting and eternal connection (the latter quite literally, as many would argue) that makes you feel all kinds of warm inside just watching them interact with one another.The animation in this film is simply breathtaking. The painstaking attention to detail, particularly with the surrounding landscape is awe-inspiring. Certain images like the luminous fireflies at night, the glistening pond outside where Seita and Setsuko reside and the beach they visit with its magnificent sunset will resonate with me for a long time. It is hard not to appreciate animation of such quality and finesse.The impact of this film is heightened with a mesmerizing score and the introspective pauses that are not only tolerated, but encouraged, in Japanese animation films. Majestic sounds used throughout also add to this captivating, almost dreamlike vibe. And yet, it was the true to life storytelling that made this film such a realistic, enchanting piece of art.I was somewhat confused of the beginning without any context and I later re-watched it after the film's end. It is a beautiful beginning (or rather end) and makes you appreciate the film even more than you thought you did. This wonderfully crafted film deserves a viewing from anyone at least once.

If this film proves anything it is that animation is no just suited to tell kids tales of fantasy, sci-fi or cartoon comedy. Japanse animation or ""anime"" is a style and sometimes you have to look past the style of a movie to appreciate a beautiful and heartbreaking story. 
But what this movie really excels at is showing the results of war and also the victims of war as we see our two main characters Seita and Setsuko dealing with the situation there in.

A well crafted film that lacks anything resembling hope.,"I have this belief that there are certain ""rules"" movies are suppose to follow. One of those ""rules"" is the build and release of emotion.

If the bomb goes off there isn't a release - just an explosion. All of that tension stays built up inside of you.That's my problem with this movie, no matter how gut-wrenching, sad or even realistic it is, it has a fatal flaw. The audience, in my opinion, is never given a moment to release the tension - just an explosion.This movie, following Hitchcock's example, is a series of tension building moments, followed by small, quiet, extremely depressing explosions.But, maybe the intent of the movie was to build emotion/tension and not release it. Maybe that was the point.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Good Film, In Spite of its Sentimentality","One common criticism of this movie is the sentimentality. I did find while watching the movie that the child's constant crying did become annoying after a while. Some people are more easily influenced by sentimentality than others, but the sob elements in Grave of the Fireflies seem too excessive to be realistic. The child behaves too much like a child, almost as if the maker wanted to emphasize that the victim was a child to artificially heighten emotions. Towards the end though the sentimentality becomes more effective.My dad walked out on the movie because it was an anime. Anime and cartoons are often seen as childish and some people are too proud of themselves to watch movies they perceive as childish. Dad returned halfway through the movie but complained that nothing was happening, so he left again. All viewers are different. Hollywood executives are aware that a significant proportion of viewers are averse to a movie in which nothing big happens. This leads to a situation in which action (mainly violent action with explosions) is often interspersed throughout a movie -- maybe a chase scene added in the middle of a boring dialogue session or a sex scence for shock effect.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stop The Madness Of Good Votes For This Movie,"If this had been a live action movie done with the style, acting, and gravitas of, say, ""Schindler's List"", it would deserve a place in the IMDb.com Top 10. And it could have been done that way with very few special effects. But it wasn't, and that's exactly what I find wrong with it. I feel that this was a horrible, horrible choice of material for an animated feature. Shouldn't an animated feature give us what can't be done in live action as movies like ""Spirted Away"", old Disney features, and anything by Pixar so incredibly do? As it was, I could not help but feel the strain as the movie makers tried to turn this into a movie that gets the viewer completely sucked into the emotional aspect of it all. Personally, I got more choked up watching ""Spirited Away"", and for that matter, ""Finding Nemo""!I understand why and how badly people want to like this movie, but for me it didn't work at all. And I find the elevated ratings for it ridiculous. There are much better anime flicks out there than this.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hotaru no haka,"The film is one of the saddest films that you can see in your life, and it is of great artistic and aesthetic value because this film narrates the pain of war from the point of view of the defeated and the film tells the story of a young man and his younger sister while they are living the ravages of the Second World War, and unlike the American films that show the side of strength more of this. The film narrates the tragedy with a tongue from the fire of war, to be one of the most prominent films that painted the chapters of the war in Japan from which a devastating expression came out, and the expressions and the amount of feelings will leave you with a quantity of feelings when you finish watching the film",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the finest movies I have ever seen.,"One of the finest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Also, one of the saddest movies I have seen in my entire life. Not much to say that hasn't been said already, but I love this movie and I remember crying intensely the entire last half-hour. Remains quite neutral in terms of the war, as an American I did not feel 'offended', rather ashamed that this viewpoint is not more largely exposed. This is just one of those films that teaches you the value of human life and the misery that war brings upon innocent children. Quickly entered my theoretical 'top ten' list. May possibly be the best anime movie ever made, not only for it's beautiful animation, but the feelings, emotions, and thoughts that arise from watching it. And every time I watch it, it's always a little sadder than the last time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A well told story,"Grave of the Fireflies is a great movie about a boy and his young sister during WW2. It's a rather emotional movie, and it's often called one of the best anti-war movies ever. I don't buy that this movie is at all anti-war. It's much more of a personal experience than anything. This is a story about the human spirit. The film never seems to point fingers or lay blame.First off, this is indeed an extremely good movie. The story is great and the characters are very likable. The Japanese voices are spot on, even the girl. All the parts are well written, and very believable. Nothing seems stretched to the absurd.The art is simply beautiful. Fans of movies such as Kiki's Delivery Service or Mononoke will notice things feel very familiar, due to being these all being from the same studio. The colors range from dark and sad to bright and cheery, sometimes fitting with the mood and other times as a stark contrast to the reality around them.At any rate, it's a really good story and one that's hard to forget. It's well told, it's memorable, it's likable, and it's at times quite sad. If you're looking for something different and serious rather than the normally light-hearted crowd of anime, give this a shot. You won't be disappointed.Rirath_com",,Anonymous,Animation
One of the Greatest Animes; One of the Greatest War Movies,"Note: this review was done while watching the 2012 English language dub of the movie. I do not speak Japanese, and I don't mind watching a dubbed version of an animated film. In my opinion, dubs are worst when viewing a live action film.""Grave of the Fireflies"" (Japanese: ""Hotaru no Haka"") is the story of siblings Seita (Tsutomu Tatsumi/Adam Gibbs) and Setsuko (Ayano Shiraishi/Emily Neves), who are both struggling to survive the final months of World War II during the American bombing of Japan. They spend time living with their aunt (Akemi Yamaguchi/Marcy Bannor) for a while before her nagging begins to get on Seita's nerves. She feels like Seita is lazy and neglecting his duty to serve the country and fight for what is a doomed cause. Seita is only concerned with the safety and well-being of his sister, as their mother dies in a firebombing during the beginning of the film.Many people mistakenly classify this as an ""anti-war"" movie, but the director, Isao Takahata, has repeatedly stated that it has no such message. This movie is not anti-war any more than it is pro-war, and it is not anti-American any more than it is pro-Japanese. It is deliberately non-political, choosing only to show the human and civilian side to armed conflict. There are no soldier characters in the movie. The only things military at all are the faceless American planes that rain bombs down upon the cities, and a flashback scene of a naval exhibition (shown more in terms as a nostalgic longing for the past in Seita's mind). The only character that shows any concern for the war effort at all is the aforementioned aunt, who mostly just uses it as a source of derision to use against Seita.It's pretty mundane, a lot of the film is spent just showing the interactions and daily life things that happen between the brother and sister. Taking baths, playing together on the beach, cooking food and eating together. The title of the movie becomes pretty symbolic as well. The amount of emotional attachment that the viewer grows for Seita and Setsuko over the span of a ninety minutes long animated film is a remarkable achievement. Don't let its identity as a Japanese children's anime fool you; it will tug at your heartstrings as much as any three hour long Hollywood saga will.This isn't really a complaint lodged at the film itself, as I've never seen the original Japanese version. But some of the English voice acting is a little bit hammy. I wasn't really expecting Oscar-worthy performances from a 2012 dubbing that was put together for a Blu-ray release of the movie, and the voices of Seita and Setsuko aren't bad, but some of the minor characters aren't very good.It's heartbreaking and tragic, and it's one of the most human movies of all time. Check this one off of that watchlist when you get the chance; you won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Animated film at its best,"To give Hotaru no haka a fair judgement is hard. It is without question one of the best animated films I have ever seen. The way most of the kind of action you would expect in a war movie has been scaled of and replaced by plausible characters and beautiful and powerful scenery, always created so that it seems as if a painter were creating a new masterpiece in every cell, it makes the protagonists lives seem more real than just about any other war depiction I have seen this far. It is quite special in another aspect as well, as it depicts japanese civilians during the second world war I can honestly say that this is the first such film I have seen, a situation I think many can identify with. The fact that the film does not demonise any human beings, not even the enemy, which can only be seen as anonymous bombplanes high up in the sky, but just tells a tragic and timeless story about a boy and his sister and their struggle to survive in wartimes is actually what makes this film a true masterpiece. This will be hard for any western filmmaker to surpass.The summation can only come to this: if you haven't seen Hotaru no haka yet, do it, you will not regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A survival tale,"Grave of the Fireflies, set in Japan during the hellish summer of 1945, tells the story of a boy who takes on the duty of looking out not only for himself but also his toddler sister under some of the most dangerous conditions possible -- a catastrophic war with a horrible famine -- after his mother is killed in an American air raid. There's much work to do, but practically no food.The son does surprisingly well in letting his little sister be a little girl, introducing her to the beauties of nature and the Japanese culture even under the extreme conditions. Two things are lacking -- food and safety. Not all the fireflies are the innocuous insects; some are the small pellets of incendiary thermite that the US Army Air Corps drops upon the wooden buildings that are the norm in Japan.To go further I would have to spoil the movie ending.The animation is excellent, the symbolism is effective, and so far as I can tell, it could only have been an animation. The situation is simply to dangerous for live actors of any age, let alone children, and the destruction necessary to establish the true horror of war and hunger would be violate every ethic.

Please watch this movie.,"I am no fan of animated features, but this film is extraordinary by any standard. The Japanese ""anime"" method doesn't focus on the animation per se, which would be considered ""primitive"" by contemporary American standards, but the scenery and backgrounds themselves are dream-like watercolours, even if many of those dreams in this case would be nightmares. The story is set in Kobe during the Allied firebombing, but the message is transmitted obliquely through the plight of a young student and his little sister who are rendered homeless in the devastated city. In an interview, the creator remarked that it would never enter his mind to use adults for the children's voices, despite the arduous task of guiding a five-year-old girl through the multiple takes required in a full-length film. Always by indirection, this sincerity makes a great impact. Perhaps I'm just a softy old coot, but I'm choked up even writing this review.

a gem,"casualties of war. apocalypse now. platoon. born on the fourth of july. these, among other countless films, pale in comparison to the breadth and emotional power of the grave of the fireflies. and what's even amazing is that it's in animation. i have never seen a film whose camera chooses to show the atrocities of war and the children that are affected by them. what's unique about the film is in its painstaking efforts in letting us see the details of childhood and innocence lost, the quiet moments between siblings, the horrible effects of war. nothing is wasted in this film. a shot of an abandoned pail of water near a well evokes a deep symbolic meaning. we were fortunate enough to have seen this movie during a film festival held in our university. everyone came out in tears. this is not to say that the movie is wretchedly sad, as it also evokes a firmer resolve that something like this should not be permitted to happen. GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is the best war (or anti-war, whatever that means) movie ever made. and i'm glad mr. ebert included this gem in his golden movies.",,Anonymous,Animation
Powerful!,"Simply one of the most honestly told, beautiful, heart breaking films ever made and it's a shame that this undiscovered gem isn't known throughout the animation realm. Perhaps it's a good thing that Grave of the Fireflies isn't well known because it will be free from the corrupted minds of cheesy Hollywood producers like Jerry Bruckheimer, who would of missed the point of the message entirely and add a brain dead script along with Josh Harnett as Seita. Or George `one trick pony' Lucas who would of used CGI Muppets to play humans, and add Jah Jah Stinks in there `for the kids' that leaves us with a kind of humour that makes us cry in despair. Anyway enough of my moaning.I first stumbled upon Grave of the Fireflies whilst surfing on Amazon for the Princess Mononoke DVD were it popped up on the recommendation list, I was Hooked on the title and the plot. After watching it I was totally not disappointed with what I saw, and was left with a tear in my eye from the sheer power of it all. As you all know properly know that fireflies is set in 1945 Kobe during the closing months of World War 2, The main characters in this film are Seita and Setsuko where their mother dies in the American bombing raids  whilst their father who is a navy officer on the cruiser `The Maya' not knowing if he is alive. They stay with their aunt for awhile who scolds them for being lazy and not doing anything for the war effort, and is reluctant to share rations with Seita and Setsuko. Even though she trades in their goods and their mothers goods to buy food. Eventually they leave and take refuge in a disused bomb shelter where after a few their hunt for foods leads to stealing. The one thing I truly admire about Fireflies doesn't use over dramatic images of destruction during the bombing raids and when Setsuko is grouchy for her mother. My mother loved this film and it reminded her of the Village she lived in, during 1950's Turkey. Where she lived in a very poor family with none of the things we take for granted like electricity and running water, and where kids had to make their own toys e.g. dolls with sticks, rags and cotton wool and playing with insects like dragonflies and fireflies. My mother cried when she saw Seita and Setsuko used fireflies to light up the bomb shelter it reminded her of how her brothers and sisters used to chase fireflies that would enter their room.Grave of the Fireflies is directed by Isao Takahata who was one of the directors of the ever popular TV series of the 1970's Heidi', which became a social phenomenon in Spain and Italy (where in some cases that episodes were repeated due to popular demand) he was also one of the key animators on Hayao Miyazaki's critically acclaimed Princess Mononoke. Ever since I've seen Grave of the Fireflies and Princess Mononoke, I've grown obsessed with anime in particular with Studio Ghibli  which has a great list of films to its name and I'm looking forward on seeing Studio Ghibli's next release Spirited Away which is due to hit British shores. I highly recommend this film and you won't be disappointed.

"Touching, but emotionally draining","To start, let me say that this is one of the most powerfully emotional films I have ever seen. Some people might be turned off by the fairly simplistic animation style, or write it off as a children's movie without really giving it a chance. While I can't speak for everyone, I believe this would be a mistake.I won't put any plot details here, for two reasons. First, there are literally hundreds of other reviews here with that information, if you really want to know, and I believe that films have more impact if you go into them with as little information as possible. But as good as this movie is, I don't think I'll watch it again, at least not for a while. It's so powerful, so utterly affecting on a primal, visceral level, that it's a real ordeal to watch. But don't let that deter you. I believe this is a film everyone should see at least once.The one thing Grave of the Fireflies does better than any other film I've seen is to show the real human cost of war. We all read about World War II in history class, with varying degrees of detail, but reading dry, detached stats in a book about a war that happened before most of us were born is vastly different than seeing the thing like this, up close and personal. It's too easy for us to just see the people on the losing side of our bombing raids as the enemy, and not as real humans that suffer as much or more than we do. That, more than anything else, is what endeared me to this movie. It made me think about things differently, things I was sure I already knew. That's rare in any movie, much less an animated one. So in conclusion, I definitely highly recommend Grave of the Fireflies, but don't make the mistake of thinking it's lighthearted and whimsical just because it's animated. It's heavy, profound, and deeply moving. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
profoundly penetrating/moving film,"Few movies can touch one's being to the core. Its impact was totally unexpected as I watched the film only because it happened to be the other feature in the 2 film-in-1 DVD I purchased. I had absolutely no idea what the film was all about. Now I can't get those profoundly moving scenes, Setsuko's face and voice off my mind. Though the film depleted my energy/vigor at the end, it was a welcomed feeling as it leaves one in touch with one's ""forgotten"" sense of humanity. Or the film heightens it, if it's not forgotten. I was utterly silent, deeply sad, ""devastated"" and brokenhearted when the final credits rolled. I felt both the actual and potential ugliness and beauty of being human all at once. Many films have been existentially moving, but few are as simple, direct though subtle, and as matter-of-factly as ""Grave of the Fireflies"".

children knocking on heavens door...,"This movie is about two orphaned siblings (an elder brother and toddler sister) trying to survive in the war torn Japan of the second world war. I think it would be a mistake to call this an anti-war film. Certainly it will pluck some chords in you as to the stupidity and cruelty of war. However, I think this is a film mostly about love, selfless devotion and atonement. The elderly brother who himself is basically also a child, takes the care of his sister into his own hands. He makes some poor decisions. These decisions are very natural given that he is just a naive child, and moreover the proud, somewhat spoiled child of a war officer. The story unfolds very realistically, you just know that everything will spiral down for the lonely children in an unforgiving world, but that the love between them will last.This movie presents the film making art at its best. The story telling, excruciating attention to details, directing, all faultless. I like this film also for the acting, I think it would be impossible for a child do the acting for the Setsuko character (the toddler sister) in a non-anime movie as is done here. She is so natural and real, it is difficult not to be moved. The only flaw I can find with the movie is the musical score. Mostly it is OK, but it could have been better.I am not very familiar with the Japanese culture, but I can say that the film includes some subtle but powerful criticism for the nationalistic fervor which led in that time to the ruin of Japan. You see officers rooting for the emperor in the ashes of a burnt down city full of burned corpses. You see half-starved children still chanting the songs about the proud steel warships of their empire. And you see the same proud children later but this time hurraying for the enemy planes because the bombs they pour are the only way they can feed themselves.

Tragedy,"The real meaning of tragedy in an animated film. Your tears will be so close. This is the first time I almost cry in an animated film. The film reveals the catastrophes of wars. The film is influential on all ages.The film opens on September 21, 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, at Sannomiya Station. Here, Seita (清太?), a 14-year-old boy, is seen dying of starvation. Later that night, a janitor digs through his possessions, and finds a candy tin, which he throws away into a nearby field. From the tin spring the spirits of Seita and his younger sister Setsuko (節子?), as well as a cloud of fireflies. Seita's spirit narrates their story alongside an extended flashback to Japan in the final months of World War II, beginning with the firebombing of the city of Kobe in March 16–17, 1945.The flashback begins with a fleet of several hundred American B-29 Superfortress bombers flying overhead. Setsuko and Seita, the two siblings, are left to secure the house and their belongings, allowing their mother, who suffers from a heart condition, to reach a bomb shelter. They are caught off-guard as the bombers begin to drop thousands of incendiary bomblets, which start huge fires that quickly destroy their neighborhood and most of the city. Although they survive unscathed, their mother is caught in the air raid and is horribly burned. She is taken to a makeshift clinic in a school, but dies shortly after. Having nowhere else to go, Setsuko and Seita move in with a distant aunt, who allows them to stay but convinces Seita to sell his mother's kimonos for rice. While living with their relatives, Seita goes out to retrieve leftover supplies he had buried in the ground before the bombing. He gives all of it to his aunt, but hides a small tin of Sakuma fruit drops, which becomes a recurrent icon throughout the film. Their aunt continues to shelter them, but as their food rations continue to shrink due to the war, she becomes increasingly resentful. She openly remarks on how they do nothing to earn the food she cooks.Seita and Setsuko finally decide to leave and move into an abandoned bomb shelter. They release fireflies into the shelter for light. The next day, Setsuko is horrified to find that the insects have all died. She buries them all in a grave, asking why they have to die, and why her mother had to die. What begins as a new lease on life grows grim as they run out of rice, forcing Seita to steal from local farmers and loot homes during air raids. When he is caught, he realizes his desperation and takes an increasingly-ill Setsuko to a doctor, who informs him that Setsuko is suffering from malnutrition but offers no help. In a panic, Seita withdraws all the money remaining in their mother's bank account, but as he leaves the bank, he becomes distraught when he learns from a nearby crowd that Japan has surrendered unconditionally to the Allied Powers. He also learns that his father, captain of the Imperial Japanese Navy heavy cruiser Maya, is probably dead, since nearly all of Japan's navy is now at the bottom of the ocean. He returns to the shelter with large quantities of food, only to find a dying Setsuko hallucinating. Seita hurries to cook, but Setsuko dies shortly thereafter. Seita cremates Setsuko, and puts her ashes in the fruit tin, which he carries with his father's photograph, until his own death from malnutrition in Sannomiya Station a few weeks later.In the film's final sequence, the spirits of Seita and Setsuko are seen healthy, well-dressed and happy as they sit together, surrounded by fireflies. The camera then moves showing the two looking down on the modern city of Kobe.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant. Too tough. Superb. Heartwrenching. (ad lib),"Before setting out praising this movie, just a little message to those who (agAIn) ask themselves what the point is of making anime so realistic, since anime is supposed to be used for stuff that can't be done in real film. Well, two replies : a) then anime should be abandoned altogether, because they can pretty much do anything in film by now - ironically, often with special effects that are little more than computer generated anime! b) that remark testifies to, besides an extremely narrow view of what a particular art form can be, a profound lack of respect for anime as a medium equal to plain film. Since, what it's saying is basically ""in specific cases anime is better, but when both art forms can do it, film is always superior"". But there's more. Apparently, none of the folk who put forth that limited view on anime have ever heard of the idea that the more abstract a figure becomes, the easier it becomes to identify with it. So, to spell it out: where a normal film might keep a certain distance between you and the characters, anime characters are more easily generalised and thus identified with.But what about Grave of the Fireflies? Well, to put it plain and simple: if you haven't seen it, you're an utter idiot. I won't tell you what to feel (except in the summary line), but the film's perfect. Pacing, direction, photography, plot, you name it. And it avoids the easiest ""ho let's go for the big emotion"" style. It does go for it, but in a very no-bul**hit way, drawing a straight line and following it.I do like Miyazaki films, but since I bought the Ghibli Box (which did not include Fireflies, as it isn't distributed by Disney outside of Japan, and the box's DVD's come from HK) I must admit that, especially in his later films, Miyazaki tends to go for Big Messages. Instead, the three films by Takahata I've seen thusfar (especially Fireflies and Only Yesterday) are marvels of understatedness. By which I mean, it's more a thing of showing the facts and letting you make up your own mind, rather than chewing your emotional food for you. Not that Miyazaki isn't good, but Takahata has made three of the best Ghibli films. And he's not afraid of showing a darker note in his films, whereas Miyazaki tends to keep his films (except Mononoke) on constant feelgood mode.Anyhow. Required viewing. Just take my word for it.

i am speechless...this is so far my favourite manga film at the moment.....,"I am not a film critic and had never reviewed films......But thought i'd put in my two cents......As I was purchasing Spirited Away and Casstle In The Sky...I came across Grave Of The Fireflies.....I knew or heard nothing about this film...In fact, I didn't know much of Isao Takahata's work at all....And being an anime fan....I bought the movie....Finally, I had a chance to watch the film.....and I could not stop crying....Not only because the film was a sad film......but also a heart warming.....when the spirits of the two siblings reunited..... The opening scene gave me the chills and haunted me a little....The last thing I expected was the main character telling me the day and year he had died as an opening line of the movie..... True to its nature that not all manga films are made for the children.....This film is quite realistic.......here we see the lives of two orphans in the closing days of World War II thorough their eyes and how little people care for one another when it comes to wars......and how it affects them.....I am going to buy a copy of this film and send it express post to George W Bush........and ask him to review and rate this film....I grew up with Japaness animation and will murder anyone who does not have an open mind or at least appreciate it for what it is..d(*_*))b.....Please watch this film......",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good movie, be wary of the negatives due to lack of understanding","I've read most of the negative reviews for this movie and I really pity the members making them. There's just a shear lack of understanding and/or appreciation for what had gone on. As a kid during the same war period I can relate to this story and can understand why these negative reviewers really can't see nor understand why this is happening the way it is.For example, them leaving because of the Aunt. This is a classic case not just in Japan but for many cultures. Her attitude towards them is so disgraceful there is no choice but to leave. Yes, he could have stayed and help his sister out but eventually they will not get any food, water or shelter. Worst yet, they'll get beaten to death simply because the Aunt will choose to support her family instead of her Sisters. That's how evil this scene is without even being told out completely. Viewers don't understand this it seems. Maybe everything needs to be explain for them every step of the way, I've no idea.In fact, my Father, sister and I just started talking for hours the other night about the family's ""travels"" to avoid the war and get the kids to safety and eventually to the US. Let me tell those that don't understand; my Father's sigh from telling the story is a sigh that I will never be able to reproduce. No matter how hard my life has been up until now, it can never compare to what they have gone through and what little I have witnessed during the escape.Honestly, you can't imagine how hard it is until you've been there. Having said that, this movie does a good job at telling it's story. If you're reading the reviews for this movie I hope you consider what I've said. Some people aren't open minded enough to see what is being communicated with the movie and assumes by taking some things too literal, as in the boy not taking up a job. Do yourself a favor and watch the film with an open mind, you'll enjoy it more.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Beautiful Movie...,"Grave of the Fireflies is a movie set in WWII Japan in the port city of Kobe. It is narrated by the spirit of Seta, an eleven year old boy found dead in a train station with an tin of candy filled with ashes. We follow him as he tells us the moving story of his last days.This movie is visually gorgeous, emotionally wrenching, and lyrically directed. This movie moves slowly, with long shots of a brother and sister living their lives. There is one shot of Seta doing flips on a bar in a parking lot trying to cheer his sobbing sister up.This is one of the greatest movies ever made, do not let the fact that it is animated bother you.

Horribly Wonderful,"This film was made with such breathtaking care that I don't expect to see another film that will move me with such intensity. The story line is told with painstaking detail, and that's what makes this movie so poignant, you understand the characters, through the little details, so well, that you cannot help but feel that what you perceive is what these characters are feeling. I literally cried throughout 15 of the films' 90 minute runtime, not just a tear in the eye ""oh that's too bad,"" but sobbing ""OH MY GOD WHY, WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN?!"" I remember a comment kept running through my head, ""this is not fair, it's not fair it had to happen to them, it's not their fault, dammit it's not their fault."" This film is a representation of how good dramatic anime can be, if used correctly. There are no kung fu fights, or mysterious dragons, only reality. Such horrible wonderful reality that one will find that they cannot think about war in the same way as they did before. I know that this was the greatest war movie I have ever seen. It also might just be the greatest film ever. See it, don't walk, run, you must see this film.Brandon Gilbrech",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The metaphor was daunting and just could not be ignored.

A Masterpiece Critics The War.,"I Have watched The Grave Of The Fireflies without having an idea about its plot, I just saw it once on social media so I googled it and checked its score and I found it on the Top 250 Movies list, which encouraged me to watch it without reading the plot.When the movie started I thought that's going to treat the world war topic and its social/political effects generally and not on personal situation. I was impressed with the graphics of the movies at first it was so perfect as if it was produced in the 00s, not in the late 80s. The characters were so great and especially the Little Girl, they got her so cute and you'll love her from the begging of the movie and you'll be attached to her.So this isn't like all animated Japanese movies this one has a special thing in it and it will surely have an effect on you personally and make you think about the cruelty of wars.I really advise you to go and watch it and you'll understand what I mean and you'll agree with me with no doubt.Simply Best Animated Movie 10/10 A MASTERPIECE!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A poignant, touching, sad tale of love and endurance.","For those who insist that cartoons of all forms, and particularly anime, are for children, I present you with Grave of the Fireflies. This amazingly well-done anime has some of the most touching, most depressing scenes I've ever seen on a screen, regardless of format.This film is set in Japan near the end of World War 2. Seita and Setsuko live in Kobe with their mother, whom they adore. When the air raid sirens sound, Seita and Setsuko run ahead to the bomb shelter, leaving their mother (who has a heart condition and cannot run) to follow. Seita is obviously not happy with this situation, but the early teen youth cannot carry both his toddler sister and his mother, so he agrees, sure his mother will join them at the shelter.From here begins the long, sad tale of the losses that Seita and Setsuko suffer through together. This is very much the story of a young man forced into the role of provider, protector, and nurturer years ahead of time, and of his little sister who adores him. Seita struggles to provide for himself and for Setsuko, and refuses to surrender himself to despair, regardless of the obstacles he is presented.I feel that this movie is all the more heart-wrenching for the way that the hurt and the pain and the fear are interspersed with the moments of joy and lightheartedness. For much of the movie, it is almost possible to believe that Seita and Setsuko will come out of this together. Of course, since the movie opens with Seita dying, alone, you know that your hope is misplaced, but you want them to survive. The love they share, and the joy they take from one another make you root for them.The characters in Grave of the Fireflies are remarkably well acted. Seita, standing strong, doing whatever is necessary to take care of his little sister. Setsuko is the perfect toddler. Happy one moment, crying the next, unsure of why anything is happening, but sure that Seita can fix everything. The children's aunt, a cold, sarcastic, bitter woman, taking every opportunity to ensure the children, especially Seita, is aware of how much they impose upon her and her patriotic family.In addition to the quality of the story and the caliber of the actors, the beauty of the artwork is just incredible. The facial expressions, the landscapes, the atmosphere. It's all wonderful, drawing you into the story. I found myself checking to see if the prone form of Setsuko was breathing as she lie ill, then realizing that wait, this is animation.This provocative, compelling tragedy is based upon a true story. The original author, Nosaka Akiyuki, wrote a novel based upon his real-life experiences at the end of the war in Japan. This story was then turned into a manga (Japanese comic book), and the story became very popular and well-known.Trivia buffs might be interested in knowing exactly how this movie made it to the screen. A director by the name of Hayao Miyazaki was working on a project named ""My Neighbor Totoro"" but the production company was worried that nobody would be interested in the tale of two little kids and a monster living in rural Japan. Therefore, they decided to make a movie they felt would draw viewers based upon the familiarity of the tale and for the educational value of the story, and make it a double-feature with ""My Neighbor Totoro"", billing and packaging the two movies together. Those who are familiar with both movies find the concept of packaging or viewing the cheery, light-hearted romp that is Totoro with such somber, depressing fare as ""Grave of the Fireflies"" mind-boggling, but the tactic seemed to work, though Totoro has become far more popular and well-known of the two movies.I cannot recommend this movie enough. It is a poignant story of the love shared by a pair of siblings in the worst possible conditions. And you'll never look at fruit drops the same way again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It lets you follow, almost as an unseen intruder into their plight and their brave suffering and spiralling decline.

Instead, these are children in war, wherever they may bedarn, it turns my state of heart upside down, completely cleared up all the smiles, joys, and nostalgic memories I got after watching Spirited Away.This movie reminds me of a reason I've forgotten, that is why at some point I'd turned to be a completely pacifist that I didn't even defend myself in the presence of serious harm from others. I was looking at myself as a coward, dumb etc, until I'm reminded that once I decided to hurt others with a reason of defense, one day (who knows?)I would declare war for the same reason, and I'd be the one causing these human beings to suffer.How in the world in this movie not in the top 250???? or as a matter of fact, in the top 10 next to Schindler's List????

A Rarity: Decent Japanese Anime - Grave of the Fireflies,"Other than this film and Spirited Away, you would be hard-put to find any Japanese anime worthy of serious discussion for content. Generally speaking, Japanese anime is a collection of boring violence and/or sex, with about as much intellectual content as a Tom and Jerry comic book. These two films, however, rise above the mainstream of the genre. Grave of the Fireflies has a more somber message than Spirited Away, but an important message, nevertheless. The effect of war on children is always a tragic subject for any film, and has been done several times in the past; mostly revealing life among the ruins in Germany, Italy and other countries affected by WW2. This time, we get to see the Japanese carnage among the civilian population; an area seldom explored by Hollywood producers. A good film for children to see as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
He's not really the hero he thinks he is,I find it incredibly hard to buy in the logic that this is anti-war because Setsuko died a horrible death. None of the other Japanese in the film including the brother himself were malnourished to the point of no return. Setsuko died because of her brothers foolishness and stubbornness. No amount of melodrama is going to change that reality.,5.0,Anonymous,Animation
An unparalleled surreal experience,"I came across the name of this movie while reading the book on Great Movies by Roger Ebert. When I watched the movie the experience was like a beautiful dream. Has there been any more lyrical with hard realism portrayed before? This can very easily claim its position amongst the greatest movies ever presented to the likes of All Quiet on the Western Front or Pather Panchali (Song of the Road). The fact that it has not really amazes me. Is it because it's an anime? Or perhaps it's from a country which has not been known beyond Kurosawa, Ozu or Mizoguchi or likes of them?
The beauty of Hora no haka does not lie in the fact that it shows realism. Nor in that it shows the effects of war on common man and thus humane in nature. Nor because it's simplicity as if viewing through the POV of two kids - one in his early teens and his sister who is barely perhaps 5 years old. It's about all of these told in a most poetic way.
The director Isao Takahata's masterstroke is to create an anime instead of a feature film. He perhaps couldn't have depicted the wide range of emotions of the characters, particularly the two children in a better way had it been anything else. The anime has provided the director the complete liberty to portray the feelings in a most telling way, stripped off completely from the physical presence of actors of sets or even the nature itself which can be sometimes distracting.
I have stopped short of giving it a perfect score perhaps because of this only. But through this I have been part of the director's and story teller's imagination, shared the emotions with its players, lamented at their losses, hardships and agony, enthralled by the beauty and openness of the nature; absorbed within the sweetness of its tune.
Few other films have achieved this and few will be able to provide such an immersive and beautiful experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the Best Animated Films I've Ever Seen,"This is no knock on ""The Lion King"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Fantasia"" or ""Snow White and Seven Dwarfs"", but ""Grave of the Fireflies"" has done something very few, if any animated features (I feel) have ever done. The film has an emotional power, which is drawn from its serious topic of war and the human spirit. Plus ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is rich in animated detail and human feeling, which towers this film above most animated films.Perhaps one of animation's few downfalls is its simplicity. Animation for the most part is viewed as a child's medium. There are many reasons for this, but ""Grave of the Fireflies"" proves without a doubt that this is a falsity. Director Isao Takahata shows that animation has all the capabilities of approaching difficult issues (like war and its consequences) with a personal heart and creative touch.The story is about a brother (Seita) and a sister (Setsuko) who deal with a great tragedy and struggle after a bombing during World War II. Yet this film has so many moments of beauty to respond to the moments of horror. The moments of Seita and Setsuko swimming or of Setsuko burying the fireflies are absolutely wonderful in their subtlety. There's not a ton of action going on in those scenes but they're so richly detailed in the animation and narrative that your eyes stay glued to the screen.This film is a testament to the human spirit and living life to the fullest. I will not lie, this film is fairly hard to swallow, it deals with difficult issues. Yet it is because of this challenge that this film stands above about every other animated films. It proves that animation is not just for children, but for everyone. This film made me smile and almost brought me to tears at the same time. ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is truly one of the greatest animated films of all-time. A 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Grave of the Fireflies: A Heart-Wrenching Animation That Depicts the Human Cost of War,"Grave of the Fireflies is a heart-wrenching film that tells the story of two siblings' struggle to survive during the aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima in 1945.

Anime unlike any other anime,"There is a possibility of minor spoilers in the following review, but I didn't tick the box, because I'm not sure if they pose a problem or spoil the movie for you.I have yet to find another anime that is similar to this title. And for the record, that's meant positive. I'm a fan of anime, and I don't care what some might think of that, but this is a movie I recommend to anyone. So to those that hold prejudgments to anime, be it because you really don't like it or because you just don't know better, watch this movie.From start to finish, Hotaru no Haka intrigues everyone that watches it. The opening scene has been criticized a lot, but to me it was done brilliantly. Based on a novel, Isao Takahata had a urgent need for a proper narrator in his film. And when you think about that, you even marvel at the first scenes more, for he has found the perfect way to present the story he is going to tell. Though it is true some scenes were perhaps to long and to sentimental, they didn't bother me. If you were drawn inside the story from the beginning (that is meant to happen), you would barely notice and those scenes would give you some time to reflect about what you just saw.Having seen this with subtitles, I cant say anything about the English voice-actors, but the Japanese have put together a splendid cast in this one. Many inexperienced seiyu have given their all, most notably the youngest (Setsuko) who was but five at the time. But the most important thing in this movie is the story, and the meaning behind it. How difficult is it for humans (let alone teenagers) to swallow their pride? Thats watch it's about. You can easily sympathize with Seita (age +/-13) and you could feel at that very moment you could've done the same. But when you think of it later on; Was it the right choice? Was it OK for him to step outside the system?It is clear where I'm taking this I guess. If you are an anime-fan you should've already watched this. If you aren't watch this and keep possible prejudgment about anime aside, for they do not apply. That said, Grave of the Fireflies manages to present a realistic war-torn Japan in which two children try to survive outside the system. Just the fact that there isn't a single trace of humor (don't confuse it with pity and other emotions) and virtually no violence alone, make this movie worth a view.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A horrible and shivering reality of poverty during World War II,"Grave Of The Fireflies (1988) :
Brief Review -A horrible and shivering reality of poverty during World War II. Grave Of The Fireflies brings horrible firing reality of poverty and struggle of livelihood on screen in animated form. There are limits to reciprocation of emotions in animated form of cinema because most of the content looks insensitive and unrealistic. The emotions have to embark in mind to tug a ring in heart but it doesn't happen unless the narrative immerses you into it. If the expressions of actors or real faces & bodies makes you feels it many times and it's natural only, then that thing is lacking here. May be that's why Grave Of The Fireflies looks roughly dramatic even though it had strongly sensitive content. The story of Siblings struggling for livelihood during final phase of World War II in Japan is never gonna look nerveless or weak in any part of the world and any time hence it works here too. The only matter is it comes with lot of cinematic shortcomings and limits. I don't know why this film is taunted as One Of The Greatest Animated Film ever. I would choose other Pixar and Disney Classics over it easily. May be it came much before those Pixar Classics happened and that could be the reason for high appreciation but still the narrative wasn't worthy enough or timeless mania kind of stuff. Overall, Grave Of The Fireflies is a good story blended with Brother and Sister's Love and emotional bond to work high on nerves but there isn't anything like extraordinary or outstanding by any chance.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestesy",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's as good as you've heard,"There are few movies which not only hold your interest throughout, but can stay in your mind for days later. 'Grave of the Fireflies' (GotF) is one such film. Among war films, it's one of the few which can convey its message without stating that there are good guys and bad guys, or heroes and villains, or ""our side versus the enemy"". Instead, the enemy is the indifference that war causes, and the pride which can blind people of their humanity. It's more of an anti-war film, since the opponent is the war itself.14 year old Seita is the main character, who is suddenly tasked with caring for his 5 year old sister Setsuko during World War 2 in Kobe, Japan. In the opening scene, we see Seita's last moments of life, right before he joins the ghost of his sister. Seita's eyes don't have the youth, energy, nor enthusiasm which often goes with the age. His first words give the date of September 21, 1945, followed by ""that was the night I died"" before breathing his last. The rest of the movie is a flashback as to exactly how he got that way.If you've ever seen Spielberg's classic ""Schindler's List"", you already know what sort of movie to expect. But since GotF is Japanese animation instead of being a live action Hollywood film, it's not as well known. And that's a shame. Many adults have likely seen the movie box when browsing for new titles, before judging it as an unworthy time waster for their children, when the story is really too powerful for many adults.With a budget of $6,000,000 to produce, it's unlikely that a World War 2 era village could have been built, pyrotechnics could have been used to simulate the firebombing, special effects and stunt crews could have been set up and paid for, with all the other expenses involved in recreating the vital scene, with funds left over for everything else. (And if they did, that scene might end up having more screen time than the story actually needs.) Also, writer/producer Isao Takahata doubted that he'd be able to find child actors talented enough to pull off such a challenging role, and he was probably right.In short, this isn't a great anime production, or a great war movie, or a great anti-war movie. It's just a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A heart-wrenching war tale,"""Grave of the Fireflies,"" directed by Isao Takahata, is a profoundly moving animated film that explores the devastating impact of war on innocent lives. Set in Japan during World War II, the story follows siblings Seita and Setsuko as they struggle to survive in the face of immense hardship and loss.The film is renowned for its emotional depth and stark portrayal of human suffering. The animation is beautifully crafted, with meticulous attention to detail that enhances the realism of the characters' experiences. The relationship between Seita and Setsuko is portrayed with heartfelt sincerity, making their plight all the more poignant.While ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is undeniably powerful, it is also a deeply melancholic film that may be overwhelming for some viewers. The narrative is unflinching in its depiction of the harsh realities of war, offering little respite from its somber tone.Despite its heavy subject matter, the film is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring bond between siblings. ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is a haunting, beautifully rendered tale that leaves a lasting impact, though it is not a light watch by any means.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

The hardest movie I've ever watched,"To say this film is sad and depressing would be an understatement. After just 5 minutes into the movie I was already choking up, and by the end I was crying my eyes out. Like crying REALLY hard. It takes a lot to get me to cry, but this did it for me. Very little ""happy"" or ""entertaining"" happens in this movie. What you're getting into is truly one of the saddest (yet beautiful) pieces of art ever made.War sucks no matter how you look at it. Grave of the Fireflies shows just how awful the true cost of it is. There were many times I just wish I could have jumped into the screen and given them some food. I am not joking.Watch this at your own risk. It very well deserves to be considered one of the best animated movies of all time. Prepare yourself for something truly moving.

Most gut wrenching movie ever made,Title says it all this is the saddest most hurtful and painful movie I have ever seen. I believe that if a films goal is to incite an emotion no matter emotion it is if that gets accomplished then that's a good movie. This movies goal is to make you feel sad and it goes above and beyond. The most I've ever cried over any piece of media ever. I believe everyone should watch it at least once but I physically can't bring myself to watch it again. The beginning spoils the movie in a way but that spoiler actually makes everything you're watching even more sad somehow. Being away of actions before they happen means that thought is always lingering at the back of your head and you'll start crying at scenes you normally wouldn't but because you've been given context. Superb movie. And that it's somewhat based on real events kills me.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Animated reality,"To reiterate what another reviewer said, the film is haunting. From the opening frame to the last (especially the last), that is indeed the best way to describe this excellent film. I have no idea how to explain how an animated film about orphaned, starving children in war-time Japan can be watchable, but this one is. Probably the fact that it's animated has something to do with it (and consideration of that possibility brings to mind comparisons to Art Spiegelman's comic book Maus, which employs cartoon animals to depict people in a biographical account - Spiegelman's father's - of Nazi death camps). In any event, a live action film would not be possible (or very difficult) for, I think, somewhat obvious reasons (the most obvious being the fact that it would be very difficult to effect the appearance of malnourished children). However, the fact that it's animated does not make the story any less sobering (just as the cartoon animals in Maus didn't soften the brutal reality of the situation).",,Anonymous,Animation

I came across the film called ""Grave of the Fireflies"". I read the comment section about how this film was so emotional and so realistic as to how it related to the Vietnam war. And so I'm thinking: ""An animation film emotional? Who's kidding who here?"" What a shocker! This was one of the best films I have ever seen animated or live action.

Worse than I expected,"This is definitely the worst Ghibli-movie yet, Takahata is certainly no storyteller, he should leave the script to others like in the excellent 'Omoide poroporo'.

Shocking - I wasn't prepared for this!,"So, I've received my present from a former student - Ghibli movies - Hooray! I sit and watch...I've never felt the compulsion to review or express my thoughts on a piece of cinema until seeing this movie. I would recommend not reading any reviews re content or any commentary on it's meaning, it would only taint the experience. But if you must I hope the below doesn't take to much away from anyone about to see the film for the first time.Sat in stunned silence, having read no reviews, done any research or had anyone explain to me what this film was about (yes, I'm an ignorant scamp!) I was in shock. Seeing this masterpiece with no expectations or any idea about the movie has been a truly profound experience.It's rare indeed for a work of art to move, causing such a torrent of emotion - and not the one's we often like to deal with. I thought I would be in for an uplifting experience, and I was, in the most unexpected of ways.Antiwar; I don't know? It seems to be touted that way by many. But then again we bring what we want too, and pin meaning to all things subjectively. 'Grave of the Fireflies' does nothing to glorify, demonise or attribute blame for any nations ideologies or the brutality and reality of war. What it does do is portray the reality of the situation and two lives affected by events beyond their power to control and the tragic consequence it has on their lives.For me this movie is a raw, unflinching confession and apology; possibly an attempt to make sense of what must have been a horrendous sense of loss and guilt...somebody's soul laid bare.

DIDN´T EXPECT TO CRY THAT MUCH. A MASTERPIECE,"I don´t really cry with movies but when it comes to children suffering i cry until i can no more. Little did i know that this film was going to become my biggest weakness. The writer knew exactly what he wanted and in my opinion he achieved it very well. It was short but concrete, sad yet with very happily moments. I hate when movies try to be emotional so they put characters suffering, it´s so obvious that they want the audience to cry but don´t get me wrong GRAVE OF FIREFLIES has the intention with the only difference that is well made, realistic, and it´s not only people complaining about the life they have. Moonlight 2016 for example didn´t give me a message, advice or enjoy. It´s just a guy complaining i know his life is hard but he´s doing nothing to change it, not even trying.The florida project girl also has a messed up childhood yet she´s trying to be happy well that´s movie.GRAVE OF FIREFLIES DID WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO AND IT WAS PERFECT.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Shocking and Powerful,I have watched pretty something pretty similar to this before and that was Barefoot Gen. The music and the visuals were nice and well done. The certain pauses at certain scenes and the playing of the music during dramatic or quiet moments was pleasant.The story was well depicted and shown representing Japan during the end of World War II and we get to live in the life of a boy and a girl who are suffering because of the war. The pacing was good and wasn't to fast or too slow. The characters were good the cast was small so there weren't a lot of characters they were only one time appearances except for the two main characters. The ending was well done and was bittersweet.I think the main beauty of this anime lies in the themes of the anime. It takes a while to understand it and find the themes but once you find it I think viewers have those ah ha 💡 moments where they had some unanswered questions.Overall I enjoyed the anime. Very beautiful and sad at the same time. A beacon of hope then a hole of a darkness you will be moved by this anime.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Unlikely..,,Anonymous,Animation

A Heart-Wrenching Masterpiece That Lingers.,"Oh my god. Grave of the Fireflies is a masterpiece-this story, in particular, could not have been done or told in a different way. It's an emotional film filled with realistic life events, capturing the horrors of war in a way that feels almost too real. Even watching it in 2025 for the first time, I couldn't help but see the heartbreaking parallels to what is currently happening in Palestine.Seita and Setsuko's story was devastating. The film didn't shy away from showing the brutal realities of war, making it a tough but necessary watch. Their bond, resilience, and suffering felt painfully real, and watching their struggle unfold was heartbreaking. Despite everything, the film also beautifully captures their love for one another, showing how even in the darkest times, moments of warmth and joy can still exist.The animation was beyond perfect. It enhanced the storytelling and captured the depressing events with painful accuracy. Every scene felt real. Animation is usually an escape from reality, but in this case, it made everything feel even more authentic, as if I was witnessing a true historical tragedy unfold.There's a strong use of symbolism and metaphors throughout the film, making it not just a story but an artistic expression of loss, innocence, and resilience. Simple objects and small, everyday moments take on a much deeper meaning, reinforcing the film's emotional weight without needing to spell everything out. This subtle yet powerful storytelling approach makes the movie even more impactful.The structure of the film was also perfect. The way it unfolds feels natural yet deliberate, making every moment feel purposeful. The pacing allows the audience to truly absorb the emotions and meaning behind each scene. The ending, while heartbreaking, is deeply poetic and lingers long after the credits roll.Overall, I can't think of any other way that this movie or this story could have been told differently. They did it justice and portrayed the feelings perfectly, which is extremely upsetting, but this is honestly a piece of art. It's heartbreaking that the suffering of some people is the reason we get to see something so meaningful, but I think it's incredibly informative and necessary.I would absolutely recommend this movie. Society can be harsh, and this film is a necessary reminder of the suffering that war brings, especially for the innocent. It changes your perspective and makes you think deeply about those who have lived through these horrors. Grave of the Fireflies isn't just a film-it's an experience, one that lingers long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A powerful experience..,"Grave of the fireflies is a fascinating animated story revealing the horrors of war. It is a movie so powerful that it is hard not to get emotionally choked up at the end of the movie (speaking through experience). It tells the story of a teenage boy along with his five year old sister made homeless by the bombings during the World War. They become separated from their mother during an air raid only to find out her dead a few moments later. Their father is a naval officer serving for the country in hostile waters. With no other place to go Setsuko (5 year old girl) under the loving care of her brother Seita, settles in their aunt's house. As time passes their aunt complains about Seita not doing anything to earn food, and starts treating them cruelly. Eventually the two siblings find themselves a cave to reside despite its poor conditions. Here he does whatever he can to feed himself and his sister, while acting as a father figure to her. This desperation to live; fabulously brought to screen will move you beyond anything imaginable. One of the greatest gifts this film has is its ability to show the emotionally draining scenes in an effective manner. We first get to see the playful, cute and cuddly Sestuko having fun only to see her lying helplessly due to starvation.I shouldn't write further for it might spoil the surprises. No other movie has moved me so deeply than ""Grave of the fireflies"". It is a masterful creation to be watched, dissected and most importantly to be learned from.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

But this blows all of them away. Those interested in the typical Anime full of fast cuts and big action will be disappointed with this film.

A poignant tale depicting the harrowing events of war-torn Japan during World War II,"Perhaps for the first time, I watched such a heart wrenching, realistic and poignant tale in an animated movie. The movie charts the tale of a 14 year old brother and his 4 year old sister who are left alone to fend for themselves in war torn Japan. Their mother fell victim to the air bombings which leaves them to shift to their aunt. Slowly the two face the wrath of the war and succumb to malnutrition. Perhaps there is not such distress as of dying of hunger. And the film brings this to the screen, which makes this film just distressing and grim, which you won't dare to go through again.A film that starts on a light note with an undying love and affection of a brother towards his sister ends up with the struggle for survival during wartime where the only motive becomes fulfilling the hunger. The story unfolds vividly in the picture just making you cry. Perhaps this demonstrates the power of the movie to sweep you along. Before this, I felt 'The Pianist"" was able to do the same. Besides, the fabulous animation which you can expect from Japanese animes, there is a tremendously moving story to the film which would make it memorable. Well, most of the Disney and Pixar animations have made you laugh all the way, this movie has a power to make you cry.Rating:: 3 stars out of 4",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best animation I have seen,"Hotaru no Haka, Grave of the Fireflies, is one of those films that really makes one weep.  Even watching it for the second time, consecutively, and after reading the script, and knowing pretty much everything that happens. This is probably the best done film about war that I have ever seen, the only one that moved me (and I've seen lots of Holocaust films, POW films, etc).The music is well done, not spectacular, and it reinforces the animation well, particularly in the beautiful scenes with the fireflies.  The animation is not technically sophisticated, by which I mean, it does not use computer graphics (I think) or any of the jazzy animation techniques that Disney favours, but the motions used, the poses, angles, and actions--the true meat of the animation, that is--are very difficult to draw, let alone animate.All in all, I would say that this is the best animated film I have ever seen, and should stand as a benchmark by which all other animation should be measured.  That in Japan, they produce films like this, with animation, while we blunder about with ""The Black Cauldron"" or ""The Little Mermaid"" or whatever was Disney's 1988 film, really brings home the shallowness of the modern American developments on the art of animation.",,Anonymous,Animation
Manipulative Drivel,"I knew from about the first third of the movie that this was not going to end well.

Just an exercise in futility.I feel like it took more than and gave. Even if this was an example of a true historical occurrence, this would be one that is rather extreme and not the norm. And if it is close to the norm for that time period, why would I want to watch it. It just seems to trying to pile one horrible occurrence after another. The acting is adequate and the artwork and animation is fine. The main problem is the writing. I don't mind a dark ending, but when there is no hope anywhere in the story, there's no reason to continue watching. It just seems like it's notable because of how dark it is, not how good it really is.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

This film is one part of my holy trinity of 'grossly' underrated films of all time & should really be recognised as the greatest anti-war statement in film-making,ever!The plot is very simple, its about a boy and his little sister having been separated from there family (there father is a rich captain in the army) trying to survive the bombing on japan during the world war.telling you this is an extremely emotional film, i feel is a spoiler in itself.

The Saddest Movie I Have Ever Seen...But It's A Must See.,"I've seen quite a few sad movies in my day- The Passion of the Christ (which is especially sad for me as a Christian), Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, The Green Mile, Terms of Endearment, to name just a few.While those live action movies are sad, I personally don't think anything could be sadder than the animated masterpiece, Grave of the Fireflies. Many say that it's so sad that they can never see it again. I just watched it for the 2nd time (the first being about 6 years ago), and while I don't agree with that, I sympathize with the statement.Grave of the Fireflies tells the mostly true story of 2 Japanese siblings, Seita- a teenager, and Setsuko, his 4-year-old little sister. They live during WWII and hide from numerous bombings from Americans- which costs them family members and makes it hard to find shelter and food. And Seita, while meaning well, makes numerous mistakes that are costly too, such as leaving a strict Aunt.I said earlier that Grave of the Fireflies is animated. That's technically a misnomer. Being a Japanese animation, the proper term for it would be ""anime."" And the anime is beautiful- with well drawn characters and settings, and impressive shots, like Seita standing in front of a red light.While anime filmmakers made Grave, I think the film works as a non- live action film on another level. Seeing the starvation, bombings, and death is hard to watch, even if it's all drawn. You look at the animation, and it's tempting to tell yourself, ""It's just a cartoon. It's not real. Everything is okay.""But then it kicks in- no. WWII happened. These attacks (by Americans, no less, who are referred to as ""the enemy"" rather than Americans), happened. Such effects on Japanese people, happened. That makes this truth harder to swallow.And that is something we overlook, especially in Hollywood. While we frown upon Japan bombing Pearl Harbor and forcing us into the war, this movie points out that they were humans affected by the war too, and like a film such as Saving Private Ryan, its images are a plea to end war, if possible. War doesn't just harm adults, but it hurts children too.Grave of the Fireflies is one of the best animated films, and one of the best war films ever made, and very much worthy of being called a masterpiece. But heed my warning and take it VERY seriously- it is NOT for kids (don't show your little kids Frozen and then follow it up with this!), and you WILL cry or at least feel numb if you are at all human. I bawled my first time, and I teared up and felt empty this 2nd time.Grave of the Fireflies is the saddest movie I have ever seen, but I highly recommend that everyone see it at least once. I apologize for the souls that I crush as a result of this recommendation, but it is that important. This movie is a necessity, because the cruel consequences of war are not.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I LOVED this movie...and I really hate Japanamation!,"I watched this film with my teenage son last year. It taught him more about the sad truth of the bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima more than anything else and kept his attention the entire time to boot. This gem of a film taught him more than he ever learned in school about this piece of history, and it was probably told in a more accurate and heartfelt manner than any history book could have presented it. We watched it on the Turner Classic Movies Channel. I was dreading watching it with my son that evening (he is an anime fan), but Robert Osbourne (the host of TCM) said to stay tuned to this movie and really give it a chance even if you were not a Japanamation/anime fan. I was absolutely floored, as was my son. It really touched both of us, and it is difficult to reach teenagers in this day and age. It made tears come to our eyes, and we still talk about this movie rather often. This film is a masterpiece and could be used to teach the horrors of war and the innocent victims who have no political vote or voice at all.

From the opening minutes of the film, tears started streaming down my face, and even after the credits rolled, my emotions continued to overflow. Please don't misunderstand me, I'm not typically one to succumb easily to sentimentality. Yet, this film possesses such a profound emotional depth that labeling its drama as mere manipulation feels unjust. The events portrayed are undeniably authentic.

A very Japanese War Story,"If I cry watching movies, it's typically for things other people don't cry for. I have been known to shed tears watching Samurai movies. Epic scenes get me a little emotional. That said, I'm not generally one to get the proverbial down-pour.In order to explain my reaction, I must explain that I spent the majority of my childhood and adolescence in Japan. In addition to spending a year or so in Hiroshima, I remember meeting a lot of veterans, and talking to a lot of old people about their experiences during the war, and so on. As you probably know, the Japanese are not renowned for their overt emotion. No Englishman ever did a 'stiff upper lip' that could hold a candle to the average stoic Japanese geriatric. They always told their stories with a very 'matter-of-fact' manner. But there was one old couple, the Goto-sans, who left an indelible impression on me (bear in mind, I've met other people who were in the 5- mile blast radius at Nagasaki).They had met as children after the bombing of Nagoya, and they recounted much of the very imagery that is illustrated in this film, right down to the machine-gunning by US navy aircraft of children running to the river , thinking they would not represent a legitimate target to the enemy. Their story had a very profound effect on my understanding of Japan, being as I was about 12 when I heard their stories.Watching this film was very much like watching their story in detail. It was as if their recounted childhood memories had materialised on film. It felt as though it imposed their very personal pain onto my heart and mind. Yes, that's ridiculously melodramatic, but it's precisely how I felt watching it. The story of human tragedy in wartime is common to all cultures and societies the world over, and yet this is a uniquely Japanese story; not for the content of the story, but for the way in which it is told. Any film-maker from any other country tackling this subject-matter would have thought to make a film which could probably be made in any other country (the exception perhaps, being a Russian filmmaker);and any other filmmaker would have delivered a film which does absolutely nothing to move you beyond what we've all seen before in every other war film since, well, that war itself. I believe it is no hyperbole to say that never before in the history of cinema has the subject of innocence in wartime been so perfectly,tragically, heart- rendingly captured. Nothing in this film is an exaggeration. The story itself carries all the necessary emotion, with no use of any of the comparatively ridiculous devices used in a lot of other movies in the same category (and let's not forget, this IS animation). Even the music never becomes excessive or melodramatic. You know how the story ends, but you can't just draw away, and it still tears through you like a rend in linen. It was such an emotional experience for me that I've never been able to repeat viewing. It is such a hopeless tragedy of a story, and yet I felt so much the better for having watched it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Achievement Not Only For Studio Ghibli But Animation As A Whole.,"A profoundly moving, emotionally devastating & truly heartbreaking tale that'll effortlessly find itself on the list of cinema's greatest tear-jerkers, Grave of the Fireflies is a beautifully crafted story that explores the relationship between two siblings & covers their struggle to survive in the war-torn city of Kobe, Japan during the final months of Second World War.Directed by Isao Takahata, this is his first film under Studio Ghibli production banner, which he co-founded with Hayao Miyazaki, & remains one of the proudest achievements for not only the director or the animation studio but the entire animation genre itself. The dynamics of the brother-sister relationship is beautifully expressed on the screen & voice actors have done a splendid job too in bringing these characters to life.The hand-drawn animation is beautiful, evocative & aesthetically pleasing, the effects of war on civilian life is strongly felt, music is minimal yet eloquent & the manner in which the fate of its main characters is unraveled is so depressing that it'll leave many teary-eyed. On an overall scale, Grave of the Fireflies is an absolutely heartbreaking, haunting & harrowing piece of quality cinema that remains one of Studio Ghibli's most defining works & is powerful enough to rank high amongst other war films too. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Animation
"A Harrowing Tale, But Not One I Would Revisit","Grave of the Fireflies is a film that is often praised for its emotional depth and powerful anti-war message. Directed by Isao Takahata, this Studio Ghibli film tells the heartbreaking story of two siblings, Seita and Setsuko, struggling to survive in Japan during World War II. The film is known for its unflinching portrayal of the horrors of war and the devastating impact it has on innocent lives.While I can appreciate the film's intent and the way it captures the tragedy of war, Grave of the Fireflies is not a film that I would want to watch again. The story is deeply sad and emotionally draining, leaving me with a sense of hopelessness. While some might find it a necessary and impactful watch, I found it to be overwhelmingly bleak, to the point where it was difficult to find any enjoyment or satisfaction in the experience.For those who appreciate powerful and challenging films, Grave of the Fireflies is certainly worth seeing. However, for me, the unrelenting sorrow made it a difficult watch, and it's not a film I would recommend lightly. I give it a 4/10 for its emotional impact, but it's not something I would choose to revisit.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's 2024. And I'm still crying.,"A title my wife recommended to me. We finally got around to watching it recently. And I can't quite put to words the emotions that welled in my heart through the process of journeying with the title characters.It's a tight movie with no fluff. It's raw and unrelenting. And it reminds you of how a story doesn't necessarily need to provide viewers with an escape for it to evoke something memorable or incredible. This story tells you the truth and nothing more. World War II is described through the lens of its impact on Japan and its people. Empathy appears to be superficial at best, showing how humans can be when tested to wits end.But in its grim backdrop, you feel the life and love from Seita (the older brother) and Setsuko (the younger sister). The writers appeared to have poured their hearts out to these characters and you can feel it. In their small interactions, even in sadness, you see them pull a sense of joy in just the small happiness they manage to capture for themselves from scene to scene. Even until the very end.I saw another review that said that this is probably the best movie you'll never want to see again. I think that's true.

Heart-wrenching,"Being a die-hard animation fan in all forms, whether it be Disney, Dreamworks, or Japanese anime, I have watched an extensive range but never before have I ever seen an animated film that has caused me to cry at the end. The sytle of animation is like other beautifully Japanese animated films such as Tonari No Totoro, Mononoke Hime and Kurenai no buta (aka Porco Rosso). This style of anime was what drew me to watch it but I was totally unprepared for the 'Schindler's List'-type atmosphere that this movie portrays. The storyline of a brother taking care of his baby sister during the war drew me in so entirely that for many days afterwards I found myself lying wide awake thinking of the message that this movie is clearly trying to send - war destroys. Isao Takahata has made a movie that all older teens and adults should see. Its story is enrapturing, the animation stunning and realistic and its message one that we should all learn from - love not war is what this world needs.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Tiny, fleeting points of light in the endless blackness","The African savannah has an old proverb: ""When elephants fight, the grass gets trampled."" This movie, based on the real-life experiences of a World War 2 survivor, wishes to teach us that there were victims on all sides. One of the harsh realities of the war was that a great many attacks deliberately aimed at civilians, something none of the Allied nations had done on such a massive scale before.The story is completely straightforward. A brother and sister lose their home and mother. Forced to seek shelter with one of the mother's sisters, they struggle to cope in a nation that is rapidly running out of all the essentials. Food, water, medicine, work...and basic human compassion. Indeed, the steady, interminable dehumanization of the aunt (who is actually very warm and friendly when she first takes her new guests in) is tough to watch; she's every bit a victim of the war as her sister.As time passes and the brother and sister are forced to move on, we see that no part of the once-proud empire has been untouched by war, and the famed Japanese politeness has warped into callous indifference. And yet, the brother and sister endure and get what they can out of life to the very end. Even as the last illusions are shattered and the hopelessness of the situation sets in.Is this a sad movie? I don't think so, at least not the way I understand sad movies. Most of the tragedy happens early on; the rest is how two children deal with it. Personally, I found their righteous struggle against despair right up to the final moments inspiring. The ending (which admittedly is fairly ambiguous and can be interpreted a number of ways) gave me a sense that the original author just wants to put the past behind and move on. No vendettas, no hatred, no pining for the old empire. Life goes on.All in all, it's simply a very pretty story, the kind you rarely see in anime, and quite moving, if not necessarily to tears.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dull To Be Honest.,"Maybe it's just dated now as I'm watching it first time in 2023, but I just found the film quite dull and the little girls voice (on the UK Ghibli DVD) was really fake and actually kinda irritating (the others weren't much better either). The whole thing is ultra melodramatic and glacially slow and the glowing reviews here almost seem to be for a different movie than the one I watched. True, I'm not a huge fan of animation but The Plague Dogs and Watership Down were way better, and much less boring, than Grave of the Fireflies.

Boring and Depressing,"Being a fan of other Studio Ghibli films, and after seeing such a high rating here on IMDB, I had high hopes for this movie. Isao Takahata's tale takes place during WW2 in rural Japan. Seita is a teenage boy trying to take care of his three-year-old (give or take) sister Setsuko after the two lose their house when US fighter jets firebomb their town. Unfortunately, Seita has little luck receiving the help he and his sister needs from his fellow countrymen.Let me just start out by saying this is one of the most depressing movies I've seen in a while. Even the scenes with the titular fireflies do little to raise my hope for these two young protagonists. Everywhere the two turn, they are simply ignored, shunned, neglected, or rejected. I don't know if this movie is more of a criticism of the US for bombing Japan and killing thousands of innocent civilians or of Japan for failing to support and counsel each other in such a desperate time.To be honest, even taking into consideration that this movie is over thirty years old at the time of this writing, the animation really is nothing out of this world. While we can imagine the ""fireflies"" (little specks of light on the screen) were impressive back when this movie was released, perhaps akin to lightsabers for the very first audiences who saw Star Wars, in 2023, they feel like a cheap gimmick. Perhaps I was expecting a movie with more imaginative, fantasy-driven elements, such as the masterpiece Spirited Away by the impeccable Hayao Miyazaki. Instead, Grave of the Fireflies is unapollogetically realistic.The plot simply isn't interesting. The movie starts ""in media res"" so we already know what's going to happen. Things just kind of seem to drag on in this rural setting which is constantly under attack. There are no significant plot twists or unexpected events. When it finally ended, I was left asking, ""That was it?"" It could hardly be called a memorable movie.Overall, I would not recommend this movie to a friend. It is slow, boring, depressing, and forgettable. I know I make these comments at the risk of coming off as insensitive. But I honestly don't know what all the hype is about. This is not a fun, magical, heart-warming story, which is what I love so much about the majority of Miyazaki films. It is the opposite of all those things. While I might not go as far to say it is the worst Studio Gibhli film, it is definitely the one I like the least of the ones I have seen.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

The siblings initially stay with their aunt, but tensions rise due to their inability to contribute financially, leading them to leave and fend for themselves.They find refuge in an abandoned bomb shelter and attempt to live independently. However, their situation rapidly deteriorates due to shortages of food and resources, and Setsuko's health declines. Despite Seita's best efforts to provide for his sister, the harsh realities of wartime scarcity and the emotional strain take a heavy toll.As their circumstances worsen, the film portrays their increasingly desperate struggle for survival, culminating in a tragic and heartbreaking conclusion.

A beautiful film that imprints on the heart,"A story of a teenage boy (Seita) who's left to take care of himself and his little sister (Setsuko) in World War II struck Japan, this movie magnificently depicts what a young boy would go through in such cruel times.The beauty of this film lies in the realistic emotions that Seita goes through during his struggle. In such adverse conditions he can still find joy in spending time with Setsuko in the farms, running on the beach and with the glowing fireflies at night. While he initially manages to cope well and even finds a shelter exclusive to just the two of them, the gravity of the situation takes its toll, especially in tending to little Setsuko. Resorting to unsavory measures to feed themselves, one of the most touching moments of the film is when Seita breaks down weeping and embraces Setsuko after being roughed up by a farmer for stealing crops. His unconditional love for his sister forces him to brave every adversity and every tragic news he receives about his parents, shielding Setsuko from every disturbing trouble .

Grave of the Fireflies offers a heartbreaking look at life and death that few films can rival.,"I first saw Grave of the Fireflies in the fall of 2013 in my dark upstairs apartment in college; after finishing the film, I went straight to bed. Despite it being one of the most beautiful movies I had ever seen, it was about two years before I could bring myself to watch it again.The film follows fourteen-year-old Seita and four-year-old Setsuko in Japan in World War II. After their home is destroyed and their mother killed in a firebombing raid, they are forced to find somewhere new to live. A distant aunt takes them in, but as she grows more resentful of their unwillingness to contribute to meals and housework, Seita decides to move out for good. Now completely on their own, the siblings move into an unused bomb shelter and wait for the fighting to end.This is a complex story. On the surface, it is easy to view Fireflies as an anti-war film, given its brutally honest portrayal of victims of war. Director Isao Takahata, though, has denied this many times, and has said that it is instead a message to contemporary, young audiences to be thankful for the environment they live in. As a survivor of the Okayama air raids, Takahata saw attitudes around him shifting and felt that the younger generation was taking for granted the luxuries that they had.In the film, the United States is never referred to outright and instead provides the backdrop for the story. This is a story about people, not nations.Instead, I see this as primarily a movie about self-destructive pride, which is especially pertinent to a nation that often viewed suicide more highly than surrender, refusing to give up on a war that they had been losing for years. Beyond the attack at the beginning of the film, what the characters experience is a result of personal decisions and of the actions of those around them. There are multiple points at which our main characters' lives would have been changed for the better had Seita sucked up his pride and made the more responsible decisions.Beyond this, Grave of the Fireflies is a heartbreaking look at children as the silent victims of tragedy, war or otherwise; this story could have taken place in the wake a natural disaster and had the same power.Through its story, music and animation, Grave of the Fireflies is one of the most hauntingly beautiful films ever made. This is an experience that you will never forget and is one of the best movies that you may never want to watch again.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
It just stays with you... and tears you up.,"I am a Japanese-Canadian and saw this movie in 1990 on a video cassette that was sent to my parents from some of their friends in Japan. I was 18 at the time and thought that I'd sit and enjoy another typical Anime film. Boy was I wrong. This movie tore me apart. So much so that I never wanted to watch another Anime feature again without reading a plot synopsis first.I purchased and viewed the DVD version again yesterday. Even with full knowledge of the outcome and story, it still tore me up. ""Princess Mononoke"" was good. So was ""Akira"" and ""Perfect Blue."" None of those  movies has stuck with me like ""Grave of the Fireflies"" has. It made me realize how lucky I am to have grown up in the place and era that I did. It reminded me of how spoiled we are. We don't need to feel guilty about how lucky we are, but a movie like this makes us appreciate it.There is no good and evil in war. In WWII both sides did their share of evil deeds. ""Grave of the Fireflies"" shows us a human element that extends beyond the soldiers.I will not re-hash the plot since many fellow IMDB members have done so. I will say that the scene that touched me the most was the scene in which Seita pours water into the empty fruit drop container for Setsuko to drink. For some reason that sequence wrentches my gut. At that point I realized that metal container symbolized Setsuko herself and how all that was left were traces of flavors. She is happy in the scene, but that is what makes the scene even more difficult to watch. At least you do have the knowledge that when her spirit is released at the beginning that she is not only reunited with her brother, but with her precious candy as well.It's funny that in the novel that this movie is based on, the metal tin is barely mentioned. Only as a container for Setsuko's cremated ashes. The director made it a point to make it a more important element of the movie.In closing I'd like to say that I highly recommend this movie. However, I'd be emotionally prepared before I do sit and watch this. As one other reviewer said, it is better to watch this with someone so you can discuss it during and afterwards. It does stay with you even if it doesn't tear you up as it did me.",,Anonymous,Animation

Stunning animated testimony to the human spirit and fight for survival,"Based on the novel by Akiyuki Nosaka , this is the disturbing and brooding story of two unfortunate brothers . It begins in post-war Japan , in the city of Kobe's train station , a boy lies dying . Subsequently , a long flashback taking place about two young Japanese siblings , Seito and Setsuko , living in the declining days of World War II . The story reflects back on two orphaned children living hand to mouth and still sometimes innocently , first with a resentful aunt and then alone in a sepulchral bomb shelter . When an American firebombing separates the two children from their parents and relatives , the two siblings must rely completely on one another while they struggle to fight for their survival .Takahata's rendition of Akiyuri Nosaka's semi-autobiographical wartime memorial novel is a heartrending and harrowing expression of the author's guilty death wish , having survived the starvation of his younger sister in the blighted wake of of the firebombing of Japan . Dealing with the unsettling and depressing tale of Seita and Setsuko (the latter acting in Heidi-style) , as the story flashes back to the orphaned , homeless children . A sensitive and thought-provoking film in which two youngsters struggle in the Japanese countryside but find they cannot escape the hardships of war and have not chance for survival . Director Takahata attempted to convey an image of the brother and sister living a failed life due to isolation from society by invoking love , sympathy and brotherhood , particularly in people in their teens , being accompanied by a rousing , stirring musical score by Michio Mamiya . Most of the illustration outlines in the film are in brown , instead of the customary black, whenever black was used , it was only used when it was absolutely fundamental , color coordinators explained this was done to give the movie a real and softer feel. Takahata animates this with remarkably evocative stillness and simplicity , finding ephemeral beauty in everything from nature's bequest as the brief-glowing fireflies of the title to the firebombs that seem to sigh in the sky before they torch thr ground .The motion picture was excellently directed by Isao Takahata . He was an important Japanese film & animated film director and the only living animator involved on the project who had survived bomb blasts . Isao was Studio Ghibli co-founder and directed notorious films , such as : ¨Only Yesterday¨ (1991) , ¨Pompoko¨ (1994) , ¨My Neighbors the Yamadas¨ (1999) , ¨The Tale of the Princess Kaguya¨ (2013) and of course , this ¨Grave of the fireflies¨(1988) .

A Beautiful movie I was not prepared for,"This is one of the most powerful war-time dramas I have ever experienced. I expected a certain amount of sentiment throughout the movie but I certainly did not think the realities of war from the point of view of two orphans would be this harshly portrayed. The film was quite hard to digest for the simple fact that the older brother, Seita, can be easily sympathized with but at the same time, we realize that the situation he is in is his own doing. His pride came in the way and watching him struggle with his sister is just too heart-breaking. I really didn't expect an anime to produce *the* most depressing ending ever and I was totally not prepared to witness it but i am still glad I saw the movie. It was simply terrific.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Somehow both relatable and unrelatable,"The animation is breathtaking. The detail in animating the most mundane of events is at a level expected from the greatest of animators. The story is heartbreaking, but it's also frustrating because all of the main character's issues could be solved if he would only take those solutions. You can't help but sympathize with minor characters that call him ""lazy"".Edit: Since originally writing this, I have learned more about the historical events that this movie was based on. I now realize why my ""lazy"" comment was technically wrong, but I still stand by it. If the movie is incapable of providing all the historical background necessary for the average viewer to understand the film, then the screenwriter is definitely at fault.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I've seen this film once before, so rocked by it that even as the memory of it faded from my mind, the emotional punch of it never left me.","I've been meaning to rewatch it with my partner who, being half Japanese, regards this idea as a form of unintended punishment or emotional torture. So with the death of its director and the fact that my partner is away, I chose to rewatch it for the first time, this time alone.American and British war movies generally concentrate on heroism, even if they regard war as evil in their message, they seemingly justify war as a necessary evil and the Allies as victims that choose to be begrudging saviours. Most movies, war or otherwise, don't start literally with the death of a child. Grave of the Fireflies does. In its scant running time it manages to show the camaraderie and community of a people suffering, it shows the unflinching boots on the ground of the affected and the afflicted, it is very possibly the greatest unglorifying anti-war film ever made.Being animated allows not just for more beauty; the stillness and movement drawing you in so much more delicately, but it allows for more of the hideousness, revealing the tacit horror and ugliness without grossing you out; the animation cutting to the bone of the realism in a transcendent way.There are moments of sheer brilliance; the fact that the kids reunite in the afterlife (portrayed in a plain and unsentimental way) makes their respective deaths tinged with relief rather than grief. Privately remembering the young child's frivolity after her death, ushering memories that couldn't concern the older child whilst in the midst of protecting her, but that he allows himself to remember when the responsibility has left him is superbly simple and common to anyone who has experienced looking after a loved one who has passed. A brief beat where she repairs the shirt and pricks her finger speaks volumes enough in one simple moment for an essays worth of complexity.I first watched this film a long time ago, upon only beginning to start to understand the potential depth and complexity of Japanese animation. As a young man, I watched it in the dark with a room full of Eastern European men that probably expected, as I did, that I might have brought something light for us to all watch, considering it was animated. By the end there wasn't a dry eye in the house as be lights came on and not one of us was ashamed because of it.Grave of the Fireflies is refreshingly and appropriately unsentimental. It's not political, it's human. It's deeply sad, very telling of a nation when they see war through these eyes, which makes it personal, raw and very, very important.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

War is Evil,"""Grave of the Fireflies"" is a powerful animated war
drama which highlights the destruction and
devastation caused on public property and the
economy by showing the lives of two siblings -
Seita and his younger sister Setsuko. Their tale of
survival is as heartbreaking as it is true to life. The
siblings rely completely on each other and struggle
against all odds to stay together and stay alive.I loved how the movie didn't focus on fighting and
violence at all but directly went into the impact
the war has on everyday life. Thus the politics of
war was avoided.The movie has a slow but steady pace throughout

The feeling this movie gives you is almost unbearable. A must watch.,"I'm still trying to pull myself together after finishing this movie 10 minutes ago.Wow, just wow. The feeling of despair I encountered watching this movie will certainly change the way I see things day to day. After the first 5 minutes I exited out of my browser and had to collect the courage to return to the movie after reading some comments. My outlook on war was negative to begin with, but this movie just made my stomach turn in ways that has never happened before.Seita could have been me. I have a 5 year old sister in the room next to me, and much to my tearful demise she acts just like setsuko. This review contains no spoilers, just an explanation from my soul. The anime turned me off at the beginning, but grew on me as the music and picture seemed to flow seamlessly. The aunt in my opinion was not a villain, she was desperate too as anyone would be in that war situation. Food was scarce, bodies lay in streets, raids were carried out daily, and death was becoming an everyday encounter.The only somewhat happy scenes in this anime were when the two were playing by the beach and by the shelter. The saddest part of the film, for me, was when setsuko reveals that she knew the truth about her mother to seita. Just something about a 4-5 year old girl who had already lost everything say so calm that her mother was dead in a grave makes it almost impossible to hold back tears. The ending of this movie was the only consolation for me. Knowing that she didn't have to suffer anymore and that she could be reunited with her family was one of the only moments of this movie that I could smile.This movie is a must watch. It may be the most depressing thing you do and you may cry and you may wish you could help but just sit and watch the movie. Do it alone because your emotion will pour out, its impossible not to cry and if you don't then you need help. Tonight I will pray for all war victims like these two. Their love towards each other is not a fictional plot in some regular anime. That sort of kindness and selflessness is felt in my heart and in the hearts of everyone watching and THAT is true art. Rest in peace to the helpless souls who's last days were in that hell. I hope the life that came after offers you the happiness and plentiful feasts that you deserve.",,Anonymous,Animation
They went too far.,"This has got to be the most depressing film I have EVER seen.Films about Japanese survival after WWII are usually hit or miss. This was both.The first half was spot on. Dealing with the bombers' aftermath and the death of friends and family can never be portrayed as good.

ONE & ONLY movie which made me CRY,"Hotaru no haka / Grave of the Fireflies is the only movie made me cry for more than 15 minutes.

"So sad, yet so visually stunning","Grave of the Fireflies came as a real shocker in the times, when Japanese animation studios produced tons of rather 'interesting' material, such as erotic and brutal anime, cartoons about robots and the supernatural, or simple heart-warming tales for children.Isao Takahata was able to create a truly tragic tale about how two young siblings struggle to survive during the War, but present it in such a way, that may be very easily called beautiful, in its own subtle sense. I mean, the visual side of this animated picture is so stunning that even time doesn't concern it. It looks as fresh in 2012 as it did when it first came out in 1988.Even though the depicted story happens on the eve of World War II, it doesn't actually present the disastrous effects that it had on the Japanese community as such. It's rather a tale of lost youth, and how the overwhelming cruelty and hatred can affect children and change their peaceful lives into a living hell. Those harmful and pure little creatures are afflicted by the selfish conflicts of grown-ups in the most striking way, and that shall be the power of the message that the movie provides.The film starts with a scene that actually indicates how this gruesomely sad story will end. Setsuko is dying on a railway station and nobody cares to help him. After a while he is reunited with his little sister as a ghost. He is now the narrator and we see the whole picture through the eyes of his vivid memories. From now on every sequence accompanied by a flaming red aura is the one, where out of this world experiences melt with reality.From the moment their mother died after an air raid, Setsuko and Seita are left totally alone in this vicious battle for survival. With nowhere else to go they decide to stay in their aunt's house. However, as we quickly find out, she isn't very happy about that and she does almost everything to discourage the kids and thus delicately persuade them to work and earn money for their own food, or simply leave her house.After discovering an abandoned shelter nearby they realize that the only wise choice is to move there and strive to endure on their own terms. Unfortunately, as they soon find out, it isn't easy in these hard war times. They can't work, their money supply is about to end, they don't have anything to exchange, and they're soon accused of stealing crops. What's more, Seita is getting weaker every day, because of malnutrition. The situation seems really terrible. How can two innocent kids be able to get along without any support?The sudden transition that Setsuko and Seita undergo is presented in a very realistic manner. It's very rare to see such a truthful representation of a child's suffering and agony in a movie, much less in an animated production. Their emotions are very real. The way they gradually learn to understand their situation is convincing, and most saddening.I previously mentioned that the movie could certainly be called a thing of beauty, due to its perfect visual presentation. Here's why: it's somehow idyllic, because even though there are signs of war everywhere around (the sirens, air raids, burnt houses and corpses), most of the time we see the two main characters staying in a dream-like hideout place, surrounded by untouched nature and jolly fireflies. In those (very brief) moments when they tend to forget about their problems, it is as if the viewer suddenly changed the movie for a more joyful one. But then the mood changes 180 degrees and we are back in the horrible times of war.Most people like to call the movie a tearjerker, and this statement can't be undermined. But there can also be a different approach to The Grave of the Fireflies. As much as heartbreaking and mournful it is, Isao Takahata shows that even an anime movie can be as graphic as a feature film. It's not easy to watch the story, but it's enormously pleasant to watch the movie. Those are two different things. And this achievement should put a smile on the face of any movie fanatic.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A film that shatters you emotionally,"Out of all of the Studio Ghibli films this World War II animation is my favourite. Set in Japan during the Second World War the story follows Seita and his little sister Setsuko as they survive in a harsh war torn nation in which food and luxuries are short due to wartime efforts.As the narrative progresses the emotional strain of the war is apparent in the way the plot flows. The emotional bond between the brother and sister and the sheer effort of survival.As the film reached it's climax I began to shed tears. Some films move you but Grave of the fireflies simply shatters your hope and well being. As you sympathise with the characters their deteriating condition simply tears away at you emotional strings.The animation is a gritty realism, rather different from the standard principles of animation in which exaggeration is almost necessary to translate emotion to the viewer. But Grave of the fireflies is done so well that even with realistic animation the emotion of the scene translates to the audience.For those of you who haven't seen this film I truly envy you. Because you get the opportunity to watch one of the greatest films of all time for the first time, an experience I wish I could relive.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best movie I ever watched,"I call it the best because this was a movie that took my emotions to next level. It starts abnormally with the lead telling about the day he died. But than the real tragedies starts to begin, the two lead characters Setsuko and Seita, elder brother and her younger sister, after losing there everything in War, starts to survive. Their survival does not give much of the hopes, as one can expect that results are not going to be good at the end. But still the way both characters live, I lived with them , there was a little hope for them surviving, reuniting with their father, that rose hopes in me. As the movies goes on, it took me into deep emotions where what happened to them was hardest thing to see. Thats what makes this movie great, the way it portrays hope and love.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An anime must see, but be warned it is a powerful, emotional film.","I knew Grave of the Fireflies was going to be hard viewing. But, that did not lessen the impact when I finally did decide to get the DVD and view it. Although the story takes place in World War II, showing the fire bombing of Japanese cities (mainly the city of Kobe) by American bombers, the film is not anti-American. If anything, the story makes a point of the apathy of the Japanese adults towards the children. It must be understood that Japanese culture requires the saving of face - like the British stiff upper lip - in adversity. This is one reason (among others) that the adults are depicted as being so cold towards the children. It must also be understood that the two main characters (Seita and Setsuko) come from a military family. That means a reserved, proud nature and unlikely to apologise to another - even when it could mean the difference between life and death. Bearing that in mind, you can better understand Seita's actions and those of the adults in the story.The production quality is first rate. I have seen Princess Mononoke in the theatre and Grave of the Fireflies has the same production style and quality. The background scenics are very moody and quite suitable to the environment that existed at that time. Definitely not your typical animation movie! Of course, the subject matter, too, is not your typical animation movie!The story is based on the real experiences of the Japanese author who wrote the original short story. You can tell this as you view the movie - this one is from the heart and from real life. That's why it is so powerful and so accurate in its depiction of events and life at that time. The base story line is derived from a traditional Japanese storytelling method, which is why the events are told in the manner that they are in the film. Even though you know what the outcome will be at the start, this does not lessen its impact once you get there at the end of the film. My greatest feelings came from little Setsuko. The scenes of her at the end hit home the hardest.You have not seen all of Japanese anime until you have seen Grave of the Fireflies (Hotaru no Haka). Keep in mind the social mores along with the circumstances that existed for those people at that time and then watch it. The emotions and powerful images will be a part of you for a long time.",,Anonymous,Animation
"State of Art,","I've come to watch this movie not on purpose. So I hadn't had any preconception or vague information at least. What I felt while I watch this movie was strong involvement itself. As many other Japanese movies, the pace of this one is seems to be controlled rather slow to make a kind of calm and meditating impression. That made me very relaxed, and I could sip the story scene by scene. The story ,supported by a classic plot of tragedy, was so touching I could see a male person keeping himself from weeping, and I was almost dropping tears. That sweet character Setsko ,who would remind anybody of their own little sister or daughter, was banging my heart to see a human being among all those -real- things in the war. And her guardian Seita would easily make an audience identify himself with him, I believe. That should be the cause of involvement and delivers the heart-breaking sorrow.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Beautiful and human,"I haven't seen a more beautiful animation than 'Grave of the Fireflies'. Not only is the imagery gorgeous, but the scenes are composed and arranged with the same care as seen in the best of art-house movies; and the horror of the fire-bombing of Japanese cities (seen by some as sufficiently terrible to make the nuclear option a morally superior alternative) is fully conveyed. In fact, this is such a serious movie (in all senses of that word) that it begs the question: why was it made as an animation at all, and not as a conventional film? Perhaps the answer is that in the flesh, it might have been so sad as to be unwatchable; at the end of the day, this is simply a story about two people who starve to death. Indeed, the film even begins with a (strictly unnecessary) flash-forward, as if the director did not want to betray any hopes we might otherwise have mustered of a happy ending. Raymond Briggs's 'When the Wind Blows' obviously comes to mind, but this film is broader in scope: it's as much about social breakdown as the war itself. The fireflies, a metaphor for lost souls, linger on in the mind.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Could be my favorite of all time,"It's been a while since I've seen this movie, but I just had to write this. I was just playing a little game by going through each genre on IMDb and picking my favorite movie from each genre. For animated movies there was no doubt for me: grave of the fireflies was number one. When I came to drama's I just thought about the movie that had touched me the most. Again I ended up picking GOTFF. Finally arriving at war movies, I also picked this movie.The greatness of this movie is all in making the spectator realise what war does to people and for a moment you don't think of war casualties as just casualties, but you start to imagine what people have gone through before dying and how the acquaintances have to deal with the loss of a loved one. Takahata creates this pity very well. He gradually makes you fall in love with the main characters (especially Setsuko). It also shows that a war affects both parties. Even though Japan was one of the 'bad guys' in WWII, this movie helps you emphasize also with the people living over there.To make a short story even shorter; this is definitely one of my personal all time favorites. It shows you (even though it's animated) more than any other movie does what the effect of war is on normal civilians like you and me. I know it might sound cruel but I'm a bit tired of all the soldier war movies. It even has gone to a point that I can't be bothered by war anymore if it's shown in the form of a military movie.

"""Elegaic and riveting"" -- NYTimes review","The plot is based on a popular Japanese semi-autobiographical novel of the same name which the author, Nosaka, wrote to atone for the death of his little sister in circumstances similar to that in the film.

"8.4/10 - Simple, Effective and Absolutely Devastating","""Why do fireflies have to die so soon?""Well, I'm having a hard time remembering the last time a film made me cry as much as this one. Absolutely heart-wrenching.Grave of the Fireflies is a Studio Ghibli film which depicts the struggles of 14-year-old Seita and his little sister, 4-year-old Setsuko, in WWII Japan. It deals with themes of being a bystander in the face of tragedy, loss of innocence and the cruel reality of war.What can I say about this one, really? It's one of these movies that are simple, yet so effective. With only 90 minutes of runtime we still get really invested in the beautiful relationship of Seita and Setsuko, and the tragedies they endure seem to hit us harder as the movie goes on. There are beautiful moments here (which are definitely elevated by the iconic score) but everything, just like life, has such a sense of fragility to it. Nothing good lasts forever. It really is one of the shortest reviews I've ever written, I think, but that's how it is with this kind of films.By showing us how the horrors of war affect two children, Grave of the Fireflies manages to communicate just how every tragedy war brings to the world is devastating to some, while others may never know the true pain behind it. It's beautiful, sad, tragic and totally heartbreaking. It does what it does perfectly without being overly complicated, but it still has so much truth to it that you can't help but let this wave of beautiful sadness engulf you.

"A powerful anti-war movie, the saddest movie you will ever see, and yet ... doesn't tell the WHOLE story","I have to say that when I first saw this movie in the 1990s as a VHS rental, I was moved to tears by this Japanese cartoon about a young boy and his even younger sister, a toddler, who become orphans even as they manage to survive the massive firebombings of their home during WWII, only to die of starvation shortly after Japan's unconditional surrender.The story behind this movie was based on the real life experience of screenwriter Akiyuki Nosaka towards the end of WWII, when he was only some 15 years old and saw his adoptive father die during the air attacks and two of his sisters die of malnutrition.We are 80 years removed now from that awful history. Nosaka passed away in 2015 at age 85. Many people watching this movie now perhaps won't notice or even know that those are American B-29s dropping the canisters of napalm onto Japanese civilians and their homes, or that those are American F6F Hellcats strafing the civilians. If you did know or recognized those details, you might think that, yeah, Americans are very much the Evil Bad Guys in this movie.And that's what makes this cartoon movie, as true and tragic the story behind it is, not even half of the REAL STORY of what happened.The FULL STORY would include the fact that shortly after American Occupation forces arrived in Japan after its unconditional surrender, General Douglas MacArthur recognized that a mass famine was underway in Japan, and urgently requested that large shipments of food aid be sent from the U. S. to Japan. This stopped the famine, obviously not soon enough to save Nosaka's sisters, but the Japanese military who had controlled the country had insisted on continuing the war well past the point where the country and its people were in desperate straits and needed to surrender (read - ""Embracing Defeat"" by John Dower)The FULL STORY would include the fact that on the night before Emperor Hirohito's surrender speech was to be broadcast to the nation (it had already been recorded, on a wax cylinder), junior officers of the Japanese Army attacked the Imperial Palace, trying to locate and destroy the recording of the surrender speech, in a final desperate effort to continue the war. The general in charge of the Palace guard was killed when he refused to help the coupe attempt and the coupe plotters were arrested. This fact is important to remember for those today who just have no clue how fanatical the Japanese military leaders were that controlled the country at the time, and thus question whether the ferocious devastation of Japan by the U. S. was necessary to force its surrender (read - ""Japan's Longest Day"" and ""The Day Man Lost Hiroshima"").The FULL STORY would include the fact that MacArthur and his aides would draw up a new constitution for the government of Japan, a constitution that gave Japanese women the right to vote, and limited its military to a Self Defense force only, to make sure that the military could never take control of the country again.The FULL STORY would include the fact that five years after its surrender, Japan quickly became a trusted ally of the U. S., rebuilding its economy as a base of operations and a key supplier for the US military during the Korean War. Try to think of another situation in human history where a victorious nation would so quickly forgive a former enemy, after such a bitter, ferocious war, and then rebuild it in its own image as a free and democratic society.Finally, the FULL STORY would include the fact that the horror of WWII had started over a decade before the U. S. was dragged into the war by Japan's sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, with Japan previously invading China, and then the rest of East and Southeast Asia, reaching even into India. An estimated 25 million people in these other countries died as a result of Japanese military attacks during this war, with widespread atrocities, and even more would have continued to die had the U. S. not utterly destroyed the Japanese ability to make war (read - ""Downfall: The End of the Imperial Japanese Empire"", and ""Tower of Skulls"", both by Richard B. Frank).The deaths of any children in war is tragic, but it's important to also know the full story and the aftermath of the story behind this otherwise very well made movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tears in my mind. One of the best movie ever.,"It's hard to explain my feelings by words.After 15 years since I watched this movie, my eyes are still crying if I only think about it.One day a friend of mine suggested me to see this film and gave me his DVD. At that time I didn't expect that a so sad and powerful story could be narrated through an animation. That vision stroke my mind and my heart, and after that I could never forget that kind of deep emotion.On September the 10th 2015, this film will be screen in Italian theaters for just few days and I cannot decide if I have the strength to watch it again.In my opinion, this is one of the best movie ever made, animated or live action. It's the perfect expression of the all sides of human nature, war, desperation, love.All people should watch a so refined and heartrending masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Masterpiece,This animated movie is realistic/historic. It is full of emotional moments. The portrayal of characters is cute and engaging. It shows the effect of war on citizens. I had never seen any animated movie like this before. It is so deep and emotional that it is hard to watch again.,9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Well done and very depressing,"I loved depressing movies when I was in college, but generally avoid them now; the heartbreak of a movie like La Strada just seems more than I can bear. I knew Grave of the Fireflies was pretty serious, but I did not realize how utterly grim it would be.Still, I'm glad I saw it. It's a very well-made movie. It's also an example of an animated movie that makes a case for animation in drama. I often feel that if there is nothing in a film that can't easily be shown with live action then it's a waste to use animation, which loses the nuances of human acting. But this film allows for scenes you wouldn't get in a live action movie; the use of fireflies would never be as lyrical and striking in a live drama.There are a few issues with the movie. One is those weird red, raggedy-anne circles on the little girl's cheeks, which I found endlessly distracting. More importantly, there are places where the boy's actions don't make sense. This is not to say that there weren't good reasons for what happened (the movie is based on an autobiographical book, so it may be true to life), just that the movie fails to make things clear.It was a good movie, but it has not convinced me to watch more depressing films.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Profound.,"I personally like this movie better than even Spirited Away. While it is sad and doesn't have a really happy ending, this animated production greatly demonstrated what it was like to live during that hard time in Japan. Both sides in WWII did horrible things, but as an American who is interested in both domestic and world history, I think this is an important film to watch to be educated on what our military did to the civilians of Japan and the collateral consequences of our country's actions militarily toward many innocent people. There was a lot of powerful symbolism in it too.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Step right up and join the ranks of the most depressing movies ever made!,"A friend of mine asked me what I wanted for my birthday recently and I asked for a DVD copy of this movie. I had heard a lot about it and was curious to see it. I got around to watching it last night and went to sleep feeling absolutely miserable. This one ranks right up there with those other cartoons that I consider to be sadistic, i.e Charlotte's Web, Watership Down, The Velveteen Rabbit, the one with that Tin Soldier and his girlfriend getting shot to pieces, etc.I'm glad that I saw this movie now at 29 than if I had years ago because it might have caused me emotional damage. To put it bluntly, I strongly recommend that you don't watch this movie if you are anywhere near a good mood because your good mood will be a thing of history after watching this.The story revolves around a young boy and his younger sister, struggling to survive during WWII. They face the threat of air raids constantly. Food is scarce due to strict rationing. The children are hardly given a second look by the other people, including other family members, trying to piece their lives back together. The two children are a joy to watch together. The relationship is sweet and loving, with hardly any bickering between the two. It is perhaps this aspect of the film that made me feel so terrible at the end of the movie. The little sister is so cute that you just can't help but smile when her face lights up with happiness. The older brother tries to carry on, with the weight of their survival on his shoulders and it's heartbreaking to think that any child should be burdened with such a responsibility.I want to cut my review short here, as I don't want to give away too much. I think this film should be watched by all but I warn those of you who haven't seen it to prepare accordingly. I was in tears at the end of the movie but ultimately, I was glad to have finally seen it.Rating: ****1/2 out of *****.",,Anonymous,Animation

"""Why must the fireflies die so soon?""","...a little girl asked.And I wish that I had an answer.The title (Grave of the Fireflies) probably sounds more fitted to a horror movie. Perhaps it is, but a different kind of horror- it depicts the horrors of World War II.It follows the story of Seta and Setsuko, two Japanese army children whose father is at war, and whose mother dies of burn injuries following an air raid on their city. They then go to live with their aunt on their father's side, who treats them as second-class members of her household because unlike her daughter and husband, they do not work.As a result of their aunt's demeaning attitude, a naive Seta decides to leave with his very young sister Setsuko and find some other place to live.The movie is unlike any movie of its type that I have ever seen- more or less because of the attitude of Seta. He always possessed a bright and happy disposition in the midst of hardship and tried to allow his sister to live as normal a childhood as possible. The movie focuses on the innocent, joyful moments that the two had together, including playing and bathing together and their oft hobby of going out to catch fireflies during the summer nights. We never feel unaware that a war is going on or the struggles the two are facing, but at the same time the special relationship between Seta and Setsuko is more highly emphasized than many of the tragedies going on around them.The animation of the movie is smooth and life-like. Of course, the coloring and shading of modern anime works exceeds that of this movie, but I can still watch this and be nearly as impressed with it as with either of those.The fact that it is animated detracts nothing from the feel and flow of the movie. In fact, in many ways it adds to it- at least for me. Those cute moments are made even cuter than they could've been without this; the flashbacks to memories are made even more hauntingly sad.Either way, this is a movie that cut me like few that I have ever seen in my life. Some movies have made me sad, but only three have brought me to tears. After the movie, I was eating a Popsicle- of all things- and suddenly everything hit me all at once and I bursts into tears.It was less of an emotional roller-coaster the second time around, but not less of a movie. It's definitely a must-see in both the tragedy and anime genres.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Probably the most beautiful movie I've ever seen,"'Grave of the Fireflies' is an absolutely wonderful animation that is a must to see. It leaves a tremendous emotional impact and a lot to think about.The war-ridden world is beautifully depicted through the eyes of children. Their innocence and naivety collides with the cruelty of reality showing how insignificant a human life is during war.It is true that this story is very upsetting and might bring you to tears many times but that shouldn't discourage you from watching it. In fact, that's why it's so good. I can't think of another movie that left such an impact on me.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Heart-Wrenching Masterpiece,"Grave of the Fireflies is a heartbreaking and poignant masterpiece of Japanese animation that tells the story of two siblings, Seita and Setsuko, struggling to survive in Japan during the final months of World War II. Directed by Isao Takahata and animated by Studio Ghibli, the film is a deeply moving portrayal of the devastating impact of war on innocent civilians and a powerful reminder of the human cost of conflict.At its core, Grave of the Fireflies is a story of family, love, and sacrifice. Seita and Setsuko are two young siblings who lose their mother in a firebombing raid and are forced to fend for themselves in the midst of the chaos and destruction of war. The film follows their struggles as they try to find food, shelter, and safety amidst the devastation around them. They eventually take refuge in a secluded cave in the woods, where they try to eke out a meager existence while the war rages on outside.What makes Grave of the Fireflies such a powerful and affecting film is the way it balances the intimate, personal story of Seita and Setsuko with the larger historical context of the war. Takahata masterfully weaves together the personal and the political, using the experiences of his two young protagonists to illustrate the larger themes of the film. The movie portrays the devastation of war in a way that is both specific to Japan and universal in its scope, making it a timeless and deeply resonant work of art.One of the most striking aspects of the film is its visual style. Takahata and the animators at Studio Ghibli create a hauntingly beautiful world that is both realistic and dreamlike. The film's depiction of war is brutal and unflinching, but it is also rendered with a painterly beauty that is breathtaking to behold. The attention to detail in the animation is stunning, from the way the light filters through the trees to the way the insects buzz around Seita and Setsuko's makeshift home. The result is a film that is both devastating and visually stunning.The film is also full of powerful motifs and symbols that deepen its impact. One of the most prominent is the recurring image of fireflies, which represents both the beauty and fragility of life. The film also makes powerful use of contrast, juxtaposing scenes of brutal violence and destruction with moments of tenderness and love. This contrast gives the film a profound emotional resonance that lingers long after the credits roll.In terms of performances, the voice actors in the Japanese-language version of the film deliver powerful and nuanced performances that bring the characters to life. Tsutomu Tatsumi is particularly noteworthy as Seita, bringing a sense of depth and complexity to the character that makes his struggles all the more poignant. Ayano Shiraishi is also excellent as Setsuko, capturing both the innocence and resilience of the young girl.Overall, Grave of the Fireflies is a masterpiece of animation that deserves its reputation as one of the greatest films ever made. It is a devastating portrait of war and its impact on innocent civilians, but it is also a beautiful and moving tribute to the power of family, love, and sacrifice. With its unforgettable imagery, powerful symbolism, and heartbreaking story, it is a film that will stay with you long after you've watched it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Simple and Moving,"Isao Takatha's Grave of the Fireflies details a brother and sister living through the fire bombings of Japan during World War II. The movie elegantly depicts the relationship between the two children, and uses the many tragedies they encounter to pace the film.Despite the weightiness of the topic, the brilliance of the film comes from the lightness of the interactions between Seita (the brother) and Setuko (the sister). The films dialogue convincingly mixes the inane quality of children's conversations, and the inability for these immature characters to process life or death situations; Setuko's hallucinations and the trip to the doctor both play between these divergences in dialogue. And the writing never strays from a simple plot, delivered beautifully.Animation in the movie varies in style; crude to wonderfully colourful. The richness of this style comes to the front in several scenes, particularly the opening and closing scenes. Nonetheless, the aesthetic strength of the film has more to do with the cuts and edits Takatha has implemented. Jarring cuts for visceral reactions, multiple angles within action scenes, and long shots for some of the bonding scenes.I watched the English version of this film and the only let down of this film was the voice acting. The actors delivered their scripts as if they were being spoonfed each line. Setuko's voice lacked any emotional resonance and Seita's voice never broke at any point in the film, despite having to deal with some extremely complex emotions.My verdict on the film, however, is that it touched me in similar manner to Kilmov's Come and See (1985) without being confined to a strictly definable piece of time. While Klimov's film deals almost entirely within the constraints of the horrors of WWII, Takatha merely uses the war as a backdrop to show how youth is loss to us in times of extreme horror. Also the symbolism, themes explored and the imagery used in every scene will definitely make me return to this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Much Different Aspect to the War Genre of Movies,"Very few films capture the aspect of war that doesn't deal heavily on combat. Grave of the Fireflies is one of those rare films. It is a powerful tale which will make you weep and fall into a reminiscing state, that it's unbelievable.Grave of the Fireflies tells the story of two young orphans, Seita and his little sister, Setseko. Two children living at the edge of the world, bounded together by the shivering effects brought by the war and the dreadful bombings. This movie does not tell the story of war, but how two children manage to cope with it. Viewers will find Grave of the Fireflies hard to swallow, because this is unlike any film they will feast their eyes on for years to come.Let us venture into these two kids. Seita is the older brother, no more than 14 years of age, who pretty much cares for his little sister, while trying to manage their current lifestyle. Setseku is a four-year old girl, who isn't dexterous enough to understand the war, and the death it has brought. Their relationship varies throughout the film, and this is what makes Grave of the Fireflies rewarding. This movie has the most realistic characters I've ever seen in a film. I've heard that a five year old Japanese girl was hired to take Setseku's role, and it shows significantly. I followed these characters throughout the film, falling in love with them, Setseku in particular. She laughs, cries and throws a furious tangent. On the other hand, Seita is a young mature man, who is somewhat ignorant and proud to an ugly extent. Their love is so significant, it almost makes me jealous of my relationship with my little sister. The movie sucks you into the characters, so they're embedded in your mind,which makes Graves one of the saddest films ever made.You'll find out later.Grave of the Fireflies is definitely labeled as a anti-war film. The movie portrays war as a very ugly event. People need to realize that soldiers are not the only ones stuck in a plight, people like us are affected deeply, especially when we have no involvement. These two children could never live an insouciant live, they are always under distress. The movie easily shows relevance to the novel, Farewell to Manzanar. What happens to people who don't fight in the war, but are stuck in between? Japanese citizens suffered greatly from our attacks. Innocient people. We have heroes in the U.S celebrating myriad times on their flag plantation on Iwa Jima(who actually turn out not to be the real heroes), we don't realize there is a back door to the situation.I don't need a spoiler to tell you people die. Grave of the Fireflies is clearly labeled as a tragic film. I learned in school that when tragedy comes, someone always dies. The question is who, and you'll find out when you watch the film. I will note future viewers to watch in Japanese. English dub is fairly poor, knowing Central Park Media is behind the dub. I highly recommend Japanese so the viewers can get a real taste of the characters and mood of the film. The actors are natural, and it's best to keep it that way. All in all, Grave of the Fireflies is one of the most powerful, if not most powerful war movie ever made. It's definitely worth a purchase, because if you are like me, you'll watch it for years on end.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
This film is beautiful in so many ways,"Grave of The Fireflies is a Japanese animated film release in 1988. The film is set in Japan during the second world war where japan was facing air raids from the American Bombers. In this dark time we follow the lives of the two main characters who was a teenage boy and his younger sister, Setsuko.At the beginning of this film, their home was destroyed by the American bombers which also results in their mother suffering horrific burns and later died in hospital. Their father is also out fighting the war in the Japanese Navy. And for the rest of the film, we're following their survival. Well there was no direct comedy, there is a lot of charm, watching the two kids interact, laugh and play in this dark world is surprisingly uplifting, but the film overall is trying to show the horrors of what war can do.Naturally, its overall tone is serious and there are some really hard-hitting scenes in this film. Animation is drawn very realistically, both in style and character movement, and it's detailed appearance can lead to some disturbing imagery at times. The music is subtle and uses chimes to help set the spiritual mood.In conclusion, I'd recommend giving grave of the fireflies a watch as it offers an interesting insight into what the horrors of world war two were like for the innocent people which is a perspective we don't get to see often in media. The art style is pleasing, the music is charming, and the story offers a lot of emotion, definetely leaving you with the bittersweet feeling.

Very Sad Movie...,"This is a very sad story. Two orphans, teenager Seita (J. Robert Spencer) and his toddler sister, Satsuke (Rhoda Chrosite) must survive on their own at the end of WWII. It doesn't get much sadder than this.Japan, 1945. The war is nearly over, and Japan is being pummeled by constant air raids by the Americans. After the death of their mother, Seita and Satsuke must find a way to survive (their father is away in the Navy).The film is strongly reminiscent of Cinderella and ""Life Is Beautiful."" The former because the two siblings go to live with a distant aunt at first, but leave because she is cruel. The latter is because of the relationship between Seita and Satsuke. Seita tries to keep his younger sister from experiencing the trauma of their situation. Therefore he tries to make everything fun and exciting for her.One of the notable qualities about the best anime is that the dubbed voices are always good. Miyazaki's films have it, but unfortunately, this one doesn't. The only voice that works is J. Robert Spencer. This is a guy we can all love; if everyone had an older brother like this, we'd all be very happy. He's very nice and pleasant towards Satsuke, to the point where it almost becomes unfair. Rhoda Chrosite is not successful though. It sounds as if a 30 had imitated a four year old, and instead of tearing at our heart, it becomes annoying. Amy Jones has stilted delivery as the aunt, but she's okay.Although this is a very sad movie, it lacks the real emotional punch that many of the best tragedies have. This is not a tearjerker, however, and calling it that would do the film a great disservice. It's a good film that should be seen, but it is not always easy going.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Must-Watch Viewing,"The story concerns a kid, not yet old enough to fight in the war, and his little sister. Their mother died in the firebombing that occurred close to the end of the war. As such, they are forced to move in with an aunt that does not really want them around. Eventually, they grow angry and leave. Takahata intended this to be viewed as a reasonable but poor decision, but the West, with all its independence, has a tendency to view his actions in more of a positive light, which I don't think is a bad thing; if anything, it adds to the film rather than detract from it.But cultural differences aside, the kids continue on their way and try to survive in the waning days of WWII. The brother does everything he can to take care of his sister and himself even as food becomes scarce. But eventually, they both die. That is not a spoiler. You the viewer are shown by the film in the opening sequence. Bro and Sis are spirits riding a train through Japan at its late-80's apex, looking out over the lights.This is not a normal war movie, as you probably have already gleaned. It is a movie about two kids forced to try to survive during war. This distinction shows in the score, which sounds reminds me of a child's music box playing with embers dancing around it. It's probably one of my favorite scores for any Ghibli movie, which is saying a lot.If I had to pick one movie to embody somberness, it would be this one. Most of it is not particularly depressing, at least not in the American sense of the word. There is no melodrama or a lot of moments specifically designed to pull at your heartstrings. The movie just lets its events play out and is better for it. Some of it has to do with smart writing; some of it is just the culture of Japan versus the culture of America. Note that I'm not saying I prefer Japanese culture and ideals; just that said culture and ideals work in the film's favor. This is a film that calls for subtle, something American films, for better or for worse, are not known for.As the film progresses, it becomes increasingly clear how and when the two kids are going to die. Now, if the film was trying to twist us around and surprise us with its every move, this would be a bad thing. But given the sort of film it is, this growing sense of clarity works. It's like putting together a puzzle. A very somber, disturbing puzzle. The characters feel this despair and so do you. It's a nice way of drawing the audience into the film.I have talked to many people who say this is one of the most soul-crushing films they have ever seen. Among people's lists of 'Films they loved but never want to see again', it is right alongside Schindler's List and Requiem for a Dream. And with good reason; there is something inherently hopeless about the situation these kids are in. You want someone to help these kids. You know that someone should help them. But you also know- right from the start of the film- that no one is going to help them.If you have a friend who doesn't think animation can be as good as live-action: first off, why are you friends with this person; second off, show them this film. It can be a bit of a wakeup call for anyone who has only seen animation used for kids movies.There are few films that can affect so many people in so many different ways. If you sit down and watch this with a friend, and they do not seem evoked by it: check their pulse, they must be dead. I could dissect how many levels this film works on, but that would take far, far too long.Something I should talk about, though, is a scene at the end of the film. Again, no real spoilers here. The ghosts of the brother and sister look out upon modern Japan once again. Take notice that the city lights are made to look like fireflies, which in this film are a symbol for the happiness and prosperity that cannot last. This has been said to be a subtle message about how the prosperity Japan was enjoying at the time was destined to fade, and that everyone should try not to be so rash and blinded by what should not last forever. Pretty cool, if you ask me.This is a film everyone should watch, at least once. There are a lot of war films out there, but there are very few like this, both in perspective, tone, and of course, quality.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"This isn't a story of heroism, meaning, or anything remotely related. Its about survival.","Few movies I've seen can bring me to the brink of tears, and only a handful of those can actually haunt me days after seeing them. Grave of the Fireflies is one of those rare movies I've seen that did this to me. Very few films have EVER made me feel as bad as this one did. Try to think of the saddest movie you've ever seen, Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition), Saving Private Ryan (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition), anything, and this movie blows it out of the water. This film has the power to devastate you, to move you, to bring you to the brink of tears and then push you over into a chaotic world. This is Grave of the Fireflies.Set during the last days of WWII, while the US Air Force was fire bombing Japanese cities, Grave of the Fireflies is a movie about a young boy named Sata and his little four year old sister Setsico. When their mother is killed in the firebombing of Tokyo Sata is forced to care for his little sister in a nation ripped apart by war and famine. With his father far away serving in the Japanese navy, Sata is the only one who can care for his sister. The love shared between these two siblings is something that will forever leave an impression on me. As an older brother myself I could very easily put myself into Sata's situation. His need to give his sister the very best he can while not being able to provide for her is a very real feeling.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The greatest film you wont want to watch twice!,"Grave of the Fireflies is a 1988 Japanese anime drama/war film directed by Isao Takahata and tells the story of Japan during WWII, focusing on the devastating effects that war leaves on the civilian populations. The story focuses on a brother and sister and the hardships they face throughout the war and their struggle to survive. Studio Ghibli is often known for there more mature and adult approach to animation movies-but nothing could prepare me for the heart-wrenching, emotional and truly tragic story of Seita and Setsuko. Grave of the Fireflies touched my heart in a way no other film has, with its gorgeous animation, astounding soundtrack and powerful narrative. Each scene is crafted to perfection and the characters (although many of them unlikable) really push the theme of tragedy, abandonment and ignorance towards the desperate and innocent people. We really feel and begin to connect with Seita and Setsuko right from the start and saddened for their state and the consequences war leaves on the innocents. The scenes featuring Seita and Setsuko are so beautiful, the moments they share together feel so real and loving, they almost feel like members of your own family. and while the film is extremely heart-breaking, the moments of joy feel so magic. Grave of the Fireflies is gripping, emotional, heart-breaking, tragic, beautiful,magical, astonishing and is the best anti-war film ever made. Grave of the Fireflies really is Ghibli's crowning gem and quite possibly the greatest film you wont want to watch twice. Never the less Grave of the Firelies absolutely deserves a 10/10- Quite possibly my favourite film of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Heartbreaking Masterpiece of Loss and Resilience,"Grave of the Fireflies is a heartbreaking and profoundly moving animated film that stands as one of the greatest achievements in cinema. Directed by Isao Takahata and produced by Studio Ghibli, this World War II-set drama tells the poignant story of two siblings, Seita and Setsuko, struggling to survive in the wake of Japan's wartime devastation. It's a film that doesn't shy away from the painful realities of war, and in doing so, it delivers an emotional experience that is both harrowing and beautiful.The beauty of Grave of the Fireflies lies in its ability to juxtapose the innocence of childhood with the brutality of conflict. The film's animation is stunning, with intricate detail given to the natural world around the children, contrasting with the bleakness of the war-torn landscape. The glowing fireflies that appear throughout the film serve as a powerful symbol of fleeting beauty and hope amidst the despair. The visuals are quietly poetic, and every frame feels deliberate and emotionally charged.The emotional core of the film rests with the central characters, particularly the bond between Seita and Setsuko. Their performances-voiced by child actors who perfectly capture the vulnerability and courage of their roles-are raw and deeply affecting. As Seita tries to protect and care for his younger sister, the audience is drawn into their world of love, loss, and survival. The film's ability to depict such a complex emotional journey through simple, yet powerful, character interactions is a testament to its masterful storytelling.Grave of the Fireflies doesn't rely on sentimentality to make its impact; instead, it allows the brutal realities of war and the human spirit's resilience to shine through. The film doesn't offer easy resolutions or sugarcoated outcomes; instead, it presents a stark, unflinching look at the consequences of war on innocent lives. It is a poignant reminder of the devastating effects of conflict and the fragility of life.Though Grave of the Fireflies is undoubtedly one of the most emotionally challenging films ever made, it's also a cinematic masterpiece that lingers long after the credits roll. Its raw depiction of loss, love, and survival, combined with its stunning animation and unforgettable score, make it a must-see for anyone who appreciates the power of storytelling. It is a film that transcends its medium, leaving a lasting impact on all who experience it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

One Viewing and You Will Know,"Let me just state before anything else: 10/10. And not just a begrudging, 'I can't find anything wrong with it soo...' kind of ten, but a very solid and well earned and freely given 10/10.OK, now that we've gotten that out of the way. Wow! This movie reminds me of the phenomenon James Joyce describes in Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as 'aesthetic arrest'. Basically, he divides all media into high art and pornography. He states that anything purporting itself as art that resorts to playing on the emotional responses of the consumer is actually just pornography. So if you find yourself overly moved on an emotional level, you have actually experienced low, pornographic art. If, however, the film (or other work) causes 'aesthetic arrest'; a feeling that transcends emotion and makes the consumer nail him or herself to the spot and experience the work over and over; makes one question his or her own responses and definitions of truth, beauty and the like; the consumer is in aesthetic arrest and the work represents high art. In short, low art affects the glands whilst high art affects the soul. 'Grave of the Fireflies' certainly seems to fit well in that latter category.I found this movie so amazing because it always had me on the verge of tears but never made cry. At 88 minutes, every image and every sound carries significance with nothing in just for the sake of bathos and sentimentality. Rarely does one find a cartoon where inanimate objects hold such deep symbolic meanings on their own, with no attempts made to underscore or personify them with wacky celebrity voices.Making this film as anime was the obvious way to go. If it had featured live-action, I think the sadness of the story would have overpowered the beauty of the message. I don't think I would have been able to watch real actors go through the events experienced by the animated characters. These animated performances somehow seem to transcend acting. They seem more indelible, more real to me. I am tempted to buy this movie, but then, I don't see why I should since one viewing seems to have grafted these images onto my very soul.Indescribably haunting, human and surreal. Best cartoon I've ever seen and up there with Citizen Kane, Naked and the other Great Ones",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I give it my utmost respect. although it didn't make me break down like the little girl that I am or move me to some deep contemplation, I have to say that it is a classic and must see. when I say classic I mean that the director knows his stuff.. the film is constructed well. it has a formal structure which is very fluid and easy to follow. not many anime movies do this (well not ones that I've seen) bottom line - watch this film - open your mind and see WWII from a new perspective. you'll appreciate the classic story telling and learn a thing or two about the far east.",,Anonymous,Animation
Sad and beautiful story,"This is the kind of story you wish they'd make more of.Yes, it's animated, but no, it's not like a Disney movie and no, it's not like the usual japanime people usually think of. This is way different.It's about a story of a boy (Seita) and girl (Setsuko) living in Japan during the near end of the Japan vs. US part of World War II. Their father is out fighting the war, their mother is seriously hurt in a bombing, and the two kids fend for themselves. It's told in a way that doesn't beg for tears, but sure as hell gets them. I don't want to give too much away, but there are times when you just have a gut reaction to what's happening to the kids. It's sad and haunting, and is a movie I highly recommend.Look at it this way, it's under 90 minutes, it isn't that long. And, having seen the quintessential anime movies (Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Princess Mononoke), Grave of the Fireflies is a level above them, and above most other movies, animated or otherwise. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"I can't stand it, and that's what makes it an amazing piece.","Set in WWII in Japan, this tale tells of the realities of war not on the soldiers' end, but instead, in the eyes of two innocent children.The film is told in a nonlinear manner, leaving the viewer to properly put together the pieces to the plot to form a sad tale of two siblings lost at war.Halfway through the film, I already feel quite uncomfortable with what I've seen so far. It isn't in a way that grosses you out due to a film's excessive use of violence, which wouldn't be surprising on a film where a war is underway. The focus of the film was to show how the casualties of war are as badly affected as soldiers are when bloodshed is involved, leaving people who are unable to defend themselves exposed to vulnerable and harmful conditions. The portrayal of the circumstances in which the siblings were victims of was what made it hard for me to watch. How vulnerable and incapable they were to their circumstances was just heartbreaking.I highly recommend others who haven't seen it to go and do so. Though the animation may not be up to everyone's taste, it makes up for its story and message. It is an eye opener to the hardships people who are left to fend for themselves deal with as soldiers fight for their people, country, and nation, on another front.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Emotionally challenging.,"As with most Ghibli offerings, Grave transports the viewer entirely into it's richly drawn world. The storyline of WW2 Japan might be considered undeserving of sympathy by some in the west, but this is by no means a war movie. The trials of the children are terrible and unimaginable, thankfully, for most of us. The relationship between the siblings is wonderfully written and immensely touching in its innocence and hope. The protective brother extracts pride and sorrow from the viewer in equal measure.

One of Studio Ghibli's best achievements!,"As an animation fan, I love all of Studio Ghibli's works (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, etc). Today, I watched another movie that Studio Ghibli also made and this is the film. I was with my brother the same age as me and after we watched it, we were crying our tears out. It's a depressing film at first, but it's so moving and beautiful that I personally agree to those who love it that this is indeed one of the greatest Japanese anime films ever made, if not the greatest.The story is awe-striking because of how the ""World War II"" setting was presented. It also has some sad moments (especially it's slow moments that gives the characters a lot of depth) that would make you shed a few years and such. The characters on the whole are very interesting and we got to know them better throughout the film. The music is great too as is the voice work, but the best part would have to go to the animation. It's breathtakingly lovely with beautiful backgrounds and solid character animation.Overall, Grave of the Fireflies ranks with some of Studio Ghibli's other films and this would be recommended to those who haven't seen it yet!

It's a touching story, showing the reality of life in a war torn country. People are essentially kind, but when they must struggle just to find food to put on the table, it is difficult to think about the needs of others. Cracks in the system appear and some fall through. Like the fireflies of the title, a human life may shine brightly but all too briefly. It is a testament to the people of Japan that although they suffered much from the American bombing raids that took place regularly during the last days of the war, little resentment or bitterness lingers.

But there are some great moments when the children catch fireflies and use them to illuminate their cave. the next day Seita finds his little sister carefully burying the dead insects as she imagines her mother was buried and that was when I knew I was watching something special.The undeniable death of Setsuko would be enough to make anyone cry. At the end of the film the spirits of Seita and Setsuko are seen no longer raggedy and etiolated but healthy and well dressed happy as they sit together surrounding by fireflies together they look down on the modern day city of Kobe . Because it is animated and from Japan Grave of Fireflies ha been little seen. When anime fans say how good the film is, nobody takes them seriously . Though it is a cartoon and the kids have eyes saucers but it belongs on any list of The Greatest War Films ever made. Some movies are such singular achievements that they deserve to be seen at least once by everyone who consider himself or herself to be a lover of film. Grave of The Fireflies falls into the exclusive category. The production is so emotionally challenging that one time may be all that can be endured. Despite the artistry and care invested in the film's crafting. The result is as close to traumatic as a movie can claim to be watching it a second time is in some ways more difficult than the first.The power of Takahata's vision is such that the initial reaction never fades. Graves of The Fireflies does not need to be revisited to leave an indelible mark of memory. Actually this movie can not be described in 500 words . Seriously I have no words for this kind of things i saw last month. It is an another level of emotion that can not be described by any word or emoji .",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Heartwarming,"Grave of the Fireflies is the third studio Ghibli film The first one was directed by Isao Takahata. When people think of anime they usually think of over-the-top light-hearted family pictures. Grave of the fireflies is hands-down one of the most serious and realistic anime films out there. Almost all anime films have some sort of lighthearted fun and comedic charm to them this is a film that takes it so seriously as if you were watching a war film. It's grounded in reality set in the events of real-life firebombing events of Kobe of ww2. You see through the eyes of siblings a teenager named Seita and his little sister Setsuko seeing their final days of the war and all the struggles that they face. You also see the impact of the people of Kobe and the Horrid impact others suffer. You got people running to bomb shelters, there are people burnt by explosions, mass graveyards. People starving can't find resources like food and water. In the long run, you want to see these two be all right you want to see them survive you want them to be happy together. Grave of the fireflies is a classic and a must-see for anyone who not only loves anime but as well as war films. When people think of Studio Ghibli they usually always reference Hayao Miyazaki However this is one occasion where Isao Takahata made a more impactful film than Miyazaki.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Masterpiece,"This movie has the power to change you as a person.This film has the power to melt even the hardest of hearts. You will never, ever hear the word 'war' again without instantly thinking of this film - and it's not even an anti war film. Just a tale of the consequences, consequences real people paid and that there's nothing more heartbreaking than failing someone who looks up to you and loves you unconditionally.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Oh My poor eyes,"My God! I am a very emotional person and this film just turned on the water works and made them over flow! From the moment the film started i was crying all the way through basically. I was hoping against hope it would have been different but i knew that what was going to happen was inevitable, heartbreaking, amazing and makes you appreciate your life a lot more and it also makes me sympathise with anyone who has been caught up in a war in the past or in the present, although it may not be a true story it is entirely possible that a situation like this very one did arouse.It makes you think about war and the effects, well it makes me think, and i imagine that was sort of one of the points. In any case if you haven't seen it then you are missing out. Go. Buy it. Vote here. Be proud.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Was looking for a tragedy,"Was not disappointing. One of those movies that shows life that isn't always a happy ending.Takes place during WW2, I highly recommend reading up on the history of the Pacific theater of war during that time. You should know a bit about the fire bombings that took place and the condition that Japan was before and after the war.This film is based on a true story, and it pulls all the right cords. If you don't like Anime because they ""sexualize all the characters"" then this might change your mind, and I'd highly recommend watching any of the films by Studio Ghibli which I would consider the on par with the likes of Disney and Pixar for storytelling.It's not Schindler's List, but it shows the dark side of war that most films don't cover.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mesmerising,"I often not review titles but this one was different like gran torino
Absolutely heart touching, it gives you the horrors and chills of war
Told by a child's prospective it seizes you to feel their pain.
A must watch truly speaking.
The soundtrack was like Ennio Morricone 's once upon a time in america and totally apt for this great piece of cinematography.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
