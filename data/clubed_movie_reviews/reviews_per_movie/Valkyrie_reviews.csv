The Critics Were Wrong...,"""Not only is Singer's film-making aesthetically frustrating (lacking coherent visual rhythm) but his juvenile regard of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler -- one of 15 documented attempts -- is intellectually insulting..."" New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film. Critics bashed it for being insulting, unoriginal, and unmoving. Let me make some corrections for them so that they can save a little face.I'm no Tom Cruise fan. A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in. Mostly this has to do with Cruise's personal life and beliefs (just watch an episode of South Park to see how some people view him and you'll see what I mean). People have similar feelings toward Mel Gibson ...but I digress.VALKYRIE, as most of you probably now know, is the final of 15 attempts on Hitler's life. Shortly after this (about nine months) he committed suicide in his bunker. But this is about the one time where it almost succeeded. I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that ""I was on the edge of my seat"" throughout the second half of the film.So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Failed  Plot Against Tom Cruise,"I'm appalled at the way the specialized and not so specialized media attacked Tom Cruise for this movie. Why? He's not just good but very good in his against type performance. I've heard critics calling him ""distractingly bad"", how ridiculous and nasty. The film by the great craftsman Bryan Singer is a suspenseful, beautifully made historical thriller with a remarkable attention to detail. In an effort to be accurate the Jews are never mention because in fact the attempt to assassinate Hitler had nothing to do with that. The real reason? The war had turned against the Germans, it was clear that they were entering a down spiral and Hitler's madness was at the center of that. Regardless of the fact we know how the story ends, the movie manages to be a gripping tale based on real events. Well done Mr.Cruise, you won! Your Valkyrie is performing stupendously at the almighty box office.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great movie and thank god for IMDb!,"First, I want to say that some time ago I learned to distrust critics and instead read the reviews here on IMDb. I've never been misled, even when an equal number of viewers liked and disliked the same movie because that let me know there was a matter of taste in play, and that's fine. Sometimes a movie pleases everyone, but that's so rare I cant really think of one. People have different tastes and that's good. But the value of IMDb reviews is that they are based on a genuine response to the movie - not a bias, or some other agenda.For example, the Fox critic Roger Friedman listed this movie as one of the worst of 2008 - without having seen the movie. That's right. He rated it without seeing it. It was a classic and reprehensible case of bias and perhaps even bigotry since he was engaging in Tom Cruise bashing which is usually practiced in conjunction with dissing Tom's religion.So I don't trust critics to tell the truth or give an unbiased review.I saw Valkyrie and enjoyed it immensely. I've studied the Hitler period and was familiar with most of the events but the movie educated me while it thrilled and entertained me. It is a movie I was happy to take my teen-aged children to see because it also educated and entertained them. I thought the cast did a great job. The script was outstanding and the direction excellent. Tom Cruise gave a dimension to Von Stauffenberg that deepened my understanding of the events. The supporting cast were brilliant.I highly recommend it.PS. It's some time since I wrote this review and I took thirty minutes tonight to read the other reviews on this movie, not surprisingly they are mostly very positive and unanimous in praising it. Interestingly, the critics, including the one named above, who trashed the movie without even seeing it, obviously did so in an effort to kill it at the box office. While many other reviewers noted this too, I'd like to point out that those critics and possibly some of the people who 'dont like Tom Cruise because of his weird religion' are actually following the same path that made it possible for Hitler to kill off millions of Jews who also had a 'weird religion'. Considering the historical background of Valkyrie I find that quite ironical.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Great movie, doesn't do history justice","I was curious about this movie since it had caused so much controversy with Tom Cruise in the main role. Personally I think he was after all not a bad choice for this part and all in all I am very happy that there is an American movie that shows the different side of Germany and Germans in the Third Reich (there was a time when in every Hollywood Movie the villain were always Germans). But Americans, who in general don't really have much understanding of history, fail to realize that Hitler wasn't voted into power by the people. As a matter of fact, he only received 36,8 % of the votes in the election. Though this made his party the leading one, he could only gain power because the politicians of the other parties thought they could control him. Once Hitler was able to turn Germany into a dictatorship, it was extremely difficult to form any resistance. So much as cracking a joke about the Fuehrer was reason enough to be imprisoned, investigated and executed. Organizing a conspiracy meant risking not only your life, but the life of everyone even remotely associated with you. And you could never be sure who you could trust or who might be a spy or simply rat you out for personal gain. This is where this movie falls a little short, because it shows Stauffenberg and others simply talking freely about their plans and their convictions. Yes, I get that it is very difficult to portrait this conflict and the tremendous danger in a two hour movie, but I can't help it, I just feel that it doesn't give the audience a real picture of how daring this operation was and how nerve wracking this must have been (remember, this was the third attempt of Stauffenberg. He had the explosives with him two times before and had to abort ... each time risking detection). If you really think this through, you can not have enough respect for their courage. And I can't help but to point out, that most people don't even have the civil courage to demonstrate and protest in a free country with a democratic government.Bottom line: great movie and you should watch it. Just be reminded, that this is a very watered down version of history.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Excellent, historic thriller","""Valkyrie"" takes on an important event in the history of Nazi Germany: the failed assassination attempt of German officers of the Wehrmacht against Hitler in 1944. Most Germans like myself are quite familiar with the story of the ""Stauffenberg-Attentat"" since it was not only the topic of many German docudramas (e.g. one made by well-known director Pabst in 1955) but is also widely discussed in history class in school.I was pleasantly surprised about the ""American"" interpretation in Valkyrie and think that Singer and Cruise came up with an excellent film. Although the outcome is known and the movie develops rather slowly in the beginning, it manages to create a highly suspenseful and darkish-intense atmosphere that keeps you captivated until the end. Complains regarding the American/English accents and the German actors not speaking with German accents, or criticizing that Stauffenberg was ""in reality"" more charming and not as stiff as Cruise' interpretation, are niggling and banal at best. The movie does not focus on the private, psychological side of Stauffenberg but on his leading role in the assassination plot planned and executed amidst the ""heart of darkness"", which -we can be sure- was more than nerve-wracking and left certainly little space for charm and jokes. BTW: I was glad to see Nina von Stauffenberg portrayed as the knowing and smart wife that she actually was. The performance of all actors is superb, and Cruise certainly deserves special praise since his commitment to the role is tangible and remarkably intense.Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Historical Drama,"It was curious timing to release this film on Christmas Day. As David Letterman quipped on last night's monologue: ""Nothing says Holidays like a good Nazi death plot"".Release timing not withstanding, this is a very powerful movie and by all accounts comports with the historical record. There was little embellishment for dramatic effect here. Hitler murder conspiracy dramas are abundant in Hollywood, but this one actually happened and was nearly successful. The story is riveting, and even though the outcome was already known (at least to anyone who had a rudimentary knowledge of WWII), the excitement level was sustained by not really knowing the precise timing of events or, more importantly, who would be spared in the end.Tom Cruise was very good in the lead role as the chief conspirator (Col. von Stauffenberg). The rest of the cast was first rate, including Tom Wilkinson as Gen'l Fromm, a Nazi head honcho who was playing both sides of the fence, and many other notable actors, such as Kenneth Branagh and Terence Stamp, all excellent.For fans of ""Downfall"", the German film documenting Hitler's final week in the bunker (one of the all time great WWII films and #75 on the IMDb top 250), there were two actors from that movie playing in this one. Thomas Kretschmann and Christian Berkel both were key figures in ""Downfall"" had supporting roles in this film.For people with an interest in WWII or history in general, this is one film worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,History
informative if superficial true life story,"If the plot to assassinate Hitler in the summer of 1944 had gone off as planned, you can be sure some enterprising studio mogul at the time would have made a film about the incident even before the ink on the ensuing peace treaty had had a chance to dry. But as the effort did, in fact, fail, we've had to wait more than sixty years for this particular piece of World War II history to find its way onto the silver screen. Well, better late than never, I always say.In ""Valkyrie,"" Tom Cruise plays Claus von Stauffenberg, a battle-scarred corporal in the German army, who helps to spearhead the conspiracy to bring Hitler's worldwide reign of terror to an abortive end. Writers Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander had really two basic options to choose from in approaching this material: either treat it as a thoughtful character study, probing deep into the psyches of the men involved, or handle it as a straight-ahead action picture, emphasizing the minutiae and the step-by-step process of the plan itself. In choosing the latter, the filmmakers have made a movie that is interesting on a superficial level (and certainly informative as a re-enactment of a fascinating event in history), but not nearly as memorable or compelling as it might have been had they chosen the former.As director, Bryan Singer keeps things moving along at a fairly fast clip, even though the profusion of characters all dressed in similar uniforms sometimes makes it hard to tell who exactly everyone is and which side of the Fuhrer dividing-line each happens to fall out on. In fact, at times, the people who are involved in the conspiracy actually seem to outnumber those who know nothing about it. Moreover, Cruise's generally wooden performance prevents us from delving very deeply into the inner workings of the man he is portraying. In addition, Kenneth Branagh and Terrance Stamp are given too little screen time to register much of an impact in their roles as fellow conspirators.Still, it's impossible not to be moved and inspired by the tremendous bravery and heroism demonstrated by these men or by the incredible personal sacrifices they were willing to make to do what they knew was right. Of course, ""Valkyrie"" comes with the same built-in limitation as ""Titanic"" - which is that we know even before we enter the theater how the story itself will turn out. It's a tribute, therefore, to Singer's skill as a director that he still manages to generate as much genuine suspense as he does with the material.""Valkyrie"" succeeds more, perhaps, as a history lesson than as a stark human drama, but what an eye-opening lesson it turns out to be.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The Plot to Kill Hitler,"Claus von Stauffenberg, a man famous for being a German Army Officer who came closest to a assassinating Adolf Hitler. Von Stauffenberg is the closest figure Germany has to a national hero during World War 2. It's surprising that it took so long for a film to be made, nor to be a German film.Valkyrie is a test project for the newly reformed United Artists under Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner. It was also a smaller project for Bryan Singer after doing 3 superhero films and reunite Singer and Christoper McQuarrie for the first time after the Usual Suspects.Valkyrie starts with a prelogue sequence in North Africa. Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is a disaffected officer who is questioning Hitler's regime and that he was leading Germany to the path of destruction. During a British air raid he is injured badly, loosing an eye, his right hand and two fingers on his left hand. He can no longer serve on the front line. In 1943 General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) fails in his attempt to assassin Hitler and the German Resistance loss an army officer to help with operations. Von Stauffenberg is recruited in the resistance and the General Staff. He comes up with the Valkyrie plan which was to make the assassination of Hitler look like an SS plot, and get the army to launch a coup to 'protect' the Nazi regime. Von Stauffenberg is the only man who could get close to Hitler because he was the Chief-of-Staff for the Reserve Army General. The film is split into three major parts, the planning, the assassination attempt and the attempted coup.Singer was able to bring in a very stylist approach of direction. I enjoy Singer's films and he was able to show his skills again. He is able to get an excellent cast, including Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh, Terrence Stamp and Tom Wilkingson to name a few. However, he shot the film in the style of a thriller, which was interesting, but being a historical film with most people knowing the outcome already takes away the suspense. But Singer did make an enjoyable film. The film has a strong scriptValkyrie is a strong, enjoyable film. It is not Singer's best but he can still pull it of.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Most entertaining.,"Ignore the silly comments of some critics who want this movie to fail.  Schickel, Ebert and the L.A. Times got it right. If you're a World War  II history buff like me, you'll appreciate the fine effort that is  Valkyrie. It shows that American filmmakers as unlikely as Tom Cruise  and Bryan Singer can compete with the likes of the Downfall creators in  handling such subject matter. Like World War II itself, the full story  of the July 20 plot is long and intricate and cannot be fully told in  the confines of a two hour feature film. There are certainly many  peripherals to the story - its tentacles ran deep into the Nazi  diaspora; thousands were executed or ""disappeared"" (including Irwin  Rommel who was not portrayed in the film) - to say nothing of the mixed  motives in those Germans wishing to see Hitler dead. These are all  subjects that have already been explored and no doubt will be again in  the future. Suffice to say, Singer and editor/composer John Ottman  focused on the heart of this story: Hitler was destroying  Germany/Europe and the July 20 plotters bucked the odds to stop him.  The performances from this exceptional cast are first rate. Think what  you want about Tom Cruise and Scientology - I'm no big fan of either -  but judge the work on its merits. Cruise may not win an Oscar for his  portrayal of von Stauffenberg, but he more than gets the job done. In  terms of scope, the locations, battle scenes, costumes/uniforms,  staging/settings, you can't ask for more in a WWII movie. There's  nothing fake, nothing phony to spoil the period experience and vfx are  seamless as they should be. If you're expecting a formula Hollywood  thriller a la Bourne or M.I., you may be disappointed, but as a serious  adult drama Valkyrie delivers the goods. It took some balls to make  this movie and UA has earned its kudos.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Solidly engaging thriller that works despite knowing the outcome before you start,"I'm not really a fan of Tom Cruise so I let this film go past me until it came to TV because I just thought it screamed ""star vehicle"" too loudly. In reality I was probably a bit too hasty with that call because Valkyrie is a solid little film that delivers an interesting story with the predictable Hollywood liberty but does so in a rather satisfying manner. Having decided to put my personal feelings on Cruise to one side, I did still think that the film would struggle because ultimately I already knew the ending (spoiler: the plot to assassinate Hitler isn't successful) and it would therefore not be able to hook me in. I think in a way this was correct but not really in the way that I thought.In terms of just straight up narrative flow the film does engage; OK it maybe takes a while to establish the main players and get things moving forward but ultimately, while I knew they would fail, I was interested to see what happens, how it happens and what they did. On this level I enjoyed the film and although it was a full two hours long I wasn't bored by it and it felt like it was as long as it should have been. Where I thought it didn't quite pull it off is in the portrayal of why the conspirators felt they had to act. In this regard I didn't feel their desperation and I didn't get a tangible sense of how bad things were at this point in the war for Germany; I know from other films etc how bad things were but this film didn't really do that so much as simply say that things were bad. Likewise I didn't get a feel for the emotions behind the plot and instead I got the impression that the film was taking it as read that everyone dislikes Hitler and therefore that would be all the understanding we would need – this is perhaps partly true but the film needed this as part of it, not an external thing brought by modern audiences.Singer does a really good job in terms of direction. There isn't a huge amount of action here but the tension is good and it is very well delivered to be a lot more effective than I thought it would be (again, the issue over knowing the ending). The cast is deep in quality but, like me, many will get stuck at Cruise. He does an OK job by which I mean he doesn't overplay or make it all about him the personality. The downside of this is that he doesn't bring much character out either and I didn't see much of a person in his character – he does have presence though, which helps a lot. The supporting cast is rich and their presence also helps the film since you cannot turn left or right without bumping into a quality British actor. Branagh, Nighy, Wilkinson, Stamp, Izzard, Hollander and so on – they all do solid work and are a boon to the film.Valkyrie isn't a classic by any means but nor is it the ego-driven Cruise film I expected. Instead it is a solidly entertaining thriller based on fact that manages to engage even though you know the outcome. Cruise doesn't get in the way and the support cast make it stronger by their quality and their number.",,Anonymous,History
Worth a watch.,"I saw Valkyrie in it's second week of release. The delay was primarily based on the mixed reviews it had generated and my own doubt about how a historically known fact could be presented as a thriller. I was in for a pleasant surprise as the movie was able to hold my attention from start till the end.The supporting cast has put up a wonderful performance with Tom Cruise never hogging the limelight.Bill Nighy is really good as General Olbricht and Tom Wilkinson is equally good as the fickle minded General Fromm. Though it is not path breaking stuff, it is one of the good films to have come out at the end of the year. But, I have to say it might get lost into all the other movies vying for Oscar attention in this award season.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Ignore the Nagative Hype,"Forget all the negative hype surrounding Valkyrie, because I assure you it is false. Bryan Singer has made a well-crafted thriller that kept me and my family on the edge of our seats until the end  even though we all know what the story's unfortunate outcome. Also, many tabloids were making this out to be the movie that would permanently cripple the career of Tom Cruise. This is entirely false. Cruise delivers a fine performance, and this hatred I can only assume is related to his rather odd personal life. Tom Cruise is as strong of an actor as he ever was, and I won't let something like turning Oprah's couch into a playground deny the fact that the man has talent, and is a truly passionate actor (and seriously, he does have a slight resemblance to Stauffenberg).The movie is based on the last of fifteen known attempts on the life of German dictator Adolf Hitler (I'm sure everyone will have him in a nice ""Five Most Evil People"" list), and has Tom Cruise playing Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, who of course was the key player in the assassination attempt. Ultimately this attempt failed (as we all know Hitler would die by suicide nine months later), but that doesn't keep Valkyrie from being an addictively engaging film.Every member of the cast does their part well, not jockeying for superiority in any way. More importantly Cruise does not grandstand in this movie, fading in with the rest of the cast, rather than trying to stand above them like you'd expect, given his past films. Cruise gives a performance similar to 2005's War of the Worlds, where he does a good performance, but he never tries to overpower the other members of the cast. In Valkyrie Tom Cruise is a being a good team player, not trying to steal any glory, and never once does he overact the part.Using very little CGI Valkyrie is also a wonderful film to look at. The vintage automobiles and aircrafts make this film have a distinct authentic flair that few other war films have (CGI looks like it was only used for the climatic assassination attempt). You can look at this and tell that this is the real deal, with the production team putting careful care into how they want this film to look, unlike most Blockbuster films that try and inflate every aspect of the film rather than aim for reality. Like the performance by Tom Cruise they don't try and overpower the audience with special effects, they simply let the characters slip into the realistic settings.Also, the complaints about the accents I truly feel are desperate attempts to bash Cruise's performance. It was director Bryan Singer's concept to not use false German accents, and not that of Cruise, or the primarily British cast. I agree with Singer's concept that if feels false, and inaccurate to have people speak in English, but with foreign accents. I know several Germans in real life, and they do not sound very ""German"" when they speak in English, because the accent is not intended for the English language. I personally feel the desire for English being spoken in German accents comes from decades of WWII films where we've categorized every-single member of the German army, and by them speaking in that accent only is to cliché them and separate them from American audiences. They can speak in German accents, but only if they're speaking in German, because if they aren't it seems to be a tool to keep your common American moviegoer from relating to the characters.Don't go into Valkyrie expecting to be greeted with a horrifically bad film that you will be able to poke fun at with friends. The movie has been released, and I feel the rumors, and negative hype of been proved decisively false. This isn't a movie to kill Cruise's career, but it won't help him regain love in the American community either (as previously mentioned he doesn't shine so much as mix in with the rest of the cast). It is a very enjoyable dramatization of a true event, and I don't think the material could have been handled much better, even with a full German cast, because Singer's style and method of conveying this story are all very well-done.Go out and enjoy this dramatization of one of the darkest periods of human history. It is worth every second of your time, and all though it isn't Oscar-worthy it is certainly worth two-hours of your time.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Must See Movie,"One of the best movies I've seen in years. In the world where special effects and cheesy plots make 99% of all films, ""Valkyrie"" delivers psychological thriller with a lesson in history. I saw this movie with my 9 year old son who is a big Military Fan. In the eyes of a 9 year old boy - the World consists of ""Good Guys"" and ""Bad Guys"". I hope that this movie will allow him to recognize that the World is little more complex than ""Black & White"" or ""Good & Bad"". This movie is the first film I have ever seen that presents German People as human beings trapped in the wheels of a spinning war machine, and not merely monsters responsible for all WWII atrocities.

"solid storytelling, almost like a heist movie, minus emotional attachment","Bryan Singer's latest film, Valkyrie, is a step-up from what was a long 'slog' of a movie-going experience like Superman Returns. His direction here is more in line with the X-Men franchise, oddly enough for a movie about Nazi's scheming to kill Hitler. He has what amounts to a well-oiled machine via Christopher MacQuarrie's script, and his cast assembled is a gallery of who's who in British film (yes, British people playing Nazis, without German accents, as well as Tom Cruise with his Tom Cruise accent). If only one felt a stronger bond with some of these characters like Cruise and Bill Nighy and Kenneth Branaugh play, there might really be something special about what amounts to a great idea carried out to the extent of great failure.If you haven't seen Tom Cruise's character, Col. Stauffenberg, explain it in one sentence in countless commercials and trailers, here's what the plot amounts to: a small group of completely fed-up Nazis plot to kill Hitler and implement operation Valkyrie which, in effect, will put the ""right"" Nazis back in power and end the war by negotiating an end to battle with the allies. This is the premise, and it is executed in a not so strange way much like the plot of a heist movie. We see the masterminds (Branaugh, Stamp, etc), bring in Stauffenberg to use his expertize and hatred of what's become with Germany as a means to pull off their plot. They also bring in some other possible 'friendlies' to their cause who will have various odd-job type tasks (i.e. Eddie Izzard's officer will make sure the phone lines are down from Hitler's operation station after the bomb goes off), and everything has to be planned and operated to the last T.But, of course, as in a heist movie, we know that things wont turn out very well, or as well as anyone might like. Matter of fact, considering that instead of robbing a bank or jewels that it's taking out Hitler and his regime and implementing emergency procedures throughout Europe, it is what we expect it to be: a glorious try at something unattainable. What does make the movie fascinating is the execution of suspense as in any good conspiracy thriller (watching the tension during the first war-room meeting Hitler has with his men and as Stauffenberg awaits confirmation to set off the bomb is intense), and the striking quality of the performances. The actors all do good work- even Cruise who has the double burden of acting with one eye (or a crazy lazy/fake eye) most of the time- this in spite of or despite the fact that they're not given much in way of motivation aside from the obvious. I liked seeing the character of Stauffenberg go through the motions of executing the complex plot, but there's not much there for me to care about the human being.This may not be the case for some, and if so all the better. This really is, to Singer's credit, one of those real WW2 movies with strong men played by terrific actors that... is not really great. In the right frame of mind it could, however, hit just the right spot. Valkyrie is slick, efficient storytelling.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Cruise is Stellar,"I have so much fun reading some ""critics"". Some want historical accuracy. Well this isn't a documentary. There's plenty of those around on this historical period. Some want German accents. The splendid ensemble cast are creating characters not demonstrating a sociolinguistics class. And others, the most unethical lot of all, criticise Cruise because of his personal identity rather than his acting chops.Well, this extraordinary movie exacts sweet revenge on such misguided critics. It is a master class of the Kurosawa ""doctrine"" that because film is such a multimodal medium one needs to be careful to balance all the competing elements harmoniously.The editing is so tight here that narrative, dramatic and characterisation elements cohere brilliantly into an organic and most satisfying whole.I could talk about the ensemble cast a lot. Suffice it to say that that too is another most cohesive and targeted aspect of the film.But this is Cruise's moment. He absolutely fills the screen with charisma. His acting is impeccable. ( He single handedly saved Eyes Wide Shut, such a great faux pas from such a great master as Kubrick). He is stellar, he shines, he smoulders, he is just scintillating.Damn those who put him down because they don't approve of Scientology or his lifestyle. Those issues are completely irrelevant as criteria for judging a cinematic performance. His acting chops are so off the scale virtually in every single movie he's made, the whole Academy and related awards caper comes across as a village fair for amateurs.Spectacular movie overall, the sort you come back to watch time and again.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Supporting Cast Leads The Way,"I really enjoyed this movie and I maybe one of the few that was not annoyed by Tom Cruise. Well as I'm sure most people know this movie is about the failed assassination attempt of Adolf Hitler.The acting was very good throughout. I actually enjoyed Tom Cruise's performance but he did not take the lead as strongly as he should have. He did what had to be done but he could have elevated this movie like he has done to others in the past. His role needed that maverick type attitude like he provided in Born On the Fourth of July. His non-German accent was not an issue it was the strength that he displayed in his performance that was disappointing to many. This movie was certainly a chance for him to build his career back up to a more serious level but he clearly did not impress too many people with his role as Stauffenburg to do that. Still, he was enjoyable to watch for me.The supporting cast though was great. Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson were all pivotal in the success of this movie and they certainly filled in perfectly. All around they were great performances but who I especially liked was Christian Berkel who I haven't heard of before as well as Jamie Parker.The directing of Bryan Singer was superb. He provided an amazing amount of suspense to a movie that everyone knew the ending to. For a good half hour I was totally frozen watching as the plot unfold. I also thought the movie was paced very well and he brought the best out of the supporting cast. Of course it was shot very well with a great production throughout. The movie was written very nicely but as many people have said, it would have been great if there was more emotional depth added to the characters to make the audience feel more attached them.This movie certainly had a lot of potential but it stayed within the realm of mostly a suspense action movie. Valkryie reminded me of a WW2 movie from the 50s and 60s with its style and pacing. It's very interesting to think about what ifs' and its kind of funny to think they almost pulled off the impossible without killing Hitler. Valkryie perfectly illustrates how the smallest of things can have the biggest impact.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An Intense war thriller,Tom Cruise in a Nazi uniform with a eye patch and no German accent? sounds like a average war movie but it was the best war movie i have seen this year. Valkyrie was mildly intense and plays well on the action and thrills but it was so hard to take this movie serious.The story should interest many people. A group of Nazi's plot to kill Hitler and call the plot Valkyrie. I was mildly interested while watching the first half while all this unfolded but when it hit the second half i sat straight up and paid attention.Valkyrie started off as a average war movie but was saved in the second half by its intense storyline and its good ending.

Dire War Disaster Movie,"Certainly the most miscast, and probably the most misconceived, War film I have ever seen. Director Bryan Singer made a modern classic with ""The Usual Suspects"" ,but his milieu is television. This comes across as a big budget / low brain effort which pulverises an essentially good story into pulp. At the heart of everything is the casting and accents. A predominantly British cast play the Germans in strong British accents, Cruise plays Stauffenberg with an American accent that veers into British from time to time. Consequently the whole film feels like a giant fancy dress party.The sets, and costumes are convincing. The dialogue is not. I wanted to suspend disbelief, but when the English speaking accents are compounded by situations, speech and phrasing which are wholly un-Germanic that is nigh on impossible. In ""The Usual Suspects"", Singer started at the end and then worked back to it, a device used in ""Carlitos Way"" by Brian De Palma, and therein lies another challenge. We know what happens, the assassination plot fails, so how do you deal with that to retain dramatic tension? The answer is that Singer doesn't. De Palma created a Shakespearean tragedy, but Singer is no De Palma, and the script and story does not allow Cruise to replicate Pacino as the man condemned to an inevitable fate. So the film constantly struggles to find it's artistic raison d'etre.Historically, the film is flawed. Inevitably Cruise plays Stauffenberg as the ""good guy"", the truth was far more complex, and interesting than that, but the screenplay has no time to flesh that out. There is an ongoing intrinsic conflict between what and who is right and wrong in the story. Perversely the denouement shows loyal soldiers making the right practical decisions in crushing the coup which is an odd moral to emerge as a defining theme.The rise of Hitler. His mass popular support. His ability to turn proud Nationalism into ghastly genocide, and the lack of resistance to him are all big, film worthy topics. The mechanics of a coup in a powerful country, with a strong regime at War is also intriguing stuff. The conflicting demands that soldiers and citizens have to their country, their leader, and right and wrong are timeless matters. All this is squandered by a treatment that would barely get off a cartoon storyboard.Frustratingly the story of the plot is a worthy theme, and the events bear critical and dramatic examination, but this offering misses the target so spectacularly that if offers nothing to the debate. For those with no interest in history, looking for straight forwards entertainment this is passable, but no more.",3.0,Anonymous,History
gripping wartime drama,"Without question, this is a well made movie, and the story is told in a compelling, engaging way even though we all know it's going to turn out badly for our hero. The costumes, props, everything is superbly well turned out.The characters involved in the plot are also interesting, each with their own internal conflicts. The interplay between political and military thinking is fascinating to watch. I had never before considered ""so what happens after Hitler is dead?"" which took up the greater part of the planning and scheming and plotting (and also gave the movie its title, from operation ""Walkure"").Cruise does well, but his supporting cast is outstanding, including numerous ex-Pirates: Gibbs, Beckett, Mercer, even Davy Jones all show up. They looked a lot more colorful in pirate garb than in Nazi gray and green, though.Still, while the movie does provide an excellent education in the assassination plot and the situation in Germany in mid-1944, it leaves us with little to hold on to. The key men all were martyred and paid with their lives, yet as the movie presents things, they accomplished next to nothing. Somewhere else I read that as a result of this plot, Hitler became even more reclusive and distrustful of his inner circle, which led to him taking less advice from capable generals and making more military mistakes. So ultimately this point could have been made somehow, but it wasn't.Worth seeing by all means, but no big loss by waiting for the DVD rental.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Good Psychological Thriller,"This story is based on real incidents happened in Germany in 1944 during the Hitler regime of World War II. German Colonel Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) gets injured in a war at South Africa. He loses one eye, one palm and two fingers on the other hand. Stauffenberg feels that Hitler is doing more harm to Germany than any help. There is a group of officers who feel the same. He joins them and conspires and executes a plot to assassinate Hitler using Operation Valkyrie which holds key to the usage of reserved army in crisis.WE KNOW THE CLIMAX: All of us knew that Hitler final end came through the act of suicide. Hence we knew in advance that he was not assassinated. And the entire movie runs on an attempt to assassinate Hitler. It requires tremendous narrative from the director if the audiences already knew the climax. Bryan Singer who directed the most fascinating 'The Usual Suspects' comes up with another riveting thriller drama in the form of 'Valkyrie'.It is more fascinating because a part of German Army believes that Germany's reputation is going down because of Hitler. This film shows the humanistic soldiers who are under director command of Hitler. I loved the way Hitler is shown. The entire film is shot from the point of view of Stauffenberg. Hence Hitler is shown for a few seconds in the entire movie  that's too in flashes without revealing the entire body.TAILPIECE: Valkyrie is a tautly made psychological thriller with interesting background and is based on real incidents involving Hitler's final months. This film has linear narration with no confusion.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Point Man For The Bomb Plot Against Hitler,"Tom Cruise is one of those actors who can't shake a youthful image. When one thinks of him, one thinks of All The Right Moves, Top Gun, even Taps as the young brat packer. Of all the young players of the Eighties labeled the Brat Pack, Cruise has had the most staying power by far.In Valkyrie, Cruise holds his own with some classically trained players from across the pond like Terrence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, and Tom Wilkinson. These folks in varying degrees participate in the plot named Operation Valkyrie to assassinate Adolph Hitler and hopefully bring about a short conclusion of the war.Working against them was the unconditional surrender policy agreed to by the Allies. Everyone well remembered Hitler's skillful use of the betrayal issue that came about in that interregnum between the Armistice and the Versailles Treaty. The Allies wanted Germany beaten with no doubt about it this time around.And they would have had to have bagged a whole gang of them, Himmler, Goering, Goebbels, Bormann etc. for it to work. Nobody on the Allied side would have dealt with any of these specimens. In fact when they did break the policy and negotiate a surrender with Marshal Pietro Badoglio and due to circumstances to lengthy to go into here, the objective was not accomplished and we had a yard by yard war up the Italian peninsula instead of a quick surrender.Cruise let's face it is not a brat packer any more. In fact he's roughly the age that Stauffenberg was when he became the point man for bombing on July 20, 1944. He even looks a bit like him. There's also a trace of the German aristocratic air about him that Stauffenberg was. Claus von Stauffenberg did come from an old Catholic aristocratic family with a military tradition who saw the Nazis as parvenus. But it was hard to argue with Hitler's early military success, especially for a military man.The performance really to watch here is that of Tom Wilkinson who is a really oily individual as General Fromm who was trying so hard to keep himself in good with both sides so he could come out on top. As for what happened to him, watch a very worthwhile film to find out.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent film,"Valkyrie features Tom Cruise as star and producer of a true story about a group of German officers who made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Hitler and launch a government coup over Germany in order to spare the country a more merciful surrender pact with the Allied forces. Despite a few setbacks, Valkyrie is an impressively well-crafted political thriller.Chief among these setbacks is Tom Cruise, himself, which is somewhat a disappointment because this man has taken a lot of beatings from the press and general public over the last couple of years and I'm usually one of his starch defenders. Cruise doesn't even attempt a German accent and doesn't really inject any personality into the role. It's ridiculously hard to suspend your disbelief and think you're watching anything other than some strange time travelling story of Tom Cruise playing himself inserted into 1944 Germany. But Cruise produced and bankrolled the film and stuck with it through several release date delays, so credit goes to him on that. Fortunately on the acting front, Cruise is surrounded by a really solid cast: Among others, Bill Nighy, Terrence Stamp (My Boss' Daughter, Get Smart), and Tom Wilkinson, fresh off his amazing performance in Michael Clayton last year. Wilkinson's character as a top general with loyalties to Hitler could have been someone you could have built an entire movie around.As in the X-Men series, director Bryan Singer doesn't just jump into the action but takes his time building suspense, even if the score is annoyingly over-dramatic at parts (it sounded like a horror film). If you're expecting an action film, you're bound to be disappointed. It's more of a backdoor political piece that reminded me a little bit of The Contender. For the first half of the film, Cruise is just going from Nazi official to Nazi official trying to find the right allies and gather signatures to enact his grandiose plan. The payoff is well-worth it, however. It's thought-provoking, tragic, and well-shot.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Haunting,"This was a hauntingly suspenseful film. Though we all know the outcome of the events that took place, you still hold your breath as the events unfold. I haven't felt like this about a film since ""13 days"" never realizing (as I wasn't there) how close things really came! The whole cast was powerful, that being said I felt that it could have been a little longer. I wish the film spent more time with Tom's character so we could know a little bit more about him but with the screen time he had he made it clear that their were two sides. Those who wanted to over throw Hitler and where Men of action and those who just wanted to sit around talking about doing it. It is clear that Tom's character was driven by taking action, just wished we knew a little bit more about him.After the film my friend and I were debating on what parts of the story were true or what was embellished. Im very certain the characters kids playing the record ""Flight of the Valkarie"" was completely fictionalized and even a bit out of place, or perhaps too obvious would be the best choice of words. However that was my only real complaint to the makers of the film. Other than that it was really well done and have a pretty good feeling that the story will stick with me for a long time. Cause lets face it, these conspirators REA-A-A-L-Y came close to pulling it off. I was actually surprised at how close they got to winning and over throwing Hitler. I could just recall something about the bomb going off and the table top was the only thing that saved him back when they were telling me about this in High school. Even then a bit of curiosity sparked in my mind but that was it.This film really flushed everything out and shed some light and give a ""wider scope"" on the people of Germany and like the trailer said ""To show the world that we are not all like him"" Its definitely a film to be proud of.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Initial opinion was 'Horrible!,' later upgraded to 'disappointing'","With the notable exception of Thomas Kretschmann, and possibly Bill Nighy, the cast just did not make convincing Nazis. There was nothing of the sinister rigidity and fear that could have really enhanced the triller aspect of the plot. I felt like I was watching a movie with an American and a bunch of Brits trying to play Nazis. The story, however, seemed to be a fairly accurate historical account of the events on which the movie is based. That I commend, although there really wasn't a convincing romantic element or memorable musical score that I think could have greatly added to the underlying story. I believe the movie could have been made ten times better by using a cast of unknowns, who at least were German. I had been waiting for this movie for a long time, and unfortunately, overall, I would have to say it was a disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,History
History trivialized by dummkopfs,"Incompetent to the point of making your stomach turn.Based on real events and people. Really? Who, exactly? Any reference to a conspiracy of Hitler's inside circle to assassinate him is purely accidental. This was an event that could have had immense repercussions on the course of human history in the decades that followed. This movie treats the whole thing like some high school teen angst dramedy.Cruise looks like a little kid trying on his Daddy's old war uniform, and whining when he finds it's too big. Forget any German accent, or anything else to occupy the role of a Nazi officer. Let alone someone plotting a murder, or fearing for his own life. He talks like he just hung ten on some like totally rad gnarly curls at Malibu, dude. And he sports that eye patch like a he's going trick-or-treating for the first time. Other actors look like they're going to laugh at him at any moment. And they play Nazis--with British accents? There's just no serious tone, when you see Der Cruiser rushing around in jack-boots like he needs to go to the Herr's room. The guy playing Hitler looks more like Moe Howard of the Three Stooges. Not badly scripted; there was potential. The director obviously needed to do more research about these individuals; his lack of knowledge and professionalism trivializes this very serious subject matter.

Critics be Damned!,"I agree with every word PRAGERS wrote, below.But what prompts me to add my additional comment is the absolute failure of the critics to rise above their dislike of Cruise and to recognize this film for the near-masterpiece that it is. As for Cruise, his performance is understated and nuanced. Only once was I reminded that he is, after all, an American, and never once was I reminded of his other work. This was a Cruise I had not seen before.The film is superb story-telling. Everything about the production is excellent.Here's is something I will always remember. The film was preceded by six (!!!) previews. Each preview was an assault on the nervous system: An explosion of color, motion, and sound -- and nothing else. When Valkyrie began to roll, suddenly my ears stopped ringing and my brain was engaged. Imagine! A film that depends on dialog!And why don't the critics get it? Because in their arrogant, insulated world,they don't have to. I have no respect for them or their craft.",,Anonymous,History
"A well constructed. researched, and acted historical thriller","Some day, perhaps years or decades from now, when Tom Cruise's Oprah antics and Scientology ramblings have faded into distant memory, people will reflect upon his acting legacy and evaluate him as a pretty decent actor who chose some interesting roles ranging from a suburban rich kid in Risky Business to a US Union officer in Japan (The Last Samurai), a vampire, and against-type as an anti-hero hit-man in Collateral.With Valkyrie you can add eye-patch-wearing Nazi to the list as Cruise portrays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg in the failed July 20, 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler.Directed by Bryan Singer (Superman Returns), Valkyrie sports an impressive ensemble cast as players in the failed coup that, had it succeeded, likely would have ended the war and prevented Germany from being partitioned by the allies.Sticking closely to historical accounts, Singer and screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander do a good job a delivering what is essentially a big budget rendering of a docu-drama that you'd expect to find on A&E or the History channel. While the details are up to snuff, and the acting uniformly excellent, what's missing is any sort of insight into the motivation of the coup plotters beyond the obvious desire to unseat a megalomaniac who was driving their country to destruction.Whereas history tells us that von Stauffenberg and other senior officers, all largely from aristocratic backgrounds, were motivated by various ideals and morals ranging from the religious to philosophical, economic and political, virtually none of this is conveyed in the in the film. Lip service is paid to their collective desire to free their fellow Germans from the group-think that has their country in its grip, but human motivation is, and was, more nuanced than that.Nonetheless, the unfolding of events is laden with more than enough drama to carry the film, and the portrayal of opportunistic fence sitters such as Tom Wilkinson's General Friedrich Fromm, whose sole interest was being on whichever side won the day, adds further tension to the story.Cruise is surprisingly good as the maimed and decorated Colonel whose inclusion among Hitler's inner circle allowed him to get close enough to plant the bomb, as well as co-ordinate the details of Operation Valkyrie - a plan approved by the Fuhrer himself to mobilize the Reich's military reserve units to maintain order in the event of his death.Valkyrie offers much more than a mere showcase for the world's most famous Scientologist. While more could have been delivered, it is true to the source and will leave you wondering how different today's world might be had these men succeeded in their actions.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Well-Crafted and Engaging,"When I first saw the trailer for Valkyrie, I said to myself, ""plenty of potential, but it looks like it will be wasted."" I was offered a the chance to see the film a couple times but turned away since it didn't look too promising to me. But I finally succumbed and decided to give the film a shot and see how it would hold up. After quietly leaving the theater with my friend, I can say this was a very nice surprise; and I'd encourage anyone curious to see the film to do so.One thing I said to myself before the film started was that I just couldn't see Tom Cruise pulling off an eye-patched Nazi attire. This was one of the first areas the film surprised me; Cruise managed to fit into his role as Colonel Stauffenberg very well. He also managed to make Stauffenberg one of his more likable characters for what I've seen. The supporting cast also do a good job and were arguably better at their roles than Cruise.The film does get off to a rather slow start but it ultimately sets the scenario up for what becomes an interesting and very engaging watch. While the end result(s) aren't surprising it's still neat to see how everything plays out and this is ultimately the film's greatest strength. Once the climax and plot began to play out I could not look away from the screen.Definitely check this film out if you get the chance, I can almost guarantee you'll leave the theater satisfied.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Good production values and great cast, despite flaws.","My Take: Tom Cruise and the strong ensemble cast make this an effective popcorn thriller, even if the ending is well-known.Don't let it's initial appearance fool you! Though it may sound like a cinematic browse through history books, VALKYRIE, even with its detailed recreation of the almost-successful assassination of The Fuhrer, is a slick, entertaining Hollywood popcorn thriller. Sure, it's crammed with details, but as entertainment, it's more than serviceable, and yet it doesn't falter to the usual Hollywood trappings. VALKYRIE is that sincere kind of Hollywood entertainment that doesn't let Hollywood turn it into something it's not.Tom Cruise is actually very convincing, not letting his popularity get in the way as a distraction, as one-handed, one-eyed Nazi Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. Worried about how his family would live under Hitler's Germany, he joins a crack team of conspirators (think OCEAN'S ELEVEN with Nazi uniforms) on a plot to assassinate Hitler (eerily played by David Bamber) and take over his Germany. Ironically, their operation (Operation: Valkyrie) was meant for coups like these.It ain't nearly the most thrilling movie set on offices and war shelters, and it ain't much of a history lesson either. but perhaps the biggest fault of the film is its lack of real suspense or danger. Since we know how it all ends, the suspense being built around the first two acts aren't quite as gripping as its supposed to. But VALKYRIE gets the job done. It's thrilling down to the scenes where the team tries to sneak bombs in near Hitler's side or the scene where Stauffenberg has a one-on-one meeting with The Fuhrer. Terrific performances abound, especially the kind of quality performance we expect from a cast that includes Cruise, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson and Terence Stamp. Director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie does stick to some of the facts, even if its faithfulness takes some of the excitement away from it. It may not be the most suspenseful thriller ever to come out in years, but it's nonetheless effective. VALKYRIE delivers, flaws aside.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Thoroughly suspenseful wartime thriller,"Despite the fact that we all know the eventual outcome of this film, VALKYRIE turns out to be a great film, featuring great performances from an ensemble cast and a script that wrings maximum suspense out of the tense true story that it's based upon.Tom Cruise might not be everybody's choice as a battle-scarred German officer desperate to do away with Hitler, but I liked his performance; he underplays it for the most part, as do the rest of the cast. Bill Nighy is career-best, doing away with the hammy mannerisms usually blighting his roles, and there are nice parts for Kenneth Branagh, Terence Stamp and even Eddie Izzard to get their teeth into. Yes, Carice van Houten is wasted but then you can't have everything.One thing I was unsure about was this film's portrayal of Hitler, which was going to be tough after Bruno Gans did such a good job in DOWNFALL. When I realised ROME's David Bamber (an actor usually known for his comedic roles) was tackling the role, I wasn't sure what to think, but he acquits himself well with the part and is unrecognisable for the most part.The film gradually builds suspense and tension despite the inevitability of the climax and never resorts to flashy special effects or action scenes to keep the viewers watching. That's why I recommend it: a resolutely old-fashioned slice of wartime thrills and Bryan Singer's best movie by far.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Mission Impossible,"Indeed this mission was impossible. This movie is named after a Wagner composition. Wagner gave verve to the German spirit during WWII with its driving musical compositions. But this Valkyre tune is also the name of the operation of the defense forces which would help to replace the German Government after Hitler were to be killed by whomever. There was a plan to protect the integrity of the German Government should Hitler die for any reason. Van Stauffenberg attempted to control this operation already in place and to place himself in control of it when Hitler were to be killed.This movie helps to cleanse Germany of its sins. It will be welcome there. Tom Cruise has shed any boyishness in his portrayal of the Col. Stauffenberg. Therefore, it all works. The movie moves along like a ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" with few slow moments. The tension builds and builds and you will not be immune to it. I believed everything. I saw no flaw that would be amusing. This is a serious movie, not entertainment.I gave it an ""8"" because I felt it was not as creative as some other movies. But then this is because it sticks to the facts. It is a historical movie not a creative romp.You will leave this movie with a serious demeanor, but there is still the saving grace that good triumphed over evil eventually. And if you are German you can choose to identify with the good guys now. Hitler is not made much of in this movie.Everything flows from one event to another with smoothness and sometimes passion. Everything is explained well. I think everyone should see it once if just to remember that there were other types of Germans involved in WWII who did not walk the party line.I feel it is one of the best movies of the year, perhaps in the top 15 of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Amazing story, decent movie.","Colonel Stauffenberg's plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler extends well beyond the limitations of any Hollywood film. It is a source of great pride for many Germans, telling the story of few standing up to many in the face of daunting odds. 'Valkyrie', in the hands of a capable director such as Bryan Singer, could and should have been much better. But as it stands, this latest Tom Cruise vehicle is at the very least a decent and relatively entertaining attempt to retell a fascinating moment in history.The most impressive aspect about 'Valkyrie' is, despite us knowing the outcome even before walking into the theater, its ability to build enough tension that for a few brief moments we may actually believe that Stauffenberg and his men will actually succeed in their mission. It has to be the biggest strength for this picture, anything less than convincing would have been an utter failure. I knew very little about the July 20th plot going into the film, and I can honestly say I was staggered at how far the plot advanced and how close these men came to succeeding.Tom Cruise may actually receive more awards consideration for his bizarre turn in 'Tropic Thunder' than his portrayal as the national hero in 'Valkyrie'. Though that shouldn't undercut what is an otherwise okay performance. A bit stiff, but he's far from being the distraction many feared. Performances from the entire cast are rather solid, and the choice to cast mostly English actors may seem strange, but it really doesn't take us out of the movie or become anything problematic. Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Eddie Izzard, and Jamie Parker all fit into their roles nicely to provide 'Valkyrie' a sturdy supporting cast.Ultimately, 'Valkyrie' never quite resonates as the profound historical thriller it aspires to be. The script never goes nearly as deep as I would have liked, we're given little access to background information that may have allowed the film to resonate much more strongly. Bryan Singer's typical character driven approach never fully resonates, leaving something to be desired in the emotional department. But as it stands, a fine editing job helps the good outweigh the bad. This is an amazing story on its own right, even if it doesn't translate to a great film. 'Valkyrie' reminds us that moral responsibility should never be sacrificed for personal gain. That even when death is almost certain, it is not failure. An intriguing and important history lesson, no doubt.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",6.0,Anonymous,History

History told Hollywood style.,"Well, this movie was a bit of a disappointment. It had all of the right ingredients in it needed to make a great and interesting movie with but yet it really wasn't one. It had Tom Cruise, Bryan Singer as director, a fascinating and a based on true events story but the movie just made some wrong choices in the process.The movie really isn't handling its story very well. Instead of telling the story honest and with respect it tells it spectacular and overblown. The movie is too Hollywood-like for its story and the real story and characters deserved a better treatment.But even so, the movie is trying to be Hollywood-like, it yet doesn't even fully succeed in this neither. The movie just isn't spectacular enough to watch for this. There aren't any big shoot-outs or a spectacular ending in which everything reaches a conclusion. There often is more talking than action, so I actually have no clue at which audiences they were aiming. Singer made the same mistake before with ""Superman Returns"".The movie also made a bad choice with its casting. Nothing wrong with Tom Cruise in his role, even though its also far from his most memorable one but casting some very British actors in some very German roles was simply a horrible choice. The accents did really bother and it was often quite laughable hearing a high placed German commander talking with a very thick British accent. Especially Hitler's voice really bothered me. Sure, the actor that played him (David Bamber) looked well enough like him but he sounded absolutely nothing like him at all. For all I cared they should had called in something to dub his voice but they didn't even bothered with it. It's a shame that most actors feel so out of place within this movie, since the movie does certainly feature some great actors in it, such as of course Tom Cruise but also Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp and Thomas Kretschmann, among many others.It's of course a good looking movie and it's also put together professionally with its directing, editing, cinematography, music and such and it also certainly wasn't a cheap movie to make but this simply does not make the movie better or more interesting to watch.

Not only until the last third of the movie does it get marginally interesting. The laugh came from the portrayal of Adolph Hitler. I mean, didn't the producers and directors watch their own film. Who did the casting here. And the photography. Was there a shortage of lights or good weather. The whole film is so black and dark, photographed in shadows. Just very hard to watch.

Valkyrie is a test project for the newly reformed United Artists,"Valkyrie is a test project for the newly reformed United Artists under Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner. It was also a smaller project for Bryan Singer after doing 3 superhero films and reunite Singer and Christoper McQuarrie for the first time after the Usual Suspects.Valkyrie starts with a prelogue sequence in North Africa. Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is a disaffected officer who is questioning Hitler's regime and that he was leading Germany to the path of destruction. During a British air raid he is injured badly, loosing an eye, his right hand and two fingers on his left hand. He can no longer serve on the front line. In 1943 General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) fails in his attempt to assassin Hitler and the German Resistance loss an army officer to help with operations. Von Stauffenberg is recruited in the resistance and the General Staff. He comes up with the Valkyrie plan which was to make the assassination of Hitler look like an SS plot, and get the army to launch a coup to 'protect' the Nazi regime. Von Stauffenberg is the only man who could get close to Hitler because he was the Chief-of-Staff for the Reserve Army General. The film is split into three major parts, the planning, the assassination attempt and the attempted coup.Singer was able to bring in a very stylist approach of direction. I enjoy Singer's films and he was able to show his skills again. He is able to get an excellent cast, including Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh, Terrence Stamp and Tom Wilkingson to name a few. However, he shot the film in the style of a thriller, which was interesting, but being a historical film with most people knowing the outcome already takes away the suspense. But Singer did make an enjoyable film. The film has a strong script",,Anonymous,History
Many saw evil. They dared to stop it.,"At the height of WW2, a group of high-ranking German officers hatched a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, and seize power of the military command in order to end the war. The operation was codenamed ""Valkyrie"", for the emergency plan that was meant to be used in case of a revolt against the Nazi government.Let me get to the point: Don't let the trailer for the film fool you. Don't let the director fool you. Don't even let Tom Cruise fool you. What's being advertised as a nail-biting, suspenseful film, many people will be disappointed that ""Valkyrie"" is more like the opposite. It's not a bad film, honestly. I enjoyed it but when watching the film, get ready to hear a lot of coughing in the audience to break the silence throughout the film.The movie is actually two separate films: The first half is actually the planning of Hitler's assassination. Due to the film being built upon this secret plan, none of the ""action"" really starts until the second half. That's where the problem lies. The first film is pretty...uneventful. The second half, although much more exciting and more things happening, is still not as ""action packed"" as you hope it to be.I guess if you're a person who likes dialog to fill the screen for the first half and some action the second, you'll enjoy it. It's great, actually, because the film doesn't need mindless action to fill up the running time, which is partly the reason why I liked the film. However, if you want it like Bryan Singer's previous efforts, you'll be disappointed.I won't be surprised if the majority of the people find this film boring and too talky. I won't blame them for expecting something much more like shown in the trailer. However, it's based on a true story so you know the filmmakers were trying to keep it true, although maybe changing a few things for the silver screen. Tom Cruise does a decent job as Stauffenberg, the mastermind behind the plan, although not an Oscar worthy performance (that would go to his performance in ""Tropic Thunder,"" of course). Everyone else also do a decent job for what they have.In the end, although not as big as the advertising make it out to be, along with the names on the movie, the film is, in my opinion, what I call, passable entertainment and important history for people to learn, if they hadn't known already. The film is more a psychological film than an action blockbuster starring Tom Cruise.

An Underrated WWII Movie,"Valkyrie is my favorite WWII movie about the plot to assassinate Hitler by a group of German officers. Based on a true story, this historical film gives a glimpse of life in Germany in the 1940's and the military's dissatisfaction with Hitler's regime. The somber soundtrack blends perfectly with every scene. Most importantly, Tom Cruise's performance as Claus von Stauffenberg is excellent as he's a versatile actor when it comes to acting in drama films, it's also his first collaboration with screenwriter/director Christopher McQuarrie who later became his creative partner in his movies such as the Mission: Impossible franchise, Jack Reacher and much more. Valkyrie is a sublime movie and I love watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Language barrier,"Tom Cruise is fine in the role of Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg, the well-born military leader of the last, spectacular attempted coup against Hitler. That is, he has the right bearing, that of a man of full confidence, born to command. Cruise himself may originally come from humble origins, but in stardom he has grown into the shoes at least of Hollywood aristocracy. He's a leading man, and so, made to lead. But in one way, he's out of place. The trouble is, though he plays a German, what he needs, and lacks, is an English accent. That's because the rest of the cast, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nyhy, Tom Wilkinson, Tom Hollander, Eddie Izzard, and Terrence Stamp, to name a few, are English, and with their plummy voices they don't let you forget it. Of course, it's also hard to forget that Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise, despite the eye patch and the crisp uniforms.Apart from the artificiality of the language, 'Valkyrie' rarely works up enough tension. And the fact that the assassination attempt is one that historically failed is no excuse, because 'Day of the Jackel' was about a failed attempt to kill De Gaulle, but it still kept its suspense coiled tight right up to the end. Anthony Lane has it right. The conspirators' scheme to use a Hitlerian emergency plan (called ""Valkyrie"") and fake an SS coup, is too complicated to follow, and the all-English cast gives us too many quirky character actors and not enough solid meat: these guys ""are meant to be battle-toughened Nazi officers, but what we get is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis."" Singer's direction is methodical, and the costumes and sets are nicely authentic, but the movie tries to do too much. It tries to set up a context of Von Stauffenberg's life and career, outline who all the main figures in the coup scheme are, depict the bomb/assassination attempt in specific detail, and describe the subsequent coup attempt, the Operation ""Valkyrie"" ruse to unseat the SS. There's just not enough focus here. In a suspenseful, well structured movie about these events, the bomb attempt would probably have been the main focus, and Von Stauffenberg would have been more central. After all, it's Tom Cruise! And he's special: he's American!There are good moments. Von Stauffenberg's visit to a distracted, declining Hitler to get him to sign the revised ""Valkyrie"" plan is impressively staged and atmospheric. It captures a tiny bit of the kind of endgame mood Sokurov got in his unsuccessful but haunting 'Molokh' and Oliver Hirschbiegel delineated in detail in 'Downfall'. And there's more authentic danger in it--the danger of being in the presence of a madman with absolute power--than in the bomb sequence. Despite Lane's calling Wilkinson ""the ever-perplexed,"" he's pretty frightening as the intractable and mean General Friedrich Fromm. Bill Nihy, on the other hand, isn't appropriate as the indecisive General Friedrich Olbricht. He's too forceful an actor for such a role.Lane is finally right in suggesting how fundamentally silly this kind of enterprise is. And yet there's a whole string of late-2008 releases about Nazism and its aftermath whose Germans all talk English -- 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,' 'The Reader,' 'Valkyrie,' 'Defiance.' Only 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' works in the unrealistic language, because it unfolds as a fable about innocence at the heart of evil. In the other films, which make claims to historical realism, the inappropriateness is jarring and the methodology -- one would hope, at least -- out of date. Germans should have made these movies. And as for having Cruise speak the opening paragraph of the film in German, well, that is laughable, and only draws attention to the pretense.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Great Cast Drives This Excellent Thriller,"This is an enjoyable movie. It isn't quite as different as The Usual Suspects but it's still an intriguing film. The German channel ZDF summed it up well: Valkyrie is ""neither scandalously bad nor the event of the century...Neither is it the action thriller we feared, but it is a well-made and serious film.""The story is suspenseful, filled with tension to keep you glued to it. It isn't bogged down with pointless side stories to add needless drama. ""Will he do it for the world or will he chicken out to be with his family?"" There's already enough going on with just trying to get it all planned out and get everyone on board. The movie's like the characters, know what needs to be done and just goes for it. And I liked that they didn't delve into every character's back story and reason for trying to kill Hitler. It's 2008/09. We know there's plenty of reasons for people to kill the man. Besides, that would have just added twenty to thirty minutes of dialog and exposition just to say that Hitler is bad.This proved to be a great role for Tom Cruise. For once he doesn't just break out in a run for some random reason trying to be an action star. Here he goes back to what he's good at, like his older roles in A Few Good Men or Rain Man. He's a good actor but not when he's running around. Maybe we can finally forget about him on the couch and think of his acting.The rest of the cast works perfectly. Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, and the ever lovable Terence Stamp are all in top form. There doesn't seem to be a single person who could be replaced with someone better.The production values are great, certainly nothing is done half-hearted. Everything looks amazing and is well done, the kind of touch Bryan Singer brings. I like all of Singer's movies. Usual Suspects, X-Men 1 & 2, and even Superman Returns. He's no Christopher Nolan or Steven Spielberg but he's still a fine director.My only real problem with the movie is I wish there was some extra punch to it. This is a real historical account. Therefore we already know how it ends. Anyone who would see this movie should have enough education from grade school to know that this plot didn't kill Hitler. This is the problem that faced the Star Wars prequel trilogy. How to make it engaging when the audience knows the ending. He did a good job but I feel he could have gone further. Maybe Singer should have taken a page from Nolan's book and made it non-linear. Perhaps played up the suspense of Hitler trying to communicate before the plotters succeeded. Or something a little more that would have pushed it from a good movie to great one.It's an exciting thriller that I recommend to everyone. It showcases not only an important event but one of the best parts of humanity. The plotters weren't saints but normal, average human beings trying to be good. They stood up in the midst of insurmountable odds to do what is right. And the fact that it was all true made it all the more touching.And in the end it did what all movies should aspire to do: I left wanting to see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Nice attempt, but too simplistic character portrayal.","In case you wonder why the film kind of leaves you cold, here's my guess: the protagonist, Stauffenberg, is lacking any inner conflict. As generally the characters Mr. Cruise plays seem to be in doubt max 5 mins of the respective film, from whence on they just try to do the right thing, against all odds, and either succeed or fail.So to be perfectly clear, committing high treason - which this film is about - would not be something you once make a decision on and then just go forward without any further qualm. And especially not so when you were officer in the German army, each member of which was obliged to take an oath on the Fuehrer's person. Unfortunately, this major conflict just gets reflected in some of the co-conspirators, where it's generally portrayed as a weakness which Stauffenberg helps them to overcome.Which, once again, leaves us with a one dimensional hero who fails mainly due to bad luck and lack of proper support from his surroundings. Sorry, but for me that just doesn't fly. For example, with that many attempts that were made on Hitler's life, one could wonder why not a single one succeeded. Maybe the perpetrators did, in the end, lack the determination. So that, as in this case, just one of two bombs would go off and thus not kill the dictator.Such an angle, or any angle more differentiating, like showing us the assassin fighting himself, fighting against his trained code of honor and against all he has been taught, and maybe even losing against himself rather than bad luck would have made for a much more interesting drama. I guess that would have been too much to ask from Mr. Cruise anyway though.So in the end, I give this film credits for being fair and sufficiently accurate. It's still kind of shallow.While at it, for those interested in the actual events I can recommend the docudrama Operation Walküre by Franz Peter Wirth. Jolly good stuff and, to the mature audience, way more involving than this film, I'm sorry to say.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Taut thriller in the WWII vein about a failed plot to kill Hitler...,"VALKYRIE accomplishes the mission it sets out to perform within a two hour running time. Under Bryan Singer's direction, it's a taut thriller bearing the outlines of a true story, handling a complex military plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler that depends on split-second timing to succeed. As we all know, it almost works. It's the ""almost"" factor that gives the film a gripping edge, even though we know the plot fails. The complete story of the events is pared down to make a concise thriller that wastes not a second of screen time.As Colonel Von Stauffenberg, TOM CRUISE gives an effective performance, given that no more of his background is known or explained fully. He delivers a crisp, tight, forceful performance, bolstered by the fact that others around him do equally convincing jobs. BILL NIGHY, TERENCE STAMP, KENNETH BRANAGH, TOM WILKINSON, THOMAS KRETSCHMANN--these are the most prominent and all of them are splendid in portraying Nazi officers who recognize that Hitler's Germany is not the one they envision for the world, intent on seeing Hitler's Germany crushed and given new leadership.Photographed on many of the actual location sites in Germany, it's a vivid recreation of the period with excellent use of sets, costumes and explosives. All of the shattering wartime explosions are extremely well crafted, as is the bomb that almost destroys Hitler's conference room.The pulsating music score gives the film a solid amount of suspense once the plan is underway. This forces the first half of the film to be largely exposition, but none of the exposition is dull. It sets up the story to follow in an intelligent way.The New York Times movie critic dismissed the film's values and referred to Cruise as ""too much Tom Cruise"" to be believable in the role. Not true. It's much more serious than that, and the film's tone is totally unlike the style of many of the war movies of the '40s--""Desperate Journey,"" for example, featuring the antics of the Warner contract players in a film starring Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan about putting one over on the Nazis, which was juvenile nonsense.It's intelligent and engrossing from beginning to end, an efficient WWII yarn based on true incidents that should be seen and appreciated for what it is--not for bashing Mr. Cruise and whatever tabloid headlines exploit his personal life. It might also inform some of today's teen-agers about an event that actually happened during WWII--at least those teens who are interested in the subject.",7.0,Anonymous,History
2 hours lost,"I have two words, and you can apply them as well to the effort of the film makers as to the (falsified) assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler depicted in it : Ambitious, but rubbish !As some other IMDb users explained in their comments, this movie fails to point out the real reasons for this assassination attempt : they felt Hitler was completely crazy, and they wanted to get rid of him to take over and do a better job. Col. Claus von Stauffenberg was as racist as his fuhrer, and so were all those generals on his side. Jews, Poles, Russians and anyone not being a blue eyed blond sucker answering to the name of Hans or Heinrich or whatever were considered by them as subhumans or worse. This movie tries to point out some good people within history's most guilty nation for committing crimes against humanity, then it gives some sort of explanation for why we never heard of such Germans back then.You also get the sense that the behavior of the characters in military environment is much more American than German. It's like having American troops, but they're just dressed as Germans.

Caper Film; Nazism Plays Footnote,"""Valkyrie"" is a caper film in which Nazi Germany plays the traditional role of the caper's exotic background setting. Caper films demand local color; in ""Topkapi,"" the exotic background was Istanbul. Here it's Hitler's bunker and a swastika-bedecked Berlin. The film's primary emphasis is the primary emphasis of all caper films: a super competent, very good-looking lead, in scenes of nail-biting suspense, must carry out a daring stunt. In this case, the daring stunt just happens to be the assassination of Adolf Hitler. And that's really the importance that Hitler is given here  he's comparable to the jewels in a jewel heist film, rather than a human being whose evil challenges the very definition of the word ""human."" Placing the ""Nazi"" in ""Nazi Germany"" into the background of a big-budget, superstar, Hollywood treatment raises questions. As I, in the audience, focused, as the director, script and star were leading me to focus, on the details of the caper, rather than on the massive evil of Nazi Germany, I wondered: is this movie, intentionally or unintentionally, about making Nazism insignificant? There are no scenes, none, in which Tom Cruise's Stauffenberg interrogates Nazism and its relevance to Germany or German identity. Nobody else does, either. There are no scenes that even hint at the horrors that Nazis were perpetrating. There is no hint that the Generals' plot to assassinate Hitler would have been beside the point for millions: the plot occurred late in 1944, after millions of Jews, Rom, Slavs, and other innocent civilians had already met their death under Nazism's methodical brutality. The Allied invasion of Normandy Beach had already taken place. Heroic American soldiers and their Allies would soon take care of Hitler, as the German people never managed to do.There is another major difference between this film and other big budget, Hollywood, WW II dramas that a veteran film-goer notices right away. The heroes have all the attributes so often assigned to film Nazis: they are ubermenschen. Their high, black leather boots shine. Their heels click. Their medals gleam. Their clean guns nest neatly against their impeccable uniforms. Their ranks are masterfully efficient and model a discipline that Leni Riefenstahl would love to film.In other films, audiences view all those admirable cinematic qualities attributed to Nazis with some regret. ""Why can't the good guys be such supermen?"" Certainly Jews, Nazism's primary victims, are usually filmed as being underfed, dirty, cowering victims. American GIs are often scruffy and inarticulate. In ""Valkyrie,"" you get the ubermensch, and you get virtue in that envious, photogenic package.Once the viewer realizes how relatively trivial Nazism is in this movie, and how superficially Nazi-like the good guys are, one has to ask, ""Does this film exist to exculpate  Germans? Germany? National Socialism?"" My guess is that no one involved in the making of this film had any of those goals. My guess is that other viewers besides me will be asking themselves similar questions while undergoing the odd experience of watching this caper film with the most vexed of pedigrees.On a lighter note: the cast is a ""Who's Who"" of respected British and German stars who have not reached superstar status. You will recognize these players, but it will take you a moment to remember from where you recognize them. I had to suspend my immersion in the film for about five minutes after Der Fuhrer's first appearance. I *knew* I knew that guy  but from where  aha. Under history's most infamous mustache lurked the Reverend Mr. Collins, the bumbling, comical, thwarted suitor of the most popular TV costume drama of all time, A&E's ""Pride and Prejudice."" If the filmmakers gambled that no Jane Austen fans would attend ""Valkyrie,"" they gambled wrong. Bill Nighy, Terence Stamp, Tom Wilkinson, Eddie Izzard, Kenneth Branaugh, Tom Hollanderreally, for anglophile film fans, this was like some kind of skewed reunion.German film fans get to see old friends, too. Thomas Kretschmann and Christian Berkel, so memorable in supporting Nazi roles in ""Downfall,"" ""The Pianist,"" and ""Black Book,"" are memorable here in other supporting roles. We should forgive the Germans just so that brilliant German actors get to play something other than Nazis.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Great  Story Well Told,"The people who create movie trailers can make any ole thing look good, so I was afraid to get my hopes up too high for ""Valkyrie."" Well, surprise, surprise, ""Valkyrie"" not only lived up to my expectations, it greatly exceeded them.Tom Cruise plays Claus Von Stauffenberg, a colonel in the German Army who is gravely wounded in North Africa and shipped back to Berlin to recover. Known for his strong anti-Hitler views, he is recruited into a group of German generals who are plotting to over-throw Hitler. Very soon Von Stauffenberg finds himself in charge of the plan. He decides they must kill Hitler and use Hitler's own reserve army to overthrow the government. It's in ingenious plan. Too bad, as one general reminds him, ""Things never go according to plan.""The first hour is build-up to the second, which is the day of the assassination attempt, from start to finish. If you need to take a potty break, I strongly recommend that you do it before the second hour begins. It's the tensest, most exciting hour I've ever spent at the movies. You won't want to miss a minute!Much has been said about the supporting cast of heavyweight British actors, and they are, indeed, wonderful. But I'd like to say a word about Tom Cruise. His performance in this movie was a revelation. He brings a quiet dignity to the role of Von Stauffenberg that I really did not expect from the guy who jumped up and down on Oprah's sofa. Perhaps the beating he's been taking in the press for the last couple of years has forced him to grow up. Whatever it is, he really holds his own, in company with those wonderful British actors.But ultimately Tom Cruise is not the star of this movie; the story is.

Valiant but a tad square.,"The plot to kill Hitler is certainly worth a good film. They slipped it into the ""Night of the Generals,"" as a sub plot, but now it gets full focus. While it is a watchable film, and it follows the history quite accurately, it ends up being a docudrama with not much creativity or tension.What could have added meat to the plot could have been to have given the growth of anti Hitler sentiment more attention, as well as the cultural clash between the officer class and the Nazis.Many critics are down on Cruise. I think he's a capable actor, but to have him as the sole guy with an American accent - surrounded by mostly Brits - is rather ludicrous, but it didn't distract me too much.It would have been nice if they had used some of the many capable German/Austrian actors. Speaking English, of course. Can't have subtitles for an American film! By now we should be well past the tradition of having Brits only playing Nazis. Actors are so good at accents these days, so if your going to use English speaking actors why not use German accents? The other problem I have with the film is the focus on the guys who wanted to bet rid of Hitler as ""good guys."" Von Stauffenberg was known to have made anti semitic comments in his letters to his wife, and I'm sure many in the officer class were anti Semites as well. Their effort to rid themselves of Hitler was not simply a noble cause, it was a plot by one class to get back some of their tarnished honor. Honor tarnished by the Nazis and the SS. Honor which certainly pushed Germany into it's attempt to create an empire. The movie completely side stepped this paradox, and it is the movies insistence on showing history in simplistic terms that lessens it's impact.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Great Movie - Kids Loved It Too,"There's been a lot of comments about the movie itself, and I agree with all the good ones. Tom Cruise has grown up; he did a masterful job conveying von Stauffenberg.

Small children are better left at home, but older children (9-up. You are the best judge of your child) will do fine, with a little help. This is a movie that is Better if you know what the story is, so explain the background (who these people are, difference between the SS and regular Army, Nazis and Germans, etc.) because the beginning of the movie can be confusing if you don't know the story. You might want to do some research, too. And expect to do more explaining after you see it. My kids - 10 & 12 - were captivated all the way through, without any sign of boredom, or not understanding what was going on. The violence is no more than kids see on t.v. No blood or gore, except for a mild scene at the beginning which is just standard war movie stuff. My kids had no trouble with any of it.

I had the misfortune of sitting next to some goon who insisted on narrating the whole film... if that guy never existed, I think I would have enjoyed Valkyrie a lot more. Nonetheless, this is a good movie to take a trip back 70 years and see a different side of the National Socialist Party.

Only Average At Best,"The very high profile cast of this film notwithstanding, I'm afraid that ""Valkyrie"" has all the gravitas of a made-for-TV movie. How some of the top names in British and continental cinema got roped into accepting parts in this film I will never understand - unless it was a matter of money, of course. Especially disappointing is the practically non-existent parts for actresses Carice van Houten and Halina Reijn. What a waste of two talented actresses. And as for the actor who played Hitler, all I can say is that after the phenomenal performance of Austrian Actor Bruno Ganz as Hitler in the film ""The Downfall"" no other actor should ever be allowed to play the Fuhrer.The plot of the film certainly has some large holes in it, too. The very idea that German Army colonels were ordering around various German generals seems pretty far fetched.Finally, of course, there's Tom Cruise playing Colonel Stauffenberg. Cruise brings nothing special to the role. If the makers of this movie were at all serious in the subject matter they should have chosen a different actor to play the role. Cruise is just too lightweight to carry off such an important role.The highlights of the film were the tri-motor aircraft at the beginning, and the very good musical score played at the ending credits.

Tom Cruise gives a strong and dignified performance.,"A prudent movie goer approaches with caution any commercial movie that purports to be based on an actual historical event. Usually by the time the movie is released the facts are so distorted as to render the actual event almost unrecognizable. Surprisingly this movie is an exception. Although the actual assassination attempt on Hitler failed, this movie succeeds in establishing and maintaining the level of suspense required to keep the audience engaged. Tom Cruise gives a surprisingly strong and dignified performance as the German officer who plays a crucial role in planning and implementing the plot. The supporting cast, which includes several outstanding English actors including Terence Stamp who plays an uncharacteristically sympathetic role, are also excellent. What makes this movie especially effective is that it avoids stereotyping the Germans as a bunch of goose-stepping Nazis or in the case of the assassins a bunch of frantic anti-Nazi fanatics and instead stays true to the story which involves a group of individuals trying to stop a war against all odds. That they fail is not the point because the audience already knows that. Rather, that they were willing to take action at all is what makes this movie a special cinematic experience.Another interesting feature of this movie is its treatment of how the German soldiers, including the plotters, dealt with the loyalty oath that every German soldier swore to Adolf Hitler. This meant that the mere thought of opposing Hitler was tantamount not only to committing treason but acting with dishonor which would cause that soldier to be held in utmost contempt by his fellow soldiers, a disgrace that few soldiers could endure. (Of course, when one considers who the German soldiers were fighting for and the crimes many of them committed in the name of their leader, one must question the extent to which ethical considerations played a role in anything the German soldiers did.)Now here's the negatives about this movie. What is especially ironic is that while the Germans were invading countries, committing genocide and killing people by the millions, they could not assassinate one person. The Germans were systematically murdering Jews - they had no qualms about THAT - but apparently killing the Fuehrer was another story. Remember, the plotters were senior military officers, not unarmed civilians, who had access to all the weapons they needed to to the job. Yes, the Germans were very ""brave"" when fighting unarmed Jews but when it came to dealing with their Fuehrer, the person to whom they voluntarily swore allegiance, then their bravery failed them. Where was the opposition on September 1, 1939 (when Germany invaded Poland)? Or on June 21, 1941 (when Germany invaded the Soviet Union)? May 29, 1942 (when the British obliterated Cologne)? Or on January 30, 1943 (when the Soviet Union captured the German 6th Army at Stalingrad)? This doesn't make the assassination attempt any less significant but it should be placed within an historical context. History records that Adolf Hitler was adored ... indeed loved ... by the German people, a fact that the German people will have to deal with for a long time to come. Germans opposed Adolf Hitler? So what? Too little, too late. And who were they to repudiate their oath of allegiance? Guided by a misplaced sense of honor, they chose to follow the Fuehrer, so they had no cause to complain. The Fuehrer had not duped them, they had duped themselves. This movie teaches that one should take great care to whom to swear allegiance. The same officers who plotted against Hitler also participated in aggressive war which set the stage for genocide. That they had second thoughts about the direction the war was going is commendable but it does not absolve them of their own complicity in implementing Hitler's policies.",8.0,Anonymous,History

This film will grab you and make you think a little differently on some of the men in Hitler's high command. Their actions regardless of the outcome put Hitler's command in disarray and as a result made Hitler less trusting and weakened his government likely saving many more lives. Catholics, monarchists, and republicans all worked together for the true good of their country to fight Hitler.

Valkyrie: A True Soldier's Tale In Defiance ***Spoiler***,"Talk about a difficult subject matter to capture on film, 'Valkyrie' was it.Not only was the subject culturally sensitive it was no doubt time sensitive (dated) as well. Generations ' X and Y' are probably not well acquainted with what was at stake back then. Maybe many 'baby-boomers' also lack insight about the turmoil that existed inside National Socialist Nazi Germany in 1944.Those of us who are better versed in world history though are not perplexed by the events 'inside' Nazi Germany. Moreover, we know now what a successful coup would have meant. Possibly the duration of WW II, well, the European 'theater' part could have been shortened had Hitler's would-be assassins succeeded.And of course at the center of the maelstrom lay Colonel Klaus von Stauffenberg. His role as portrayed by Tom Cruise in the plot to kill the Nazi Supreme Commander was nothing short of supreme bravado even in failure. Cruise, to my surprise delivered a credible account of the German loyal to the Republic but not to Hitler.Moreover, the Wehrmacht's swearing of an oath of total allegiance to Hitler was all a mistake. Those who swore did on the basis of cleverly concocted lies. Colonel von Stauffenberg states as much many times.Despite the advance billing of an 'all-star' supporting cast, none of them were needed. Even including Kenneth Branagh and Terrence Stamp as key conspirators, did not alter the cold, bare facts. The film was all about Cruise, er, Col. von Stauffenberg.A German looking Tommie handled the center stage heat and stress well. By extension an argument can be made here that this was actor Cruise's signature performance on film. That's how I saw him.Fancy that: the avowed Hitler hater finds redemption in failure. Don't believe me? Ask Tom. The main actor expressed his loathing of Hitler in an interview during filming.As an adjunct, the director tried his hand at political subterfuge on at least one occasion. If I recall correctly, Hitler's character poses a vexing thought. The camera pans closer. A polished lens soon finds the German leader's cold stare. Thereafter he lays down the gauntlet to Colonel Cruise.For posterity's sake I'll repeat Hitler's words.""If one understands this (Valkere), then one understands (German) National Socialism.""Say again...Sorry Tom, we're out of space. Ex-Chancellor Hitler got the last word. Better luck next time, (if there is one).",10.0,Anonymous,History
Cruise Control,"Anybody with the most cursory knowledge of history will know how 'Valkyrie' ends, but in order not to incur the wrath of the spoiler police I'll confine myself to observing that the one time I laughed out loud while watching this film came when one of the conspirators shoots himself by just raising his gun to his head whereupon it simply cuts; when in reality what followed was extremely botched and messy.British intelligence had considered assassinating Hitler but abandoned the idea since they concluded he would do a better job on his own of losing the war if left unmolested. 'Valkyrie' also gives the erroneous impression that Stauffenberg was provoked into attempting to kill the Fuhrer by the sight of Nazi attrocities when his real motivation was the patriotic conviction that Hitler's leadership was leading Germany to certain defeat..The poster depicts Cruise as the 6' 3"", one-armed Stauffenberg with both arms, both eyes and a good six inches taller than the team he leads; while as usual in a Hollywood production all the Nazis are played by Brits (even David Bamber who plays the Fuhrer himself).",7.0,Anonymous,History
Oh dear...,"I wonder if in the history of cinema there has ever been such woeful miscasting. The British contingent - Nighy, Stamp, Branagh and even Eddy Izzard, for Pete's sake - were so stiff upper lip it was a little tough for me to keep a grip on the fact they were meant to be German officers and not British officer POWs in a German stalag, accents apart. Many critics have incidentally criticized the latter in this film but there really is no choice unless we revert to the bad old Hollywood days of evil-sounding ""you English pigdog, ve haff vays off making you talk!"" Nazi accents or make the film in German with subtitles, which is inconceivable in a Hollywood crowd puller such as this.But the ever young-looking Tom Cruise as Stauffenberg?! Now that's just silly. Every time I saw him I had to stifle a giggle, especially when he popped that daft glass eye in. Forget the fact that he can't act for toffee.It's a pity that such a heroic and tragic tale had to be reduced to this. The Nazis foul revenge was only glossed over at the end, well, Tom was lying there dead, wasn't he, so that was that.But for other reviewers to even mention this film in the same breath as the masterly Downfall is laughable. This story could have done with similar treatment and then it might have been a serious piece of cinema.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Intense, but a lack of dimension in the characters.","Valkryie is a relatively intense thriller with an ending that we all know going into it, but that doesn't make it any less suspenseful. Well...maybe a little less suspenseful, but not significantly. The film has one fatal flaw though and that's it's complete lack of focus on it's characters. Bryan Singer made a decision to focus almost entirely on the attempted assassination on Hitler to the point where by the end we don't even know who these characters, aside from Stauffenberg, were that conspired to bring down Hitler. As far as I'm concerned, they were just a bunch of strangers in a room. The performances were good, giving each character a certain amount of presence, but after it all I still don't know who these men were. Tom Cruise definitely commanded the film with a driven performance that made him the high point of the picture, for me. And in the end, despite the lack of layers or exploration into the characters, the story still managed to be very suspenseful which made it fun to watch. And that ending was devastating.",,Anonymous,History
War of Conscience,"What makes Valkyrie clearly stand out from the common or garden Third Reich movie is the depiction of the careful build-up and execution of a plot where a majority of the participants are engaged throughout in a zone of ambiguity where while they are fairly sure of what to believe in, they are not clear about what their role in the same should be. Apart from the clear ideology of von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), the indecision of the likes of Olbricht (Bill Nighy) and the ostensible undying allegiance to the Fuehrer from the likes of Fromm (Tom Wilkinson), make for immense viewing pleasure. In the end, this is a movie set in war where there is not a single genuine battle scene, just the air raids in different circumstances  with his troops and with family respectively  that reinforce in von Stauffenberg his belief in the futility of it all. Rather, this movie is all about strong and carefully constructed character portrayals of a set of distinct individuals who chose to differ from the establishment, but in their own separate ways",7.0,Anonymous,History
Great a movie for an audience who understands subtle,I just saw this last night at a pre-screening and it was fantastic. When I saw the recent trailer it made me think it was going to be another mindless action film but it really did surprise. Everybody performed very well and despite the cries of naysayers I felt that Tom Cruise did a very good job. Not to the level of actors like Bill Nighy and Terrence but he did perform well. The direction was great and the movie was beautifully shot. I especially liked a subtle homage to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Now this may not be a movie for everyone as it is more of a thinking man's film and less of a shootemup bang bang movie. If you don't mind using your brain during a trip to the movies I think you will enjoy this very much.,10.0,Anonymous,History
A suspenseful and entertaining war thriller,"After hearing the negative reviews, I was a bit anxious about seeing Valkyrie. However, it turned out to be a pleasant and enjoyable movie with a great supporting cast, a solid script, top-notch direction and stunningly realistic visuals. Of course, the first thing everyone talks about is Tom Cruise. I actually thought he was very solid, and after the first five minutes or so, I really pretty much forgot that it was Tom Cruise and saw only saw Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. It sounds impossible since he's so recognizable, but it happened. Unfortunately, most critics have written off his performance as 'distractingly bad,' and in my opinion, they are exaggerating a good deal; there is no doubt a lot of bias toward Cruise, and I suspect that many were already bashing his performance before even seeing the movie. I feel like this is rather unfair since a lot of critics have given the film itself negative reviews merely because they disliked his performance. The supporting cast also does a very good job, with special mention to Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson. Kenneth Branagh did a solid job considering he had surprisingly little screen time.Valkyrie is meant to be a thriller - and that is exactly what it is. The score, Bryan Singer's direction, visuals and decidedly bleak script contribute to the tension that carries throughout the movie. It is remarkable that Singer was able to keep up the fast paced suspense when we already know the ending. Speaking of the ending, this is a depressing movie and doesn't offer the glimmer of hope at the end that one might expect from a WWII movie. Valkyrie could easily have been turned into an Oscar-bait drama, but instead, it is clearly geared more toward the audience with the explosions, action and expansive vistas that are the stuff of adrenaline-pumping action movies. And there is no doubt that it looks fantastic. The visuals and costumes look absolutely authentic and might even garner the movie a couple Oscar nods.I also think that even though Valkyrie is presented more as a thriller than a war movie, it's interesting to learn about the story, which is relatively unknown to the general public, yet a momentous part of history. The movie does a good job of showing how far this small group of Germans was willing to go in order to save the country - and the continent - from total devastation.If you go into the theater looking for a decent, entertaining thriller with a great story, then Valkyrie won't disappoint.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Not Quite Lift-Off,"Just saw this movie and felt that it took way too long to gather impetus and real drama. That's the difficulty in filming something--a coup--that until the moment of realization is just plotting on paper and a lot of talk. If the first half had been cut back significantly you could have had a really tight thriller instead of a turgid first half and a slowly gathering thriller of a second half. I blame the director and the editor for this. In this case, a 90 minute movie would have been great! But once Cruise was finally on his way to kill Hitler the film really kicks into gear, and then it's a pleasure all the way. And the director, actors and screenwriter are to be given great credit for making a pro-German WW2 film about an event all too few know about today. I myself had no idea of the resistance of many of the German officers toward Hitler, nor did I know about all the many attempts on his life.

Appalling acting of Tom Cruise,"I have to start this review with an honest confession. I think that Tom Cruise is an appalling actor, with laughable technique, minute personality and no talent whatsoever. There I said it. Then why see this movie? First I am an history buff, and secondly the marvelous cast of brilliant British actors, trying their best to support a man that earns 50 times more and can't act to save his life. The movie itself is a well done, above average caper. We all knew that Hitler wasn't assassinated, but the story kept our attention, and even managed to be somewhat suspenseful. Still, this is a sad example of a mediocre Hollywood star, one of many one trick ponies, looking pathetic in a company of great but under-respected peers.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Tom Cruise out to get Hitler!,"I like this movie very much, even though for the life of me I cannot spell the title. Tom Cruise got far on his good looks, but he proves here that he is a fine actor as well. This is his finest acting since A Few Good Men. I never thought I would say this about a Nazi but Von Stauffenburg was a very brave and heroic man and had his plot suceeded, he would have been REVERED as the man who killed Hitler and ended the war. This movie has excellent performances all around (even though the lack of German accents does get confusing). The greatest compliment I can pay the filmmakers is that even though I knew how it was going to turn out, my stomach was still in knots as the plot unfolded. SPOILER ALERT, the only reason why Hitler wasn't killed is that an SS Officer kicked Von Stauffenbur's briefcase bomb under the table and a heavy oak table support deflected part of the blast from Hitler. Anyway, this is a good first class thriller about brave men who saw true evil and decided to do something about it.",,Anonymous,History

Just about every criticism they made about this movie missed the mark by a country mile. To say that a historical movie cannot build suspense because the eventual outcome is known (a criticism leveled by IFC's Matt Singer) seem almost too stupid for a layman critic to utter, let alone a supposed professional. I found myself wringing my hands several times in this movie, waiting for the heartbreaking events to unfold. I have also heard many critics raving about how poor Tom Cruises performance was...once again, far from reality. I usually maintain that tastes vary, and such variances account for some of the negative reviews, but there are so many off the mark statements being made about this movie, that I wonder if there isn't some hidden agenda at work here, an anti-Cruise bias if you will.

Bryan Singer's best flick!!!,"Bryan Singer's 'Valkyrie' is an outstanding piece of cinema, cinema at its very best. Singer, before this has mostly made poor films, including the much-hyped failure 'Superman Returns', but this time around, with a meaty and historic subject in hand Singer brings a cinematic master stroke. Based on the time of Adolf Hilter, and a conspiracy of assassinating him by his very own people, an incident that took place on July 20 1944. 'Valkyrie' catches you attention from the word GO and continues to spell its magic till its end.Pluses of the film: Bryan Singer, the captain of the ship is the true hero here, he has directed the film like a pro. Camera-work by Newton Thomas Sigel is simply astounding, background score is spell-bounding and superb production value. Performances are perfect: Tom Cruise is superb, he plays his part with ease and style. Bill Nighy is outstanding, he's simply superb in the penultimate 15 minutes. Tom Wilkinson is in form,once again. Terence Stamp is effective. Kenneth Branagh is excellent. David Bamber, as Adolf Hitler is good.Minuses: The films length could've been trimmed by 5-10 minutes.on the whole 'Valkyrie' is an excellent film, a complete sweeper. Bravo!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Valkyrie dramatically plotted to assassinate Hitler through a monotonously solid scheme.,"Operation Walküre was the last known attempt to overthrow the Nazi party, immediately stop National Socialism and assassinate the Third Reich himself, Adolf Hitler. An emergency continuity of government operations that planned to roll out Germany's Reserve Army to implement order in case of chaos ensuing the nation. Various German military officers however, were able to acquire the original plan and make certain amendments. These alterations would assist the attached conspirators in regaining control of German cities, the disarmament of the Schutzstaffel and the arrest of Nazi leadership. Yet these could only be actioned dependant on the successful assassination of Hitler.Suffice to say, as history would indicate to us, the plan was unsuccessful. However, that does not prevent Singer from re-telling the implementation of Walküre and highlighting the significance of painting various Nazi officials as morally conflicted humans. Colonel von Stauffenberg, having been severely injured during an air raid of P-40 fighter-bombers, rapidly became disillusioned with the future of a country he was once proud of. Him and various other military officials, including General Beck, General Olbricht and Dr. Goerdeler, questioned the tyranny that Hitler envenomated Europe with. And so, the proposition to utilise Operation Walküre in an attempt to overthrow the Nazi party was swiftly commissioned. This included the infamous July 20 plot, von Stauffenberg's assassination attempt by planting a detonation device within Hitler's Eastern Front military headquarters, ""The Wolf's Lair"".Valkyrie can simply be surmised in one word: solid. Much like the concrete foundations that the Nazi party believed their ideologies were constructed upon, Valkyrie's cold and meticulous approach works both in its favour and detriment. For the uninitiated, Valkyrie provides an important history lesson in World War II politics. War depictions, especially those manufactured in Hollywood, tend to bend the truth to insert some level of overburdening national patriotism. Singer, along with McQuarrie's conscientious screenplay, avoids that by embracing the history of Walküre, despite a few historical inaccuracies littered throughout. Audiences should know the outcome of Valkyrie even before deciding to watch the feature or not. It's history, and everyone should know the climactic events of the Second World War. McQuarrie precariously utilises the inevitability of Walküre's failure to embody a sympathetic motive within these characters. Culminating in a solemn third act that embellishes Stauffenberg's final cry. ""Long live sacred Germany!"".The preceding conversations of proposed political manipulation and operation planning, whilst succinctly entertaining, were monotonous throughout. The narrative's pace had no peaks or troughs. The re-enactment of the July 20 plot failed to conjure up any tension, as did the initial battalion attack. The story's inevitability could assign itself as the culprit, however it's more adorned to McQuarrie's minimal characterisation of von Stauffenberg that plagued its potential. The stellar British supporting cast, including Nighy, Wilkinson and Branagh, were able to fluctuate with their emotions. Nighy in particular was able to transition from professional stability to overwhelming frustration, all in a matter of seconds. Cruise (regardless of the Scientology protests...) was somewhat miscast, despite his profile resemblance to the real individual he was portraying. The stoic yet vigorous persona he opted for unfortunately weakened the gentile moments with his family, often exuding unconvincing emotional output. Again, the resonant third act redeems all these qualms, it just takes two thirds of a feature to connect with von Stauffenberg as a human. Honourable, albeit paper-thin. Also Hitler's portrayal, with Singer implementing low camera angles and a multitude of shadows, likened him to a Bond villain. Unusual to say the least.As mentioned before, Valkyrie is solid. Its slick production design, wholesome historical accuracy and competent supporting cast made this operation a successful depiction of rebellious Nazis. Frustratingly the central performance, one-note narrative tone and thinly detailed characterisation failed to explore the conflicting morality of military officials. The inner debate between right and wrong. Surmounting to the consequential question of ""what if...?"".",6.0,Anonymous,History
Solid WW II movie,There was a lot of suspense throughout the movie. The plot was solid though if you know a bit about history you already know how the movie is going to end. Really the only thing that bothered me about the whole movie was the fact that the main character Mr. Tom Cruise did not talk with any sort of German accent. This made it slightly less believable. I mean you would think that with almost everyone else in the movie having a German accent (almost not everyone did) that he would maybe extend his acting abilities and try to enhance his character by playing it with a German accent. Oh well you can't have it all...It is also a very educational film that encompasses many aspects of life that a soldier serving in the German army during WWII may have.Overall a good movie that I would recommend to anyone who likes a good movie even the non history buff types. (A few of my friends who know nothing about history said that they liked it after it was over). In fact those that are not aware of the ending may find this movie even more exciting then those that do.,8.0,Anonymous,History
"Certainly intense at times, but I wasn't fully satisfied like I should have been.","Let me just state for the record, that I find the Hitler era to be fascinating. I disliked Hitler's methods, I thought he was a ruthless human being, I didn't agree with his leading style, but the man was fascinating. Tom Cruise wasn't an issue for me, the man almost always delivers, the only thing I didn't like was he didn't put on an accent. This is not an action thriller, it's a carefully plotted suspense thriller, that moves slowly but surely with a great buildup to it, well some of the time anyway. My big gripe with Valkyre was I didn't get enough information as to why Stauffenberg was so intent on destroying Hitler. I mean I knew why, but I was really hoping for more emphasis on that, that's why I was so disappointed, even though I enjoyed many bits of it. The ending is not a fun one, in fact it's very powerful and saddening, it will hit you that's for sure.Bottom line. Valkyire is interesting and engaging at points, slow moving and disappointing at others. I craved more then what I got, and in the end I became only half full.

True heroes of the reich,"Well that's the phrase you'd rarely find in a sentence post 1945 but this movie is exactly about those people.

Fantastic performances, masterful cinematography, outstanding music score as well as the story that makes a difference - these are only the icing on the multilayered delicious cake called Valkyrie. There were, there are and there always will be people who are opposed to the present regime of the country; the word ""regime"" itself is a reason enough for people to rebel against and those few brave ones who stood out, went in and tried to overthrow the inhuman ones need to be known because true heroes have sadly no fame whatsoever and Valkyrie does its best to change that. Not a big fan of war movies but this I could watch over and over again; it reminds us that anything could be achieved if we're persistent, faithful, willing to change, and willing to wait too because all big dreams take time to come into reality.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Not a bad film, but a disappointment","It is no secret to anyone with a passing knowledge of 20th century history that Hitler did not die on the 20th July 1944, and so the suspense of Bryan Singer's new thriller about the assassination plot which failed on that date seems to be irreversibly compromised.It is strange therefore to report that there is some tension through the film, even though the ending is never in doubt. However, it is still a failure. There is a feeling with this film, much like Ed Zwick's ""Defiance"", that it should be better than it is  that this story merits a better film than the one it has ended up with.That is not to say that this is a bad film. The quality of the film-making is excellent throughout and there is little to complain about. It looks good, sounds good and is generally well put together. A lot has been made of the lack of continuity with the accents but, despite the fact there are occasional slips into German twangs from some, there is no distraction in the diversity and it is far less irritating than the thick accents which have become the norm in many films.The acting is very good. A number of liberties have been taken with the characters to make them heroic (von Stauffenberg, for instance, was in fact a raging anti-Semite), but there are still interesting figures here. Cruise's von Stauffenberg quickly becomes a fairly dull, generic hero (the fault of the writing and not the acting), but the outstanding supporting cast, which includes Ken Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, Christian Berkel and Thomas Kretschmann, always make the film watchable. There is a particularly impressive performance from Bill Nighy, whose General Olbricht is probably the most interesting character in the film.But the film never rises above the realms of simple, solid entertainment. It is by no means a dull two hours. In fact, the time flies by, but this never becomes truly thrilling. Perhaps it would have been better to have created more interest in the peripheral characters rather than the dull von Stauffenberg. One feels that there would have been more tension if you cared a bit more about the characters.3 Stars out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,History

Great film-making and actors make this a tribute,"This film is a tribute to a group of unlikely heroes determined to end the tyranny of Adolph Hitlers Nazi regime at all cost, and in the end they paid the ultimate price. This is a story that 90% of the world knows little to nothing about but is a story of such great importance to the eventual outcome of World War II that to forget it would be akin to forgetting the events of Iwo Jima or D-Day. From that point on, Hitler was a paranoid wreck and the already shaky foundation of his psyche had been dealt a crushing blow when several of his most trusted allies plotted to end his life. This led to a decline in the strategic efficiency of the Nazi military and to a sense of distrust amongst the ranks of the Nazi hierarchy.The movie itself is presented beautifully with strong direction by Bryan Singer. Tom Cruise pulls off the role of Colonel Von Stauffennberg marvelously and much to my surprise he played the character off with much feeling and emotion.This is a definite must see for not just WWII buffs but for the everyday moviegoer as well.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Historically interesting, but bad casting","I found Valkyrie to be historically interesting and well-told, but there were problems with the casting. Most of the people in the cast were fine actors, but the problem is that they picked some of the most English of the English actors -- people whose Englishness is central to their presence like Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, and Bill Nighy, which makes for a strange contrast when we're asked to believe that they're German.My complaint isn't to do with accents: I'd much rather actors act in their native accent when playing foreign characters than speak English with a German accent, which is rather insulting to the audience. It's that the actors they chose are so quintessentially English.Tom Cruise did an OK job, I think. But I was frequently reminded of his character in ""The Firm"".

In my eyes, they created a worser film than existed before, which means they went back instead of making progress, which one can expect.In the 2004 Stauffenberg, the leading actor Sebastian Koch portrays the character much more convincing for me than the self proclaimed scientologist. This 2008 specimen lacks depth and is too simplistic. I mean Americans get one year of history in high school, so most of the viewers will indeed be satisfied for what they ""learn"". If of course one is educated, one will be finding this film too Hollywoodean. This is why I think it is a waste of one's money to expect much from this piece.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Flawed but Interesting,"Valkyrie (2008)*** (out of 4)Highly flawed but entertaining drama centered around Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) and other high ranked German officials who try to hatch a plot to kill Hitler. This is a rather strange movie to get into because for the first hour I was rolling my eyes at a lot of the stuff going on but once the day of the assassination attempt went into effect the movie picked up a lot of steam and for that final hour I found myself caught up in the story and entertained. I think a better movie could be made of the subject but in the end I think the producers were just trying to capture a popcorn movie and on that level they succeeded. I think one of the biggest flaws are the English and British accents being used for the German characters. I understand they couldn't have the actors speaking in German as that would have killed the box office returns here but there's really no excuse to not having German accents. This is especially true for Hitler who just comes off rather nerdy here instead of the terrifying figure he really is. I couldn't help but roll my eyes a few times when he was speaking because it just didn't have that flair that comes from what we're use to seeing from him. The message of the film, and those doing the mission, was to inform people that not every German was a follower of Hitler. That's loud and clear but I must admit that the plot seems to have been watered down or sugar coated because the film plays the assassination plot rather simple because there's never a problem getting close to the main and everyone involved speaks openly about their mission. With all of that said, the final hour contains some nice suspense considering we know how the film ends. It also pays nice respect to the men risking their lives to try and end the tortures being brought by Hitler. The look of the film is very realistic but I will say the English accents sometimes take away from the authenticity. The performances are all decent with the exception of Cruise who just doesn't fit this role. Cruise is one of my favorite actors but I had a very hard time believing him in this role even though it was clear he was giving it his all. Kenneth Branagh and Tom Wilkinson offer up good performances in their few scenes. In the end I think it's best not to take this film overly serious and instead just sit back, have some popcorn and enjoy the story.

Because, most of them are shaped around war tactics, strategies and struggle scenes with blood and gun. Any other facts from this direction are common for me. Directory, Directory of photography, music etc. don't become felt strongly. Characters excluding Tom Cruise don't shine as deserving to Cast's powerful elements. Such an interesting story would be reflected to cinematography according to me. I think, the director and the writer didn't show an amazing effort and they had a simple way to create a film. One important reason to watch it, may be how great organizations contain such great ambitions,fights for the sake of leadership or willing to have decision mechanism.",7.0,Anonymous,History
very well done and meticulous re-creation of events,"I just came out of watching this movie five minutes ago, and wanted to jot down some quick notes on my immediate impression of the film.This is an excellent portrayal of the events leading up to an including the attempted assassination of Hitler in the summer of 1944.For those viewers who are interested in the history of WWII, they will find that this has been a meticulous re-creation of events. Too often, these types of movies--for the sake of ""dramatization""--obscure, ignore, or outright distort the historical record. There is very little, if any, of that here.I suspect the screenwriters closely followed the history of this as depicted by William Shirer in his excellent ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"".Too often this event has been relegated to a footnote of history. One of the things the movie tries to impress on the viewer is the incredible courage of the conspiracy members. I have read some reviews where the reviewers whine about the ""darkness"" of the movie. But it must be remembered that the conspirators knew that this was a desperate attempt to save Germany and stop World War II, and that there was only a slight chance of success. It is to the credit of the German Resistance Movement---too often dismissed by historians and even FDR himself--that they realized the evil of Hitler and tried to do something about it.Cruise is quite good as Stauffenberg, and the British actors do an excellent job depicting the German co-conspirators.I would urge others to see this movie, and especially young people. The movie has not only a historical lesson to teach, but a lesson in morality and courage in the face of tyranny. It is a lesson still pertinent today.We also need to show Hollywood that there is a demand for good weighty movies such as this, and not only for the escapist mind-candy that so often appears at your local cinemaplex.",9.0,Anonymous,History
An okay political spy historical thriller.,"""Valkyrie"" sure isn't the greatest film you will ever see, yet it's not the worst as it has plenty of drama and suspense and the plot is filled with intrigue and intense feelings to make any film fan and history buff interested. Star Tom Cruise who isn't the star he used to be still is very adequate here in this role of Col. Claus Von Stauffenberg who during his command time of WWII decides to plot an assassination attempt of the ruthless and evil German ruler Hitler. As you watch the film if your looking for lots of action you will be disappointed, as it's focus and most scenes deal with behind the scenes workings and overthrowing of a secret plan to disguise a government with the end plans leading them to Hitler. Yet any history buff of those times of WWII and those who know German times along with Hitler history will understand the film well. That said I don't want to give away to much info. Overall this is nothing great yet the plot and planning of the film's story is interesting and keeps enough intrigue and drama to make it a view for most history buffs.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Highly suspenseful and worth the movie ticket,"I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. The story was good and the acting, by all, was superb. Even tho you knew the outcome, it was still was suspenseful and sometimes put you on the edge of your seat. The theater was crowded and kudos to Tom Cruise. He and all involved in making this movie, deserve a good turn out. It made me get by book, The Bunker, out and am now reading it again. It also reminds us that many, many Germans were not like the SS and the Nazis that were involved in the holocaust. The plot moves right along and you are never bored; sometimes found my heart racing! The information listed, just before the credits, was very helpful in letting the audience know what the final outcome was for those that participated in the attempt to assassinate Hitler. Spooky how the actor looked like Hitler! Highly recommend this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Cruiser vs The Fuhrer,"Well, its finally here. For ages now much of the press has rubbed their hands with glee as they looked forward to trashing this pet-project from the Cruiser. Cruise V Hitler after all had TURKEY written all over it. Even I had a laugh as I waited to see the wee man's attempt at appealing to the greater German public after they slammed Scientology and branded it a cult. That of course is another debate all together. On to the film. Its not nearly as bad as many people had hoped or expected, some of it is rather good in fact. From what I can tell it is historically accurate in its depiction of the failed Von Stauffenberg plot to assassinate the Fuhrer in July 1944. The recreation of Hitler's Wolf's Lair and the Berghof is picture-perfect and adds much realism to the film and the direction from X-Men's Bryan Singer keeps things nicely bubbling along. The film's biggest problem though is Tom Cruise as the aristocratic Claus Von Stauffenberg. He simply fails to pull it off and comes across as a cheesed off - dare I say it, ""Little Hitler."" The role needed to reflect the Bavarian Count should've gone to someone like Liam Neeson or perhaps Christian Bale. Strange and uncomfortable casting permeates this film: the presence of Eddie Izzard as a communications officer at the Wolf's Lair is totally out of place and much of the cast also fails to convince. The best performances come from the European actors ,Thomas Kretschmann, Christian Berkel and the gorgeous Carice Van Houten who was last seen dodging more Nazis in Black Book. Sadly not enough is seen from them as the British with Cruise in-tow take centre stage. If this film had been made by the people behind Downfall it could have been so much better and as is, it remains something of a missed opportunity (no pun intended).",6.0,Anonymous,History
Terrific Entertainment!,"Valkyrie is the latest film from director Bryan Singer, after many delays the film has finally been released, and I must say that it was definitely worth the wait.The film is about the assassination plot against Hitler, formulated by military officials. The leader of this plot was Col. Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise). These officials knowingly committed treason in hopes of successfully killing Hitler.The film was superbly directed by Bryan Singer, who re-enforces himself once more as one of the film industries greatest living filmmakers. As well the script by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander was terrific. Of course the true highlight of the film was the amazing acting. The cast, ranging from Kenneth Brannagh to Tom Cruise himself, was stellar. It almost seemed as if every single character actor in the film industry was cast in this movie.While some have given this film flack for the simple fact that you pretty much know the ending before the film even starts, the film still manages to be a tense and highly entertaining thriller that not only will keep the audience on the edge of their seat, but also the ending will evoke a deep emotional response from the very same audience.Valkyrie is Bryan Singer back in true form. It is easily one of the best films I have seen in a long time, and I am greatly looking forward to seeing this film over and over again.I give Valkyrie a perfect 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,History
expect thrills and a pulsating tale of idealism but not a masterpiece,"The air is literally full of tension and thrills, also at the beginning when the first killing attempts are made. Tom Cruise is helped in his aim by a lineup of British supporting players, Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Izzard and Tom Wilkinson. The story follows an evident tradition of Hitchcockian situations, the excitement coming out from exchanges of dialogue more than from big action scenes (a few explosions in this instance). Stauffenberg's role is depicted as emotionally rousing, and that's probably the sticking point of the film; other than that, in spite of an interesting and original perspective of World War II, the film doesn't break the ranks of a good thriller.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Great Movie for History-Minded People,"Valkyrie was in incredibly accurate film with regard to what actually happened on this particular plot to kill Hitler. Of course, they had to embellish a bit on the details they didn't know about. Tom Cruise, though I'm not a fan, did an excellent job portraying his character as did much of the cast. The battle scenes were sparse but very well done, and the uniforms were very much accurate. I swear, I don't know how Hollywood does it, but the sets for WWII Germany are immaculate. Furthermore, the story is just incredibly well-told, if you've read any book on the matter.I think the reason some people didn't like this movie was that they got lost in the history of the plot -- They don't really explain who or what the SS really were or represented, and failed a bit to really explain the importance of the main characters trying to change certain directives during the plot. This makes sense, of course, if you are knowledgeable about WWII Germany or the Nazi Party, but I think this was lost on some viewers. Kids these days...If you like to read about history, war, or are at all interested in an accurate film on the plot to kill Hitler, you should definitely see this movie.As an aside, I have many friends who didn't see the movie because they heard that they don't use German accents when they speak... Are you kidding me?? First, they adequetly transition from German to English in the first few minutes of the movie so you don't have to watch a subtitle film, and second, Good Lord! Does having an actor with a false German accent playing a German character really make a difference? Remember Enemy at the Gates? All the Russian soldiers had British accents. Did anyone complain?? Did anyone criticize 13th Warrior for the same transition?",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Cruise Is Okay, But The Story Sags Far Too Much","I really wanted to see this movie. All my life I have been fascinated by the daring of the anti-Nazi conspirators -- especially the aristocratic, chivalrous Von Stauffenberg, who in today's Germany (especially in the German military) is given the worshipful adoration and veneration of Martin Luther King, Davy Crockett, and John F. Kennedy combined.Cruise never gets the chance to show us what made this shining knight shine, what made this time-bomb for goodness really tick. We don't get to see him cut loose as a soldier, machine gunning Tommies and slugging it out in the desert sands. We don't get to see him blinded by a flash of insight as a Jewish child is kicked into the gutter or an elderly rabbi is forced to scrub the pavement with his face. We don't even get to see him do a passable bedroom scene with his foxy wife.Instead we get an hour of stupendously dull plotting, where Cruise is forced to run with droopy, flaccid character actors like Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh, and assorted other Englishmen who look pathetically out of place in any uniform, in any army, at any time. The movie really telegraphs the fact that all these conspirators lack the ruthlessness and determination to fight fire with fire and shoot to kill the Nazi menace. Only Tom Wilkinson, as the shifty General Fromm, and Eddie Izzard as the well-meaning communications officer, give us some sense of the real moral complexity of the plotters, not to mention the terrifying agony of these brave men who risked torture and death.Finally, long after it's too late, in the last half hour we get a taste of suspenseful drama, as Von Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin and tries to bluff the uprising to victory even as Hitler prepares his gruesome revenge. It's painfully revealing that Cruise, working the phone banks like a celebrity at a telethon, is far more believable than he is playing the cold-eyed assassin. ""What's that you say, general? Yes, that's right, we're in charge now. Don't forget, you heard it here first! Yes, that's right, I'm in charge, because I just said so! Can we count on you for your support? Gee whiz, why not?"" He's believable, but more like a frat boy running a bake sale than a gallant officer risking his life. Charming, but not quite appropriate to the situation.One final note: watch for Christan Berkel and Thomas Kirtschmann, two genuine German actors who were both superb in the death of Hitler classic UNTERGANG. If the whole UNTERGANG cast had been here, along with the director and the scriptwriter, this movie might have been a classic too. Instead it's just a so-so vehicle for Tom Cruise.",6.0,Anonymous,History

For those who enjoy WWII history or period war films, this is an amazingly well done film that both entertains and teaches. Tom Cruise's portrayal of Stauffenberg is convincing, and the supporting cast help bring this element of the second world war to the big screen. The cinematography and set design bring together the full package.I wonder if part of the reason that this film has received negative press is because of Cruise's personal life and religious beliefs.

Another intense film by Bryan Singer,"Tom Cruise, Kenneth Branagh, Patrick Wilson, Bill Nighy, Stephen Fry, Tom Wilkinson, Eddie Izzard, Christian Berkel, Thomas Kretschmann and Carice van Houten all shine in this very interesting movie by director Bryan Singer.Finely written by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander, Singer translates to the screen and Singer never disappoints.The movie which takes place in Germany, circa 1943, depicts how the 14th attempt to assassinate Hitler has gone wrong. Then there is a bold plot to blow up Hitler in his Wolf's Lair.For me, the story really picked up and became rather gripping towards the last part of the movie. I suppose the third act.All in all I enjoyed it",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent!,"I agree with mojaverose in that it is much easier to understand what is going on in the movie if you know some background information prior to seeing it. On the History channel I watched an excellent documentary about Stauffenberg and the several overlooked attempts to assassinate Hitler and I do believe watching the documentary allowed me to walk into the movie with a much greater interest and walk out with a FAR greater appreciation. There is no narrator in the movie explaining the events so if you don't already know what's going on, you're going to have to pay attention to every word and detail to catch up on what is happening (there is not much action and lots of conversation in the beginning of the movie).Overall, whether or not you're a history buff, this movie is a must-see. It perfectly portrayed the feeling of desperation of those who were against the Nazi government and wanted to stop it. The last 10 minutes of the movie left me in tears. I will definitely watch it again.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Let's kill Hitler,"Valkyrie is based on the true events in Nazi Germany. The plot to kill Hitler. In 1944 some German officers hatched a plot to take out the Fuhrer and deploy another administration.This film is about the various intricate plot leading up to the assassination attempt and its aftermath.Although we are all aware of the outcome, plaudits has to be given to the writers and director Bryan Singer for maximising tension to the hilt.As always, Tom Cruise gives it his all, although you might think he is a little too earnest here and is ably supported by a largely British cast who either are aiding him or resisting him.Valkyrie could easily had been a cheesy and rather sentimental story but it really works as a thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Flawed by Cruise performance, but not a terrible thriller","Tom Cruise's traditional one-note performance prevents this true-life suspense thriller from being anything but a predictable, pointless exercise in hubris. Although most of the accents seem inauthentic anyway, Cruise's dull, toneless American dialect is about as sincere as Kevin Costner's legendary Robin Hood accent, without the sweeping sense of purpose. In the end, the movie is largely forgettable; given the large amount of negative publicity surrounding it and its star, this is faint praise indeed.Colonel von Stauffenberg (Cruise) is a disillusioned German officer during World War II who decides that he and he alone must thwart the Fuhrer and save Germany from itself. He quickly discovers, though, that he's not exactly alone in that attitude, as various fellow officers (played by such luminaries as Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, and Terence Stamp) have been trying to take Hitler out for some time. All they need is a good plan and a good organizer.The trouble, Stauffenberg quickly realizes, isn't the assassination itself but rather the aftermath. You can't just kill Hitler and waltz in with a new chancellor, since he does have plenty of supporters. So Staffenberg decides to co-opt an existing plan, called Valkryie, and adopt it for his own purposes. Valkyrie is intended to be the contingency plan should the Allies break through to Berlin, but Stauffenberg (rather easily) rewrites it so that one set of Germans is blamed for the assassination of Der Fuhrer, thus allowing them to be imprisoned by another set of Germans. Quite crafty.But as any casual student of world affairs in the twentieth century can attest, this isn't how thins panned out. As we all know, Hitler eventually committed suicide in his bunker in 1945, as the war was nearing its conclusion. So obviously the Stauffenberg plan was an abject failure, which sort of removes a lot of suspense. But director Bryan Singer still manages to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, particularly during the explosion that ostensibly kills Hitler (and his cabinet); you know it's coming, but it arrives so suddenly and so organically, without any good-guy slow-motion theatrics, that it's very jarring and effective.In addition, Singer pays less attention to What This All Means to the world (and Germany in particular) and concentrates instead on the psychological makeup of the conspirators, particularly the reticent General Olbricht (Nighy) and the decisive Stauffenberg. What happens to influence their plan? What happens that they hadn't counted on at all? Most importantly, what happens when the plan ultimately fails? So I have to give Singer a lot of credit here, building up some suspense when the outcome is already knowable to everyone.But the overall probably, as usual, is Cruise himself: he's simply not credible in the role of a long-serving German military officer. Cruise always seems to feel that since he's such a Great Actor, he can simply slap on some accessory - in this case, an eyepatch - and he's immediately transformed into that character. Not the same guy, Stauffenberg and Cruise! Not the same guy at all! The fact is, though, that the eyepatch has more personality; Cruise is neither serious enough nor solid enough in the role for you to believe he's anything other than Tom Cruise, Movie Guy. He even rolls through his standard two or three expressions, and when that's done, he's done.Cast with another Stauffenberg, Valkryie might have soared a bit higher, but Cruise's flawed performance is more reminiscent of an albatross than an eagle.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Desperate bravery by the conspirators,"I saw a discussion of this film by a bunch art/culture critics on a TV show. They all said the film was poor (or words to that effect). The following day I had agreed to go to the movies with my 13 year old son in the afternoon. When the appointed time arrived he checked the theatre's film schedule. Valkyrie was the only film available at that time and that he was old enough to watch. So I had him check IMDb (in an attempt to dissuade him (thinking Valkyrie would be trashed by IMDb reviewers). To my surprise it got good reviews (as well as bad ones of course). So off we went. Now for some reason I was never really a huge fan of Tom Cruise although I'm not saying all his film are rubbish  he's been in plenty of good ones and I believe he is a very good actor  but I wasn't really expecting to enjoy Valkyrie because TC was staring Anyhow the film turned out to be very good. Cruise was very good. The rest of the cast was very good. Oddly, it did take a few minutes for me to come to terms with none of the actors making any attempt to affect a German accent!. One of the other IMDb reviewers said something about the film should have been a 'made for TV' movie. But, it looked absolutely fabulous on the big screen. The thing that really came across was the bravery of the conspirators and the despair as they realised their beloved Germany was doomed and they were being lead by a man who was close to insanity. I can usually tell when a movie isn't holding the audiences attention  people start shuffle around etc. Valkyrie seemed to have the audience enthralled. When the credits came on everyone just stayed in their seats for a good 30 seconds (normally folks get straight up when the credits appear). My 13 year old thought the film was fantastic - he was really surprised when it because obvious at the end that the film was based on true events. Maybe this type of film is not for everyone but for critics to say it was rubbish is beyond understanding. Roll on IMDb reviews  professional film critics are no more qualified to pass judgement on film than I am (or any other member of the public).",9.0,Anonymous,History
I Saw the Blast,"Greetings again from the darkness. Things aren't always as they seem. Colonel Claus von Sauffenberg is convinced he has succeeded in his mission and proceeds to carry out the plan. The really interesting piece is how quickly so many jumped in to assist. There was an entire segment of the German population that did not buy into the Nazi propaganda.Directed by the great Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects), the film shows us one of the 15 reported assassination attempts on Adolph Hitler. The film is beautifully shot and flows very well. My two issues with the film are the difficulty in believing this small group of outcasts could pull this off, and the site of Tom Cruise in nearly every scene.Hard to imagine this film gathering much of a following given the star and the subject matter plus the fact that it is only enjoyable to watch from a technical aspect. The supporting cast is pretty strong and especially good are Tom Wilkinson and Thomas Kretschmann.If this subject matter appeals to you, I would highly recommend the outstanding film ""Downfall"".

The best Hitler Bomb Plot Movie I've seen.,"There's probably a foreign language (German) film that is far superior, but I think this is probably the best Hollywood attempt at this interesting subject matter. I went and saw this at the cinema, not for Tom Cruise, but because I've seen a few documentaries on the subject. This movie of course stretches credibility in parts, but let's be honest the primary reason for movies is to entertain. You want enlightenment, go read a book or watch a documentary on the subject.I'm not the biggest Tom Cruise fan, but he is excellent in roles where he is being pushed by unseen forces. He's able to create a level of tension that is believable. For proof of this, doubters can go watch The Firm, as well as the first and best Mission Impossible.",,Anonymous,History
"Sharp, Crisp and Entertaining","Saw the movie yesterday and these are my first thoughts. Good acting all throughout and for once, a movie focused on a very different aspect of the Third Reich. That not everyone in the German ranks approved of Hitler, and wanted to do something about him so the world would view Germany differently.This premise of the movie is believable. And what followed was an exciting story. Which says a lot about the movie because we know what happens in the end: but the movie still manages to create a sense of excitement, even giving audiences an admittedly false sense of triumph that maybe the good guys actually succeeded. For me it is this sense of thrill and optimism portrayed in the movie that makes it one of the better ones I've seen in a while.And while the individual performances were OK-good, it's Bryan Singer's movie. One can see some of the elements of The Usual Suspects. I repeat again, while TUS was an out and out thriller with one of the best climaxes ever, this movie's ending was always known. I do believe that adding a clever twit in the end isn't THAT difficult (no offense to TUS) but to create a drama when the whole world knows what happened in the end needs master direction, and that's exactly what Singer did.I'll be watching it again, and maybe I'll find some revealing mistakes, some scenes that don't quite add up. But it seemed like a really good movie to me the first time, and since once is about as many times I watch most movies, I'll remember this one.",9.0,Anonymous,History
F...ing  thick wooden leg table! (Screen),"The 3 days History student is very pleased by this movie and remembers why I have chosen this education at first before taking a Law course:History makes me become one with the world: my little life becomes nothing in comparison of the thousands, and help me delete my false conceptions for the truth.I heard about this attack in my class book and without any more data, I imagined that Stauffenberg was an individual but courageous lunatic. I never guessed that the coup was much bigger and there were so much involved in top levels. It's dramatic to see how those men evolved from shyness to dedication to kill the Furher at any cost, because with the end coming, they must have to try anything to avoid their heroism to remain unknown for ever.Maybe because Third Reich means pure evil, his seduction is heavy and Singer helps it: sets, wardrobe are beautiful all the more this movie was actually shot in Germany. The only flaw is the Fuhrer portraying which lacks of charisma! I have seen Z-movies about WWII with more daunting Fuhrer.I would finish by wondering why we have to wait so long for such a story? Why my french cinema which considers itself for the best of the world, didn't adapt it so far?

Amazing,Tom Cruise Gives An Awesome Performance In This Movie It's Really Good,10.0,Anonymous,History
Entertaining WW2 thriller,"The most elaborate and extensive plan to kill Adolf Hitler is depicted admirably in Valkyrie by none other than Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise, a slew of quality British actors and the director of X-Men and Superman Returns.Now I'm no WW2 history buff, but I gather the film is mostly historically accurate. I did admire how much suspense the film generated despite the known outcome. This plot to kill Germany's most demented individual was well orchestrated and very close to working like a charm, only a few mishaps and human errors prevented it from succeeding.As for the performances, the British guys owned it. Branagh, Stamp, Wilkinson, Nighy and even Eddie Izzard are flawless in their depictions as Nazi soldiers who are disgusted by their leader. Tom Cruise is neither here nor there, playing the leader Claus von Stauffenberg. He is not bad, just not very good either.With the outcome previously known, I approached ""Valkyrie"" as pure entertainment. It's always good to leave a film a little wiser about history but this film didn't leave me breathless or astonished in any way. The film is suspenseful, well made and written and is most likely a very welcome addition in the genre for WW2 buffs.In the end, what stayed with me was that it seemed likely that some higher power was watching out for the demented leader of Germany as no less than 15 assassinations were attempted and in the end he died of his own hand. It's a funny twist of fate.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent British film,"Forget all the emotional claptrap about glorifying Nazis's and all that rubbish from people with no historical knowledge of the period; this is a quality British film in essence, and it surprised me nothing I read mentioned this prior to watching it. (not that i read many reviews) An excellent almost exclusively British cast, somewhat let down by Cruise's performance (if for no other reason than he's the only actor not using a British/European accent), but at least Cruise is not continually the sole center of the films attention. Excellent camera-work, music (very subtle) and editing. If you enjoyed Conspiracy and Downfall, you'll love this film.After watching it, the first thing I asked was ""Why on earth did Cruise do this film""?, he just seemed so out of place in it.

Would Hitler himself have displayed more emotions portraying von Stauffenberg (than Cruise)?,"I find it ironic that in a movie where there is no such thing as only two dimensions (to the emotional states of the characters), that Tom Cruise finds a way to make this possible. I'm saying that as a person who has generally liked Tom Cruise, and really liked him in a couple of films. I can't remember a movie where I've thought the general acting, and story line was very good, but cared so little for the main character.The movie follows a good story line; the only thing I really would have liked to see more of was some of the communications that went on behind the scenes towards the end, to add a little more depth from a historical perspective, and to build a little bit more suspense. I also did not have a huge admiration for the Hitler impersonation, as I did not find disgust enough for his character, but came in with low expectations of being impressed with those scenes anyway.I thought the acting was generally very good, and the characters likable. Even some of the characters who didn't have any lines did a great job of displaying their emotions just from facial expressions alone.That brings us to the main character who I thought seemed more like Hitler than did Hitler himself in the film. Besides a couple of scenes where the character was obviously distressed, and found in tense situations, I thought Cruise made for a very unlikeable and very two dimensional character. I didn't even realize the lack of emotional ties I had to his character until after the film had ended. Watch some of the behind the scenes footage as well, and see if you get a very unemotional impression of him there as well from how he talks to the other actors on set, like I did. I thought that the von Stauffenberg character was turned into a two dimensional being of almost pure action and decisiveness, when in reality, that poor man must have gone through emotional distress that few of us could even imagine - I felt the movie completely missed out on this very important aspect.7 stars for the storyline and general acting, but the lack likability for the main character brings it down to 6 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing and highly under-rated film,"With the exception of Top Gun and his cameo at the beginning of Austin Powers III (hysterical, by the way), I've never been a real Tom Cruise fan. I don't ""not-like"" the guy but he never seemed to be a real draw for me. So it was with some trepidation that I watched this movie.All I can say is unbelievable.I was completely blown away by this movie and his performance. To say that his performance, and all performances for that matter, was merely ""convincing"" does not do this movie justice. Suspend the notion that all the actors had to have a German accent and this movie will have you totally involved from the opening credits to the very very end. Having a B.A. in History, I enjoy watching ""period"" pieces based on fact and picking them apart for their inaccuracies and I ultimately grade them on how much they actually get right. (The movie Pearl Harbor failed miserably. It was December 7th and we were attacked by the Japanese. Other than that...)This movie gets flying colors. The atmosphere was set so convincingly paranoid and apprehensive you couldn't help but feel that you were there in the room with the conspirators at times.

I mean, after all, this is not a ""what if"" movie.To me, this movie took forever to get going. It is extremely slow pace and that may sit well with others, but you expected to have a bit more meat than it had. But I guess this movie wanted to show you how much commitment that these guys had. Unfortunately this movie really centers around Tom Cruise's character and waste so much talent of the other cast members (Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, Eddie Izzard).It is in interesting story but the movie didn't make it so. This movie feels a lot longer than its 2 hour running time and unfortunately I think Universal has a big dude on their hands. For people who are going to think they are going to see a WW2 film, save your money, it's not that type of movie. And I knew what I was getting into, but unfortunately this movie did not entertain and thats should be the number one priority of any movie. It just didn't keep my interest.

History Skewed Beyond Repair,"This film is being falsely advertised, but not too false. Based upon a true attempt to kill Adolf Hitler and using the names of the real people who tried, the second half of the film is total fiction & the plan is fiction as well.Even though it is framed so well by the writers, reality gets left behind after the explosion attempt. The group that Col Stausser headed in the attempt to kill Hitler really did not have an exact plan what to do if they were successful. That is what makes the second half of the film and especially the scene with the attempted arrest of Henrich Himmler total fiction as this never happened.What really is missing is the prime motivation for why the group was trying to kill Hitler. The true historic motivation for this group was nothing to do with freedom from Hitler. While they wanted to kill Hitler, their goal was to bring back the Kaiser. They were hoping that by restoring the German Monarchy, they could end the war before Germany was destroyed by the evil madman.The film depicts the group as nearly pulling off this military coup and this did not happen. Every German knew about Hitlers plans for slaughtering Jews from Mein Kamp. Jews had a bad time in Europe when the war started as Stalin was sending them to death camps in Siberia just as quickly as Hitler was.The only things the film can get credit for is looking authentic while the mix of English, American & German accents get mixed, and correctly pointing out that the day of the bombing in the Wolfs Lair, that El Duce (Benito Musselini), deposed Italian was there. It also points out correctly at the end of the movie who gets shot for the high crimes.The suspense music seems to repeat itself a lot in the film, too often. Some folks might this Cruise getting shot is good, but actually this story has been done better than this film version where because of their lack of motivation, it is difficult to understand why the movement is here at all. I sure wondered about it when the film ended.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Very interesting and with historical value,"Bryan Singer's new film,Valkyrie tells the story of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg,a German army officer who, in the world war two, planned and executed a plot to kill Adolf Hitler and save Germany. As part of his plan,Stauffenberg, arranged for the internal emergency measure, Operation: Valkyrie(hence the name of the film) to be changed to enable his fellows to seize control of Berlin after the assassination of the Fuhrer. The movie shows the efforts of Stauffenberg and others,the planning of the conspiracy,the contingencies, the several attempts to actually execute the plan and so on. Stauffenberg is played by Tom Cruise,who could perhaps have immersed himself in the character a little more but, nevertheless, did a good job. The ""look"" of the film; wardrobe,locations and infantry is amazing and feels very authentic. The fact that the characters speak English is expected,after all, this is an American film but, I don't think it hurt the movie at all,we all know this events took place in Germany and what is important here is the story that is being told, and a story can be told in many languages. The interesting thing about Valkyrie is that it shows a slightly different perspective of the Germans then most movies do on this subject.After all,there were,in fact,at the time, individuals who didn't agree with Hitler's politics and all the terrible things he did and who fought against it, or in this case, died trying.For everyone who's interested in this historical period,Valkyrie is a must see, and for those who don't have much knowledge about it, here is a change to learn a little more and see a different take on some of the events that occurred.7/10",,Anonymous,History
Not a Cruize fan...usually,"Having studied and written about the subject matter, I was compelled to see this movie, even with Cruise as the main character. I was sorry I couldn't get to it sooner, resigning myself to see in only on my smaller screen. Finally I got to the big screen. The first critique of this movie in this long line of them seemed merely Cruise-bashing to me. Perhaps I would not have gone had I read that first one, except for previous interest in the subject. I'm glad I went. Despite my aversion to the star, I was pleasantly surprised. I forgot that it was Tom Cruise. Rather I felt I was watching Von Stauffenberg. Even knowing the actor and the real person's stature's were different, my suspension of disbelief had a low threshold. The movie seemed almost ""documentarian"". Which I enjoyed. While I'm only rating it a 7, that is for the general public, who may not enjoy the subject matter as much as I. For me it was probably a 9. Not a blockbuster, but these types never seem to be. One serendipity item I did find amusing were the number of actors that were also in a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, including Bill Nighy (Davey Jones). Interestingly enough there is a profile photo of Von Stauffenberg on Wikipedia, showing a strong resemblance to Tom Cruise. You can also see he was taller than Cruise. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg",7.0,Anonymous,History
One of the Greater Films of 2008,"I know that opinions will be mixed on this but I must say that Valkyrie is one of the better film that Modern Hollywood has produced. Yeah this is a movie that is trying to tell the public that not all Nazis were Nazis. And you know what? They're right.Let's face it, Germany has kind of become the model country where the ""evil people"" are born all thanks to Hitler. So you would think that, for once, a movie that portrays Germans as good guys would receive better reception. I mean, that is one of the higher parts of this movie in my opinion, to try and stop the hate. I might be exaggerating but that's probably how this film is going to be interrupted. And I have to admit, it is refreshing to see people with appearances that are usually associated with villains being portrayed as the heroes.I would strongly suggest this film to anybody but keep in mind that this is a MOVIE.

"Failed Heros Recognized: A Tour-de-Force Film About Fallen Heros -- The Film Is Its Own Valkyries, Raising Fallen Heros","The word ""Walküre"" (aka Valkyrie in English) comes from German composer Richard Wagner's opera ""Die Walküre"", the third installment of his fantasy cycle ""The Ring of the Nibelung"". In Wagner's ""The Ring"", the Valkyries were winged maidens who fly to battlefields to raise fallen heroes and take them to the great sanctuary of Valhalla. Walküre was also the code-name for a military operation created by the German-Nazi regime to be enacted if Adolf Hitler suddenly died. Although the film itself refers to the word in the latter sense as a military-coup operation, the film is also a referendum on the fallen heroes who lost their lives trying to save Germany. ""Valkyrie"" the film becomes the Valkyries of these fallen heroes.Certainly, when we think of the heroes of World War II, our minds conjure images of Roosevelt, Churchill, Patton, Eisenhower and Montgomery. But aside from the political leaders and military commanders, many civilians and lower-ranking military officers were involved in resistance movements in both France and Germany who wanted Hitler stopped. These people, many whose names have been lost to history, risked their lives to undermine the German-Nazi Regime that not only occupied many European countries but began persecuting and executing innocent people. ""Valkyrie"", starring Tom Cruise in his best role since ""Jerry Maguire"", Kenneth Branaugh (""Henry V"" by Shakespeare), and a host of notable supporting talent including Terence Stamp (General Zod of ""Superman"" I and II), and Tom Wilkinson (""Michael Clayton""), documents the last but most elaborate plot to assassinate Hitler before Germany and Austria would be devastated by the allied forces. And also save the remaining lives of people dying in concentration camps. They wanted to demonstrate that not all German citizens, both military and civilian, approved of Hitler's vision of Germany that included such inhumane intolerance.The assassination and coup attempt was headed by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Cruise), a decorated military officer who was loyal to Germany but detested Hitler's strategy and ultimately his ""final solution"" persecution of innocent civilians. Many of the events as portrayed in the movie actually occurred. When Stauffenberg loses a few limbs and an eye after one of his last military campaigns, he is seduced into joining a band of conspirators made up of high-ranking military and civilian personnel. The conspirators simply want to assassinate Hitler, but Stauffenberg points out that an assassination is not enough. A detailed military coup needs to be enacted, otherwise the highest-ranking members of the SS would simply take over the government where Hitler left off and continue the dictatorship.Among the many detailed plans in the German Government is an operation known as Walküre (aka Valkyrie in English), a detailed military strategy that outlines how the government would continue in the event of the death of Adolf Hitler. Since Hitler was absolute dictator during the Nazi Regime, there were no constitutional guidelines for succession and/or transfer of power. The conspirators who want to oust Hitler through assassination decide to use the military's own plan to take control of the the government before the SS.The film chronicles the debates between the conspirators, the assassination plan, and then the plan itself. The only minor criticism of the film is occasionally the conspirators are shown discussing their plots, sometimes only a room away from the Führer himself! Knowing that conspirators were often plotting, the German-Nazi regime would constantly watch and survey anyone and everyone for even the slightest inkling of disloyalty. Even those who were innocent but did not report suspicions quickly enough to authorities could find themselves under arrest. However, at other moments, the conspirators use coded language to indicate their intentions which seem much more realistic.Overall an outstanding and compelling film that keeps you on the edge of your seat. One of the best films in recent memory, a tragic but honorable subject. The film details relatively accurately the actions of a small group of people willing to risk their lives to stand up to Hitler and show the world that not everyone in Germany would kill or be killed without question or pause. This film is for those people outside the allied forces who tried to right a terrible wrong. They lost the coup and their lives, but ultimately they won.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Above average wartime thriller,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1944, Col. Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), Maj. Tresckow (Kenneth Brannagh) and generals Olbricht (Bill Nighy) and Fromm (Tom Wilkinson) plotted to kill Hitler and overthrow his SS army by initiating his 'valkyrie' defence league and get them all to wipe each other out. Needless to say, things don't run entirely to plan.Big name star Cruise is here sharing a platform with a host of British thespians including Branagh, Nighy, Wilkinson, Terence Stamp and Eddie Izzard, all curiously keeping their English accents despite playing soldiers in the German High Command. The human angle of the story seems to be trying to show how some members of the Nazi Party, even those high up in the chain of command, found some of Hitler's acts unacceptable and wanted to show the world they weren't all compassionless freaks. That's just a sideline, though, and the main angle is the thriller aspect, and this is executed with enough tension, suspense, style and flair to keep things running nicely. No one's delivering the performances of their career, but the all star cast list are a lively sort and keep things flowing along nicely enough.Interesting, exciting, thrilling and competent, it's not quite good enough to win any awards but it's top notch Sunday night entertainment all the same. ***",7.0,Anonymous,History

Eh,"What a waste of so many extraordinary talents! To have Tom Cruise and Kenneth Brannagh lend their talents to such a plodding and predictable plot is a travesty. We don't care about film characters just because of the historical events or the actors- we care about them because of who they are and what they do in the STORY! This is just a documentary with nothing other than the historical events to support it. And anybody with a rudimentary, or even sensationalist, knowledge of WWII history knows how it will end. There's no suspense! Fault the writer/director for becoming so enamored with the historical events. The death of the wife of one of the major players may have been an impetus for writing the story in the first place and be an explanation for the overly sentimental treatment of the events. The opening special effects are spectacular and prepare the audience for something much more substantial than what the film delivers.

A good historical film always makes you want to find out more,"As the film starts we see the oath taken by the German army as thanks for not making the Nazi stormtroopers swell their ranks. In Tunisia the German troops are battling the British and the allies. Colonel Von Stauffenberg is a young officer who believes that Hitler is a threat not just to Germany but the entire world. After suffering a terrible injury after a British attack, Von Stauffenberg is relocated to Berlin, were as fortune would have it, he comes across the conspirators who are trying to kill Hitler but have failed in their last 14 attempts. Von Stauffenberg believes that as long as they can get a plan to take over from the SS and Gestapo after Hitler was gone, then it could well be 15th time lucky. Using Hitler's own plan ""Valkyrie"", the emergency plan for the military to retain control if the Wolf's Lair ever became cut off, Von Stauffenberg comes up with a fool proof plan to eliminate one of the most evil men in history.Thus begins one of the most tense two hours I have spent in the cinema as you will the conspirators to succeed and fret at every step of the way that the SS or Gestapo may be on their heels, ready to burst through a door any second and take down each and every one of them. The mood of the period and the attention to detail is excellent, with one of the best ensemble casts of the year so far. Singer's direction is great and I for one learnt a hell of a lot about just how close we came to ending the second world war nine months early.The thing I find strangest about this film is the critical mauling the film has received. Everyone I have spoken to has loved it, found it fascinating and came away with a desire to learn even more about Stauffenberg and the rest of the conspirators, so what's with the downplaying of it. I imagine one reason is the fact that the media have it in for Cruise at the moment and so he can't do anything right, even when he's on form. I also think that the fact that there aren't that many speaking roles for women in the film is another reason for some negative reactions. Well here's the thing about that focus group folks, THERE WEREN'T ANY WOMEN GENERALS THEN! I don't expect action heroes to suddenly start shooting the set up on ""When Harry met Sally"", ""How to lose a guy in 10 days"" or ""50 first dates"", so deal with the women's roles in this film.I think the other reason that many people find a film like this hard-going is that it's hard from them to separate the Nazi's from the German army at the time or understand the sanctity of the oath they took towards the Furher or the reasons why? This is not an easy war film or one that fits into our perceptions like many of the Vietnam war pictures do. This gives us a moment in time when, if things had gone better, millions of lives could have been saved.Don't believe the gripe!Nuff said.",8.0,Anonymous,History
reserved competent work,Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is disillusioned with Hitler and the war. He abhors the atrocities committed by the SS. He is severely injured in North Africa. Major-General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) is the military leader of a coup but his attempt to kill Hitler fails. General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy) recruits von Stauffenberg who comes up with a plan to use Operation Valkyrie which is set up to maintain order after the death of Hitler. They need the head of the reserve army General Friedrich Fromm (Tom Wilkinson) to order Valkyrie while they try to rewrite the operational manual so that the SS won't interfere with the coup.Director Bryan Singer brings a solid workmanship to the production. Tom Cruise's reserved acting lacks a certain excitement. The story is told competently. It could easily be lost in the labyrinth of characters but the awesome cast is able to give each character his due. I'm also glad Singer didn't try to have the cast do fake German accents. The movie does lack the thrills but it still has a low-burning intensity.,7.0,Anonymous,History
"An Excellent, Historical, Factually, Intense, Correct, Drama - Just Excellent.","Having studied the History of the Second World War in college as well as for a media project in depth details and having known that there were several plans to remove Adolf Hitler, the Fuehrer, I was very keen to see this one on the screen from the moment I had heard about it Colonel Von Stauffenberg, whose real name is Claus Philipp Maria Graf Von Stauffenberg, a officer in the German army during the Second World War and a Roman Catholic by religion, is a member of the German Resistance Movement, gets injured and loses an eye and two fingers in a Allied attack in North Africa as he is a member of the Afrika Corp, who are on the retreat as the Allied army moves forward. But when he gets better he goes to a clandestine meeting and meets three figures, one of who wants to become the German leader by getting rid of the Fuehrer.Starring Tom Cruise, Carice Van Houten, Kenneth Brannagh, David Bamber. Thomas Kretscmann and Tom Wilkinson, the movie is directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander.Tom Cruise is natural in his role as Von Stauffenberg and he has shown the intensity in his acting in such role as has Kenneth Brannagh. The movie itself recreates the atmosphere of the time and goes on to give the audience the feeling that they are witnessing an event in history. But what makes it lean more towards to make this is that it shows the bombardment of the German capital, Berlin. Factually correct, this movie depicts the last plot that was hatched to remove Hitler, the Reich Fuehrer Heinrich Himmler, the propaganda minister Josef Goebbels and also Herman Goering, commander in chief of the Luftwaffe.This is a very intense drama that is really worth while watching and more so for those who are interested in the Second World War events.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Cruise-ual Suspects,"Most thrillers rely on a sense of mystery, that is the point of them - to thrill the audience to the edge of their seats wondering ""what is going to happen next?"" So how do you build a thriller around a story of which the audience knows the outcome right from the start? This is the case with Valkyrie, based on the conspiracy to kill Hitler by a group of his own Nazi generals, and I don't think any journalistic codes of ethics are being broken when I tell you that the plot fails. Not only that, but the film has been plagued by pre-release rumours and speculation about everything from test audiences panning it to critics writing it off before they had even seen it simply because Tom Cruise doesn't attempt a German accent. However, from this has been crafted a tense, engrossing war thriller.Director Bryan Singer is back in the territory of his breakthrough film, The Usual Suspects: a group of plotters involved in a plan in which everything goes horrifyingly wrong. Throughout his career, from Suspects to first two X-Men movies (i.e. the good ones) and Superman Returns, Singer has never made a dud, so why pundits thought it would end up being so is probably the biggest mystery of the entire film. Along with the likes of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson, Singer is one of the best in the business at shepherding an ensemble cast, and the way he does so here is one of the film's major strengths. He works masterfully in introducing us to the major figures in the plot, allowing us to tell them apart, explaining their roles and suggesting their differences and, to his credit, never allows proceedings to simply deteriorate into a star vehicle for Cruise, who provides a perfectly fine anchor for the story to centre around (say what you will about Tom, no one does defiant heroism like him).The taut and crisply paced direction is aided in no small way by the skilfully efficient screenplay (from Nathan Alexander and Usual Suspects writer Christopher McQuarrie). The film is built around the idea that the biggest plans revolve around the tiny details, and it spares none of them yet still manages to make such a complex story coherent and seem almost straightforward. However, this almost complete submission to the plot does sacrifice attention to the characters.Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg, the man who engineered the entire plan, is clearly an interesting and complex character  a career military man and a Nazi who is willing to risk everything, even the safety of his own family, to kill Hitler, yet Tom Cruise never has the opportunity to play him as anything but intense and determined. We see the group discuss the morality of murdering Hitler rather than simply overthrowing him and whether the risk of the plot is worth it with the Allied forces looming over Belin, but we never find out why Stauffenberg, or any of the other members of the conspiracy, have gone from Nazi generals to deciding to rid themselves of their Führer. Although maybe the audience's own knowledge of history is supposed to fill in those plot points for us. Who needs a ""reason"" for wanting to murder Adolf Hitler?With this knowledge of history in mind, it is perhaps surprising that the greatest success of Valkyrie is that there are still genuine twists. The makers of the film have been blessed with the fact that the details of the plot are still relatively obscure, so although we know that the bomb intended to kill Hitler did not succeed, it is the aftermath of this sequence which is the most intriguing. The plot fails at about the halfway point of the story, and I guarantee that everything that takes place afterwards will be news to you, and that despite yourself, you will end up on the edge of your seat wondering how it is going to end.For more of this review or reviews like it, visit:jacksfilmblog at blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,History
An Unexpected Triumph,"VALKYRIE deserves wider attention than it received during its theatrical release, a theater run mired by the media emphasis on the tacky behind the scenes stories of the making of the film and the character destruction of Tom Cruise. This is a fascinating bit of World War II German history that is not as well known as the other aspects of the Third Reich and it bears telling. Writers Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander have used the facts of the 15th unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Hitler as spearheaded by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) and molded a thriller and a classy drama populated by some of our finest actors. Director Bryan Singer manages to recreate Germany of 1944 and make it all look real - too real for comfort - and paces this complex mission with steady and harrowing momentum.The film belongs to Cruise who is rarely off screen. His acting is solid and credible. The other actors whose presence gives the film a sense of realism are Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Kenneth Branagh, Terrance Stamp, Thomas Kretschmann, Eddie Izzard, Christian Berkel, Tom Hollander, Jamie Parker, Carice van Houten, and David Bamber (excellent in the role of Adolf Hitler). What makes this cast stand above the average ensemble crew is the sense of selflessness each actor brings to his/her role. Even though many of these fine actors are only on the screen for moments, their contribution is so well crafted (and directed) that the audience feels as though each is fully understood as members of this infamous historic event.This film appears to be an honest, non-sensationalized view of history about which too few people are informed. As a quasi-documentary it holds up well: as a thrilling drama it deserves kudos. Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,History

Fascinatingly Accurate - In More Ways Than One,"Most people are familiar with the assassination attempts on Hitler but few people know the details of what really happened. This film provides an accurate, not to mention entertaining, glimpse into history and details what really went on. The accuracy of the film is one of the main things to commend it for. Some of the locations in the film are the actual locations where the events took place which brings so much immediacy to the film. Even the sets which were copied or created look startlingly authentic. The level of set design is astonishing. There are so many small details and colours. It wasn't nominated for an Oscar but thrillers hardly ever get nominated because of the narrow mindedness of the academy, and who cares about awards anyway.Another great thing about this marvellous film, is the acting. Rarely is such a meaty ensemble cast assembled. Tom Cruise, Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp and many more are some of the finest actors around today. There is only one principle female actor but it's a military story so one should expect this. Tom Cruise especially stands out (well of course, he's the lead actor) in a thrillingly nuanced role. Unfortunately though, the decision was made for all the actors to speak in their own accents, which marrs the authenticity slightly. Despite the opening being in German and cleverly turning into English, it is still a bit annoying that they don't do German accents. Some speak with an English accent, some American and some German. Aside from that, one has to realise it would be the first major Hollywood picture full of stars to speak with a German accent. And if they all spoke with German accents there would have inevitably been some very awkward accents and it would have brought down the acting quality.The key theme the film explores is about making a difficult choice. One of the Nazi staff has a very telling line in which he says ""We cant be neutral any longer and when we make a choice we've got to come down on the right side"". Bryan Singer constructs a fascinating portrayal of this very human dilemma and the film shows all the anguish and indecision and consequences of choices like these.Even though we know how the story ends it doesn't stop Singer being very successful in pile-ling on the suspense. The tension is electrifying as Stauffenberg plants the bomb and hurriedly tries to make an escape. You really suspend your disbelief and hope the assassination will work. You desperately hope it will be successful even though you know it wont. And one just has to sit and watch the achingly beautiful climax.",4.0,Anonymous,History

The conspirators are shown as guys who were horrified at what Hitler was doing, which is bunk. Most of them had no problem with the war when Germany was winning. It's when Germany started losing they started growing a backbone. Von Stauffenburg was no exception.Now, all that said, the pacing is pretty good.

I will give them this: They certainly knew how to (over) throw a party.,"We all know that film, in general, has its target audience to appeal to, but what I really do find interesting concerning Valkyrie is that with the twenty or so people in this particular cinema screening a large proportion here were aged above sixty-five years of age. It seems that this, Valkyrie, appeals to a larger spectrum of age, albeit for reasons known to only the individual cinemagoer: Star-name, action, drama, historical value et al. It seems apparent that this movie has far more reaching appeal than first appears. Here we have a film that centres on the attempted murder of Adolf Hitler during the latter part of WWII by his own Officers'. While Bryan Singers's film takes its part in this niche of German history, this film does not really carry itself in the manner of a war film but gives an air of historical drama.This too would apply to the supporting cast. With the international feel of an American Cruise (Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg), the British Branagh (Major-General Henning von Tresckow), Nighy (General Friedrich Olbricht), Wilkinson (General Friedrich Fromm), Stamp (Ludwig Beck) and Izzard (General Erich Fellgiebel) then there is the German Democratic Republican Kretschmann (Major Otto Ernst Remer), who, when called upon, give fine, strong and respectable performances'. Even with this flavour, the focal point is strongly on the resistance of these German Officers'. The Soldier takes on the might of the domestic germ of Hitler's right hand men, repelling Hitler's German National Socialist Party black shirted members': the Nazis and his S.S. personal bodyguards' (the paramilitary organization founded in 1925 who administrated the use of the Death Camp) and their dishonourable actions which have brought upon the face of Germany through their genocides and methods of control shame, disgust and revulsion.Here we have Germanys best, Germanys fighting men, men who have known at first hand the honour of the battlefield and what it is to make sacrifice for a willing cause, Bryan Singer has given us an interpretation into the birth, life and death of the 20 July plot of 1944. Putting names to faces, even those faces and locations here seen only for a brief, but important, moment, such as Berlins Police Chief Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorfq and the actual Bendlerstrasse (Bendlerblock) building, used as place of execution of the conspirators.Both Mr. Singer and Mr. Newton Thomas Sigel (cinematographer) gives Operation Walküre (the use of Germanys Reserve Army (Heer), who at a time of national unrest, of any description, would be awoken to quash any sign of rebellion or unrest) an arena of a keen sense of drama and tension. Plotting the death of Adolf Hitler is no after thought. We see a tight band of top ranking Officers believing in a just course, any doubt, and fear, here is reflected in the eyes of those who try to better Germany, and visualising this is only second best to the fraught realities and dangers that we see these men re- enact. There is simply no room for complacency. The risk is too high. Failure is not an option. The pace is set.The authenticity of its environment in which we are given a firsthand account is both charming in its uses of deep focus and a feeling of depth and perspective for the eye to muster gives the particular subjects' here the demeanour of what these men symbolises in both prestige and heritage and the scope and goals for all concerned.Valkyrie is a tale of pride and honour. We shall possibly never know the real men involved here: their politics, their beliefs, their traits and as the parting of the wave of time may have been distorted or lost forever, it feels and looks all the part an historical document that may be taken with a light pinch of salt and enjoyed for what it is. An exposé of the men who once tried and failed in their part to target, to slay the beast and to finally bring peace to Europe. A fitting stance that, seemingly, appeals to all spectrum's' ages to appreciate, understand and respect.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Bryan Singer and Tom Cruse do a fine job,"Director Bryan Singer has turned in another very interesting movie about attempts to assassinate Hitler.Written by screenwriters, Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander, Valkyrie kept my interest throughout and more so in the second half.The talented cast of actors, with Tom Cruise in the lead role includes Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Carice van Houten, Thomas Kretschmann, Terence Stamp, Eddie Izzard, Kevin McNally, Christian Berkel, Andy Gatjen, Jamie Parker, David Bamber, Tom Hollander and David Schofield.

Everything a political thriller should be!,"There have been some negative reviews for this so I came into it expecting it to be mediocre but it was actually quite good. Suspenseful and thrilling,t his is what a political thriller should be like. It was certainly more interesting than a political film which got a lot more attention -- Frost/Nixon. Sure, that was a stage play and this is an original film but both films about are about politics and people deciding how far they will go to reveal their leaders true intentions. This film is 2 hours but there's not a moment where you're waiting for it to be over. The same can't be said of the meandering Frost/Nixon which takes an hour before the interviews even start. I'd rate Valkyrie near the top of my list for best films of 2008. Tom Cruise is actually quite suited to this role. He's a capable actor in the right hands.

Valkyrie was a mostly compelling historical World War II drama starring Tom Cruise,"In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit that after the bombing in the beginning of this movie, I fell asleep during the talky sequences during much of the first hour. That said, when the plans of the title went into action, I was riveted for the most part. Tom Cruise is fine as the attempted heroic von Stauffenberg character despite what that real-life person suffered in his attempt at killing Adolf Hitler. And Bryan Singer does provide some suspenseful moments during the last hour. And while I did miss some of Carice van Houten's scenes as Cruise's wife, what I did see were some beautiful frames of her kissing her husband goodbye. Maybe next time I'd give this movie a higher rating but for now I'm giving this a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Cruise = Stauffenberg ; Walkürie,"Operation Valkyrie is in effect! Opened Christmas Day, 2008, was another of the World War II films, but this was different. Much different. Tom Cruise plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the leader of the Resistance rebelling against Hitler. His ""side-kicks"" include Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, and Tom Wilkinson. The film is based around the movement to assassinate Hitler and move their group into power using an operation called Valkyrie that Hitler himself had approved upon.I found this film very interesting, and a good lesson, especially for someone like myself who has never heard of the details of the attempt assassinations of Adolf Hitler. The acting was fantastic, especially Tom Cruise with his eye-patch that covered half his face. I thought it would be a distraction or minimize the amount of expression in his face, but he did a fantastic job! And, of course, Bill Nighy and Kenneth Branagh are always stunning in whatever parts, big or small, that they take in any film.As I watched the film, I was listening mostly for the writing than watching for the cinematography or other. And the writing was fantastic, and I can't wait to get some official quotes out on the internet (because I LOVE the deep, thoughtful quotes of movies or books). Anyways, one other concern I have heard from others is about the lack of German accents in the film (because, yes they are Germans, not allies), but I say no concern for them. I find that accents in this film would have distracted from some of the more important scenes. If anything, it makes the film just a little bit better.Overall, the film was great and is definitely worth the price of the theater tickets, the popcorn, and the DVD when this is released. It belongs on the shelf next to Downfall.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Suspenseful Account of an Attempt on Hitler's Life,"I'm not a huge fan of Tom Cruise – although I can understand why he's a movie star – but he's actually quite good here. He plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the German soldier who led the most famous plot to kill Hitler in the last months of WWII. It's a story that, while perhaps not well known in terms of detail, is familiar enough for everyone watching to know that the mission failed, so despite a rather dull opening third, the film does well to generate some suspense once the plan is actually set in motion.There's no doubting the fact that not all Germans serving in the German army during the war were Nazis, but the quality of noble righteousness with which the character of von Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators are painted tends to rankle a little. Had they attempted to kill their fuehrer in the late 30s, when Hitler began his policy of invading neighbouring countries for liebensraum (living room) for the German people, or even in the early years of the 40s when victory in the war looked like a real possibility, I might be more inclined to believe these men were working for a noble cause. Since the attempt on Hitler's life took place in the summer of 1944, when most strategists were already agreed that it was only a question of when – not if – Germany capitulated, I can't help wondering whether self-preservation wasn't more of a factor when it came to going through with the plot.Anyway, the film itself is a lot better than people believed it would be when the release date kept being put back. There was speculation that the reason was Cruise's German accent, but he – like all the other characters – doesn't even attempt one. That doesn't really bother me – I understand the reasons (and nobody ever complains that Gladiator wasn't in Latin). The film is filled with familiar British character actors, all of whom deliver believable performances (Bill Nighy as the vacillating General Olbricht in especially good.) Even Eddie Izzard turns up (without his frock) in a small role. I also liked the portrayal of Hitler by David Bamber. No bombastic tyrant, very little ranting, just a slight, ageing man with stooped shoulders and a slightly distracted air about him at times who seems to sense that things are slipping from his grasp.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I Shall Render Unconditional Obedience To Hitler,"Oh, swell - A twitchy, doddering ""Hitler"" with a thick British accent, and the ""Stauffenberg"" character using his glass eyeball as a calling card, toying with said eyeball as if it were some sort of therapy bead, and then, later, saluting a ""Heil, Hitler!"" with his stump.These are the sorts of ""special"" touches added to VALKYRIE's story (courtesy of director Bryan Singer) that lost this film some major points, from my perspective.With all of the attention to detail and all of the focus on WW2 authenticity that was carefully put into this film, it really annoyed me, big time, that no attempt was made by any of the actors to even try to ""fake"" a German accent.If this lot of actors were really supposed to be some of the ""greats"", then they certainly could've made some sort of effort to muster a ""German"" sound in their voices. Like, weren't this bunch paid enough to master that one, little detail? 'Cause I think that it would've surely helped immensely with the overall believability of VALKYRIE's story.I'm guessing that it all came down to Tom Cruise (who still being nothing but a talentless, little, pretty-boy) sounded so moronic when he tried to speak with a German accent, that, since he couldn't do it, then the whole deal was completely scrapped on the matter for one, and all.As lush a production as VALKYRIE was, I found, in the long run, that it was far too stagy. Way too often, there seemed to be no natural movement happening with any of the actors. Their overall actions all seemed to be stiff and unnatural, as if director Bryan Singer, had placed each one of then, just so, on his own little ""X"" on the set and then ordered them not to move, even an inch.I know that the intentions of this film were probably meant well, but, unfortunately, VALKYRIE's story, about high treason, conspiracy, and betrayal, set during WW2 in Germany, left a lot to be desired.Yes, Back in 1944 Hitler may have been the arch-enemy of the world, but the way that he was presented here in VALKYRIE, as a literal fumbling and feeble non-entity, I would've never believed that for a single, solitary minute.As far as WW2 pictures go, VALKYRIE was good, but, definitely, not great film-making.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"""Valkyrie"" had an intelligent cast and crew worthy of telling it.","I swear by God this sacred oath: that I shall render unconditional obedience to Adolf Hitler, the Führer of the German Reich and people, supreme commander of the armed forces, and that I shall at all times be ready, as a brave soldier, to give my life for this oath. Wehrmacht Oath""Valkyrie"" poses a question: How can one surrender allegiance to a leader whose ideals are beyond comprehendible? During a time when expressing opposition would result in severe consequences, Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, wonderfully portrayed by Tom Cruise, and a group of courageous individuals, defied the status quo and dared to do the unthinkable when they attempted to assassinate Hitler. ""Just remember,"" warns General Ludwig Beck (Terrance Stamp), ""nothing ever goes according to plan."" Though Stauffenberg is well aware of the impending outcome, he proceeds anyway. That's bravery.Bryan Singer's suspensefully crafted ""Valkyrie"" revolves around the events of July 20, 1944, in which Col. Stauffenberg, following an intricate plan, carefully placed a briefcase containing a bomb during a meeting in Hitler's ""Wolf Layer."" With Hitler out of the picture, Operation Valkyrie, a contingency plan designed to protect the Nazi regime in the event of a threatening disruption, would come into effect. Ironically, through strategic deception, Operation Valkyrie was signed by Adolph Hitler, who was unaware that the plan would be used as a counter attack which would mislead Hitler's Reserve Army into thinking they were fighting for his government. Though we know Hitler's eventual fate, Valkyrie never becomes a bore. Through ingenious film-making, Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men) milks ""Valkyrie's"" nail-biting suspense and delivers a gripping, entertaining historical thriller.The resemblance between Cruise and Stauffenberg is uncanny. Cruise, whose career went downhill after the release of ""War of the Worlds,"" brings an interesting resonance to Stauffenberg. Though Cruise gives a stiff performance, it's properly justified. With Hitler's Germany unleashing catastrophic damage, how could Stauffenberg, who had dear love for his country, not be grim about its eventual outcome? Equipped with an elite cast including Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Eddie Izzard, and ""Black Book's"" Carice van Houten, as Stauffenberg's wife Nina von Stauffenberg, ""Valkyrie"" never falters. Even though the cast doesn't experiment with adopting German accents, due to Bryan Singer's film-making niche, it never becomes a distraction.Re-teaming with screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie, who penned Singer's ""The Usual Suspects,"" ""Valkyrie"" flows seamlessly on its suspense. Opening with a lackluster beginning, Valkyrie's emotional grasp kicks in during its second act. Though the film works primarily on its entertainment factor, the film's dramatic intensity places ""Valkyrie"" on a higher level. These individuals, knowing the consequences, went with their gut instincts and decided to act for the benefit of the nation, and the world. It's an inspiring story that needs to be told. Luckily, ""Valkyrie"" had an intelligent cast and crew worthy of telling it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Valkrie is amazing,"I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Valkyrie definitely deserved the classification of thriller. Not one of those horror movie thrillers but a real life, real situation suspenseful movie.Brian singer did and excellent job in creating suspense. Through out the movie I was constantly telling myself: Is the plan going to work? or Come on do it already!With that said, the acting was very very good. As well it should be for a high quality film. David Bamber portrayed Hitler as a person who was by no means invincible, but as a person who, in less pleasant terms, a sick looking individual. In similar ways the joker was brought to life by Head Ledger.This movie had by far the most impact on me then any movie has ever had in terms of heroism, loss, and redemption. The last 15 minutes of the film literally gave me chills.All in all this is defiantly as must see for any person that loves the film industry. An 8+ in my book.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Does not meet expectations but still good,"Being a huge fan of Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie, I was eagerly awaiting for Valkyrie. It also helps that Tom Cruise has starred in few duds.Valkyrie ends up being a nice historical/thriller/war film but does not meet the expectations I had. Thanks to past experience, you would expect Singer to nail both the tensed, shadowy aspects of the conspiracy (Usual Suspects) and amaze us with the grand scope of World War II (X-Men). He doesn't impress with either. In fact, this looks like it could have been directed by any solid veteran filmmaker, and perhaps with added punch and flair. There are few memorable shots, few memorable scenes.Christopher McQuarrie does not elevate the story past an interesting chronicling of events. Perhaps this type of story does not suit him as well. It's still gripping but more by the fact it is loosely based on real events. McQuarrie has excelled with creating flawed, somewhat cynical and hopeless characters and making us sympathize with them. This would have been a golden opportunity to highlight the various motivations of those behind the coup, but we don't get much of that. Much of the movie centers around Cruise's characters. Some added scenes between various characters without Cruise would have added to the conspiracy aspect. Likewise, there are very few scenes dealing with his personal life. For instance, his family appear more like a background. Same with the injury, which is brushed over quickly.Tom Cruise is solid and dedicated and the rest of the cast I felt was very good. But there just isn't a script or strong lines here. Interestingly enough, after three Mission: Impossible movies that had very little to do with the TV series, this may be the closest thing Cruise has ever done to Espionnage/secret agent films. Closer in feel to a M:I than any of his movies.This is far from a bad movie. It is interesting. And the fact it is based on real events make it somewhat inspiring. But it is not the movie itself that inspires. More the thought that men were trying the overwhelming task of taking Germany in a new direction at such a critical time.Worth seeing once on rental.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Real heroes deserve wide audience,"This film is about real heroes in an heroic action that is little known outside Germany and deserves a wide audience for that reason alone. Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) and Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) never waver, and their courage and conviction are truly inspiring.But the film also captures the ambivalence of a conspiracy, because it also includes people who are not heroes. Olbricht's (Bill Nighy) vacillation may have made the difference between success and failure. Fromm's (Tom Wilkinson, brilliant as always) prevarication is abhorrent, but perhaps the most common of all stances.The wonderful coming to life of the whole event shows again the magic of cinema. The attention to detail -- the planes, the vehicles, the uniforms, the settings -- pays off in transporting the viewer into the event. We literally become eyewitnesses to history. And it is moving that the final scene is played in the very Bender Block courtyard where the real event took place.Is Cruise perfect? No. It is a shame that the actor cannot be lost in the character in the same way that he was in Tropic Thunder. Yes, it's the accent, but also the mannerisms, the attitude. Stauffenberg was a hero, but he was not a Top Gun. But the movie may not have been made without Cruise's participation and apparently the locations may not have as authentic without his help, and he does look somewhat like Stauffenberg, and he did try. Everyone else, as many comments have noted, was terrific and very close to perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Irony,"A very excellent movie. Much better than one would expect of Hollywood. Thank goodness they did not take the ""U-571"" (200) or ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) approach to history.In ancient German mythology the Valkyries (Chooser of the Slain) were beautiful female goddesses who before a battle would select those who are to die and then escort the bravest of the slain to Valhalla. Valkyrie means ""Chooser of the Slain"".There are several ironies in this story. It was Hitler who unknowingly approved of Operation Valkyrie. But Operation Valkyrie did not allow Hitler to maintain control in the event of an uprising. Nor did it allow the generals to seize control from the Nazis. Instead, Operation Valkyrie accomplished what no man foresaw, the destruction of the best and the bravest of the senior German officer corps. The Valkyries would not have had it any other way.",,Anonymous,History
Not just a cinematic history lesson,"A powerful movie. The stark fear these men felt as they plotted to overthrow one of the most evil regimes the world has ever seen was well portrayed. To fail would mean not only their own deaths, but the deaths of their families as well. It was little wonder some of them hesitated when it came time to make that call. The bit where Stauffenberg turns to the portrait of Hitler and asks ""Do you know how this war will end? The portrait will be unhung, and the man will be hung"" then turns to von Haeften, the young man he's interviewing, and says ""I am involved in high-treason by all means available to me. Can I count you in?"" Just blew my mind. I think if I had been von Haeften at that moment, I'd have run screaming from the room. A well crafted film in every respect.

See Inglorious Basterds and enjoy the multi-lingually of it! And Quentins movie is much more fiction than this one. Go figure then, I guess.

A fine effort sunk by Tom Cruise,"On seeing this film, my first reaction was that Tom Cruise's role was enhanced for the film. Last night I read the portion of ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" by William L. Shirer that covers this period, and it looks like his role was not exaggerated much (beyond the ""white knight"" uniform). In fact, the movie goes to great lengths to portray all of the major characters in the story accurately. In fact, I'd almost swear the screenplay was lifted pretty much whole from Shirer's book. (It is a very big book, and is a classic. It was published in 1959, 14 years after the end of the war.)I'm very interested in this period, so I enjoyed the movie immensely. We forget the past very quickly, and we have mostly forgotten how murderous the Nazis really were. As a result of this coup attempt, the Gestapo tracked down, tried, and executed almost 5,000 Germans, both civilians and military officers. Many of these were middle or upper class (like the characters we see in the film). It's still hard to imagine that this happened in a European state that had a democratically elected government before Hitler took over the state.As for the movie, I think its main fault was using Tom Cruise for the lead. He just leaves me cold, in every way. Although he is very good looking, I think this must have made him a total narcissist, because he never really seems to connect emotionally with any of his fellow actors -- and there were a whole lot of very good actors in this film. Even the shots where he is kissing his wife don't show his face ... which I suspect looks like a dead fish. For such a good looking guy, he has just zero sex appeal.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Historical Film Must Fill in Some Spaces,"I can understand history buffs taking people who are critical to task. This is probably a pretty good representation of an historical event. I was captivated. It's a good looking film, with mountains and forests and paths to secret places. Where it breaks down for me, the casual movie goer and non-historian, is in the great number of characters, their loyalties, and their participation in this event. If you are marketing to a large audience, you must have a little softer touch. I suppose one could say, ""You're stupid! That's your tough luck."" I'll leave that to the documentaries. As for the flap over Tom Cruise, I had a hard time with him being a Nazi colonel. I can't explain it. He's got the glistening teeth and the boyish look, and, even with the missing parts, he doesn't work for me. I just didn't feel the emotional anguish I think a Stanley Kubrick would have brought out. The characters, mostly Nazi's, sort of blended into one lump, and when the movie ends, I'm not sure I've quite got it. Still, it is big and impressive and shoots high.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Another impressive feat that the makers pulled off was that the people they cast actually resembled their historical counterparts, particularly Hitler.

One of the best films in years,"Valkyrie had a troubled past. From negative reactions to Tom Cruise in the lead to German not being spoken in the trailers, it seemed like Valkyrie would bomb and be forgotten about forever. I am very pleased to say that is not true.If you don't already know, the story concerns Klaus von Stauffenberg, a high-ranking German official who is missing a hand and an eye, conspiring to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Obviously, the plan fails and Hitler survives, committing suicide nine months later in 1945.Some people have said that Valkyrie is pointless because Stauffenberg and others did not succeed. It's not about the outcome, just like if a movie were made about a firefighter who died in the World Trade Center. It's all about the courage and bravery it takes to make that kind of decision in the first place. Those men risked everything to rid the world of a psychotic tyrant, and this film will help show people that not all Nazis were the evil super villains we like to think they were.Tom Cruise was incredible. Not once during the film did I think to myself ""Hey, that's Tom Cruise!"". He became Stauffenberg and stole every scene he's in. The other actors are excellent and convincing as well. I do like how Hitler wasn't portrayed as a brooding embodiment of evil. When the actor speaks, he doesn't growl or shout his lines monstrously. He simply talks, as you or I would. And that is very chilling.Valkyrie is a fantastic movie, and one of the best I've seen in years. The cinematography, acting and suspense were handled masterfully. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Misguided Start Evolves into Clear Brilliance,"'Valkyrie' makes a very poor first impression. The first act introduces the characters incoherently and is murky.However once the initial arrangements are made for the key events that will unfold, the movie bursts into tension and thrill with masterful pacing.Tom Cruise is a solid actor for this role, respecting the sincerity of the character. Bill Nighy highlights the fear of failure with his nerves. Tom Wilkinson is captivatingly conflicted. Eddie Izzard looks genuinely terrified of the consequences. Thomas Kretschmann gives an intriguingly tired approach to his character.It's a cold film despite it taking place in the summer, and this conveys a sense of doom and foreboding that sweeps the final acts with painful grace. It's a powerfully and solidly executed movie that is marred by its need for a rewrite for its opening acts.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A nice change from the regular World War II movies,"Although the Second World War should never be forgotten, it's fair to say that war movies are hardly big money-spinners at the box office right now. Perhaps it's because we're used to see the Allies winning in the end? However, Valkyrie is told from an entirely German perspective. It's the dying days of the war and Hitler is determined to fight until the last man, bringing down Germany if it comes to it. So a rouge group of German officers (led by Tom Cruise) stages a plan to assassinate him and arrange a truce with the Allies.Tom Cruise can act, if given the right part. Here he doesn't have to do too much. He's largely here for 'star power' value. However, it's the story that's important rather than who's in it. Despite the fact that you'll probably know the ending, it's actually pretty tense as the Germans fight their own leader and try to bring a less devastating conclusion to the war.Bonus points to the film for putting together a large group of some of the best British actors to play various German roles (and Eddie Izzard, who sneaked in there somehow - bless him).If you fancy something a bit more historically accurate (and I'm told Valkyrie is reasonably accurate) then this is worth a go. Perhaps 'Downfall' (an excellent German-made film about Hitler's last days) could even be a sort of sequel to this?http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,History

There were Nazis who understood the evil of Hitler and knew he had to be taken out.

"Better off as a ""Made for TV"" movie","First off, I agree with those critics who found Tom Cruise utilizing an American accent while the other actors are all speaking in polished British accents, a big mistake. The film's verisimilitude is compromised quite a bit by Cruise's inability to convince us that he's truly Klaus von Stauffenberg, a sophisticated Army officer from an aristocratic German family.That said, Valkyrie wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. It's basically a by-the-numbers recreation of the last plot to kill Hitler. While it lacks suspense (since the film's climax is a forgone conclusion) it does ably depict who the players were and how they concocted and carried out the failed assassination plot.Valkyrie fails in the area of character development. We never get to know any of these characters as multi-dimensional human beings. Director Bryan Singer chose to tell his story purely as an action-adventure movie. On the plus side, the movie looks like it was filmed at some of the actual locations especially the scenes shot at the ""Wolf's Lair"" which looked pretty realistic.The most objectionable aspect of 'Valkyrie' is elevating von Stauffenberg to hero status. While certainly he was courageous, he was no hero. Had Germany been winning the war, it's not likely there would have been as many assassination attempts as there were. I find it difficult to believe that most of the conspirators were primarily motivated by a moral imperative.Daniel Goldhagen, in his brilliant book ""Hitler's Willing Executioneers--Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust"", informs that von Stauffenberg's own brother admitted that in the sphere of internal politics, ""we had welcomed the basic tenets of National Socialism for the most part...The concept of race seemed sound and very promising."" Their objection was merely that its ""implementation was exaggerated and carried too far"". Stauffenberg's uncle, Count Uxkull, stated ""We should hold on to the concept of race as far as possible.""According to Goldhagen, one of the central documents of the resistance to Hitler, prepared at the beginning of 1943 by leading Protestant theologians and university professors, explicitly condemned genocide but still argued that Jews caused trouble for Germany, that a ""Jewish Problem"" existed, that the Jews had harmed Germany and that a ""solution"" was necessary that would prevent future harm to Germans.Valkyrie might have been better as a 'Made for TV' special. Instead of spending all that money about a minor footnote in the history of the Third Reich, wouldn't it have been better to focus on the complicity of the overwhelming majority of the German people who either enthusiastically embraced Hitler or looked the other way as he successfully carried out his nefarious plan of genocide and attempt at world domination?",5.0,Anonymous,History
Swap the name Hitler with Lex Luthor and you have yourself a thrilling ride.,"When it comes to World War II, there are undoubtedly a myriad of different stories to be told, whether from the front-lines of the war itself or from those left back home. It goes without saying then that such an entertainment industry which thrives upon compelling situations thriving with drama and action would be foolish not to capitalise on such a historical, iconic and memorable piece of history which was, regrettably, brimming with such qualities. Such has been Hollywood's claim for many a year now, throwing out broad examples of tales from the front-lines of war, some which do justice to the horrors of those years, some of which only seem to belittle.Valkyrie then, with its stars and creators rooted in popcorn fodder action movies at first comes off more aligned to the latter. It's sophomoric in its historical significance; facile, kitsch and watered down for the sake of telling a thrilling story and yet if taken strictly on a fictional base, at least does so formidably. On this ground I feel somewhat divided; on the one hand Valkyrie uses it's ""true story"" to evoke feelings from the audience that a film dealing with fabricated events (although, one could argue McQuarrie & Alexander's script to be more a work of fairytale than fact) would have to establish from the ground up; and yet there's also the undeniable truth that Singer and co do a brilliant job of telling a compelling and well constructed story full of high tension action and suspense. In the end, I had to let go my reservations for Valyrie's attempt at providing a historical account set to enlighten and instead imagine I was watching Mission Impossible set in 1940's Germany.Whether or not this evokes any reaction from audiences is a matter of speculation only on the part of myself, but I really can't see it irking much more viewers any more than it did myself. Granted, during the first act of the feature I was troubled with Tom Cruise and his über-Americano stature- which in turn negates any sense of engrossment within the story's supposed deep rooted truth- yet as the movie goes on and things begin to be put in place, Valkyrie moves on from caricature impressionism into an engaging form of entertainment; the historical backing in turn becomes redundant, and sure, this spoils the aforementioned pre-connection to the story itself, but swap the name Hitler with Lex Luthor and you have yourself a thrilling ride regardless of all the uniforms and salutes.So who then is our Superman- our Ethan Hunt perhaps? Well of course that comes in form of Tom Cruise under the guise of Claus von Stauffenberg, a colonel disillusioned by Hitler's war. Opening the feature with perhaps its only reel of German dialogue, Stauffenberg ridicules Hitler's war and demeans it to the point of embarrassment; there's no denying that this colonel isn't alone, and that's exactly what Valkyrie sets out to explore. From here the movie attempts to convey the idea that not all Germans were saluting national socialists bending to the whim of their Führer; indeed, there were many who directly opposed his reign and wanted him stripped of control- to free Germany of Hitler would mean freeing his people of absolute disaster in the eyes of their opposed forces. It's no surprise then that much of Valkyrie dabbles in and out of the building cascade of rebellion from those initiating the now infamous ""Valkyrie"" operation, detailing the intrinsic planning and implementation required to pull such an attempt to assassinate and cut off the head of Germany's war machine.For the most part, particularly throughout the movie's latter acts, Valkyrie tells a compelling and rigorous story of espionage and political plotting; the tension riding high during the movie's biggest scenes- some of which providing excellent visuals complementing the bubbling suspense underneath. Granted, there are many instances which only work to belittle both Singer's movie and the facts it is based upon themselves, but such moments are far and few between the greater, more viscerally adoptive ones. Cruise, who admittedly feels out of place within the feature's opening sequences, does well to transform as he does in his greatest roles, disappearing completely behind his persona to great effect. The same unfortunately cannot be said for a few supporting cast members, yet with such a large ensemble, this doesn't prove too much to put up with.Conclusively, despite a few reservations about the movie's willingness for you to submit to the script's supposed foothold in fact, Valkyrie at the very least provides a decently paced and constructed story that will disgruntle historians but please those looking for a good story. Of course there are a myriad of problems, most of which occur during the film's opening, stultifying act, but if taken with a grain of forgiveness, Cruise, Singer and co do well to keep you firmly in your seat to see where it all goes wrong for Stauffenberg and his ever hopeful rebels with a cause. More Mission Impossible than Der Untergang or Saving Private Ryan, Valkyrie is a fine and riveting effort plagued by the very historical setting to which it subscribes to; World War II it seems is a playground for film-makers with ideas of grandeur and yet Singer here constantly feels like he should stick to the pages of comic books rather than those of solidified history.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,History
Superb,"It's a great cast and a well made film that keeps you interested, because the story is so good that it's hard to believe that it's true.I think Tom's latest work really shows his abilities as an actor far more than his performances in 'Top Gun' (1986) or 'Cocktail' (1988), etc ever did. He's really grown on me with 'Oblivion' (2013) and 'Edge Of Tomorrow' (2014).Kenneth Branagh however is far too British to play a German or perhaps it would be fairer to say he's too Shakespearean or too much of a Luvvy. My preference would always be that actors have the right accents, if not language, for the part they're playing in any film for authenticity anyway, but Ken manages to stick out like a saw thumb amongst a large cast of Brits who generally don't draw your attention to their accent at all.The film appears to be very true to the time and the feel of the Second World War as far as I can see, as well as being excellently filmed with great heart and importance. An interesting historical film with a blockbuster budget and delivery.It also shows you why you should buy a handbag that stands out from everyone else's.704.15/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Respectable and rather tense Second World War thriller which manifests suspense and danger around a group of men looking to make a grandeur change.,"The camera slowly, tantalisingly zooms in on a spinning record whilst bombs are falling all around the building the contraption is in; our lead and his family helplessly cowering in a basement as the loud and proud emoting of Wagner's 'The Ride of the Valkyries' booms out of the gramophone when the rumble from another explosion pushes the needle back onto the track. It's an important sequence, the scene in which whilst down there in that basement taking cover from the very bombs designed to injury him as he figures out a way to aid those they belong to, our lead hits upon the idea of enforcing an operation; a plan that might bring about the ending of World War Two, thus saving hundreds of thousands of lives, but at the risk of his own. It's a powerful moment, one that gives our lead an idea, impetus and strength within an individual happening designed to maim and destroy. Such is the nature of the lead, showing strength through adversity; like all of those that were members of whichever resistance movement in whatever nation at that time.And from whence the thriller Valkyrie gets its name is revealed, a 2009 Bryan Singer film about the true story revolving around a certain man named Claus von Stauffenberg, a German colonel in the upper throngs of the Nazi party during World War Two, who took it upon himself to wipe out Adolf Hitler in a bid to have the German political hierarchy thrust into chaos as The War chugged into a fifth year. The film sees Singer return to material of a Nazi orientated nature for the first time since 1998's Apt Pupil, another rather terrifying drama, that time about a young boy becoming gradually more and more obsessed with a specific text in The Holocaust as themes of blackmail and the exploiting of power one supposedly possesses over another person, the likes of which the young boy had been reading of, became more frighteningly apparent.In Valkyrie, another look at the dangers or misuse of power is observed; the determination of Tom Cruise's von Stauffenberg in achieving what it is he wants so dear by way of knowing he can be in such close proximity to an individual of such infamous nature is played out, an advantage he utilises so as to put a plan of action into motion. Others are connected, a flurry of British actors curiously both hovering and revolving around American Cruise's whim, all of whom playing true to life German officials that want an end to the madness and murder as Hitler prolongs the deaths of the innocent and those serving on the various fronts of The War. They know the risks; they know their mission and they're aware of what it'll take of them when the scene in a church sees von Stauffenberg talk to Bill Nighy's general, a certain Friedrich Olbricht, for the first time about the idea of trying to initiate operation Valkyrie plus ideas about how setting out in eliminating a man is still a mere act of murder. Indeed, later on Olbricht observes that while they're doing their best to save lives and end suffering: ""only God can judge us""; the theological elements of following through with this mission made aware.Cruise's von Stauffenberg is a battle scarred man, weary of the war and an individual with experience of the front line when an attack on his desert troops in Tunisia by an American Flying Tiger fighter plane leaves him without a right hand and a left eye. His wife is Nina (van Houten), her and their children those whose lives we feel are in greatest danger when he is away and indulging in his plans; here Singer using the innocent lives of von Stauffenberg's family to act as representatives for those of the greater nature of who'll be saved if the plan succeeds. One scene sees von Stauffenberg attempt to call home by way of the telephone, but recent bombing has made communication difficult as von Stauffenberg's situation becomes increasingly precarious. He places the phone down and it hangs ominously on the receiver, teetering as if on a cliff edge; rocking back and forth as a photograph of his family stare back at us with the phone in the foreground: the outcome of their situation remains unanswered and certain fates of the von Stauffenberg family remain in the balance as the phone continues to rock as if to dramatically become unhooked at any moment.The film covers his gradual infiltration of Hitler's Nazi party higher members, and his consequent invitation to the heavily fortified Wolf's Lair, located deep in rural Germany, in which the strike will eventually occur; an idea met with some disdain from certain people early on, particularly Tom Wilkinson's Friedrich Fromm, when Singer applies a number of profile shots of men facing each other in a showing of anger, disagreement and confrontation. His direction is taut and punchy, taking a true story of which few will have heard of but mostly all will know the result of within seconds of it being detailed, the film's expositional tidbits from fully grown men explaining plans and complicated political procedures and agendas to one another harmlessly inter-cutting with the pot-boiling and execution of this plan to leave an awry suitcase in a dangerous place. The key to the drama is not knowing the outcome of von Stauffenberg and several of his cohorts, nor how it was they went about dealing with the situations they created. Singer's treatment of the material in that punchy, rapid fashion renders it accessible for more mainstream audiences without ever really degrading it or exploiting it for cheap entertainment's worth. The film is a tight and focused effort, involving in its own right and efficient in retelling a story of failure that needs not be forgotten.",7.0,Anonymous,History
the plot actually made sense.,"I remember when this movie was in theaters and it was getting a lot of bad reviews. I just figured it was another role in which Tom Cruise is totally unbelievable. And the story would be hard to follow. Well, Cruise was OK, and the story was easy to follow. It is about a group of Germans that want to assassinate Hitler and take over Germany to sign a truce with the Allies. They don't want to see Europe destroyed.Cruise plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg whom is leading the attempt on Hitler's life. He's got a lot of convincing to do in order to get other officers to go with the plan because they know if it fails, it will be considered treason. Even when the plan seems to go as planned, the other accomplices are still hesitant to go forward with the plan.FINAL VERDICT: It's a little too long but I thought it was easy enough to follow. If you find World War II interesting, I'd recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A great, well-researched movie","(This is one of the best-researched movie on WWII. Superb, accurate details. I especially liked the faithful reproduction of Hitler's mountain retreat Bergof. The outside and interior were exactly like the real thing.) The German people had made a pact with the devil, even though they did not know it at the time. Belatedly they realized what they had done, by which time it was too late. In retrospect, even if they succeeded in killing Hitler, I doubt that it would have been the end of the story: Goering, Himler,Goebels and other Nazi henchmen almost certainly would have put down the coup, with or without Hitler. The Nazi apparatus was too much entrenched to be dismantled simply on account of Hitler's death.....",9.0,Anonymous,History
Valkyrie flies high,"It is no small feat on the part of director Bryan Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie that 'Valkyrie' manages to keep increasing the tension as it goes despite the fact that the audience already know the outcome.'Valkyrie' is artfully directed and beautifully shot. The costumes look authentic, and it eschews CGI cheats in favor of the real thing. Planes are real. Buildings are real. As a result, you become immersed in this place and time.The cast is uniformly excellent. Cruise and the bulk of the non-German actors wisely avoid attempting accents. The anachronistic result takes some getting used to, but ultimately I believe it allows them to concentrate solely on their performance.If you're looking for a taught thriller, and a bit of a history lesson, 'Valkyrie' is a film you must watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Very good,"Great production values, historical accuracy, and fine acting can be found in ""Valkyrie,"" a 2008 film starring Tom Cruise, Terrance Stamp, Tom Wilkinson, Kenneth Branagh, and Eddie Izzard. Tom Cruise played Claus von Stauffenberg, and one of the actors in a small role is actually von Stauffenberg's grandson. In the movie, Claus' wife Nina (Carice von Houten) is pregnant with the actor's mother.There's no point in going through the story - it was one of something like 15 plots to assassinate Hitler, and the third try for von Stauffenberg,a man from a well-known family and a strict Catholic who never became a member of the Nazi party.Two points, both referenced in a review on this site. The reviewer who wrote that kids walked out of the movie saying they were surprised by it because they thought Hitler was going to die - shame on their teachers. It reminds me of the review of ""13 Days"" on this site that said the Kenny O'Donnell character, one of Kennedy's most important advisors, played by Kevin Costner, was fictional. Right, and they used White House transcripts and just stuck him in there. It is awful, I agree.The second point, referenced by the same reviewer and undoubtedly by others, was about the accents. I'm going to disagree on that point, though I get what he was saying - everyone should have been British or American, not some of both.The acting rule is, when people are in their native country, such as Germans in Germany, it's assumed they're speaking their own language, not English with an accent. Therefore, one doesn't need an accent. As far as having both Brits and Americans in the cast, I refer you to ""Das Boot"" which was in German, but some of the actors were from Austria, some of them were from varying parts of Germany - in short, lots of dialects. So to have people speaking English in a movie where there are different accents is really quite realistic.Though, if you know anything at all about history, you know how this movie ends, it's still very suspenseful. I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise - I find his acting very external most of the time - but he does okay, he isn't afraid to surround himself with excellent people, and his makeup is perfect. I thought the film looked authentic (though black and white is always better for films set in the '40s), and, from what I've read, historically right on, including the big scene where von Stauffenberg puts his plan in motion.Someone else commented that Americans can't understand the enormity of what von Stauffenberg was planning, and therefore, the film doesn't work, but again, I disagree. As a viewer, I certainly felt the terror and the enormity of the plan. One had to be really desperate to agree to it. And plenty of Germans were.",8.0,Anonymous,History

No cruise for Tom,"This is certainly a tale worth telling - the 1944 unsuccessful attempt on the life of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler by a group of dissident army officers centring on the aristocratic Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. Furthermore the director Bryan Singer has an exciting record with work including the first two X-men movies. And visually it looks good, being made at Germany's Babelberg studios (which I have visited) with much of the action centred on the Nazi Army Ministry (which again I have visited - it is now a Museum of the Resistance to the Nazis).The film opens well and, after a dullish section, finishes strongly but that ""Valkyrie"" fails is primarily down to the poor casting. There are some fine British actors on show, including Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson and Terence Stamp (although it's hard to take comedian Eddie Izzard too seriously), but the short scientologist and American Tom Cruise as the tall, cultured German von Stauffenberg does not work at all.",,Anonymous,History
Tom Cruise Plays One Hotsy-Totsy Nazi,"Had a better actor than Tom Cruise been cast in the lead role, ""Valkyrie"" might have gone in some interesting directions. But it's Tom Cruise we get, and so ""Valkyrie"" ends up being a modestly exciting action film that staunchly resists the impulse to be anything special.Cruise plays a German officer with anti-Hitler sentiments, who leads a covert operation to assassinate the dictator and stage a coup in the last days of WWII. The film is based on a true story, but take that for whatever it's worth. Director Bryan Singer, of ""The Usual Suspects"" fame, keeps things moving along at a clip, but all of the period detail and pretensions to historical accuracy can't obscure the fact that this is just routine Hollywood action fare. Any potential the screenplay might have afforded to draw parallels between the ruthless Fuhrer and Cruise's single-minded idealist are tossed aside, and the film decides instead to treat Cruise unambiguously as a fallen hero. Makes the film go down smoother perhaps, but also makes it much less interesting.The supporting cast is a who's who of British actors that includes Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh and Tom Wilkinson.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,History

"""Valkyrie"" is not intended to be a character study, but a thriller. And the great merit of Bryan Singer's direction is exactly managing to maintain this tension until the end","Directed by Bryan Singer (back in a minor role after the mega-production ""Superman Returns"") from a screenplay by Nathan Alexander and Christopher McQuarrie (who previously collaborated with Singer on the excellent ""The Usual Suspects""), ""Valkyrie"" he already demonstrates his concern for details from the first minutes of projection: Stauffenberg begins narrating in German what he writes in his diary, while the English voice slowly overlaps the previous one, making the origin of the characters and the story clear to the viewer. It is a somewhat unnecessary resource, but interesting and honest on the part of Singer, who shows respect for the audience.The concern for details, by the way, is not limited to that: it is fascinating to follow the recreation of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. Despite the German government's denials of location shooting, Singer and his team manage to bring a high tone of authenticity to the film by building sets such as the SS headquarters and its dozens of flag poles, the Wolf's Lair, Hitler's private home and even a pool with a huge swastika in which the leader of the Reserve Army practices his swim. This care with the recreation of the period helps to transmit the atmosphere of ostentation characteristic of the Nazi government, guaranteeing a high degree of verisimilitude to the production. At the same time, the script presents the plan extremely effectively. Even though he doesn't waste much time on his exposition, the explanation and the unfolding of the narrative never leave the viewer in doubt about what is happening and what the conspirators' step by step is - an important achievement by Singer and his screenwriters, which makes the audience never tires of the story. On the other hand, Valkyrie suffers from not dedicating a few extra minutes to a crucial point: the formation of the group. How and in what ways those top officials came together to conspire against their greatest leader is a question that remains unanswered by the audience.The script's big problem, however, is that it doesn't seek a more in-depth or complex portrayal of its characters. From what is presented by Singer and his writers, all the conspirators could be summarized in the same way, practically without any differentiation: pro-German and anti-Hitler officials. None of their personalities are elaborated or developed with care and, if they don't seem just caricatures, this is almost entirely due to the talent of their interpreters, who do their best to transform the script's shallow characters into figures, at least, human. This is the great highlight of the work of actors like Bill Nighy, Terence Stamp and Kenneth Brannagh, who, even without more qualified material at hand to develop their characterizations, are effective in their performances. The same happens with Tom Cruise, whose Colonel Stauffenberg is nothing more than a man in love with his country and willing to sacrifice himself for it. Even so, the star, who adopts an almost expressionless posture, is efficient in his minimalism: it is easy to notice the nervousness on Stauffenberg's face when he leaves the bunker after the attack or the feelings when he is reunited with his family.The real story of ""Valkyrie"" is much more complex than what is presented in this film, which only presents the general outlines of the conspiracy and always through Stauffenberg's perspective, however, we have to accept this summary of the facts because we are not before a documentary, but rather before a thriller whose main objective is to present a story filled with suspense and tension that captures the viewer's attention. But the biggest problem here lies precisely at that point, because despite only presenting the juiciest parts of the fateful operation, this long one fails to instill a tense environment around the advances and retreats of the conspiracy. For two hours, the film is limited to retelling a story widely known to the public, without giving it a significant amount of emotion that makes it appealing from a socio-psychological point of view. This latent absence of emotion and action undermines the entire narrative concept of the film, which is limited to the reporting of facts in a dry and impersonal way, something that immediately creates too many similarities with a historical documentary that only aims at the concrete investigation of the facts. . It would be expected that a film of this genre would give greater priority to the human side of the story, but that did not happen.At its core, however, ""Valkyrie"" is not intended to be a character study, but a suspenseful thriller. And the great merit of Bryan Singer's direction is exactly managing to maintain this tension, even if the viewer already knows how the plot will end - anyone with the slightest knowledge of History knows the result of the attack. Singer builds his film on a growing nervousness, in addition to doing very well in carrying out crucial scenes (the sequence of the attack, for example, is a real masterpiece). All of this makes the audience sometimes forget what they know beforehand and find themselves immersed in the narrative proposed by the director. Hence, Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander's script tries to create suspense as to what will happen to the character's family, but they have so little screen time that it's impossible to get involved with this subplot. In this sense, the beautiful and talented actress Carice van Houten, who lives the protagonist's wife, is the one who suffers the most, since we never quite understand the nature of the relationship between Stauffenberg and his wife. It even ends up seeming a little too ""cold"" for the audience, complicating the viewer's involvement in the protagonist's desperation to know how his loved ones are doing (something mentioned several times in the third act of the film), since they barely appear.If there are small flaws when it comes to telling the story, giving even little information about von Stauffenberg's past, the same cannot be said about History. It is visible on the screen all the concern of Singer and his team with the impeccable reconstruction of costumes and sets, the result of a lot of study and work on the part of the production, mainly the Art Direction. The historical portrayal created by the production design well explores the very tight spaces at a certain point in the plot, mainly because much of the film takes place indoors - whether in the plans for the attack, in the family moments in a bunker and even in the attack itself. . The way in which Singer applies the bureaucratic formality with which the soldiers interact and pass each other is very valuable, to compose the montage and the most personal scenes of the film. In a moment of farewell between Stauffenberg and his wife, played by Carice Van Houte, the camera stays on the back of the protagonist's head, who sees his family leave by car, his wife and 3 children - the scene is already a memory. The character is already on a plane heading towards a meeting with leaders where he will attack the Führer.As the car goes out of focus and moves away, we only hear the plane's turbines, further ahead the car stops and the camera moves slowly and horizontally, from right to left, his wife gets out of the car, who gives him a kiss from farewell before the dishonorable (betraying your leader), but necessary, mission to save the country. The farewell to the family and the teary eyes of the wife who returns for a brief moment represent the break with the dream of what this attack could turn out to be, bearing in mind that after that moment, reality also comes with the mission. The joint failures of coincidences and relapses of various parties that did not abandon Hitler lead the opposition group to failure. The harrowing agony of seeing the plans go down the drain one by one is enhanced by an ending that returns to this memory, to the moment when anything could happen.Bryan Singer, who despite managing the plot with elegance, cannot avoid some slips, many of which are provided by the script. Despite the fact that we are in the middle of Nazi Germany, and in the middle of a secret military action - that is, a cold environment in which everything should be rigidly calculated - the film occasionally exaggerates in sentimentality, playing for audiences it should avoid. Thus, we know in a simple way the hero's family, his exploits, impulses and sufferings, all in the sense of identifying with him. But who wouldn't be sympathetic to someone who wants to put an end to the greatest genocide of the last century? The director really tries to imbue the protagonist with an extremely American ideal, in which he dreams of the sovereignty of a ""true"" Germany and that everything that happened at the time of the War is a deviation from this path, as if there really was a path to follow. That moral compass may turn out to be the film's weakest aspect. Tension really is the aspect that can be achieved at certain times, but the motivation given by Christopher McQuarrie's text never really explores the true demons within these characters who led forces that massacred part of Europe for years. As if there were such a thing, McQuarrie makes those who died in an attempt to ""save"" the country from Hitler's hands the ones who really carried the spirit of Germany.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Hitler's Death???  Although we know the truth... Suspense...,"When I saw the trailers of this movie that was coming, I had no doubts that movie was going to be Very Good or at least good. Why? Because the great director, Brian Singer and the actors that were chosen. Also the Academy Award winner Cristopher McQuarrie was an incentive to see the film and we see his marvelous work in it. My point is: We know Hitler die in 1945, not in 1944 and that his death was due to suicide, not to an assassination. So, we maybe expect a boring movie with only a little suspense and a lot of historic dates and facts. But, in ""Valkyrie"", the thing is too different. Until the final we forget all we know about the World War II. We really believe Hitler's going to be murdered by that plot against him and we learn quite a lot of this plot in its context. That's the true value during all the film. We are gaining suspense and more suspense... And, in the end, while getting out the cinema, we realize that we saw a very dynamic/entertaining movie with action and uncertainty, with history involved.

It gets a bit slow in first half but does step on the gas in second half. Maybe because of a great cast, Cruise doesn't get to do a lot really.

All the intensity and suspense I could handle,"""Valkyrie"" was about all the intensity and suspense I could handle. How much more intense can you get than a small band of German officers plotting to kill Adolph Hitler? You know it won't be easy and carries a high risk of failure ending in your own death and possibly even your family's death as well.Tom Cruise played Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, an officer in Hitler's army. From his introduction we can tell he's not entirely satisfied with Hitler's war. After losing a hand, an eye, and a few fingers during a North Africa operation, he was promoted to chief of staff of the reserves. This position put him into close contact with the Fuhrer played by David Bamber. When he was recruited by the small secret band of conspirators he was more than happy to join and he proposed the bold idea of assassinating Hitler. It was the only way to accomplish a coup in any case. Any talk of taking over the government while Hitler was still alive was a waste of breath.Stauffenberg would take the lead on planning and execution. Even with one hand and one eye he was determined to assassinate Hitler and reclaim the country from the Third Reich. This movie was incredibly intense and probably a good PSA for Germany because it reminds, or informs, people that not every German was behind Hitler and his campaign. This was the first movie I'd ever seen that showed a concerted effort by high ranking German officers to do the right thing which made this movie both exciting and enlightening.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Bryan Singer surprises by making a war movie with few Hollywood clichés.,"The July plot of 1944 is the focus of Bryan Singer's attempt at a US-made war movie about the desperate attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler in the face of German defeat in World War II.The main character and the mastermind behind the plot, Colonel von Stauffenberg, is played by Tom Cruise, in a bit of a surprising casting choice. Though Cruise is no stranger to historical films (The Last Samurai for example) the part of von Stauffenberg is a very complex man. After all, his true motives are clouded in mystery.So does Cruise pull it off? Not really. The performance is decent, but if you compare with other performances in similar movies like Adrien Brody's pianist, or Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in Schindler's List. I suspect that the filmmakers know Cruise's limitations as well, since they have hired a stellar supporting cast including Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy and Terence Stamp.Nevertheless, this is a surprisingly solid effort, and one of the better American war movies made in the 2000s. Since Americans are not really involved, the viewer is spared the usual patriotism and flag-waving so common in American war movies, instead the film focuses all-in on von Stauffenberg and his plot. I think the movie looks good, has a good pace and keeps you interested all the way even if you history buffs already know how it will end.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Cruise does not convince as a German aristocrat or officer,"I was talked into watching this movie and unfortunately I sat through it. Of all the movies I have ever seen about WWII, this one was the least convincing. None of the actors gave me the impression of being German. And Cruise as Stauffenberg was completely unconvincing as a German aristocrat of that time. I had seen the Reader before I saw Valkyrie and though I regretted that they chose non-German actors too, I very much enjoyed that movie and found it a good representation of the time and people I grew up with.I have a hard time understanding how anybody could find this movie interesting, I thought it was boring from the beginning to the end.",1.0,Anonymous,History
admirable   work,"the subject is a great challenge. because the story is well known . and the expectations to have the most inspired adaptation on screen is the first step. the virtue of entire team of Valkyrie is to do a real surprising film. precise, correct, nuanced, impressive. not the story of a man and his followers but the construction of an idea. the atmosphere of Nazi Germany, the motivation, the family's support, each dialog and each move, the smell of the war and the force of an ideal. and, sure, Tom Cruise in a role who remains confirmation of his talent and hard work. a film who is a splendid homage to the Resistance and, in same measure, a profound useful portrait of a fight under the dictatorship regime.",,Anonymous,History
Reliving An Important Implication,"There were a lot of Critics that Blasted this and Their Analysis tended to Focus on Things like the ""miscasting"" of Tom Cruise or the English Accents so far Removed from Germany that a Buzz Bomb might be needed to make a Connection.While these are Valid, if overrated, Criticisms, the Heart of the Movie is taking Us to a Real Life Event that had Global Implications and Placing Us among the Co-Conspirators that were in the most Hostile of Environments. We are there and if They Spoke German would that make the Story or the Tension any more Authentic. Think Not. This is, after all, a Movie.Perhaps these Critics would have them Shake the Camera more and speak in hushed, mumbled tones to make it ""seem"" more ""real"". Forget them, Cruise and the rest of the Cast are Fine as is Director Bryan Singer in His approach at Realism through Props and Costumes.The Tension is Muted somewhat, because the Audience knows that ALL Fifteen Attempts to Assassinate Hitler Failed, although any Movie about WWII is given that Conceit. It is quite Tense and the Place and Time are Accurate, as is this Recreation of the Final Inside Job to get rid of a Tyrannical and Terrifying Dictator.That would, in the End, take more than a Comparatively Small Group of Germans who were Determine to Prove that there was more that just a Little Opposition to the Way Things Were.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Fine drama,"A short time ago, I watched a fine New Zealand made drama called ""Until Proved Innocent"". A good story, well told, about a man in jail for a crime he didn't commit. It's real potency though, for me, was undone by the fact that I knew the outcome. It was all over the news. Couldn't help it. There's nothing the filmmakers can do about this of course, and not everyone will be bothered about knowing the ending. In this instance, I suppose, it was all about the means, rather than the end.Many a drama is let down, isn't it, by giving the game away too early and a great movie can fall off the rails in the final twenty minutes. Can I think of a good example. 'course not, but they exist, and the point here is, happily, Valkyrie is not one of them.It tells the story of an assassination attempt on German leader Adolf Hitler in 1944 bu a group of patriotic nationalists (not Nazis) fearful that their Fuhrer will irrevocably destroy not only their homeland and it's people but Europe as well (if he hadn't already).Not everyone will know Hitler's eventual fate in a bunker 8 months after the events in Valkyrie took place. and for those, the dramatic effect will be amplified. I knew the end and it didn't matter at all. What I didn't know how we were going to get there. Here, it is all about the journey. The plot, the players, the setbacks, the failure, the fallout and finally the fates of those involved. Like a rail trip through the alps. So much to enjoy en route.And just where ""Until Proved Innocent"" lacked real dramatic thwack, Valkyrie has enough tension to press the most relaxed individual into breathing exercises.Some of the lead performances teeter on the edge of melodrama, but this is a minor quibble at most. Tom Cruise is fine, but he is of course, Tom Cruise. Not his fault, and as usual, he does deliver the goods, but it does make a portrayal of German officer Colonel Stauffenberg more difficult to grab in a film of this dramatic ilk. Wilkinson, Stamp and Branagh do what is required, but the real stars are the supporting cast whose various turns evoke great sympathy of people torn between duty and honour in crazy times.",8.0,Anonymous,History
good effort,The story is fascinating and you feel the genuine frustration at the end - if they were all going to die why didn't one of them just shoot Hitler himself? Tom is better than usual - he avoids the million dollar smile. He still is a little bit all American but at least he didn't try to fake a German accent - that would have been a disaster.Kenneth Branagh has been playing a lot of Nazis but I don't think he is very convincing - he doesn't have an evil look. He is more like a milkman or a baker. Other supporting cast members are better.There was an earlier Brad Davis version which isn't as good as this called the Plot to Kill Hitler if you want to compare.,7.0,Anonymous,History

Tense,"A rare modern true story of ww2 that captures the feeling of being there that many war films fall short. Tense, brave, heroic, unbelievable!",10.0,Anonymous,History
The story survives some ordinary direction,"The Stauffenberg plot was an attempt to assassinate Hitler, size power in Berlin, and end the war, and in 'Valkyrie' (which was the code name for the second part of the plan), a largely British cast (aided by Tom Cruise) attempt to tell the story. The scheme was well-planned, unlucky, and had it succeeded, many lives might have been saved. But Bryan Singer's movie suffers from some problems. Stauffenberg's heroic qualities are maximised (he's presented as the bravest, and furthest-sighted, member of the conspiracy, as if being the one who actually planted the bomb was not enough); and the complex motivation of German rebels against Hitler is simplified into anachronistic moral revulsion (which is not to say that the plotters didn't indeed think Hitler evil; but their view of the world was almost certainly a different one from the conventional contemporary judgement on the Nazis, which is how their thinking is represented here). There's some unimaginative direction as well: how many shots of a man in uniform throwing a cigarette butt on the ground does one movie need? Yet the natural power of the story is too great to be completely ruined by one director. These men were attempting to take a life, risking their own (with unknowable odds), and attempting to save millions. When the film ends with a quote from the German resistance memorial, it's hard not to be moved.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A very good movie,"I am always surprised to learn how little I know. I knew there were murder plots against Adolf Hitler during WW II, but I did not know that there were large conspiracies against the evil dictator and that there was an attempted coup after Von Stauffenberg's (Tom Cruise) attempt to kill the Nazi leader. This is a good movie and like with ""All The President's Men"" and ""Apollo 13"", knowing the result of the action before seeing it did not diminish my enjoyment. Cruise and cast do not employ German accents (a few actors like Tom Wilkinson sport British accents) but they are believable as WW II era German officers. The best thing about this fine picture occurs after the bomb attempt when Von Stauffenberg and his colleagues attempt to pull off a coup and topple the Nazi regime before it destroys all of Germany.

Director Bryan Singer's ""Valkyrie"" is not more than a modest adaptation of true story events on German Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg's assassination attempt of Adolph Hitler during the height of World War II. Operation Valkyrie, is the name of the plan that used the Reserve Army to keep amongst the Germany country should anything disrupt communications from Hitler, or should Hitler be killed. It should have been titled ""Fuehrerkillrye"". Colonel Santa Claus did have some elf helpers (I mean other German conspirers) in his ""Bye Hitler"" assassination attempt including: General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy), Ludwig Beck (Terence Stamp), and other general German Hitler Haters. Singer orchestrates the ""Kill Hitler"" tune synchronic at times; but at others, it was lost in key with its complex ""hard-to-follow"" plot. Tom Cruise's starring performance as von Stauffenberg was commandable, I mean commendable, but misfired at times with its monotonous expressions. The supporting acting performances from Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Izzard, Tom Wilkinson, and the aforementioned Nighy & Stamp also failed to kill me with thespian excellence, even though I am giving these acclaimed actors the benefit of the doubt because they were given such a convoluted script. Not to say that Christopher McQuarrie's script wasn't sporadically engaging, but most times it was blown right over my head and also of most general moviegoers.

What a Surprise!  Fantastic Film!,"I was initially extremely skeptical due to the film's negative reception from film critics. I was also extremely skeptical of Tom Cruise, not to mention the film itself. I was completely turned off by the multiple times this film's release date was bumped back. This is surely a sign of a struggling, failing film, right? No. I am pleased to report that the film was absolutely fantastic. It completely delivered and left me satisfied - and thinking - for days after the viewing.The supporting cast is fantastic - many of the actors are actual Germans who act in German film (see ""Downfall,"" etc.). Tom Cruise's performance is potent and believable. All of the characters seem to ""just work"" on screen together. The characters and the performances all seem to contribute to an unrelenting sense of tension throughout the film.Although the outcome of the plot is well known, I found myself clenching my fists and cheering for the ""good guys"" throughout the entire film. You cannot help but find yourself identifying with the emotions and tensions on screen. There are many points during the film where the tension becomes almost too much to bear. It's times like these when you know you've found a good film - a good thriller - and a good drama. The film delivers fully in every aspect.The film even delivers in the historical accuracy arena - it is obvious that much work went into portraying the story in a historically accurate light. If you're a nitpicker, you're bound to find inaccuracies in any film; however, if you're a history buff that enjoys an excellent reenactment with a nice mix of drama, this film is for you.I would ignore the critics on this one - I think Tom Cruise has left a sour taste in their mouths. Instead, give this film a try and I promise you won't be disappointed.Valkyrie is a well-rounded, tense drama that leaves the viewer thinking long after the film is over. This may be the film that revives Tom Cruise's career. It certainly is an excellent World War II film that can stand up there with the best in the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Ich bein ein gutsy,"For the first time in recent memory, I was overwhelmed with choices when I popped into ""Video Busters"" last night. There was plenty for me, but also a decent range left that wifey might be interested in too. Being a long weekend, I got a stack of videos and for the overnighters grabbed this and ""Revoltionary Road"".""Valkyrie"" is based upon a remarkable true story of a group of brave men who attempted to assassinate Hitler and seize power of Germany during WW2. That has to rank as one of the gutsiest things to attempt ever. Heading this group is decorated war hero Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (played by Tom Cruise, in his finest work since ""Top Gun""),perhaps the most important Colonel ever behind Colonel Sanders. The plan is reasonably complicated, but if they can pull it off, they will see Hitler and a bunch of his key men killed and a coup occur where the SS will be shutdown and the country can be placed in safe hands and will consequently surrender to the Allies. It won't be easy though. The plan relies on being able to get key army people to be willing to commit treason and to get Hitler to unwittingly sign a document that will essentially enable the coup to occur should he be killed. Tricky. Will The Colonel pull it off? See it to find out.Reasonably well done, except for the fact everyone spoke English and without a hint of a German accent. That made it seem a bit weird. Cruise was OK at The Colonel, but there would have been about 50 better actors they could have used eg Russell Crowe, Tom Hanks or Sean William Scott.

Not Historical - Stauffenberg was no hero,"Below is a selection of comments on this film from the World Socialist Web Site, written by one of its German correspondents:Regarding Stauffenberg:""This depiction has little to do with the real Stauffenbergan opponent of democracy, an anti-Semite and an initial supporter of the war. Stauffenberg's political and ideological conceptions would fit badly into an epic about a hero, and are therefore excluded.""In an article for the Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin, historian Richard J. Evans, a specialist on the Third Reich, described the convictions of the Hitler assassin as follows: ""Stauffenberg's moral outlook was a multi-layered assortment of Catholic teachings, an aristocratic code of ethics, the ethos of old Greece and German romantic poetry."" Under the influence of the poet Stefan George, Stauffenberg aspired to ""an idealized medieval empire"" through which ""Europe, under the leadership of Germany, would acquire a new measure of culture and civilization."" ""These conceptions were compatible with the goals of the Nazis. Although Stauffenberg never joined Hitler's party, whose plebeian character contradicted his own elitist proclivities, he supported Hitler in the 1932 elections for Reich president and celebrated his appointment as Reich chancellor in 1933. He saw in the Nazis a ""movement of national renewal that would put an end to the shabby parliamentary compromises of Weimar."" And he ""believed that a policy of cleansing the German race and of eliminating Jewish influences from it had to form a crucial part of this renewal,"" writes Evans.""So much for the ""historical accuracy"" of the film!",,Anonymous,History
Cruise is not a right person for this role.,"Tom Cruise is not believable in any role much less as a German Colonel in World War II. Through the entire movie it is the supporting actors that carry this movie. Comedian eddy Izzard portraying a German officer is another bad choice for this movie. Had cruise been replaced with some top notch real actor the movie would have had some chance of wining Oscar for many things supporting actors, scenes, locations, etc.. I believe he did this movie to revive his sinking career which has been getting worse and worse day by day. With his good looks fading away as he is getting older there is not much to go with. I am sure many people will score this movie very high simply because standards have dropped in many things in this country including movies.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Great Psychological Thriller!,"Valkyrie is one of the better recent psychological thrillers that came out. This movie has such an interesting story line and a great ensemble cast.

It's about how Colonel Stauffenberg and other Nazi-haters teamed up to plan an attack on Hitler.The acting is really good. This is one of Tom Cruise's better roles.

Homage to Luchino Visconti,"I have only seen half at this stage, but it seems to me to be a gigantic, and very well done homage to Visconti's masterful 'Gotterdammerung'. Normally if I see Tom Weirdo in the credits, I don't bother even starting the spools, much less finishing. But when one sees Branagh, Nighy, Stamp & Wilkinson amongst the first XV, you know you have a team that can compensate for even a half-wit at Five-Eighth. He actually does not do a bad job, but the Fullback is Singer's never-ending cues back to 'The Damned'. It actually works better without all the sexual weirdness that Luchino just had to inject into all his sumptuous, high camp melodramas. If I get to the Macbeth bit, it gets a 10 and I will be very happy indeed! In any case, you are not wasting your time and you can then Google ""Luchino Visconti"" and really begin to live.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Surprisingly good,"I have to admit I came to the movie with a Tom Cruise bias. A friend of mine who is also a movie nut - and I agreed that in almost every Cruise movie he has to run away from an explosion of some kind.That being said, I had to brave a traffic jam in Sacramento (on a Saturday even) and missed the North Africa sequence, about the first 8-10 minutes of the movie I heard.All that being said from what I do know of my WW2 history this was technically accurate. Of course unlike the usual thrillers one knows the outcome beforehand, but it was nevertheless an attention-riveting movie.I finished a good book on Rommel, and he is not mentioned anywhere in the movie. I do know that he was implicated in the plot, and I believe he was to be installed in the ""new"" govt to negotiate with the allies. Rommel was one of the few Nazi generals respected by the allies, not only for his tactical brilliance in North Africa and France (I view him as a German Robert E. Lee), but his humane treatment of allied prisoners - against Hitler's orders - in North Africa. He was forced to commit suicide because of his involvement in the plot, although he took no part in the planning; only a passive involvement.Also while there were many brave Germans involved in this plot - I read somewhere that 5,000 were killed by the Nazis in the aftermath - one does not get a feel for the widespread and terrible repercussions in the movie. I was pleasantly surprised that his wife Nina and her children survived and Nina died only in 2006.A historian said of this plot that it was ""too little and too late"". It would be easy (and futile) to speculate what would have happened had it succeeded - Roosevelt and Churchill agreed on a principle of ""unconditional surrender"" - in part to keep Stalin from making his separate peace - although Churchill (and many German officers admitted later) that with nothing to lose, it meant that Germans would continue the futility of fighting with many needless deaths after D-Day.That being said, I still enjoyed the movie. Didn't want to wait the 45 minutes for the restart to see the North Africa sequence so I will probably get it on the DVD.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Tom Cruise a Nazi?,"Tom Cruise a Nazi? In this film Tom Cruise plays Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg as a member of the Nazi party who tries to kill Hitler and end World War II with his fellow conspirators. Obviously he fails because we all know Hitler didn't get assassinated but during the whole movie you are pondering how he fails and that is the only reason why this film is somewhat interesting. This is the only film that you may know nothing about but still know how it's going to end. Bryan Singer, who made the only good ""X-Men"" films, does a good job by making a film seem like there is a lot of action in it but realistically it's just a bunch of close-ups of Tom Cruise looking constipated. Mr. Singer didn't cast Mr. Cruise for his acting ability but rather for his presence or quite simply his star power. This was supposed to be Tom Cruise's comeback movie after the commercial failure of ""Mission Impossible 3"". At best, this movie achieved lukewarm reviews from critics to audience alike. Watching this movie you realize why Tom Cruise is an action star and not known for his dramatic performances even though he had a few. Tom Cruise may look just like the person he is playing but you got to wonder if this film could have been better if anyone else played his role, for example Leo? The whole supporting cast effortlessly out acts Mr. Cruise and it's almost embarrassing for him because he seems to be trying so hard. All in all it' s a decent film if there is nothing else at the video store and I feel lucky that I didn't spend more than 3 dollars on it by going to the theater.3 out of 5 starsCool factor: NazisLame Factor: Hardly any action in what appeared to be an action movie.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Good story. Mediocre movie.,"Yet another example of Hollywood's exploitation of WWII history to turn a profit. This is a glitzy production depicting real events, but with plenty of artistic license. The challenge is to build suspense to keep the audience's interest. Nothing wrong with that. The movie does provide suspense despite knowledge of the eventual outcome. But, in the end, after the suspense is over, the summation that there is this group of military leaders who disagreed with Hitler and fought for the true Germany. This gives the characters' actions moral legitimacy and elevates them to hero status. That is overly simplistic and largely false, in my opinion. The resistance to Hitler came relatively late in the war and mostly due to Hitler's military missteps, like insisting to fight on 2 fronts, refusing to withdraw and redeploy troops as conditions required on the battle field, and his irrational approach to warfare in general. None of this is clear in this movie. The meeting at the Wolf's Lair depicted in the movie, was focused on German losses, the approaching Russian army in Poland and the Allied invasion from the West. Earlier in the war, when Germany was ""winning"" there was little to no resistance within the Nazi ranks. This was before Hitler decided to invade Russia. In the end, the viewer is left feeling like there were morally grounded individuals in the Nazi ranks acting on behalf of their country irrespective of this historical context, like they were there all along. This is typical of Hollywood's depiction of war in general. There has to be some redeeming quality to characters or the movie doesn't make money. So leave out some info and write in some narrative explanation to assist the audience's experience. This formula is dangerous because most movie goers do not research historical events and so walk away from the movie having seen a completely distorted viewpoint on actual events. People mostly go to the movies for escapist entertainment. This is okay for completely fictional stories. But when you have a story based on historical events, you (the filmmaker) have some responsibility to your audience to either provide the facts and let them make up their own minds. Or, If you are presenting your opinion/perspective then start the movie with a disclaimer - ""this movie represents the opinion of the filmmakers."" This way you make it clear up-front that your opinion is what is being presented and not all the facts/context are included.This is one of the most interesting stories from WWII and is so much richer than the heavy handed moralizing of this movie.

Individuals do stand up for what they believe in,"In what is a very powerful told story about the German Nazi regime during world war II, Americans get a glimpse into the fact that not all Germans were in support of Hitler's actions.

The better question is that it begs what if things happened just slightly different then the events that occur in the film depict.Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast do an excellent job in displaying the characters of the film. The sense of tension and urgency comes through from the actors on screen and you are drawn into the feelings that the real life person's must have been feeling in these intense life and death situations. From argumentative discussions to the planting of the bomb to the silent looks and glances the film does an outstanding job of letting the audience feel like they are right there in the scene through out the film.The re-telling of the famous Stauffenberg is very worth of it's own film and the story is quite interesting.

Everyone else in the film did a creditable job and thus the film doesn't actually venture into the ""bad"" category, but it's close. I was expecting a powerful performance from Cruise but it just isn't there in this case. Heck, Cruise even bears a slight resemblance to Von Stauffenberg.

"Although the movie may not leave a powerful impact, it is nonetheless an absorbing account on the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler","For a brutally profound subject matter such as the attempted assassination of Germany tyrannical leader Adolf Hitler, it takes an immense amount of talent both in front and behind the camera to capture the alarming atmosphere of an event that supposed to be a turning point for Europe during World War II. Bryan Singer, famed from his work in 'Usual Suspects' and the 'X-Men' trilogy, takes a stab at portraying the violent events leading to the failed slaying of the ruthless Nazi leader responsible for the mass execution of over six million Jewish lives. His efforts in some degree do a little justice to the men involved in the notorious plot. By no means does the film carry the powerful gravitas that leaves a powerful impact nor does it strike a chord with a visceral execution. But one of the few things both Singer and the cast on screen manage to accomplish is capture the absorbing tension in a plot that could meant life or death for millions of European lives. This film follows the July 20th 1944 attempted assassination of Third Reich leader Adolf Hitler (played by David Bamber). With Germany accepting the inevitable defeat against the Allied Powers, they believed that the only way war could end peacefully in the European front is eliminating Hitler. Recruited by General Friedrich Fromm (played by Tom Wilkinson), German soldier Colonel Claus Van Stauffenberg (played by Tom Cruise) leads a team of soldiers including Major Henning Von Tresckow (played by Kenneth Branagh) and his compatriot General Friedrich Olbricht (played by Bill Nighy) on a mission to take down the Fuhrer and overthrow the renegade. As the clock is ticking, the soldiers are caught in the crossfires of German officers who grow increasingly suspicious of their dubious intentions.It is no surprise that the mission was a tragic failure for both sides of the compass as it would be a year later before Hitler finally met his end. While we know how things end, the important aspect is how successfully Bryan Singer crafts the trajectory of the events that lead to the forecoming tragedy. More of a conspiracy thriller than a war film, the film has a fair baggage to offer in the midst of its complex war history. With countless lives in danger of Hitler's tyranny, Singer makes ambitious effort to keep the stakes high and the suspense in the following the diabolical plan against the Third Reich. This accounts to some palpable tension each scene after General Stauffenberg and his colleagues spring into the action. Although the plot is not all firefights and explosions erupting through the air, Singer certainly knows how to keep a decent pace without leaving too many moments feeling wasted. One major flaw lying within the execution is the failure to capture the visceral energy of the action. Along the way, however, the story plants plenty of interesting concepts on the tension between Germany and the Third Reich, enough that will provide you with plenty of food for thought amidst the complicated politics surrounding the war in the European front and the shock waves perpetrated by Hitler's Nazi occupation. As for Tom Cruise, the fine actor does a splendid job capturing the gritty nature of General Stauffenberg, the man fighting the save the future of Germany from Hitler's wrath. While the American actor may not carry any German descent, it is safe to say he fits the bill. He is greatly supported by an English cast of Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, and Kenneth Branagh -- each of whom play characters of different nationalities than their real-life personas. If there is anything missing in their roles, it is the ability for the audiences to grow an emotional attachment to them.Valkyrie is an intense, tension-driven conspiracy thriller that may capture the heat of its uncompromising subject matter, but sadly falls short of the visceral impact that could have left a lasting impression. Despite this, it is an intriguing picture with a load of thought-provoking material worthy of discussion once the film reaches it conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent movie,"This is a very good movie; important too to tell this story. It is good to see that there were Nazis even inside that tried to stop the evil within their ranks. This movie is interesting and involving and well acted and directed as well. It is too bad that the timing prevented it from reaching a lot of people. We are still too close to the horror that Hitler did to accept that human beings even originally committed to something can change. But it is this change that can save us. I thought Bryan Singer did a great job. Tom Cruise is believable and excellent in the movie. If anything, it seemed to me his years in Scientology prepared him to play this part.

Ignore The Haters. Great Performances,"Valkyrie (2008)Plot In A Paragraph: A dramatization of the 20 July assassination and political coup plot by desperate renegade German Army officers against Hitler during World War II.I had long since stopped listening to critics, and decided if I fancied a movie, based on its merits!! Shamefully I passed on this and only watched it last year when I stumbled across it starting on TV in the early hours of the morning.Considering most people know the outcome of the movie, Director Bryan Singer has created a movie that is surprisingly suspenseful and tense. All of the cast are superb, Terrance Stamp, Jamie Parker, Carice Van Outen, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson (I was glad to see what happened to his character in real life) stand out. Cruise on the other hand plays it perfectly understated. A real less is more performance. Other than the fact it was popular to bash Cruise at the time, I don't get the hate aimed at him for this movie.Valkyrie grossed $80 million at the domestic box office to end the year, the 35th highest grossing movie of 2008. The film grossed 200 million dollars worldwide making it the fifth highest-grossing World War II film of all-time.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent WW2 Thriller,"I regret missing this one in the theater. Just saw it on blue-ray and its a fantastic. Singer & McQuarrie team up again and do one up on The Usual Suspects. As a thriller, it's pacing and suspense work seamlessly - never a dull moment. As WW2 genre picture, it's refreshing, as we're not watching typical Hollywood flag waving fair. The weight of the Nazi regime looms large and never has there been a better portrayal of Hitler and his senior advisers on film. If you are looking for loads of combat action like Saving Private Ryan, look elsewhere. The movie is not trying to wow you with effects as the story alone is interesting enough to stay tuned. One warning though, the pacing is very quick so be sure to pause the movie if you're getting a snack. The story's told from inside the Nazi high ranks and that makes it all the more interesting.The acting is superb. The supporting players all bring there A game and script is tightly woven enough that the balance between each character is real. Regardless of what gets said in the media, I've always enjoyed Tom Cruise as an actor. His does admirably here and the role of Stauffenberg does not suffer from the surrounding talent. What I really enjoyed most is the simplicity with which the film unfolds from Singer's lens. He's probably the most talented young director in Hollywood and his attention to detail does not overwhelm. It adds the to the zazz of the picture and his abilities shooting the Hitler sequences make them absolutely nerve racking. Probably the most underrated film of 2008. It's worth adding to your collection.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Movie Disappoints,"I am sorry to say that this movie disappoints.Now, the actual historical story has been done before on a documentary shown on the History Channel in the past. In fact, I have seen it more than once. So, the story is known and therefore being based on a true story the movie had a lot to prove.For a few reasons it did not live up to its challenge.First, while Tom Cruise is a well-known actor, his almost whispering delivery throughout the film made him come off as an actor with a monotone. There was little drama in his acting and it appeared that he was content and the director was content to allowing Mr. Cruise to simply look good in a German uniform and give glaring eye contact throughout most of the movie.Second, with all the detail and expense of dressing almost the entire cast in German uniforms the general lighting scheme of the movie did little to enhance the costuming design. Very dim lit scenes inside rooms and offices was apparent and did not help the visual effect. Even in the era of the 1940s people had better lighting inside their homes and offices. The lighting did not have to have the ""overall orange effect"" with faces in ""half-shadow."" Why Hollywood people think this is a good effect is beyond me. It is boring when seen in the movie theater when the screen is so darkened and it makes one want to fall asleep watching such scenes!Thirdly, having actors who pronounce their English words with British accents while pretending to be a German is laughable. To make such a film realistic requires (and with all respect to the fine acting staff, however) actors who are real Germans and can speak the English language yet retaining their German pronunciation of English words. This should have been a movie with all German actors and actresses who had English speaking lines.Future movie makers should consider my suggestions and recommendations to really make a fine WWII motion picture.Larry from Illinois",6.0,Anonymous,History
One of my Favorites,"I first saw this movie in theaters without knowing nothing about it, my friends kind of just dragged me along. When I left the theater, I remember thinking that it was a spectacular movie. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and always has you thinking. The day this movie came out on DVD, I just had to buy it, and have watched it at least a dozen times. I have always loved war movies...mostly for the blood and gore, but this one doesn't have any blood, or gore, and still manages to be a favorite of mine. The only complaint that I have about this movie is that you already know how it is going to end, but even with that, it still had me just as sad to see it happen. And to anyone who refuses to see this due to Tom Cruise: Get a life, and don't judge actors on their personal life. Just because someone may think differently than you does not mean that they aren't a good actor. Tom Cruise happens to play the part perfectly. So I would advise anyone to at least give this movie a rent, and if you end up liking it, then you will definitely want to buy it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A good movie, although Cruise doesn't convinced me.","This film's story is about an unsuccessful attempt to kill Adolf Hitler by members of the high command of the German army. To say that the conspiracy failed is not to spoil because any half-educated person knows Hitler's trajectory very well. The film kept our attention for our curiosity. As much as we already know how it all ended, we want to see how they tried to do it and the movie is quite skilled at making suspense around it. However, it would have gained value if it established a bridge between the conspiracy and the state of the war, putting the plot in the war context. Personally, I missed that background. Tom Cruise played the lead role in a decent and reasonable way, but without giving personality to his character. He was still sounding like himself. The film also has a good cast of supporting actors, sometimes playing much better than the main actor. Finally, a positive word also for the scenarios and costumes.",6.0,Anonymous,History
mediocre at best,"This movie was truly awful.The pacing was slow; so much so I went and did the dishes at one stage.The choice for the actors - some of them very fine indeed - to not don German accents (or at least a more uniform set of accents) - was an odd and off-putting one indeed.Cruise's performance was per functionary and emotionless, and although the movie tried to give a sense of the motivations and meanings of the historical characters it failed miserably. I get that the directors wanted to leave some ambiguity there - after all who truly knows what drives a person to a particular act? But the ambiguity led to the film being nothing more than a series of events with no depth or insight. Poor directing.Don't bother with it - read the historical accounts instead.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Pirates of the Third Reich,"Not bad at all. I've never been a fan of WWII films but recently I've become obsessed with reading about the war as there are so many intriguing things especially as we move chronologically away from it more and more things become declassified such as the occult obsessions of the Third Reich, the NAZI connections to NASA's space race, the development of flying discs by NAZI scientists, the immense funding of the Third Reich by the Bank of England and bankers on Wall Street, the development of IMB's punch-card systems to single out the 'inferior types' (which to this day IBM whinge they had no idea about) and more known things like the influence of Darwinism on National Socialism in the early 20thC, and more specifically the horrific application of the pseudo 'science' of eugenics, a term coined by Darwin's nephew Francis Galton. If I'd have learned all that in school I might have been more interested in history - of course it's not convenient to tell everyone the whole truth so many of us 'allies' are in the dark about the facts that some nutters in Germany were funded, influenced and inspired by the Anglo-American establishment. Then of course if the people of the time had known this it would have vastly damaged morale and the war may have been different... who knows. Anyway Europe was destroyed leading it to be rebuilt into this fabulous integrated trading 'blok' of the E.U. making the road to global governance much easier. - Clearly it's pertinent to add the Nazis and Hitler and Himmler took perfection of the species through negative eugenics to an insane level, quite unlike the eugenics societies of the United States and Europe. Of course hopefully the new global system will be benevolent and will address the enormous issues running amok - such as the corporation, the real Terminator, or golem, or monster which we've created...All the things which are insubstantially mentioned above are demonstrably documented in various interviews, papers, and books - most notably the works of Anthony Sutton, Edwin Black, Richard Weikart, countless RIIA, CFR, League of Nations, United Nations and other sources writings over the last couple of centuries.Anyway I digress. It would be nice to have a film about all the really interesting stuff like what I mentioned above but it's never going to happen, I'd have to make it myself - all we have is the conventional vastly boring due to huge omission of vital details history, or the conspiracy psychos. But as a piece of conventional history this does the job fine - it is indeed a compelling story of Herr Stauffenberg and the internal resistance. I read about the event in the book 'Agent Zigzag' - well worth checking out - and so when I saw there was a new film of course I was compelled to check it out. It's quite humorous to observe that half the cast from Pirates of the Caribbean are here - and an appearance from Eddie Izzard is always a nice change from seeing him trannied up telling jokes on stage. I'm always in two minds about Tom Cruise because it doesn't seem like there's ever any real emotion there. It would have been nice to have some consistency in the accents, even if everyone tried to make a subtle attempt at German sounds - but maybe this could have been insulting, I don't know. It would have been nice to have more German actors but as a commercial Hollywood film it's never going to happen is it. They have to ensure popularity and remuneration on the release.This film is well worth watching for those interested in the history and those who are not. These kinds of films are singularly important to counter the massive propaganda throughout the whole 20th Century demonising the German people as a whole and to clarify that the maniacs who ended up taking control for all those years were not supported by their whole institution - which ultimately was the downfall and internally brought down or rendered ineffective the secret services, the military, civilian and governmental systems from complete adherence to the cause of Germany. And what a relief to everyone who lived to tell the tale.Other films viewers of this may be interested in and have been referred to by other reviews are 'Der Untergang' (Downfall) and 'Die Welle' (The Wave) - the latter which is a German retelling of a social experiment carried out by a Californian teacher and his class in the sixties (seventies?).",7.0,Anonymous,History

The producers go to all the time and trouble and expense to recreate an atmosphere of Germany in the 40s and then they cast people who have the inability to make themselves seem like Germans? There weren't any English-speaking Germans for the parts? No Americans? No British who can lose their accents or speak with a German one? It bothered me for the entire film, so I don't agree with the 10-star reviewer who says it's a niggling complaint. At times it was very tense, and others it just seemed slow.

A powerful historical thriller,"Tom Cruise leads Valkyrie's strong cast as Claus von Stauffenberg, a German Colonol who saw his beloved country crushed as Hitler, obsessed with conquest, expended it in every way possible. Concluding that he could no longer serve both his country and the Fuhrer, Stauffenberg took on a central role in a plot to assassinate Hitler.I find it sad that reviewers who are clearly just criticizing Tom Cruise, and do not sound like they have even seen this movie, are giving it such poor ratings. Cruise's dedication to this film is tangible, and the results are admirable: not his usual flashy characters, but a serious, strongly motivated man in an impossible situation.And as for the movie itself, Valkyrie is based on true events. It started out a little slow, but picked up before long. It's a testament to everyone involved in the filmmaking process that Valkyrie manages to be suspenseful, even though we all know the basics of what will be happening, before we even see it.A dramatic and tragic, yet ultimately triumphant story, Valkyrie was so well-made and well-acted that I found myself shedding a tear at the end. 9 out of 10...highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Could Have been better,"The trouble with this film is also the reason where it was made, in Hollywood, it is also the good reason we are talking about it ! Let me explain :-This should have been made with more German actors (or at least more germanic speaking Europeans) speaking in German, but with English subtitles for the english speaking world, I watch a lot of foreign films and have always found that it is much much better to have them speaking their natural language with subtitles, you get the meaning better and it does not look crap like when dubbed.That saying, we would probably not have seen this nor be talking about it if Hollywood did not get a hold of this story, so its great that it was made (by Americans) but it could have been much better.Despite what I say it is a good film, well directed and well acted, I have always found Tom Cruise to be eminently watchable, the English actors did a good job, at least they were more Germanic, David Bamber (who played Hitler) didn't get it quite right though, the 2 actual Germans in the top cast were good (but not speaking German), the photography was very good, it could have benefited with being a bit more dramatic with the story line stretched out a bit more. I think the late Rutger Hauer (although Dutch and not looking like von Stauffenberg) would have been a better fit than Tom in the main role, maybe Tom could have played Hitler, after all he is the correct height, it would make a change for him to play a bad guy for once, I'm sure he would have done a good job.So Glad it was made but wish it was in German with more Germanic Actors.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Seriously???,"A great story. The beauty of it cannot be denied. They did a good job dramatizing it but the fact that everyone except Hitler has either an American or British accent makes me skeptical of the entire thing. Maybe as true to the events as can be, but this just feels like a very fictionalized account. For a story of this magnitude and profundity, they could have at least made the accents match the people being portrayed. The Germans and everyone else are probably not surprised enough by this display of arrogance to be offended by it. But I'm still too much of an optimist. A legitimate version of this film need to be made. Really, this film should be subtitled, like THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST was, but I know that ain't happening unless a German filmmaker gives it another go.

Very authentic and interesting story,It's the first time I have seen a film of the good SS Van Stauffenberg. I never had the intention to see the older film because I was every time interested to see war movies with action. It was Tom Cruise that got my attention for this exciting and solid remake. It contains therefore only a short battle scene but then the story shows step by step how Van Stauffenberg wanted to assassinate Adolf Hitler. All the sceneries were well done and the perception of this true event is very authentic. I think that all the actors did a great job here. I wished so much at the end that everything came true as Van Stauffenberg and his supporters imagined. Instead it's a great pity that finally the plan failed and Germany then got destroyed. After nine months of his execution the second world war nightmare got an end at least. Let's hope for a better world in future. I am asking myself the question if Van Stauffenberg acted only to get power about Germany before it was too late or if he really intended to stop killing more people. 6.5/10.,6.0,Anonymous,History

It's a Jungle in Nazi Germany,"""Valkyrie"" is a gripping suspense film that had my stomach in knots for most of its running time - I must surely be a masochist to enjoy this kind of pain! Director Bryan Singer brings an ""incident"" from the dying days of the Third Reich to the big screen with thoughtfulness, craftsmanship and style.

Not only Tom Cruise (who takes many risky parts and who does solid work here), but the likes of Bill Nighy, Kevin Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, all of whom bring real authority to their characters. Herr Hitler, as played by an actor named David Bamber, seems not quite ""all there"", and not quite in charge either - more a brand name than a commander of millions. I started thinking about power and my belief that you only have it with the consent of those around you, people with a vested interest. When the film takes us inside Hitler's inner sanctum, populated by smug, sycophantic generals, like lions between feeding frenzies, the atmosphere is stifling.There's considerable attention to detail and apparent authenticity in the look of the film.

Not all Germans supported that madman,"RELEASED IN 2008 and directed by Bryan Singer, ""Valkyrie"" is a World War II crime thriller based on the true story of the last German plot to assassinate Hitler in the Summer of 1944, although it wasn't a crime, of course, but rather an act of heroism.Tom Cruise resembles the protagonist, Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg, but he lacks his height. Despite this, Cruise is solid in the role and the story works up some quality suspense. Even though we know the plot will fail, you can't help but root for the dissenters' success. Almost 5000 Germans were subsequently executed on grounds of treason for the failed attempt, although not all of them were connected to this specific conspiracy.The film is both entertaining and educational. It shows that there were thousands of Germans who were willing to risk all to get that lunatic out of office. And they almost succeeded.

Quite Good,"Col Stauffenberg (Cruise) has a plan to kill Adolph Hitler to save Germany in the 1940s during WW II. This is based upon a true story.I would call this a history lesson except we already know the outcome and really didn't need to know the details. This 15th attempt to kill Hitler failed. End of story. Nice try, but they didn't get him.The acting by the entire cast was terrific, but no Oscar performances. There were a couple good choreographed explosions and a plane strafing, good troop movements, and the details of the ambitious plan were kind of interesting.The biggest thing in here is this: No one even attempted to speak German or English with a German accent and that was appreciated greatly because we understood what was going on. There were none of those, ""waddi say?"" moments. Quite enjoyable if the details of the plan were true or not. Didn't matter. This was a serious moment in history and the presentation was excellent.What was missing? Suspense and tension. In real life, when this was actually going on, I am sure there were suspense and tension stretching to unbelievable lengths. But, not in here. Pity. That could have helped make this a little more than a history lesson and give us a real sense of dire consequences for the participants in the plan to kill Hitler.The pace of the movie was too fast to achieve suspense and tension as the scenes did move at a somewhat rapid pace. But, there was a lot to tell and because of that no room for suspense or tension. Pity. Suspense and tension could have given this movie more importance. Double pity.I wasn't going to watch this movie. The word was the acting wasn't any good and Tom Cruise spoke English in a German setting back in the day. HA! The acting all around was terrific and they all spoke English and because of that I understood and enjoyed everything. Oh, wait a minute, they did speak some German at times: Heil Hitler!Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only one F-bomb was heard.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Needed a little more action.,"Before I watched this movie, I was expecting this movie to be an action thriller.But I was disappointed.There was too much drama and too much talking.It's worth watching, but it really doesn't live up to the hype.The movie is basically about a bunch of guys who wanted to stop and kill Adolf Hitler.It's a shame that there are only a few explosions and a lot of gunfire that involves mostly drama than action.Oh, did I mention that this movie was based on a true story? Well, it is.If this movie was supposed to be a thriller and a War movie, then there needed to be at least a couple of battlefield scenes or whatever.If only there was more action.Tom Cruise does deliver a good performance, but if Jason Staham was in this movie, it would've been a non-stop thrill ride.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Educational and entertaining,"Director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men, X2, Superman Returns) steps away from his typical fantastic stories and instead embarks on a straight-forward historical drama with Valkyrie.Based on the true story of the German resistance's plot to kill Hitler, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is a decorated war hero secretly against the Fuhrer. He gets an opportunity to do something about it by joining the German resistance, and they plot a daring coup to topple Hitler's Germany.Carice van Houten (who oddly looks like Vilma Santos!) plays von Stauffenberg's wife Nina, and while without much dialogue, effectively transmits emotion on screen with the slightest of expressions. This acting style is strongly echoed by the rest of the cast: Kenneth Branagh (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Hamlet) plays the cunning Major-General Henning von Tresckow, who enlists him in the resistance; Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Notes on a Scandal, Love Actually) plays the wishy-washy General Friedrich Olbricht and Tom Wilkinson (Michael Clayton, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) plays the careerist General Friedrich Fromm. The handsome Thomas Kretschmann (The Pianist, King Kong) plays yet another ironic role as Nazi supporter, Major Otto Ernst Remer.Reminiscent of Ang Lee's Lust, Caution, Valkyrie is beautifully told in bittersweet fashion. The suspense and drama are efficiently translated by the stellar cast, told in a wonderful, old-school way of storytelling. Educational and entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A good, solid film","I went to see this film with mixed emotion, curious to see Tom Cruise's performance. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the film.I will ruin nothing by saying he does speak English in the film. As a matter of fact, everyone does. Cruise is the only one with an American accent, though, which may have criticized. I am not sure why, though. I guess if you speak with a British accent, you get a pass (Sean Connery in ""The Hunt for Red October"" anyone?) Maybe these folks would have rather had all of them suffer through fake German accents or even a subtitled film.That said, I felt the suspense build, even though I knew enough of the history to know what would happen. All of the performances were good, with Bill Nighy's being exceptional. Was it the greatest film ever? No. But few are. I would recommend this film to anyone who would like to know of a little known event in the chapter of World War II.",8.0,Anonymous,History

From Rastenburg to Hollywood,"A cheap historical reconstruction, trying to fill-up with insignificant details the serious flaws, and vulgarizing an important plot of the last century. Commercial, shallow and spectacular. One of the biggest failures is the over-blowing of von Stauffenberg, a mediocre officer with authority problems who, by a hazard game, came into the limelight for his moment of bungled glory. Here, we see him monstrously bigger than life, in the superficial performance of Cruise - otherwise, a very good actor, when he's used by a director capable to skillfully speculate his humor.Still, the movie is interesting enough - mainly regarding the way it depicts the gregarious mass-psychology of the rats when the ship is sinking. The most important scenes are those regarding the labyrinthine interstices of the multiple conspiracies starting to overlap and collide, around the hypothesis of the Führer's demise. Extremely revealing for anyone concerned with the history's backstage. As a Romanian, I forcefully remembered the similar case of December 22, 1989, when many wings of the Securitate, K.G.B., C.I.A. and Free-Masonry were competing to take over the power, after Ceausescu had fled - everything leading to the ""terrorist setup"" staged by the Iliescu clique. History repeats itself - indeed it does!",4.0,Anonymous,History
Gripping WW2 film despite some flaws,"A good film about the Von Stauffenberg plot, the conspiracy that almost succeeded in killing Adolf Hitler during the later stages of World War II. It doesn't start very promisingly: things happen fast (we have Von Stauffenberg severely injured in a battle in North Africa, losing an arm, three fingers and an eye, and a few minutes later we have him joining the conspiracy, without explaining very well his motivations) and characters are introduced hastily without explaining well who they are. But as the movie progresses and we get into the plot itself (which was more than about killing the Fuhrer; knowing that that wouldn't be enough to end Germany's dreadful situation, they also have a complicated plan to take power and be able to sue the allies for peace in terms that would not be disastrous for Germany), it gets more and more gripping with a superb final hour. The mostly British cast here (among them, Terence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy), acquit themselves very well. Tom Cruise, however, while not a disaster, is just not very believable as a German officer. Besides his limited acting range, his demeanor has always been very American, so he is just not very believable playing people from other countries. I can think of other actors who could have been great in this role: for example, Thomas Kretschmann, who plays a Major who has a key role in breaking the coup attempt, could have been a great Von Stauffenberg. Still, this was better than expected as director Bryan Singer (of the X-Men franchise) certainly knows how to make a gripping, entertaining movie. And the movie includes also some terrific aviation scenes using period planes.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Good And Deserves A Watch,"For some reason it feels like this movie kind of just came and went when it was released and I think that was a shame. I really liked and thought that this was a very good picture and is one I would gladly watch again.Where some World War II movies can tend to be on the dull side, I thought that this one was exciting throughout. It was neat to see a movie with the major plot being a well thought out assassination attempt. It was enjoyable to root for Stauffenberg to get the job done.The characters were all good as well and I thought that Cruise did a very good job in his role.To my understanding, this film closely follows the actual events that occurred. It is nice when movies are able to do this all the while being interesting and fun to watch.I don't really see why this movie never received the very positive outing that I feel that it deserved.

Recaptures Von Stauffenburg story very well.,"I just finished watching Valkyrie at home after seeing it once in the theatre. I liked it just as much, good acting very good action scenes, intensly believable. The sets were very authentic as were the clothes, radios, furniture etc. If I had any complaints about the movie it would fall with Tom Cruise, his voice throughout the movie is spoken in no more than a whisper making it hard sometimes to tell what he is saying. Also I think his character as a German count and aristocrat would have come across more authentic had he used a good prussian accent. This movie is a keeper Im glad I bought it.

One of 2008's Best movies,"My wife and I went on a movie spree this Christmas and of the five we saw, Valkyrie was by far the best. The story is well known as the last of 15 failed attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler in the final days of World War II. Tom Cruise's serious portrayal of German Panzer officer Stauffenberg was accurate, detailed, and well done.The movie plays much like the best movies of the 1960s and ranks up there with The Longest Day, A Bridge Too Far, and Great Escape. The accuracy of the narrative, the uniforms, military equipment, and portrayal of the key players adds to the quality of the movie.It is unfortunate that the average movie-going public will not appreciate this movie for the quality of entertainment it brings to the theaters, as is evinced by the popularity of such low brow tween movies like Twilight and Spirit.

Learn who Colonel Claus von Stauffenbergis and what he did.,Interesting movie about how Germans who care about Germany try to save it by killing Hitler and take over Germany. This movie has a lot of talking which got me bored. They didn't have to make this movie 2 hours long or could have replaced the boring useless talks with some shooting or battles. Anyway this movie is based on real events and I'm a fan of WW2 Germany movies and this was just interesting and educational. the scenes of German guarding the Wolf's Lair look awesome and I wish I could see warfare in those nice looking forests. The acting was good I liked how Tom Cruise was acting as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. there was suspense of what was going to happen when because the ending is predictable.

Technical errors in Valkyrie,"Technical errors in this otherwise good movie. Opening scene with the civilian model of the Junkers JU-52 'Iron Annie' number D-2600 piloted by Hans Baur whom I knew personally. This was the same plane that Hitler used in the 1932 election campaign and was in the movie 'Triumph of the Will'. By 1943 he was using the much larger Focke-Wulf 200 Condor as his personal plane. Scene in Berlin at the government quarters with all the flags flying as if they were on parade and no bomb damage to the buildings. One would think that the Allied bombers could not find their target - they did and over 420 times. Most notable error was when Major Remer was told to obey Dr. Goebbels instructions only - no mention that he was promoted to Colonel on the spot skipping one rank. The security guards at the Rastenberg HQ were portrayed as army and not the SS escort unit who always protected him. Scene in Berghof after the Normandy invasion showing Hermann Goring stating that he had things 'under control"". By this time in the war Goring was held in such disfavor that he was not invited to staff meetings. His deputy, the half-Jewish Field Marshall Erhard Milch was running the air show.

We Have to Kill Hitler!!! Tom Cruise Overcomes Social Justice,"This was a fantastic movie.

The Tom Cruise eye patch movie,"This film was ridiculed throughout its production, from the casting and lack of German accents to Cruise's eye patch - Valkyrie was to be the quick death of the rebooted MGM. A big budget disaster, that would destroy even more what Lions for Lambs did to MGM. Pulling in $200m worldwide, the film was successful enough in the box office and wasn't the critical disaster that many expected (or hoped for), though it hardly received love from critics. The film is a tight old fashioned thriller, with strong direction from Bryan Singer and a nice pulpy, no fat screenplay that doesn't waste a moment on the plot to kill Hitler. It's a quick history lesson with the framework of a thriller. So while the film is all surface and doesn't go deep, that's hardly a criticism and there's much to recommend here. Cruise is adequate, but it's the machinations of the plan that when put in action are nothing short of entertaining to watch - even though you know how it will end.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Good movie, despite the bad reviews.","Bad reviews and a slight amount of stiff acting by Cruise notwithstanding , Valkyrie is a great, historically-accurate movie.With the exception of a single, short scene, Cruise's acting was decent to very good. All the other actors besides Cruise gave superb performances.The lack of German accents/German itself, and the substitution of the actor's natural accents instead, detracted nothing from the film; if anything, it made it a little easier to watch and follow, and more accessible for viewers who may not know the whole story behind Stauffenberg and the July 20th bomb plot.In summary, Valkyrie is a movie worth seeing, about a great and principled man who believed in serving God and his country over a crazed madman and the Nazi regime.8 stars out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Competent Story Telling, but Problem with the Star","In a film like this, there is really nothing to spoil because everyone knows how it would end. I watched the video of ""Valkyrie"" in several installments, but the flow of the story was no problem. The story being told was very interesting -- the plot to kill Adolf Hitler by German patriots led by Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) and its aftermath. The direction by Bryan Singer was very exciting and suspenseful, holding my interest successfully.There were so many competent character actors there, not everyone was convincingly German though. My main problem with the whole movie is the lead actor himself, Tom Cruise. He is too much of a star to make his portrayal of von Stauffenberg convincing. Even with the eye-patch, he is still Tom Cruise. He did not disappear into the role, as would have been ideal for a movie like this.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Engrossing political thriller,"It was heartening to know that this was based on a True Story. Good to know even under Hitler's rule, people had the courage to stand up for what was right. So thanks to Tom Cruise and Bryan Singer for letting the world know about such people and their efforts.The movie was well made and had some great acting. As mentioned by the other IMDb reviewers, the supporting cast had done their job to perfection.But on the flip side, there were just too many characters in the movie and all with some significance. So you had to stay alert at all times in the movie and not miss a single sequence. The other drawback I had was that the very essence of the movie (suspense) was lost even before it began. Since everyone knows its a failed assassination plot, what was I waiting for in the Climax? So while I empathized with them I couldn't root for the protagonists.But all in all, it was a good drama and should find something in the Academy awards this year! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Well done!,"When I sat down to watching it, I wasn't expecting much, because I had been reading reviews where the critics were down on the film.

The impression that someone is after you, breathing down your neck, the impression of the suffocating surveillance is there, too. I am also very much surprised that the Americans have also produced something not along the usual lines - no soppy scenes, no lone hero that takes saving the whole world in casual stride between breakfast and lunch, no countless special effects blotting out the plot, no wallowing in gruesome episodes.It seems to me that to some extent this film resembles Soviet films about WWII, at least I find a lot in common in the visual language, in the manner of presenting the material.Tom Cruise does a very good piece of work. He's not just an eye-candy here, but a personality, and a very forceful personality to that.

Cruise's performance only minor setback,"First off, it is important to not go and judge this movie by the poor reviews of Tom Cruise's lack of German accent. Had he donned an accent, it would have been rather difficult to take him serious as a leading person in a plot to murder one of history's greatest villains. It would have distracted from an otherwise decent acting performance.As well, going into the movie I expected an action-packed thriller but the pacing made up for lack of prolonged action. It was a nice change of theme to a war movie, as it dealt with the story of the Germans, not the Allies.The side-roles were extremely well cast. I recognized several great German actors such as Christian Berkel, who gave a great performance as Quirnheim. Bernhard Hill's cameo was also enjoyable, especially for those VERY familiar with Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (one line may sound familiar).Overall, Valkyrie was a great movie about politics, courage, and the power of the people.

I recall reading many references by those who were there that duty at, or even visits to, the swampy Wolfschanze wartime headquarters were an ordeal, especially in summer, so the bit about killing the mosquito was terrific. The aircraft were great! But upon leaving the theater,the character and the performance that left the best impression, and was the most memorable, was Thomas Kretschmann's, perfect! and I agree, he would have made a far better Stauffenberg.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Thrilling history lesson,"As a 29-year-old South African, the July 20th plot to assassinate Hitler (let alone the other 15 attempts) was news to me. I never knew about it until I first heard of the making of this movie. We were taught World History in school, and the second World War formed part of that, but somehow we must have just glossed over the fact that there were inside-attempts on Hitler's life.So, eager to learn something about history I never knew, I really looked forward to this movie (that and the fact that I'm a huge Cruise fan). And I have to say I was really impressed. The negative pre-release hype had me very concerned, but it was all in vain. The movie was well made, had very good performances and managed to do the near-impossible: maintain suspense in a movie where the outcome is known in advance. (The outcome obviously being that they don't succeed in killing Hitler. Not a spoiler by the way).The first half of the movie is basically the set-up. We see Tom get recruited by the dissident officers due to his outspoken and vocal criticism of the way the country is being run into the ground. Once he joins the ""rebels"", his vision in getting rid of Hitler becomes even more focused and determined, which leads him to orchestrate the July 20th plot.In the second half, Brayn Singer builds an ever-increasing level of suspense and close calls as the plan gets put into motion. And it really is an eye-opening experience to see everything that Operation Valkyrie entailed. With the success of the mission hinging on so many factors, one can only marvel at the intricacy and scope of the plot.Cruise was very good in the lead role, with just the right amount of self-belief and maybe false optimism to play Von Stauffenberg. Some of the supporting actors though, to be honest, put in even better performances, especially Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson. So leave your skepticism at the door, and give this movie a chance. It's inspiring and tragic, but instills hope in humanity, that only by making a stand can any of us hope to make a difference.",10.0,Anonymous,History
2nd Worse movie ever made,"First of all there is no way T. Cruise could have been an SS officer, he doesn't fit the physical profile. He is a great actor but to not have real Germans playing the roles is a slap in the face of movie making. Secondly, the men involved in this plot were scared to death! The actors portray them as if they have nothing to worry about and as if there is no need to wonder about the individuals they are in cahoots with. i would recommend that people save their money and buy a mocha at the airport. It is obvious that everyone involved in the making of this movie have no regard for history and hope to rewrite the way things were. Germans were evil, the allies killed most of them and those that were left all swear they had nothing to do with it. This movie is a sham and tries to offer an apology for mass sheepishness. Do you really want us to believe that the whole time Jews were being taken from their homes that they were the only ones who knew? Their neighbors didn't know? Get real. Waste of money, unless you were looking for another MI movie, if thats the case it is great. To say that it took balls to make this movie is to say you never saw the movie made in Germany just a few years after the war on the very same subject. It takes no courage whatsoever to make a movie of no consequence. This movie is 40 years too late.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Must See Movie,"I have only just got around to seeing this movie and I found it brilliant. I have read many threads on here commenting on Tom Cruise and his religion!

Some films have a start, a middle and an end, where you have three impact parts and little boring bits in the middle to attach them all. But in my opinion not this one! In certain parts of the film (I am not going to describe them, in case some people haven't seen it yet) my heart was in my mouth with fear and nerves and I got goose-pimples (and no the cinema wasn't cold!). That sounds extremely silly but when you put it into context that the storyline was based on actually events its really not that silly.The last half hour of the film for me, was extremely emotional. My heart went out to the Germans who tried so hard to destroy Hitler and what Kenneth Branagh said in the movie ""show them that not all Germans are the same"". Not only is this a Hollywood movie with excellent actors putting a great performance but this was based on true events and some people need to take a step back and remember this little detail.

What could have been...,"Nazis are a recurring motif in Bryan Singer's filmography: his third feature, Apt Pupil, dealt with the sick relationship between a teenager and a former SS officer, while the villain in the X-Men franchise, Magneto, is famously driven by his hatred for humanity after his family was wiped out at Auschwitz. Is it that strange, then, that when a project emerged concerning a failed attempt on Adolf Hitler's life in 1944 (all based on real events), Singer faced plenty of obstacles (problems with German authorities, re-shoots, constant changes of the release date) to get it done? The result is perhaps his least accomplished picture to this day, but when he gets it right, he gets it very right.One thing the movie makes very clear from the beginning is this: not all Germans were on Hitler's side, but usually those who didn't agree with his ideology kept it to themselves. When we first meet Colonel Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), he has already lost all faith in the Nazi dictatorship, and after losing his left eye, right hand and two fingers from the left during a military mission in Africa, he decides it's time to really do something. This leads him to joining forces with a group of disillusioned officers (Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Terence Stamp among them), who appoint him as the new leader of the conspiracy to kill Hitler (David Bamber). The plan they come up with is indeed very clever: using Hitler's own reserve army (the so-called Operation Valkyrie, hence the film's title), they will take over the control of Berlin and subsequently the rest of Germany once the Fuhrer has been blown to pieces. However, there's always a slight chance the operation might fail, and since not everyone at the Ministry of War (Tom Wilkinson's General Fromm, for example) shares their anti-Nazi mentality, they must be prepared to face the consequences, should anything go wrong.The main strength displayed by Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (the Oscar-winning author of the director's breakthrough feature, The Usual Suspects) is their decision to make the movie a thriller, not a history lesson (apart from the accuracy of the production design and costumes): the narrative moves at a quick pace, the mood is the same as in classics like The Manchurian Candidate and the entire second half of the picture reeks of pure, unadulterated suspense. This is a strength, but also a weakness: the plot structure and Singer's direction have the surprising effect of making the story tremendously exciting despite the obvious outcome (although, as the director commented in an interview, everyone knew how Titanic was going to end, and that didn't stop it from earning an obscene amount of money), but this also leads to most of the characters being depicted as mere pawns in the game. In fact, apart from Stauffenberg, no one is given enough psychological back-story to explain why they're doing what they're doing.And yet the characters are great fun to watch, and that's all due to Singer's trademark excellent eye for casting: the British group of supporting players (Wilkinson, Nighy, Branagh, Stamp, Tom Hollander and Kenneth Cranham) lend the picture the dramatic gravitas few American actors are able to give a period piece (even comedian Eddie Izzard keeps a straight face throughout proceedings), and Cruise, ostensibly chosen because of the resemblance between him and Stauffenberg, proves to be as solid a lead as ever and confirms, once again , that he's a better actor than most people give him credit for. Part of the actors' success lies also in Singer's vital decision to let everyone speak with their normal accents instead of trying to make them sound German, since he didn't want ""realistic"" to become ""ridiculous"" (and after seeing Mel Brooks' The Producers, it's hard to disagree). In fact, the only non-German cast-member who speaks with the ""correct"" accent is Bamber, a choice that is easily explained: it's another effective way to distance Hitler from his adversaries, since the actor's speech pattern gives the dictator an additional aura of monstrosity.Valkyrie isn't a perfect film, that's a given, but it isn't as bad as the pre-release reports were keen to imply, either: it is in the hands of a very competent director, and what it lacks in detail it makes up for in pacing, tension and performances. Not bad for a picture a lot of people considered doomed while it was still in production.7,5/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

Tom Cruise has been in Germany for months and h e did not had the time or the money to synchronize the German language by German actors? Shame on you Tom Cruise! this film had a budget of 80 million u.s.$? the sychronisation os the German language weould have added i suppose as much of $.25.ooo.=.

Excellent production of a story we need to know about,"I just saw the film last night at home and I was very surprised at how much I liked the film and how intrigued I was in the telling of this story. I think the anti Tom Cruise crowd did everything they could to try and sabotage this film. But at a cost of around 90 million and a gross so far at almost 300 million world wide, the film did not lose money and the story is an important one for everyone to know about. This film is based on intelligent script writing and performances not CGI special effects and non stop violence, I think most people are so dumbed down by Hollywood they can't connect to anything that is intelligent and historically accurate, which the film is, there were very few liberties taken. I highly recommend this film for anyone who has the ability to understand complex history. Also many of the filming sites were the actual places in Berlin, which makes it that much more powerful.",9.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best historical movie,"It's amusing to say that I got to know about this film while I was reading wikipedia about Tom Cruise movies which have grossed less than $100M in North America box office. I downloaded it, watched it and am proud that I watched this movie. It's a great piece of work.The best thing about this movie is that it is so interesting that you may not feel when 2 hours are over. I didn't realize how quickly time flew by. Director did a great job in making this story so much grasping and knowledgeable. This movie perfectly balanced the drama and thrill. The balancing is so proper that nothing really feels less or more. Also, what was good about this movie was that it stays to the point without any subplots or unnecessary drama.Brian Singer did an effective job at pulling off a historical thriller. Tom Cruise shines in a dramatic role which has been written very well. Rest of the cast also makes a mark and does exactly what is needed.I'd strongly recommend this movie to everyone, especially those who enjoy historical thrillers.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Really Very Good,"Well, despite the fact that I really do not like Tom Cruise and never did, I must admit, this WWII movie i a real winner! To begin with, it shows one of the most thrilling and interesting moments in world history, that is, Hitler assassination attempt, and then, it depicts the event very well. Tom Cruise here is a great choice, he portrays Von Stauffenberg very convincingly and we believe him all the time. Tom managed to play deep, with passion and excellent precision. Other great winner is the portrait of Hitler himself, here we see a maniac, a cruel tyrant so closely and so causally that the very fact we see Hitler shocks us. Such a small man could do such horrible crimes! Then, there are other great roles, of Beck, Fromm, Goebbels and others. They all are real, breathing, flesh and blood men and women who really created history in 1944. This is a very good movie and I do recommend it to all who like European history. Maybe, the only weak moment is the slightly dragging tempo at times, but it did not break the whole picture.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Remake for Fans of Tom Cruise Only,"In 1944, a group of high command officers plot an attempt against Hitler, and one of the leaders of the conspiracy, Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), goes to a meeting with the Fuhrer in charge of exploding the place. However, Hitler survives and the conspirators are executed.The 2004 ""Stauffenberg"" with Sebastian Koch in the lead role is another great example of the powerful German cinema. Based on a true event, with remarkable performances, tight direction and excellent reconstitution of a dark period of the contemporary Germany history, it is highly recommended  indeed a must-see film - for fans of war movies. This shallow and unnecessary remake, with Tom Cruise in the lead role and spoken in English, is only recommended for fans of Tom Cruise and viewers that do not like to read subtitles. Prefer watching the 2004 German version for television that is better and better. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Operação Valkiria"" (""Valkyrie Operation"")",4.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliantly film,"Wow, this movie was amazing.It was very well written and directed, and the acting was astonishing. Again Tom Cruise has mastered his character and acted it perfectly, I could not flaw one thing in Cruise's acting throughout this movie, and every supporting actor was also astonishing.This movie was such a change from the modern day Hollywood movies we see which are all about the CGI and who can spend the most money. This film focused so much on the story and pulled it off so brilliantly. The other great thing about this film was that it put you in the perspective of German soldiers during WW2, and how they were caught in a war machine, war mongering Nazi Germany, and how they hated it just as much as anyone else in the world. It gives you a great perspective that not all Germans were war hungry and not all Germans were responsible for the atrocities of WW2.Overall a truly fantastic, well told story that will stay in your mind long after the movie as finished.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

Bearable,"I find it difficult to review this movie. It appears neither faction nor drama.The creators obviously debated whether to use natural English or ""'Allo 'Allo"" German accents, and on balance I think they made the wrong decision. For an English speaking audience, English spoken with a German accent is far more believable than a ragbag of differing English / American speech.Casting is one of the most important aspects of any film, and here again I don't think it has been well done. Cruise, of course, is Cruise. Nighty is Nighty. And so on. ""Downfall"" was such a brilliant success because of the utterly believable casting (as well as the brilliance of the Fuhrer's portrayal). But in Valkyrie, none of the characters is developed: they are actors . The tensions that arose because of the doubt that the plot might succeed are shown - but not developed sufficiently to make you care.The flashbacks and flashforwards don't do anything for the structure of the film, and if anything make it a little confusing.The dialogue wasn't helped by rather poor sound mixing: I found some of it quite difficult to follow - but then the picture quality wasn't very good either so it may have been a digital projection problem.I usually rate a movie personally as to whether I will buy the DVD so that I can watch it every year or two. On balance I might - but only when the price comes down to the rental value.Not a real clunker, but - frustratingly - missing just too many critical ingredients.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Another Movie in Bryan Singer's Line of Masterpieces,"The movie starts off with an introduction speech by Stauffenberg (Cruise) in perfect German. It is then slowly phased into English. Then, after the attack that cost Stauffenberg his fingers, right hand and eye, we were headed for a crash course of who's whom and what's what in Hitler's Germany, all the way until the closing execution scene.Most people, I'm sure, had already known the ending to this based-on-history movie. But the question to ask while watching Valkyrie is not ""What happened in the end?"" but instead, ""What went wrong?"" The movie shows us what was the flaw of Operation Valkyrie and why no one killed Hitler but himself.Bryan Singer got everything spot on. The tension and intensity of the film is there. You will feel the suspense even if you had already memorized the WWII history. One thing that I found peculiar was how Singer depicts Hitler, not as a mad man with murderous intention and hatred, but as pure evil. Whenever he is on screen, everything felt dead silent, sombre and dark. Starting from the first scene he's in all the way to the last phone call scene, in which we do not even see his face but just hear his voice.This is the kind of mood that I'm sure we'd feel if we were in that era. And this is the way a good director interpret a scene.But, what went wrong with Valkyrie as in, the movie? Well, the cast. Everyone did their job well, I can give you that. But it seems that everyone could have top it up a notch. The accent was all over the place and it looks like no one was living as their characters.Other than that, Valkyrie is a well made movie. The directing and editing was well played, and the script and tone of the movie was anything a well-made movie should have.Valkyrie shall forever remain in director Bryan Singer's unbroken line of masterpieces.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"The critics were so, so wrong","It's like every so many moons, when Jupiter aligns ... all the critics get together and decide who they don't like. Then, they wait for that person to make a film so they can PAN it as the next Gigli, and write fancy quips to completely annihilate someone's career. Unfortunately, they picked Tom Cruise - and he's most likely not going anywhere, folks.Even more unfortunate, they did all this to Valkyrie. This film doesn't aim at ANY in depth Freudian psycho-babble because it shouldn't. In fact, in case you didn't know, it is a WAR film. It reminds me of the war films of yesterday - so sorry it's not Saving Private Ryan, you crying emoto-bots. For what it's worth, I found this story *more* compelling because it doesn't attempt to squeeze the drama out of every film second.Oh, and the film shouldn't be required to discuss other subject matters. It is such a powerful performance by Mr. Cruise, and the supporting cast was simply incredible too, that I just can't see why anyone would want to butcher it by going completely off topic. There was a bunch of stuff going on during WWII, and most of it was horrible. This is like a facet, not an overview.But overall, please do see this film in spite of the critics. I almost didn't see it - and opted for another film at the theater - because of what the critics were saying. My lesson is learned, and I am passing my wisdom on to you.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great movie - only if you know the historical background though,"This is a great movie, well acted and executed. Tom Cruise plays well in his role and the supporting actors do a great job too. I enjoyed watching the movie, however, if you don't know who those people were (Stauffenberg, Keitel, Goebels...) and if you don't know much about the 3rd Reich, this movie will not give you as much as those who are familiar with this era. A movie worth watching!!! It focuses on one event only (the assassination) and it does not spend too much time on the political part of it. Not sure if that person who plays Hitler was a good choice, I don't think Hitler was portrayed correctly in this movie. I think he would have beem more charismatic.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The unusual Cruise misfire,"A plot to overthrow Hitler is one hell of a piece of history; and a big Hollywood production with a formidable high concept, name director and movie star, is bound to be a sure thing. Well, maybe in the future, but not this movie. So many scenes of hushed conversations and hand-wringing; it's no wonder ""Valkyrie"" is such a chore to sit through.Tom Cruise movies don't usually thud like this, at least not for me. And I gotta be honest, it's baffling. But he leads a cast of unconvincing Germans and (I dunno how this is even possible) it's left to the sets and wardrobe to remind us that this is the Third Reich. No accents, no spoken deutsch, nothing? It just pulled me right out of the movie and I could never get back in.",5.0,Anonymous,History
What do they want?  The folks who gave this 1 star?,"I'm a voracious reader of history and list WWII as among my favorite grounds for research. This movie is hopefully one of the most persuasive mediums to those who know nothing about the great event. A great number of Germans knew that Hitler was a disaster for the empire. These people (no make that patriots) took an enormous risk to rid Germany of Hitler and the story needs to be told. So why the bickering over some time-lines? The scenery, uniforms, technology were faithfully exact and the sheer audacity of the whole plot was rendered in a true and believable manner. What do the 1 stars want? A stifled PBS document with a suitably dull narrator? I give Cruise and his cast a loud cheer to bring this moment of valor of the Germans to the large screen. I hope more like this come out but with the 1 star naysayers I doubt if we will see a big budget movie come out any time soon. I hope they are proud of themselves.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Nutshell Review: Valkyrie,"Since it's based on a true event, unless you have your head buried in the sand, you'll know the outcome, or at least the end result, of Operation Valkyrie, an ambitious plan put into the hands of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) together with his entourage of high ranking officers and political officials in a coup-de-tat to bring down the Fuhrer, disrupt his chain of command, and assume control of Berlin, thanks to quite a contingency strategy that Hitler had. If it had been successful, history would turn out rather different, but we are where we are now. So what makes it still a compelling story to sit through?The pace at which Bryan Singer puts this film through that's what, at breakneck speed rarely slowing down to take a breather. And that's quite the winning formula actually, keeping things tight and moving with clockwork military precision. For those who may want to take this as a loose reference for research into unsuccessful attempts at Adolf Hitler's life (this one being the last before the Allies came knocking), it compacted in two hours the entire recruitment to execution stage, where treason is the order of the day, not knowing who to trust, and to what degree.As explained, with any military operation, nothing goes according to plan. Recruiting is a dangerous exercise, because in a regime where everyone swears an oath of loyalty to one person, it perhaps provided the magical formula on defining loyalties, which is strangely curious yet effective. Decisions on who to believe and who to side, especially when facts become muddled and with the lack of information, it left many wondering and questioning their personal beliefs, whether to stick to the status quo, or jump on the bandwagon in the hopes of effecting change, while putting your neck on the chopping block.Providence too played a huge role in the film, with changing of key locations and the ease with which certain key elements of the plan get arranged and completed. However, any plans which involve large underground group members each having their own say, or if pass the point of no return they waiver and are not resolute in seeing things through, it puts everything up for grabs. Improvisation without hesitation in execution, especially without thorough, objective and robust planning devoid of emotion, becomes an Achilles heel, with wanting to strike fast an overbearing condition in the plan proving to add complexity for everyone. As with the adage of too many cooks spoiling the broth, plans that rely on inch perfect precision execution, given too many variables on the table, are formulas for disaster.And what's this about the accent you say? Kate Winslet did a German-accented character to perfection in The Reader, and hence the awards she garnered for that. Bryan Singer may have opted for the cast to not need to put on a fake front (given after all quite a method employed to transition from German to common English), and I felt that given the strong performances all round, it was whether to invest the time to instill that kind of discipline to speak with an accent, which may result in only marginal incremental in authenticity, or choose to forgo it since it's not going to drastically affect the narrative. So accent or not, it's a small issue really.The cast is a mouth watering one, which could also account for the appeal I suppose. Tom Cruise leads the ensemble cast, even if I found his physical defect of the lack of a hand and missing fingers somewhat distracting, because I always tend to stare at it, in wicked anticipation that the sleeve was cut too short, or if the CG guys left a tell-tale mark. And as mentioned, the cast is nothing but spectacular on paper - Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp (who seems to be in almost every supporting role these days), Eddie Izzard, Jamie Parker who played excellently the loyal Lieutenant under Cruise's von Stauffenberg, and with what I deem as cameos by Kenneth Branagh, as well as the grossly underused Carice van Houten who was also in another WWII-set film in Paul Verhoeven's Black Book.I suppose fans of Downfall would probably be interested to take a look at a key even that took place within Hitler's chain of command, that likely had sowed additional seeds of suspicion to the dictator leading to the final days of WWII. Save for the initial one-sided battle at the African front in the first few minutes of the film, the rest became a battle of the minds and resolve of its participants in a fierce power struggle. Definitely recommended for WWII buffs.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Mediocre movie, and Cruise is hopelessly miscast as a Germanic aristocrat.  He simply cannot pull it off.","The review by Michael Malak in which he tells us how much this movie helps his 9 year old recognize ""Good Guys and Bad Guys"" is as unhelpful to us as seeing the movie is for his son. The Germanic peoples were not accidentally ""roped in"" to doing something against their will during World War II. And von Stauffenberg, though admittedly brave--as were all the plotters--was not a hero. (People who undertake extremely dangerous and risky schemes have to have courage, but that is different from heroism.)You have to remember that Germany started the war on September 1, 1939. The plot in this film came about after almost five years of atrocities and aggression. The whole idea popped into Stauffenberg's head not for ""humanitarian"" concerns or ""moral"" consciousness, but because the war was going very badly for the Germans. If Germany had been winning the war hands down, he never would have contemplated this. I worry that the Germans today, what with their monument to him and other plotters and such, are not inventing ""heroes"" so as to avoid the real lessons of history. The movie is also mediocre at best. 2 - 2½ stars.",5.0,Anonymous,History
A few editing errors!,"In at least one scene, when Colonel Stauffenberg is shaving, he suddenly has four fingers. I believe the same editing error occurs in two other places: toward the end, after being shot his hand is shown dripping blood. Apparently his wounds healed in this case as well. And possibly another time in a scene where he was carrying a weapon. Since when did German officers carry what looked to me to be Barettas? Everybody knows that the standard officer sidearm was a Luger. There was no mention of the role that Field Marshall Irwin Rommel played in the assassination attempt. It was an important part of history as I recall, and he did commit suicide after the attempt failure.Otherwise, I liked the movie a good deal, and consider it a must see, especially for WW II history buffs. My reaction toward Tom Cruise' performance was very favorable, and I believe he deserves some order of special recognition for it. Hence a very favorable rating.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""Operation Valkyrie Is In Affect""","This movie was entertaining, to say the least. What I've noticed about IMDb, is that people are either very harsh, or very easy0going.

The good thing about the movie is that, despite the fact you know the ending, your attention is kept, and the suspension is always high!The other night, I was watching a German production called ""Operation Walkury"".

A nice film but an unachieved goal,"Satisfying general historical ambiance, all actor's crew- acting, shooting, photography, but main thing, the historical details were not clearly exposed - thus the foggy and undocumented historical evaluation of some 3rd Reich's officers resistance, against Hitler's murderer regime - clearly set it though, to the last year of Hitler's end... thing to say that is the least surprising from their part.The direction needed many more elements, we only saw Hitler's house to the Bavarian Alps (wolf's nest), some conspiring offices discussing about shooting Hitler and Valkyrie plan to proceed after, the Army Headquarters, some Ministery buildings -very well shot was that of Press, with all the telexes passing through. As for the military plan so called ""Valkyrie"" - the main story of film's plot, that scenario was very weak, so called vague and general...The all atmosphere of the film was very satisfying, but it produced only a taste - a very good indeed! of the really happened so discussed resistance of Hitler's generals - also known from Hitler's own words at his last moments when he was trying to be informed, and be conscious about the inevitable fall, ""I was surrounded by traitors"".",8.0,Anonymous,History

a serious attempt to make a serious film about a serious subject,"I recently reviewed the made for TV movie The Plot to Kill Hitler. This is the same story, but with a bigger budget. In the cheaper film the actors attempted German accents. In this one, mostly they don't. On balance I think this film has the better attitude but David Bamber does play Hitler with an English-German accent; this is not as good as Mike Gwilym in the TV movie with his bizarre Welsh-German accent. Hitler here is a little dispirited charisma-free man, and I don't find that portrayal convincing.Stauffenberg is played here by Tom Cruise. Well, what can we say? He gives it his best shot. Apparently, Cruise was attracted to the role after seeing a picture of Stauffenberg, and noticing how similar he looked. He maybe missed the fact that Stauffenberg was 6 feet 3!There is a strong British contingent here, all with strong British accents: Nighy, Izzard, Branagh, Stamp, Wilkinson, McNally, Parker. You do get used to it. Well, almost. Bill Nighy should leave serious drama alone. He's just too naturally funny.Anyway, apart from the actors, the settings and production values are first rate: costumes, direction, music all faultless. And this is a serious attempt to make a serious film about a serious subject. As such it should be applauded.

A Superior Film with Superb Ensemble Acting and Attention to Details,"A film with the presence of such fine actors as Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, and yes Tom Cruise, would be expected to entertain, and this one certainly does. On its own, as a war thriller, it is perfectly understandable and interesting. But better yet, the film is scrupulously accurate with details of the plot, small details of the officers' uniforms (something at this late stage that every war film should get right, but which few do), and in general capturing the surrealistic air of 1940s Germany under the rule of a madman. Cruise has taken a lot of undeserved guff for his religious beliefs. What he chooses to believe is up to him. The bottom line is that he is a superb actor, and manages to convey the great strain that Colonel Stauffenberg must have felt as the plot moved forward. Here was an officer only recently escaped from death on the battlefield, having lost much blood, an arm, an eye, and parts of his remaining hand, yet doggedly pursuing his goal of rescuing the moral center of Germany. The oath a German officer takes has been described as a nearly physical bond, and Hitler had cleverly converted the Wehrmacht's oath into one given to him directly. Breaking such an oath is a painful thing to a German officer, even when the oath has been given to a monster. Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators had the courage to relinquish that oath in favor of a larger morality. In so doing, they saved the honor of Germany, even if in what in the end was a rather pathetic way. From that small seed of honorable behavior, among others (e.g. The White Rose) has grown today's democracy, the bulwark of a free Western Europe. This film would make a good double feature with ""Sophie Scholl, The Final Days"".",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Yes it stars Tom Cruise, but watch it anyway...","I knew about this real story two decades before the film was made so I knew a lot going in and was dreading in the back of my mind what they would ""alter"" for the movie and or to suit Mr. Cruise's ego and team of image consultants that he has employed since the start of his career in the early 1980's. Yes ladies he's ""that"" old. But I must say it was done very historically correct and yes Mr. Cruise fit himself in the real life character of Stauffenberg rather than ""tweek"" and leave out stuff, character wise for him to still pull off the movie star image he loves to protect and cultivate. Did I see ""cult"" in that last word...hum?
Any-who, this is one of the best interpretations of that event of July 20th 1944 that tried to kill Adolf Hitler and end World War 2 in the European theatre of war then and there.

[8.3] Tom Cruise WWII character in his quiver,"A believable and suspenseful movie depicting the events leading to Operation Valkyrie.Tom Cruise performed well and believably as Claus Von Stauffenberg, no question on that!Bryan Singer's direction was very good and professional and always kept me satisfied throughout the movie.To those not pleased with whatever the film carries or the choice of actors, maybe a movie based on actual WWII events is not the right thing for you and you would be mostly pleased by a stellar documentary that is both educating and satisfyingly real enough. There are a few out there on the subject.That being said, after 13 years, I would very much love a new movie on the matter with a fresh cast.That would be a refreshing try and we would have a little comparison in our hands!Changes, new viewpoints and fresh ideas may evolve to greatness.Hope that new producers and directors take the matter in hands with greenlight of a studio and we would have a new take on the Operation in a few years.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Gripping,"It's usually a mistake to watch a movie made from a book,especially a historical biography like this one. But this was superb.The complex story was pared down to film length keeping in just the right material. Every tank, truck and uniform seemed accurate, even the ones in the earlier Desert scenes which seemed excessive by previous decades of movie laziness. Where were the old US tanks with a respray we are used to ? The predominantly UK acting team were spot on. Excellently cast and tight and skilled in their execution. Tom Cruise was brilliant and totally believable. I don't care what he does in his private life. That is irrelevant to his performance. Even my daughter loved this film and asked me countless questions about World War 2. If it makes you look deeper into the subject it will have served a higher purpose. The idiots who condemned this film stand exposed by their own ignorance.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent except for casting Tom Cruise,"First of all, I have to confess I highly evaluate Tom Cruise's talent as an actor. In many films of his, I thought that he is not only a superstar but a good actor, ex. in Rain Man (1988), Eyes Wide Shut (1999), The Last Samurai (2003), Collateral (2004), in all of which he was not a hero but an ordinary man who is worried, hurt but finds a way to go. Above all, it is a miracle to continue to be in great hits for more than 20 years! Nevertheless, why does this part (Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg) not suit him?That may be because the English language is not suitable for the German historical events. The sound and intonation of the German language is essential for those (please do not think that I urge the German language has a bad image, I found it one of the most beautiful languages when I repeatedly watched ""Das leben der anderen""(2006)). And the English spoken by Tom Cruise is too American. At the very beginning, Tom Cruise narrates the diary of Colonel Stauffenberg in German for a while, but it does not sound genuine German. (Tom, you have deserved an Oscar since a long time ago! Why don't you speak any European language with the perfect accent and intonation like Meryl Streep? Then that would definitely give you one.)On the other hand, the English language also brought us many other advantages, in particular, the many attractive supporting actors, such as Bill Nighty (superb in the last scene!), Terence Stamp (great throughout the film!), David Schofield (speaking most impressively the historically famous statements in the court). Only Kenneth Branagh should have appeared more, it is really a shame that such a talented actor is not made best use of.In addition, it is really good for Hollywood, instead of the German cinema, to declare that there were many Germans against the Nazi even during the war period.Other actors, who could even have corresponded to the German language, are also very attractive. Carice van Houten is just a fine wife of a German colonel. Thomas Kretschmann is always a beautiful German officer who makes us believe he must be a good and thoughtful man (but he must be tired of playing such a role so many times).I really love the last scene followed by the beautiful ending music, and want to see it repeatedly to memorize human being's dignified spirit to try to correct the wrong way to go.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Germans speaking perfect English during WWII?,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Spoken in American English to hide the fact that Tom Cruise CAN'T act and speak with a German accent. Tom Cruise is a mediocre actor at best, and this role is way beyond his acting ability. I couldn't help but chuckle during the film whenever I saw Tom Cruise on the screen and he reminded me of his role as ""Maverick"" from Top Gun. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Tom Cruise, but like I stated, this role is way beyond his acting ability.Another annoying thing of this movie is Adolf Hitler. It's really hard to see and hear Hitler speak perfect American English. It would of been a bit more believable if he had a German accent whenever he spoke English. Also, Hitler didn't seem so evil without a German accent.I rented this movie and after hearing the first few minutes in English, I thought I would be able to switch the audio to the German language, but that option was not even available. As a DVD, it would of been nice to have a German audio option.If director Bryan Singer wanted to stay true to the real-life, WWII event surrounding ""Operation Valkyrie"", he should of stayed true to the language. Maybe he should take notes from Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds which is also set during WWII but stays true to the era with multiple languages spoken in the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Armed with a cunning strategy to use Hitler's own emergency plan--known as Operation Valkyrie--these men plot to assassinate the dictator and over-throw his Nazi government from the inside.

This one is one such example.For the original plot owners ( and we know all are dead long ago ) they made one fault.Killing Hitler was the only thing they should have thought about.

A really great movie,"I appreciate a well told true story. I have always liked WWII movies because the Nazi's make such clear cut bad guys. There is not much grey area when it comes to this war about who the bad guys were. The fascinating thing about Valkyrie is that it not only condemns Nazism and fascism but also shows that there were still plenty of good people in Germany who were willing to die for what was right. This movie isn't just entertaining. It has a higher moral message in the end, and that is the difference between a good movie and a great movie. By realistically showing the characters as being human, both the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"", I think we are reminded that there was really not anything that special about the German psyche that allowed this to happen. It can happen anywhere in the world.I think the famous Edmund Burke quote says it best""The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing""Acting : Great

"""The portrait will be unhung, and the man will be hung""","Main character of this movie, Colonel Claus van Stauffenberg makes a plan how to save Germany from Adolf Hitler. It is based on true events during World War II and tells a story of planning the assassination of Adolf Hitler. The operation is called Valkyrie and beside Colonel Stauffenberg it involved a group of senior German officers and politicians.The movie starts with German language while Colonel Stauffenberg writes about Nazi's crimes, and then after few seconds it transitions into English language. While the dialogs during the movie continue to be in English, background voices, singing and even writings on documents are in German. It sets some authentic atmosphere, so it's not bothering that much why actors don't speak German throughout the movie. In addition, visually it looks really good. Attention to details on uniforms, Nazi headquarters and makeups are top-notch.Throughout the movie you can feel and understand the pressure some of the characters go through. Their life depends on the success of this operation and I feel the movie did a good job in portraying this. However, you don't discover much about the characters involved in the plot. Colonel Stauffenberg as a main character gets some minor screen time about his family and his past military activities and that's it. I would like to see some back stories for some of the officers, especially Lieutenant Werner von Haeften who was Stauffenberg adjutant. This would explain some of his actions at the end of the movie.Overall, I would recommend this movie especially if you're fan of World War II events.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Great, accurate film","This was a totally engrossing political action thriller. We know what's going to happen, yet we remain on the edge of our seats as the events roll forward. This is because we feel like a fly on the wall witnessing a pivotal moment in history.For the want of a nail the horseshoe was lost...and then the kingdom. The film does a great job conveying that feeling. We get glimpses into the plotter's motivations. No, not everyone is entirely pure and we wonder how come it had taken them so long to arrive at their positions; although, in the case of Colonel Staffenberg it's reasonably well explained.The acting cast is great and they work together beautifully. No one tries upstage anyone else. The harping about the lack of German accents is plain confounding: Germans don't speak English with German accents; they speak German! I hardly noticed anyone's accent after a short while.The movie aroused my curiosity about the depicted events and I wanted to see how accurate the film was. I realized that I had as definitive of an account as you can have close at hand: ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"", by William Shirer. The film is exceedingly accurate while still adding color and aesthetics. Even some of smaller details, which I assumed were made up, were historically-based.This is a very good, underrated film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
I want my 10 bucks back.,"The movie Valkyrie starring Tom Cruise was; in my opinion, just like the films attempt at Adolf Hitlers assassination, a failure. This films trailers and advertisements portrayed it to be one of the more action packed films of the year, when in reality it was the complete opposite. The only scene containing action or enough suspense to keep you interested is the opening title scene.If a movie does not contain any true action, comedy, or horror it must contain good acting and direction in order to keep the audiences attention. Valkyrie lacked greatly in each of these departments. For instance, how could a movie about German Officers and Nazis, contain men speaking English; in perfect American and even British accents? This evident and easily avoidable problem was one that caused the movie to lose any sense of realism that it had. Atop the Tom Cruise led nosedive into mediocrity, the director, Bryan Singer should have explained more. There are many times in the movie; when a British sounding ""Nazi"" says one thing and then is contradicted within seconds.The only thing this film has going for it is a suspenseful soundtrack that can add to the mood of would be suspense. This movie is recommended to be avoided unless a true History or Tom Cruise fan.",4.0,Anonymous,History

A real life  conspiracy.,"Valkyrie is the story of a team of German officers during WW2, who after fearing for the progress of the war, they make a plan in order to assassinate Hitler ,seize power and then make peace with the advancing allied forces. When I was in my teens I really loved that movie for I had a major crash with anything related to history, after I though that it didn't worth and now I see as a quit accurate adaptations of this real life conspiracy, which not many people know it.As for casting, the actors were extremely similar to their counterparts, with Tom Cruise seeming to be a twin to Claus Von Staufebenrf, the protagonist and main character to the flick. The cinematography is amazing and the sets are as accurate as they get, what do you expect Bryan Signer of the X-men directed it. But anyway as all we know basic history is it obvious what was the result of the conspiracy.Man I think that if they had Eric Lenscher (Magneto) with them things would have been different.;)Now there are some inaccuracies here and there and some thinks that were changed but over all the crew tried to be as authentic as possible and be faithful to the history and the did it. When you adapt a story from a novel ,a comic book, a historical event it is impossible to be 100% accurate, some changes for production sake and keeping the run time in reasonable length, but the most important think is the film present to the audience the main facts and present them as close to reality as that is possible. Here that is a bit easier for the story is focus mainly in Germany and the whole story is started in March 1943 and ended in July 1944.The last part is crucial for may saved the movie from becoming like Alexander of Oliver Stone or Bayhem Pearl Harbor. It focuses in one story of a bigger period and didn't try to make it as complex as possible but as good as it could be. Just think the most well known and praised WW2 movies, like some my favorites Saving Private Ryan, Letters from Iwo Jima, Das Boot, the Great Escape, the Downfall, the Pianist and Schindler's list. All focused in one in event of character and play the story as it went and showed the way the people reacted. This way is more easy, it helps the audience to relate to the characters and it can then focus to make the settings and costume accurate.As conspiracies shown in movies go this is one of the best , because it is grounded to reality and simple in order everyone to get the bigger picture. That is how conspiracies are made, not with absurd complicated traps and goal. For real it is impossible 9/11 and similar conspiracies to be true because are so absurd that Willie Cody will come and say :""that's stupid"" !",8.0,Anonymous,History
Tom Cruise With an Eye Patch - Nothing Can Save This Horrible Movie,"I haven't even finished watching it, and I can tell you from a lifetime of watching great and ugly movies that this is truly a waste of talent. I love history, but I think that most of us have moved beyond Hitler. He didn't win, and has been cast in a most unfavorable light. I would have done much the same as him, except for going after the Jews and attacking Russia. And letting 300,000 captive British soldiers go. And using the Messerschmidt for bombing rather than combat. Hitler was a doomed cadaver, but not without his talents. The people who made this film have a heavy cross to bear. Nazi war memorials in 2009 are akin to black-face and Al Jolson. Some things belong in the past. This narrow view of European history is farcical. I loved Tom Cruise in Eyes Wide Shut and The Last Samurai, but those were both seamless classic movies that move the heart and imagination. This is a piece of turd, truly. Branagh does not save it, nor does Tom running around in an eye patch. Hitler looks like a dwarf. In reality he was 5'11"" to Tom's 5'7"", and yet he is made to look like a diminutive lizard cowering beneath the towering Tom Cruise. It is a joke. And the people who made this terrible movie cannot be excused. This was bad timing. The costumes and historicity are fine, but everything else is bland to typical. Had they even gone the Mel Gibson route and chosen only no-name or no-fame actors to make you believe the roles more readily, this still fails from a filmic point of view let alone an artistic. What makes it worse is that some little zipper-head with a camera filmed it in a movie house and Shylocked my friend for $2.00, The real scam is paying full theater price to see this dustbin of a flick. A waste of time. It belongs under the M3 in exchange for the original Wicker Man footage. Bring back Stanley Kubrick and keep us from movies like this, please.",3.0,Anonymous,History
An operation that could change history,"Nazi Germany. Every person will have certain thoughts when he hears the mention of a long-defunct system. A black page, no, probably a few black volumes of our human history, when the whole world shuddered and saw all the horrors that a man could think of, that he imagined himself to be a being that stands above others. Adolf Hitler went to his triumph for many years, gaining large-scale support, but also making a lot of enemies. Someone praised his ideas, was at one with him. But there were also those Germans who could not accept the truth being propagandized. And although there have been many attempts on Hitler's life for almost 15 years, Operation Valkyrie is one of the most famous attempts to kill the personification of death and fear named Hitler.Tom Cruise tries on the image of the famous officer Klaus von Stauffenberg, who was destined for the role of the most famous of the conspirators on July 20, 1944, when the attempt on the Fuhrer actually took place. An interesting and, it seems, unusual role for a famous Hollywood actor, whom the viewer is used to seeing mainly in action movies or dramas, but not in the role of a real person, and even one of the conspirators against the Nazi regime in Germany.The film demonstrates the most significant events related to the conspiracy against the current head of Germany. For the first half of the film, a competent script, an excellent cast and high-quality work of the director immerses us in the near-Hitler world. The second half of the picture is devoted to the very famous operation ""Valkyrie"". And of course, I am sure that every viewer necessarily knows that the attempt will be unsuccessful, because we all remember that Hitler did not die in July 1944, but did it almost a year later. However, the story rises to such a level of intensity on the screen that you believe to the last that everything is about to work out. I still remember how in the cinema, on the most important scenes, I squeezed the armrests of a comfortable chair and, it seems, whispered to myself: ""Well, please, let them succeed in killing Hitler."" Is this not an indicator of a high-quality film, where an atmosphere has been created that completely immerses you in this most interesting story.I really liked how the pace of the narrative is inflated after the assassination attempt. Here, the audience is shown, with due degree of necessity, the ""Valkyrie"" itself, when, although with a creak, certain actions begin that should occur in the event of Hitler's demise. The tension still continues to grow, but soon everything crumbles, otherwise it could not have been, as we know from history.I still remember how one of the heroes picks up the phone, from where a man says in Hitler's voice: ""Do you recognize my voice?"" Major Roemer changes his face, looks at Goebbels, what is standing in front of him and who he came to arrest, and he realizes that he is talking to Hitler himself. And here everything becomes clear. The plan fell apart, the attempt was unsuccessful.The film is made very qualitatively. It was created, in my opinion, as a political thriller, which had an excellent historical basis, without even having to invent it. The main thing was to correctly show the whole story, to make the right accents, which director Bryan Singer undoubtedly managed. The author has shown that he can not only tell high-quality stories about mutants in ""X-Men"", but also adequately screen such an important page of history.In addition to a strong script and good direction, the film is ready to boast a lot of strong names of the cast, among which Tom Cruise Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Carys van Houten, Terence Stamp, Tom Wilkinson, Thomas Kretschman stand out.""Operation Valkyrie"" is a worthy art project that successfully adapts one of the most interesting pages of world history, when its wheel could well have turned in a different direction, giving rise to another reality. And although in 1944 much was already predetermined in the defeat of Nazi Germany, Hitler's death could well have stopped the bloody war and saved a lot of lives. The film also demonstrates that even in a country like Nazi Germany, many did not support the ruling regime, which led the country into the abyss, depriving tens of millions of people of the future. There were also those who found the courage to admit the criminality of the actions of the authorities, to go against it, to try to fix it, even at the cost of their lives. Such people, their examples are needed at any time.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Valkyrie,"I had seen Valkyrie, the 2008 film by Bryan Singer at the cinema, and I anxiously awaited its DVD release. I was gifted the DVD shortly after release and watched it for a few months straight several times. I added it to my June schedule after realizing I hadn't seen it in nearly 10 years since those months passed just after the DVD release, to see if it held up for me. I was happy to learn that it did, which is not always the case in a film I liked at the time of release after year pass. Valkyrie stars Tom Cruise and Kenneth Branagh in a retelling of the assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler and political coup plotted by renegade German Army officers. Historical films are a tough batch if you're historically inclined and know the outcome of what's being filmed, and Valkyrie managed to sustain suspense despite knowing how the plot turned out.Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) has been severely damaged, like many, by WWII. Losing an eye and an arm in battle, Colonel Stauffenberg along with many others has come to the conclusion that an honorable surrender is the only way out of the war. The problem with the idea of an honorable surrender is the fact that Adolf Hitler would have to be eliminated in order for that to take place. All previous attempts on Hitler's life had failed so Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg has been recruited to head this attempt. In order for this attempt to work, Operation: Valkyrie must be changed to enable the members of the coup to take control of Berlin in the event of Hitler's demise. As the coup members go to work plotting an assassination of Hitler and a military takeover of Berlin, their plan is thwarted by a series of failings and a rout of bad luck.I remember being in the minority on the issue of the switch to English from German at the beginning of the film, and I was still unbothered by the change in language despite being a fan of foreign cinema. Granted, I'm usually on board for inventive methods of storytelling, but the language shift left me equally as unfazed ten years later. the most fulfilling part for me of waiting so long between viewings was being more familiar with the actors in the film. I had never seen a Kenneth Branagh film before the first time I saw Valkyrie, but I had heard about him a great deal; ten years later, however, I am familiar with Branagh and recognized him immediately in Valkyrie. The same can be said with my experience with Eddie Izzard. I had never even heard his name before my first viewing of Valkyrie, Izzard is well known to me now, and it was a treat to see him in such a role. I'm a classic film fan so I don't often get as much experience with contemporary actors as I probably should so this was a fun exercise in recognition that comes with ten years of cinema maturation. The pacing in Valkyrie was perfect building tension through the end of the film beautifully despite one knowing how the film ends. I was also especially stricken by the lighting of the film. Valkyrie was lit in a way that often evoked a dream-like state while simultaneously providing a ripped-from-the- past historical drama feel, as well. Adding to the tension of the well- paced film was the score, filling the audience with a sense of unease at every turn. Valkyrie is a strong war drama, which well utilizes a unique method of storytelling gripping audiences until the final credits roll; I'm glad the film held up.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Instead I got 15 old British men and one American blabbing about how they were going to execute Hitler. My main disappointment from this movie was that it lacked visualization. There was.

It is packed with top class actors (most of them British, with a scattering of Germans).One snag: Tom Cruise. Is he anyone's idea of a cultured Prussian aristocrat of seventy years ago?

"Great movie,  definitely worth seeing","This is one of the most intriguing and largely untold stories of WWII. I've studied the period quite a bit and had heard of assassination attempts, but I never knew about this one and how it almost was successful. The movie was filled with high drama, good action, great directing and acting. From a cinematography point of view it was visually stunning. This was one of Tom Cruise's best performances. I feel he often gets a bad rap because of his Scientology views, and I heard reports that the German government was not happy he was filming Valkyrie because Scientology is banned in Germany & he's not the most popular person there.My only complaint is that I would've liked to see more German actors. There's a wealth of great German actors who speak English and who would've been more authentic in the main roles, but it seems like in most movies with Europeans the main roles are usually given to Brits. Nevertheless, the acting was superb especially from Cruise & Nighy.If you're not a Cruise fan, don't let that stop you from seeing this. If nothing less, it gives a good look at the often neglected German side of WWII, showing that most Germans were against Hitler and the atrocities he committed against the world.",10.0,Anonymous,History

narrow minded and leading view of history,"""Many saw evil.

Look at yourself before you judge.Tom Cruise, who i loved so much in The Last Samurai; my favorite movie showing the relativism of cultures, flops to the total opposite here, taking on this role.

Well made historical drama,"""Valkyrie"" was well done, covering the failed 1944 plot by high-ranking German officers and elites to assassinate Hitler and overturn the Nazi regime. Don't let the Tom Cruise haters dissuade you; he does a fine job as Claus von Stauffenberg, the aristocratic co-leader of the plot. The supporting cast includes numerous fine, prominent actors, who all give excellent performances.

Historical WWII Thriller,"Valkyrie staring Tom Cruise in the leading role as Colonel von Stauffenberg caused some controversy at the time due to his casting as the officer who led the plan to kill Hitler during WWII. Ultimately the movie did better than expected at the box office and proved popular with movie goes if not film critics.An important note is that this is a thriller movie set during World War Two, rather than a drama of that period. This is an important distinction as what director Brian Singer gives us is a fast paced, well shot and tense action thriller. The downside is we lose character development and depth but that would have slowed the pace and maybe lost the urgency of the act of the attempt to overthrow the Nazi's (so more about the act rather than individuals involved).This does mean that the stellar cast including; Terence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson are all underused for their roles but also that Tom cruise is not overwhelmed in his role for which he thankfully keeps it simple and straight. And that is not to criticise him, this is the type of role he can do well.As mentioned the pace is fast and the viewer is kept involved throughout. Apparently they had lots of documentation about the real plot left by the Gestapo who investigated it and so could keep things as close as they could to reality, though just condensing the time frame.This is one movie where the critics get it wrong. Though maybe depending on your views of Tom Cruise as an actor as to how much you enjoy this, Valkyrie is a well directed and convincing period action thriller that does not disappoint.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Most revealing Cruise performance since ""Cocktail""","Not a bad screenplay. Very authentic sets & costumes. Extremely-motivated supporting cast. Aura of authenticity back to the 1040's. Thought-provoking premise despite the historical realities that remind us that Hitler died in the bunker in a most-cowardly act of suicide just before the Russians would have captured his ass. However, who's idea was it to put Tommy in the lead role? He detracts from every scene he's in by his lack of presence. Tommy's insistent actor persona detracts from the importantly historical character he's portraying. Unique in hollywierd, Tommy is never happier when he's playing Tommy enjoying Tommy.

Could not have been better,"This movie was phenomenal. The directing was sleek and precise, by the amazing Bryan Singer. The story was incredibly well written, with painstaking attention to detail. You will find no embellishments here. Of course, everyone knows how the movie will end, but that doesn't take away from the suspense and the brilliant confidence with which these men acted. Tom Cruise gives one of his best and most subtle performances in years. You'll honestly forget its Tom Cruise at all. This movie is about more than just a plot to kill Hitler. It is about loyalty to a set of ethics and principles that were upheld by very few at that point in time. It is about having the courage to act when no one else would. This is an incredibly important story, because these brave men need to be remembered. They died for their country, the Germany before Hitler. This movie will creep up and floor your emotions in ways you won't see coming, and you'll be hard pressed to stop thinking about it. The critics who reviewed this movie poorly don't have a heart or a brain, just a bias against Tom Cruise. And for what? If this movie proves anything about Tom Cruise, its that he can do anything.

"Exciting, Taut, High Tensioned Stuff","Give Tom Cruise credit for his performance in Valkyrie. There's no high energy soundtrack doing the work for him here, this is old fashioned high tension thriller acting, and Cruise does it quite well.Hitler is still rampant even as the war has turned against Germany, and a reverse cabal of moderate and humanistic German officers think the war can end if Hitler is assassinated.But how to reach Hitler in the midst of a blazingly militarized Germany during a two front war? This is the almost-impossible challenge the film's plot poses. If this ambitious hope can be grasped, Cruise's character, a still-young but old-souled combat hero, von Stauffenberg, might just be the man to grasp it.Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson give career-polishing performances as German generals moving in and out of 'the plot' with varying degrees of self-interest.The filmed scenes, which mostly stick to wartime Berlin barracks, look fact-perfect. The preponderance of grey woolen uniforms as costumes and unwieldy sounding German names (to American ears) are offset by crisp, well-paced dialogue, interesting lighting, and tension filled physical blocking of the actors as they go to work.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Confusing and dissatisfying depiction,"I suppose there's not much point in adding yet another voice to the hundreds that have come before, but I just wanted to get my opinion off my chest.I admit I was expecting the worst from this movie, yet a pleasant surprise would have been welcome. First of all, who is who here? How do you account for a load of British accents, practically the lone American accent (Tom's) and a smattering of German accents? Were those German accents supposed to depict ultra-German Germans? I found that phenomenon extremely confusing and distracting. Next, could not the drama of the events have spoken for itself? Did we have to have a constantly sinister soundtrack to remind us that something serious was afoot? I also found that extremely annoying. Third, I did not feel that Tom Cruise delivering his lines in a sonorous whisper substituted for real depth of feeling and acting ability. Fourth, did they HAVE to give Nina von Stauffenberg the Hollywood-glam treatment? Look at pictures of her. She was not drop-dead gorgeous, or impeccably costumed, nor did she have elegantly flowing locks.Fifth, I have to take issue with the premise of the movie. ""Many saw evil. They dared to stop it."" Yes, they dared to stop it, or try, more than 11 years after it began, with most of them as registered members of the Nazi Party. I don't deny that resistance was extremely difficult and dangerous in Nazi Germany, but we have to remember that the majority of Germans, including Claus von Stauffenberg, allowed it to become Nazi Germany in the first place. And by mid-1944, some were resisting so strongly in order to save face, as it was clear that Germany would lose the war. Where was the serious resistance when the Jews lost their civil rights? When Jewish businesses and synagogues across the country were destroyed, and Jews themselves terrorized, BEFORE the war, in November 1938? When Hitler invaded country after country, before and after the war's start? Thank God for people like Claus von Stauffenberg, Ulrich von Hassell and others. But it was far too little, far too late. And Valkyrie, including Tom Cruise's attempt at a noble portrayal of Von Stauffenberg, does absolutely nothing to acknowledge that. Von Stauffenberg's last words, ""Long live sacred Germany!"" (""Es lebe das heilige Deutschland,"" I assume), show part of the underlying problem. Too many Germans believed that Germany was somehow sacred, and therefore entitled to more, while subject to less moral judgment. How wrong they were, and what a price they paid. And what a price did pay all those murdered by the Nazi regime. A glamorized, would-be valiant ""Valkyrie"" can't change that.Rant over.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Cruise on a roll,My favourite Tom Cruise movie. I know a lot of people don't like Tom because he is a scienetologist and for other reasons but give this one a go it's good. A true story about ridding the world from a germ like Hitler so that ain't bad. They get so close and even though you know they don't get there it keeps you in. Old Tom bears a more than passing resemblance to who he plays and he does it well. Everyone else is great in it too. Mainly English actors playing Germans of the day. If only they could of polled it off. The lives that could of been saved. Tom does bear more than a passing resemblance to who he's playing.,9.0,Anonymous,History
Great movie - a must see!,"Valkyrie.. what an incredible story, and an incredible movie! This has got to be one of those movies where they talk, and talk, and talk, yet keep you entertained. Except, I don't know any other movie where there is continuous talk, yet keeps you entertained.Valkyrie was truly outstanding. I'm no super film-critic, and I don't really look at the technical aspects of films, unless its extremely obvious (e.g Cloverfield is crap), but this movie, under my standards, really delivered. It had a good cast, with some great scenes here and there. Its obviously been made for people with interests in the WW2 era and the NAZI regime in particular, and it would be understandable that any non-historian would not be interested in this, but I can honestly say that this is a great flick for any regular movie watcher.I think what really makes this movie a hit, is the suspense. We get the idea that Hitler is real bad, so any opposition to him will inevitably end with a death sentence. However, despite all this, brave NAZI officers worked at ending his regime once and for all. It was the suspense of those officers getting caught that kept my eyes stuck facing the TV, and the possibility that they could have been blown at any time and at so many occasions. Like I said previously, the means of delivering this suspense is through talking. In most movies with suspense and action, the 'hit' is delivered through guns, bullets, tanks etc., and that can get boring, but this movie is different, and in a good way! Valkyrie was a great movie overall, and I think its fair to say that an 9/10 would be the best score for it.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"High suspense, top notch cast and a history lesson","This was very good even if it did tend to drag in a couple spots. The level of suspense is pretty high throughout though and the cast is filled with heavy weight actors.

"nice movie, but staffenberg's role doesn't suit tom cruise","Overall I liked the movie, it is really nice. But i felt tom cruise doesn't suit for staffenberg's role. Only American action hero type roles suit him. he is not for these real stories, especially German. He is very much American. Whenever i saw him his face remembered me American military or air force. In the whole movie he never showed the real feeling of the FEAR on his face which shud have been felt by any officer of his rank when taking on Hitler's life and such a big step which would change the world. All the time tom cruise looked highly confident, as he looked in Mission impossible. Another thing abt this movie, I often got feeling of watching American military not German military of WWII. Don't know why ? May be because everyone speaks American English in the version i watched. though i don't understand German. My expectation before watching movie was i wud be in the middle of WWII, inside German military where they are trying to assassin Hitler secretly. But while watching i never felt i was in WWII Germany. yet movie is good, if u watch without expectations, you will really enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Misses The Point,"Valkyrie's account of the failed plot to kill Hitler is no more than a thriller that does not thrill. In theory, it is possible to tell a suspense story about a historical event with a known outcome. Although we know de Gaulle was never assassinated, Day of the Jackal pulls its audience along with the intricate details of how the fictional killer almost brings it off, and how the French security services thwart him at the last minute. It works as a howdunnit. But the story of the plot to kill Hitler is a whydunnit, and Valkyrie takes the why for granted.Because the Nazis give us the luxury of both hindsight and moral certainty, they make us lazy. We know they are absolutely evil, and we know they are going to lose the war. So it is easy to take for granted that Stauffenberg and the other conspirators are making the right choice. They know the regime is evil, they know the war is lost, and they want to make a statement and maybe salvage something from the wreck. It's just what we would think in their place – or so we flatter ourselves.But that reaction is superficial because we are not in their place but in our place, looking back at theirs. What Valkyrie should have done is taken the audience mentally into a world where the Nazis are the established, legitimate government and all good patriots want Germany to win the war, or at least to escape defeat. That takes more than swastika flags over every post office. It takes the creation through dialog of a social atmosphere in which Nazism is conventional and right. Without that baseline, the conspirators' decision to overthrow their own government and embrace defeat is trivial. How have these few men come to think that Hitler is evil and crazy when everyone else still follows him? What led them to choose what everyone around them thinks is wrong? Valkyrie doesn't tell us. Tom Cruise looks like pictures of Stauffenberg, but he conveys nothing of the man's inner life. Without that, Valkyrie has less point than Swing Kids.",5.0,Anonymous,History
A good film that overcame much negative buzz.,"Though not a huge financial success, Valkyrie was certainly not the bomb that many predicted for months leading up to its release. There were problems during shooting with extras being seriously injured, problems in post-production leading to re-shoots. And of course the worst bad buzz inducing thing of all... the release date kept getting moved around. Had Tom Cruise's career finally come to an end??? That is really all we heard in 2008. Though Cruise does not seem to possess the box office clout he once had, it is actually nice to see him begin to transition himself into roles where he can actually play someone in particular. Not just be himself.Cruise plays Col Claus von Stauffenberg, a decorated German combat officer highly critical of Hitler's war effort as the tide begins to turn during WWII. Stauffenberg was clearly not alone in military circles who were outraged at the actions of the SS and certainly knew Hitler had bitten off more than his armies could chew while running roughshod over Europe. After losing an eye, a hand, and some fingers on the other hand during action in Africa, Stauffenberg then devotes himself to joining with other like-minded officers and civilians to overthrow the increasingly eccentric dictator. Singer and company weave a tight and suspenseful story that looks authentic and isn't difficult to follow. And it is quite a feat to keep an audience on edge even when you know how things turned out in the end. Well, maybe with our lack of history in public schools these days, the younger generation might not know the ending. But try getting them to watch anything without 3D CGI anymore.The film does a decent enough job of re-creating Berlin at the time. So much so that the filmmakers came under fire for using so many Nazi symbols. These may have been toned down in post=production as some media types here in the states claimed that there weren't enough of them visible. There is also the question of how much the film glosses over the Holocaust taking place concurrently. Just how much did these people know? Stauffenberg in the opening scene remarks into his journal about the killing of Jews, and later plans on closing the concentration camps after the new government has assumed command. But really, not much else is said about this issue. Really at the end of the day, Valkyrie is just a good historical thriller. Of course these work best for those of us who don't know every detail about the actual events and can swallow the Hollywood touches a little more easily. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",8.0,Anonymous,History
too long overdue - valkyrie,"MOVIE. Im not a great fan of Tom Cruise but for political thrillers ""Valkyrie"" it's Tom Cruises best movie since ""a few good men"" in 1993 but it's also his best movie. I was impressed the movie was better than I anticipated. 9 out of 10.HISTORY. Stories about the German resistance are too long overdue but there is an institutionalised agenda to limit or even stop public awareness about them. I don't believe the director realises the door to history that has been inadvertently opened with ""Valkyrie"" and it 's historical impact. The most crucial part of the movie is the bomb plot on 20 July 1944 and the political coup. The bomb plot occurred on the last day of ""operation good wood"" on 20 July 1944 when the allies began to break out of the DDay lodgment area. Although inferred in the movie is the grave mistake made by a German officer not portrayed in the movie whom failed to make certain the Valkyrie codes had the ""highest priority"" when orders were communicated to the German army or wehrmacht. Consequently, when the conspirators put operation Valkyrie into effect the wehrmacht also received orders from Fuhrer HQ or Adolf Hitlers headquarters to counter Valkyrie and this is where the plot came unstuck. Had the Valkyrie codes been given the ""highest priority"" the wehrmacht would have ignored any further communications from Adolf Hitlers HQ and the conspirators probably would have succeeded.COSTUMES/PROPS. Although the producers claimed to make a considerable effort with costumes and authenticity i was disappointed here. Soldiers were often seen wearing a dark green mark 1940 pattern combat helmet which matches more closely the color of post war West German border police of the 1960's rather than 1944 field Grey tones. In 1944 the long boots worn by soldiers had largely disappeared and were replaced by ankle boots with British like gaiters. The K98 bolt action rifle although still in use was not too prominent in 1944 because German soldiers were being issued semi-automatic rifles instead including the worlds first assault rifle the MP44 and the Gewehr43 rifle. There was also the Gewehr 41 made by either Walther or Mauser which saw combat in Normandy. Some of the props were below expectation and appeared to ruin an excellent movie the worst of which was the outer checkpoint for the ""Wolf's Lair"" where a cheap shack and sand bags were included in the set and where soldiers were wearing the wrong uniforms.EDITING. The editing could have made a huge impression on the audience if there were and should have been more ""long"" shots in the movie. Long shots particularly of Von Stauffenburg and his Ajutant Leutenant Haeften should have been used to emphasise the grand German architecture of the 1940's wartime to make the audience feel they're in Nazi Germany.This could have been achieved showing the two main characters, the colonel and his adjutant, walking the staircases to Hitlers residence or the ministry with guards in dress uniform at attention. Modern computer graphics like that used in King Kong to reconstruct a 1930's New York or Chicago could have been useful here too.CAST. High profile British and American actors probably did this movie a great justice ""selling it"" to a world wide audience. However, the German actors that were cast did an excellent job and looked the part in their roles too. The only role i didn't like was the role of General Keitel played by a British actor with a horrible British accent and was obese and looked like the drunk grandfather Dingle from the British soap Emmerdale.Yuk.Valkyrie, is a very good movie breaking historical ground.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Tense, Suspense-Filled Drama on the Sacrifice of a Hero","Tall, handsome, cultured and an aristocrat, Claus von Stauffenburg is one of the most interesting and fascinating enigmas in history. One of the leading conspirators in the final plot against Adolf Hitler's life, he symbolized the resistance against tyranny and evil. ""Valkyrie"" is a compelling recreation of the dramatic events in the assassination attempt that brought an empire to its knees. Without wasting a second the film dives straight into the heart of the matter ably revealing the intense, fevered atmosphere as the plot unfolds into climax and tragedy. The pageantry and sinister vibe of Nazi Germany are well-depicted as they serve an appropriate backdrop to the good acting, directing and cinematography. Like many of his films Tom Cruise's portrayal of the doomed Stauffenberg is erratic. It's taken for granted he's no Pacino and De Niro but given a role closer to his personality like the manic-driven Lestat in ""Interview with the Vampire"" he shines. With a more complex and subtle character like Stauffenberg he fumbles. Many scenes show him forgetting his role as the bemused look on his eyes and features highlight an actor appreciating his role but forgetting to actually play it. One fact going for him is he quite resembles the real life Stauffenberg and the actor portraying Hitler is a striking lookalike to the bonus of the film. Fixating from start to finish this edge of your seat thriller is a model on how historical and suspense films should be done and is a highlight in art and as a tribute and memorial to heroes and why they should always be remembered.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Historical thriller,"A general consensus for those who don't delve deeper into history, is that the German people did nothing to stop Hitler. The story is compelling and should be a part of upper high school and college history classes. The saying, ""history repeats itself"" is no truer than in today's headlines. The world has always lived (and died) with violent dictators (Ghengis Khan, Mao, Pol Pot, Idi Amin, etc. ). We currently witness the hermit kingdom of North Korea---run by Kim Jung Un in brutal fashion. A most interesting thing was to see an image of world electricity use (night photos from satellites) and the ability to pick out huge international cities such as Paris, New York, Tokyo, etc. Looking across the globe photos, one can see less lighting in the Australian Outback and the continent of Africa---and the only nation on Earth in total blackout was North Korea.My one criticism of Valkyrie was the accents. Tom Cruise used a mundane American accent ? And there were several distinct British accents on what was supposed to be German leaders...and then some officers and soldiers used German accents. The disparity was somewhat offputting.",8.0,Anonymous,History
I love it!,"Bryan Singer faced a significant challenge when creating a suspenseful plot for his historical drama. The challenge was how to keep the audience engaged when the outcome of the historical event is already well-known. However, Singer crafted an expertly woven thriller that centers around a failed attempt by a group of German officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler in the Summer of 1944.Tom Cruise plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, a disillusioned officer who joins a clandestine committee with plans to replace Hitler. The aim is to seize control of Germany and forge an alliance with the Western Allies to protect the nation from the Russian forces. Despite the intricate plot, each conspirator maintains their composure as von Stauffenberg triggers a bomb inside Hitler's Wolf's Lair in Rastenburg.The film features an ensemble cast that surpasses most productions. Alongside Cruise, there are British talents Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, and Tom Hollander, as well as exceptional European actors Thomas Kretschmann, Christian Berkel, and Carice van Houten. The visuals are stunning and chilling, authentically recreating a Berlin adorned with Nazi insignia and teeming with uniformed troops that cast a foreboding shadow over humanity.Although the film carries a Hollywood essence, Christopher McQuarrie's script adds a touch of genuine sophistication. The respect accorded to the message and sacrifice of these men is palpable throughout. It is not only visually captivating but also a poignant portrayal of WWII.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Wrong way Valkyrie,"The age-old Hollywood problem of how to recreate a famous historical event either through realism or accentuation rears its head again in this Bryan Singer-helmed Tom Cruise-starring depiction of the failed von Stauffenburg assassination attempt on Hitler which, if successful could have changed the direction of the Second World War.A studier of history like myself, while pleased in a way to see the bravery of Von Stauffenburg and his cohorts recognised in film does however think that a more truthful low-key approach would have served this serious subject matter better. However what we get here is a sort of ""Mission Impossible"" for the war era with real life characters reduced to Hollywood-created ciphers and while the film acquires a kinetic energy as it moves towards its doomed conclusion, as stated, the film-maker takes the easy option of giving it the big blockbuster treatment, with over-intrusive soundtrack, various skillful but irrelevant camera tricks and worst of all dialogue which rates alongside ""Braveheart"" and ""Pearl Harbour"" for (lack of) weight and substance.On the plus side, the production values are top-notch, with excellent sets, costumes and particularly the utilisation of period motor and flying vehicles. However, we again get the wild assortment of accents as none of the heavyweight UK/US cast attempt even the semblance of a German accent throughout the whole movie (even Hitler!) and yet every printed word on display is in the original German. The acting is okay although Cruise is of course just wrong, wrong, wrong in the central part - I was reminded of Cary Grant in ""The Pride and The Passion"" or even Errol Flynn as General Custer and nobody else really rises above playing the uniforms - no-one actor appears at any time to really inhabit their role, which is the least I'd say they owe to the memory of this brave band of conspirators.The impact (no pun intended) of the crucial bomb scene is again weakened by the crassness of the heightened build-up to the event in time-worn thriller-style and whilst the fall-out scenes which follow as the fortunes of the attempted coup flow and inevitably ebb better draw in the viewer, by then the overall effect has been diminished by what has gone before.Maybe I'm too precious about matters of authentication but I feel the big-budget action-suspense approach taken here works only with fictional stories and that screen adaptations of actual war-time events benefit immeasurably from a more realistic, documentary-style approach. If you want to see my point in action check out ""Downfall"", a quite brilliant German-language production covering the last days of the Third Reich which manages to harrowingly but engrossingly grip the viewer until the bitter end.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Good Account Of The Lead-Up To And The Aftermath Of The July 20 Plot Against Hitler,"I have to give credit for a pretty detailed, largely step by step account, detailing the machinations leading up to the July 20, 1944 attempt by a group of Army officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler and seize power in Germany, as well as for offering much detail about the aftermath of the failed attempt, and the ultimate collapse of the coup. Beginning with Col. Claus von Stauffenberg being recruited into the group of conspirators, and ending with his execution, the movie revolves around him, and its title is taken from orders issued to the German Reserve Army to seize control of Berlin on Hitler's death (""Operation Valkyrie."")If you are at all interested in this period of history (and why else watch this movie) you won't find anything particularly surprising in this, and there certainly isn't any suspense about the outcome. It's simply a pretty good documentation of it. The history is decent enough. I personally think that the movie exaggerated Stauffenberg's role in the coup attempt (and even more his authority over it.) Still, there's no doubt that he was an important figure and deserved to be centre-stage in this dramatization of it. Tom Cruise was an interesting choice to play Stauffenberg. He did well with the part, although Cruise as a German officer (even as an anti-Nazi German officer) was a bit of a stretch.In a broad sense, the July 20 plot wasn't especially consequential. Hitler survived, the War went on and the conspirators were executed. Not a lot really changed because of this. The plot did, however, make it obvious to everyone (including the German people) that there was active opposition to Hitler at high levels. The reasons for the opposition were varied, but as much as we might like to think so had little to do with moral qualms about Hitler's or Nazi ideology, and almost everything to do with the belief that Hitler and the Nazis were leading Germany to destruction by mismanaging the war. So, was Stauffenberg the hero the movie makes him out to be? Hard to say, but he certainly deserves his place in history. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

A racy film that insults these great and truly NOBLE men,"Valkyrie is a racy film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, although of course we all know how this story turns out. Unfortunately, it is told in such a way as to advance the post-modern agenda, continuing--albeit passively--the massive destruction of the Nazis into the post-Nazi era. Occidental civilisation is still committing suicide, and cultural barons such as these filmmakers are the reasons why. In no particular order:1. It is true that the Nazis' systematic internment and gassing of millions of Jews was a horrid crime. So was the similar treatment they gave to an unknown number--probably millions--of non-Jews. So was their brutal bulldozing of Ukraine and European Russia. Klaus von Stauffenberg's memorial makes it sound as though the gassing of Jews was Hitler's only crime. It was not.Now before you cast me as a closet anti-Semite, my objection is not to the depiction of the Jews as victims but to the shameless post-modern exploitation of racism, sexism, ""ageism"" and ""homophobia"" for profit, or worse--a grievous sin against both productivity and fairness. Look up ""Southern Poverty Law Center"" and ""ACORN."" Incidentally, one of my closest friends--an agnostic Jewess--is in agreement with me about the disgusting and exploitive ""Holocaust Industry.""2. Klaus von Stauffenberg was first and foremost a pious man and a pedigreed aristocrat who believed above all in the supreme authority of God and in the legitimacy of terrestrial rulers. His beliefs were deeply seated from a transmission of many generations of faith and legitimate power. He was aware that tyrannicide is a delicate matter in Catholic theology and only justifiable under the gravest circumstances.You would never know that from watching this film. Stauffenberg's Catholic religion is glossed over in the beginning and then never mentioned again, as though God had abandoned these great Christians in their noble struggle. (My own theory, based on my limited knowledge of Maistre, is that their failure was allowed as a punishment on Europe for turning its back on God. But God never abandoned these great men: they are, today, in a place where they no longer suffer the treachery of us, their colourless subjects.) Nor is Stauffenberg shown to consult, as he did, with Cardinal Count Preysing of Berlin, who advised Stauffenberg of the morality of this move and even risked his own life to help the plot.3. Tom Cruise cannot act in any role except Ethan Hunt. Casting him as the great aristocrat Klaus von Stauffenberg is an insult to this latter man's memory.Shame, shame, shame, shame. Any chance you get to overheat the film lamp or throw a DVD in the microwave, take it. Wipe this shameful underreporting off the map of history.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Nein Duetsch Tom,"I knew Tom Cruise couldn't fake a foreign accent, like many of his contemporaries: Gary Oldman, Leonardo DiCaprio, even comic Robin Williams, amongst others. Kenneth Brannagh is British and when Europeans speak English they have a similar accent to a German speaking English, so that's passable.I despise films where an American actor cannot do a foreign accent, because so many can. I recall John Wayne, portraying a German sea captain in 'The Sea Chase,' and he sounds like John Wayne in 'Hondo' or any other film he made. He had a typical monotone way of speaking and was one of the worst actors in the history of Hollywood.I like Tom Cruise, particularly in 'Eyes Wide Shut.' As far as 'Valkyrie' is concerned, I'm taking time out to write a review and then I'll continue with the film (which is on pause), but I won't change my '3' rating because it is b-a-a-a-a-d. Lastly, Valkyrie is the wrong spelling. Auf Deutsch, it is spelled 'Walkyrie,' as the 'W' is pronounced with a 'V' sound, as anyone who is a fan of Wagner (pronounced 'Vahgnair') would attest to. Incidentally, I love Wagner's music, especially 'The Ride of the Walkyries,' (from the opera 'Die Walkyrie') even though he was Hitler's favorite composer. At least Hitler had good taste in music.",3.0,Anonymous,History
it could have been a much better film,"The plot to kill Adolf Hitler put together in July 1944 by a group of military was the last in a series of attempts to kill the head of the Third Reich and save what could be saved of the German honor, and spare Germany the total defeat and unconditional surrender. This is one of the most fascinating and intriguing pages of the history of World War II and any film that is inspired by this action has interesting premises to base upon despite the fact that the end is known to everybody. The plot failed and the was continued for another ten months, Adolf Hitler committed suicide and escaped human justice, but not the justice of history.The man who led the plot and who had the courage to put a bomb in the meeting room where the commanders of the German army were gathered together with Adolf Hitler is one of the fascinating characters of history. He was a complex character, that his wife Nina von Stauffenberg who survived him for more than half a century described in the following words: He let things come to him, and then he made up his mind ... one of his characteristics was that he really enjoyed playing the devil's advocate. Conservatives were convinced that he was a ferocious Nazi, and ferocious Nazis were convinced he was an unreconstructed conservative. He was neither.Claus von Stauffenberg is the principal character in Valkyrie, the historic thriller directed by Bryan Singer. Tom Cruise could have been the ideal casting, even if he is about ten years older than the age of 37 that Stauffenberg had at the time of the events. He was not, as both director and lead actor seem to focus on the action side of the story, on the details of the plot that involved activating a program designed by Hitler himself that mobilized the reserve army in the eventuality of a successful plot to the life of the Fuhrer, and on the reasons - mostly of human nature and of hazard - that lead to the failure of the plot. The historic details are interesting, but the documentary quality is not enough to fully sustain a Hollywood production with stars of such quality, and too little of the human dimensions, dilemmas, fears of the plotters make it beyond the screen.'Valkyrie' could have been a much more interesting film, a drama focused on the tragic complicity of the German military class with the criminal Nazi regime and the choice that few of them made to become traitors to their country in order to save something of the honor of the nation. Instead of that we get a docu-drama made with the expensive means of the Hollywood studios, which bows respectfully to the plotters of July 1944, but fails to bring on screen their human and true historic dimensions.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Amazing film which Tom Cruise RUINED!,"Well, to be honest he didn't ruin the movie, but Tom Cruise was horribly cast for this role and he and whoever selected him to have any part (let alone a main part) in this film is responsible for turning a 10 grade movie down to a 5 grade. Casting is everything. He seemed totally misplaced and wrong for the film. It's like choosing Cruise for Schindler's List instead of Liam Neason; he keeps it from being a serious historical movie. Cruise is great in many movies, but he has a strictly modern acting style and personality which is anachronistic in a WWII film like this and is distracting and incongruous. Everyone else (and I mean everyone) was beautifully cast for the film, skillfully selected, and most actors actually closely resembled the real people. Bravo. But Tom Cruise, while somewhat similar in face to the real Claus, just has zero 'command' or 'presence' in the film, especially for a leading role and a high rank of colonel. Plus he is too short, doesn't look German, and combine that with a kid-like face and teenage voice, and you just can't take this guy seriously for this role. And the grandchildren of the real Claus actually openly told Tom Cruise to turn down the role and told him to get out of Germany, because they felt he was a totally wrong selection for the role. To me, the right choice would have been Eric Bana (who did superbly in Munich and who has the height and face which closely resembles Claus) or James Marsden or many others who have more screen presence and who are less kid-like in appearance and voice. A real shame. Otherwise, a wonderfully directly and scripted movie and a cast of actors who are perfect!",5.0,Anonymous,History

The depiction of this small group at last wanting to get rid of this madman raised the question,where had they been since 1933 when it all started?I recall most Germans (after all we know post war it was hard to find any Nazi's) soldiers,civilians,the whole lot of them enjoyed VICTORY- the Condor Legion in Spain,Anschluss,conquering Europe & Russia-always remembering it was only those damned English who spoiled things by not surrendering in 1940. As for those Russian animals,Serbs,Jews etc.-Well,the Wehrmacht were only good soldiers,just like the U Boat crews who never really liked their job!So the movie shows that finally the proud Prussian spirit rose up & tried to straighten things out- a little late,though I feel this film may not be too popular in Leningrad, Stalingrad,Moscow or Tel Aviv?With no thanks to the Count & colleagues, Operation Sealion postponed, Dunkirk & the Flying Few saved us & the world from being 'Germanized'So this good Movie makes me rethink how 'lucky' we were to survive- and how so few Germans ever realized the horror they inflicted & tried finally to do something;sadly in the movie their motivation is not well discussed,other than now WE are suffering?I suspect if they had succeeded their new autocracy would have still fought to the bitter end?

Good Movie in spite of Tom Cruise,"Had any SERIOUS actor chose to take on the lead role besides Tom Cruise, this would have been a flawless film. I'm not a Cruise-basher in any sense, but this was a film about a German character set in WWII. My disappointment stems from Cruise's decision not to even attempt a German accent which distracts from what this project COULD have become.I tire of Tom Cruise promoting himself as an A-List Actor without demonstrating that he deserves to be there. How many accents have we heard Meryl Streep portray over the course of her career. Nearly every film that bears her name portrays new characters with new accents and even new body languages... the sign of a TRUE actor. Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Heath Ledger are included amongst the elite of the acting community... not through self proclamation, but through REAL talent.The fact that Tom chose to pull a ""Keanu Reeves"" and just fake his way through this film... shows that maybe he needs to turn his attention toward sitting out on the sidewalk with the other Scientologist to sell their wares to the unsuspecting tourist of Hollywood Blvd.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Valkyrie is based on the true story of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) and the daring and ingenious plot to eliminate one of the most evil tyrants the world has ever known.A proud military man, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg is a loyal officer who serves his country all the while hoping that someone will find a way to stop Hitler before Europe and Germany are destroyed. Realizing that time is running out, he decides that he must take action himself and joins the German resistance.

A below average film with no thrilling!,"I was looking forward to seeing the film and was pleased from the beginning then everything went off the record and was boring. Tom's performance wasn't convincing at all I thought he was himself and the character wasn't attractive at all with absolutely no reactions until near the end not because it is about war it should be as he performed it. Also the difference in it's personality after the beginning wasn't much convincing too as I read about stauffenberg and he said ""remarked to friends never to have really known what to do with so many fingers when he still had all of them"" which refers to a very solid and aggressive character. Everything was good at the beginning and in the end, the music, the cinematography, the acting was better, but along the film it was very average and boring with plots though I had't read about the operation much easily predicted. won't recommend it. 5.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History

"A Tom Cruise action movie, not a serious historical drama","Today's movie was ""Valkyrie"" (2008), a historical World War II drama directed by Bryan Singer. In Canada, it's available on Prime Video, Hoopla, and TubiTV. It's on Fubo, MGM+, Ruku, Hoopla, TubiTV, PlutoTV and FilmBox in the United States.My 5 of 10 review is at:It's a historical World War II drama set in Germany in 1943-1944. It opens in 1943 when Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) was seriously injured in battle in North Africa. The film then follows Stauffenberg's joining the resistance movement that included General von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh), General Beck (Terence Stamp), General Olbricht (Bill Nighy), political leader Carl Friedrich Goerdeler (Kevin McNally), Field General Witzleben (David Schofield) and Colonel von Quirnheim (Christian Berkel). We also meet General Fromm (Tom Wilkinson), head of the Reserve Army which was critical to Operation Valkyrie.The film shows Stauffenberg convincing the others to use, as part of the assignation plot, the Valkyrie plan authorized by Hitler to provide continuity of government in the case of an emergency. Generals Fromm and Olbricht headed the Reserve Army utilized in the plan. It follows efforts to get Adolf Hitler (David Bamber) to sign off on a revised plan and the subsequent efforts by Stauffenberg to plant a bomb near Hitler at a military briefing, and the consequences when things go wrong.The script for ""Valkyrie"" treats the historical event like a 1950s World War II movie--it's all plot and action, with no exploration of motivation. And Stauffenberg's motivation for participation in the plot is highly fertile ground for exploration. Tom Cruise's Stauffenberg is the commanding center of everything, while others like Olbricht and Fromm are portrayed as weasels. Some of the dialogue is very contrived, and the musical score belongs in a thriller. Interestingly, it's now clear that Stauffenberg did not originate the Valkyrie idea (it was Tresckow).""Valkyrie"" is a Tom Cruise action movie, not a serious historical drama.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Tom Cruise out of his league?,"As seems normal for American big-budget movies of a historical nature, this must be seen as 'based on fact' rather than factual. The conspirators didn't get anywhere near the control of Berlin and Germany as Is suggested here. Indeed, some of the factual errors are huge - For example, Himmler Is shown not In his all-black SS uniform, but In the field-grey of the Wehrmacht(regular army) which Is a mistake of the highest order. He had no connection with the Wehrmacht In any form. Indeed, despite his presence and plenty of talk regarding the SS, not a single SS man or black SS uniform Is ever seen, especially silly when one considers that Hitlers' personal Bodyguard of two thousand SS men were In close proximity to him at all times. Then we see men In the brown uniforms of the SA (Sturmabteilung), an organisation disbanded In 1934, a full 10 years before the date In which these events are set. Hitler and his confidantes (Keitel, Himmler, Goering, Goebbels)look like comical caricatures rather than representations of the real people. Perhaps this was Intentional, but that makes It all the more puerile. Despite all of this, If you're a war-movie buff or just a person who likes to root for the underdog, then you'll enjoy this movie, Historians and purists will hate It. It's otherwise very well made, although where exactly the $75 Million budget went (other than In the pocket of Mr. Cruise) one can only speculate. The cast - mainly English actors - are superb and Bill Nighy In particular Is excellent as General Olbricht. Why Tom Cruise was chosen for Stauffenberg I simply cannot fathom. He's good at action movies, but this was beyond him and he's put to shame by the excellence of the other cast members. Stauffenberg had aristocratic bearing which Cruise couldn't replicate. Apparently, the whole cast were ordered to refrain from putting on German accents because poor Mr.Cruise couldn't do one, so even the German actors had to speak without an accent! Okay so an accent Isn't really necessary but It adds to the realism. Why didn't they simply get a more suitable man for the part? Tom should stick to what he's best at - this was way beyond him.",3.0,Anonymous,History

German WWII conspiracy lost in translation,"I'll make it short. Any movie based on historical events has already lost most of its suspense from the outset. This movie is no different. However a strong performance by the Director and cast can make up for this. Valkyrie is based on one of many failed attempts to kill Hitler during WWII. Tom Cruise plays the main character and does so convincingly. All other actors (and mind you this is a star class of actors) play their parts very well.What doesn't work and this is why I rate it the way I do, is the fact that almost all of the suspense is killed by the English language. It is the very essence of the menace of the Nazi regime and the very insidious image of Adolf Hitler that is now lost in translation. This movie would have been an A plus if it had used the German language and if that resulted in a few star actors having to be replaced by native German speakers, so be it. The Dutch actresses actually make it look somewhat authentic European, although their roles are too marginal to actually save the entire film.This film might work for the US market, since they don't like subtitles but for the European market, it does not work even though the events depicted are part of the single most important era in European history (if not world history).",4.0,Anonymous,History

As it is, we have an American in the lead role surrounded by a bunch of Englishmen playing Germans. Even Adolph Hitler has a British accent(!). Not a bad movie at all though - you feel for the guys involved in this complicated plot and know that they did more for Germany than anyone under the Reich flag did in the end.Worth a viewing as there is plenty of suspense and drama for most. It also tells another side of Nazi Germany that most people never think about - that some Germans DID think that Hitler was crazy and were brave enough to stop him - at least fifteen such times by the movie's count.",,Anonymous,History
illustrations,"I didn't find anything here that i wasn't expecting, and nothing i expected to be here was absent. This is a bad premise to commenting on a movie. The thing is, i don't expect much of Bryan Singer. Yes, he gave us ""usual suspects"" which has some narrative interest in how the flashbacks are used and in how we redefine all that we'd seen with the final twist. But even there the direction was stylish, which means he chose effect over meaning, appearance over flesh. But clearly he is one of those guys who gets carried away by his immense enthusiasm, but than doesn't have the brain to bend his emotions to a coherent structure. Like him, so do think most of the common film goers, especially those who would flock to a movie like this. So, we have a box office success.But if you want to go further, you'll find very little to interest you here. The one thing that matters is the story itself. What these guys tried to make was big, not because of the act in itself (certainly many Germans would want to do the same if they could) but because they were privileged Germans, who could just play the Nazi game. Of course by than the end of the war was close and they felt that, so killing Hitler might also be a way to protect the future of those who were around him. In any case, it was a brave attempt. But that can be told by a simple documentary, like the one in the extras of this DVD. The film is a mere illustration of the events. It's like those re enactments of historical facts in the History channel docs, with a (much) higher budget. But apart from that it is pretty useless, except for a minor entertainment value.Well, the writers tried to build on the tension by not allowing us to understand or check Hitler after the bomb exploded. That tension is mildly well done, because it elects a narrator, it makes us live the lives of the dissidents. But we knew what had happened, so even that fails.After the incredible participation of Cruise in Tropic Thunder, i would expect he would keep redeeming his career, but here he goes back to his usual numb thing.

Valkyrie Is No Masterpiece But It Brings An Important Historical Piece To Light,"As informative as it is intriguing, Valkyrie is a finely carved, swiftly paced & well acted historical account that takes a leaflet out of the countless unforgettable events which occurred during the Second World War, and brings it to cinematic life in a tense & gripping fashion but what hinders it from making the desired impact is Tom Cruise's own star presence.Though this film is no masterpiece, it does bring to light the legacy of Claus von Stauffenberg & his noble cause to show the world that not everyone in Germany shared Hitler's ideals.

A missed turning point in history?,"Tom Cruise heads an impressive cast of mostly British actors (including but not limited to Kenneth Branagh, Terence Stamp and Tom Wilkinson) in the story of a failed coup against Hitler by his miliary/industrial complex.Not being an expert of the period I don't know how accurate it is (I have seen the same story told more briefly in ""Night of the Generals"" and ""War and Remembrance""). But it turns out to be a tragedy of errors (to paraphrase Shakespeare). It is vital to note it starts saying it's ""based"" on a true story. Suggesting it does indulge in flights of fancy.Many attempts were made against Hitler, often by the military, but he survived them all. If you don't believe in a personal devil, perhaps it's time you reconsidered. Only a very real devil could have kept that awful man alive in a war that killed millionsThe movie is well done, but it wastes lots of time showing Cruise shaving or riding around in cars.I refuse to use the word ""important"" to any work of art, especially movies (disclaimer: I am an artist) but this is one everyone should see.One curious point: if there is any discussion weighing the politics of assassination (assassination is a political act that George Bernard Shaw referred to as the ultimate form of censorship) I missed it. The rightness or wrongness of assassination was not important, only whether they could get away with it.Please note this was after the Communists infiltrated in his staff had urged Roosevelt to insist upon ""unconditional surrender"" (to Churchill's surprise) thus already condemning much of Europe and certainly Germany and its people to unnecessary death and destruction; Roosevelt's declaration meant the German people were fighting for their very lives and possibly extended the war.At one time I'd have thought Cruise too lightweight to pull this off, especially up against British heavyweights.
