A Visual Achievement,"A film that explores the dark and miserable town, Basin City, and tells the story of three different people, all caught up in violent corruption.Although the use of digital filming and CGI is very contentious, Robert Rodriguez found a way to make it work to his advantage in a way that may not have been possible with traditional film. The way the black and white brings the noir to life, blending smoothly with the rare other colors... it is the only way to bring a comic book to life. (A similar style is in ""The Spirit"", which does not get nearly the respect it deserves.)This casting is incredible, as it is varied and really brought the best performances out of Alexis Bledel, Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba that their careers ever had. Mickey Rourke was re-invented, and this may have been one of the last great Bruce Willis roles. Such a powerful film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Comic Adaptation Ever,"In Sin City nobody is innocent, not even the Bishop, and they are going to pay for that.The movie is based, both the story and aesthetics, in the noir comic by Frank Miller, who is also co-director of the film,together with Robert Rodriguez; Quentin Tarantino was invited to direct one of the scenes. The movie intertwines four different stories, whose characters will cross paths at certain point: The Customer Is Always Right, The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard The movie is visually stunning and stylish. It looks and feels like a real noir comic, with camera framing and positioning typical of comic vignettes, as well as the use of high contrast B&W and chiaroscuro. The movie has wonderful black, white and sepia tones with cutout reds and bright colors, a technique widely used in Photography and drawing, but never used in movies before. The movie was completely shot using green backgrounds.The movie is heart-attack paced, with no a moment of dullness or rest. However, is not for the heart faint, as it is extremely violent and gory, very hard to watch sometimes. The fact that those being punished deserve it, does not make the violence easier to swallow.The characters are never dull, very human - never good or bad, but both things. Moreover, they are at very melancholic types, funny and merciless.The movie delights the viewer with terrific performances by a large group of A-listed actors. However, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen and Rosario Dawson really shine through. Jessica Alba and Elija Wood, who are usually a bore, are terrific in their respective roles, too.The best comic adaptation I have ever seen.Entertainment and quality together. Brilliant",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A very dark (lol) action noir drama...,"I watched the 'Unrated, Recut and Extended' version of the movie, which is pretty different from the theatrical version of the film (which I've also watched). It's really a 'superhero movie' like those DC/Marvel movies in disguise... these people have super powers, but it isn't explicitly stated. The movie was also breathed-upon by Quentin Tarantino and it totally shows... this is a very 'Quentin Tarantino-esque' movie. It's filled with action, though there's a good amount of drama and story/plot mixed in so that you don't get numb to the bombardment of constant action. Each of the characters are heavily unique yet extremely stereotypically portrayed (for good reason). Overall it's a good film and eventhough this type of movie will only appeal to a small percentage of general audiences, I would recommend that you watch it at least once if you're not certain, as it is really a pretty good movie, especially given the unique artistic choice with the dark art style.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Bold, Brilliant and Totally Badass","With Hellboy, Guillermo Del Toro lovingly recreated panels from artist/creator Mike Mignola's comic book stories and brought them to vibrant life, setting a new benchmark for adaptations that respect their source material. With Sin City, however, co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller have done more than just recreate the brutal chiaroscuro of Miller's stark post-modern noir artwork, they've captured the essence and the aesthetic of Basin City (as much a character as Marv or Hartigan) and brought its universe and characters to a stunning three-dimensional life. And unlike Hellboy, which suffered from a weak, confusing script, Sin City weaves a Pulp Fiction-esque narrative which snakes through the dark streets and crooked alleyways of this hellish metropolis like a fever dream.In short, Sin City delivers a blistering ballet of bullets and blood, dames and danger at every turn. It's a kinetic masterpiece of pop culture for the new millennium (and a case could be made that this was the movie that CGI was invented for).As a Frank Miller fan for over 25 years, I know his work and I know Sin City  and this Sin City will knock your socks off whether you are a fan or a newcomer to the dark delights of his devilish imagination and brutal style. Exceeding my expectations on all levels, this movie ranks as one of the most enjoyable cinema-going experiences I've had in years.Everything works here. From Rodriguez's cinematography and editing, to the seamless direction (no mean feat when you consider Robert co-directed with Miller and Quentin Tarantino joined the mix as ""Special Guest Director""), to the spot-on casting. The script gives Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro plenty of opportunity to chew the scenery  and they do, especially Rourke, who, despite having his mug buried under a thick layer of gruesome latex, delivers one of the best performances of his career and steals the show as Marv, the giant thug with a broken heart. The ladies hold their own, too. Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy and Jaime King are all great in their roles, particularly Dawson as machine gun-wielding Dominatrix/Hooker-Godmother Gail. And kudos to Elijah Wood (proving there is life after Hobbits) and Nick Stahl who deliver contrasting performances as vile villains, the ultra-creepy Kevin and the disgusting Yellow bastard, respectively.Sin City is smart, stylish, sexy and sick. It's also violent and funny. Certainly not a film for the whole family, but for those of us who enjoy our movies rated R, this flick kicks the head and the gut like a mule.Here's hoping Sin City makes a mint, for there are 10,000 stories in the naked (sinful) city, and this is but a handful of them. I'm already praying for a sequel.A picture perfect ""ten"" for this cineast.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Like reading a comic book - literally,"Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller (who also co-directed and wrote the screenplay) Sin City tells three stories of crime, corruption, and redemption set in the fictional town 'Basin City'. The first story details the quest of Marv (Mickey Rourke) who searches town for the man who murdered Goldie (Jamie King), the woman he believes to be his one true love. The second tells of Dwight (Clive Owen) who must cover up the death of a corrupt police officer (Benicio Del Toro) in order to avoid a war between the cops, and the girls of old town, led by Gail. (Rosiaro Dawson) The final story shows Hartigan, (Bruce Willis) a beat up retired cop framed for a crime he didn't commit, trying to save the life of a girl whose life he saved at a young age, who grew up to become a stripper, (Jessica Alba) while all the while being tracked by a mysterious stranger with a grotesque appearance. (Nick Stahl)It's a churning vat of old fashioned pulp style stories, each one more dark and edgy then the last. And yet, Sin City itself is morbidly fascinating; if you don't mind delving through the haze of sleaze, violence and corruption you'll find a really compelling story underneath the hard exterior. Sin City exudes the essence of classic film noir, except combined with over-the-top violence, characters and dialogue to maintain that comic book feel. Giving co-director status to creator Frank Miller and allowing him to write the screenplay was perhaps the wisest move director Robert Rodriguez ever made, because Miller's gritty influence shines through, perfectly capturing the mood of his original creations.And the visuals... extraordinary. The entire film is shot in black and white, except for certain items which appear in colour. (a red dress, red blood, although sometimes the blood is stark white, and not to mention Nick Stahl's character, Yellow Bastard, who is, indeed, yellow) Rodriguez is also smart enough to use a greenscreen backdrop, so as to recreate Miller's gritty, moody sets by computer animation instead of trying to create them first hand. And it works, wonderfully - the sets perfectly set the tone for the rest of the movie: dark, bold, over-the-top and quality work unlike any other. Add the characters' noirish costumes (almost every male character sports, as Marv puts it, a ""damn fine coat"") unique appearances, (it says a lot for the quality of the movie when a character like Yellow Bastard doesn't seem out of place) and movement (take note that if the movie was paused at any given point, the frame would look like a panel from a comic book) and Miller and Rodriguez perfectly nail the comic book feel.It also helps that a wonderful cast has been assembled to bring life to the mayhem. Spot on performances abroad here, but the standouts in my opinion were Elijah Wood, who was truly chilling as Kevin, the silent, cannibalistic serial killer; Nick Stahl as Roarke Junior/Yellow Bastard, a truly creepy and disgusting character; Clive Owen, playing against type as Dwight; (who isn't exactly a sophisticated, British gentleman, but then again, no one in this film is) Mickey Rourke as Marv, managing to turn out a stunning performance, even with his face buried under several layers of latex; Benicio Del Toro almost unrecognizable as corrupt cop Jackie Boy and a welcome appearance from Michael Clarke Duncan as Manute, an enforcer specializing in inflicting pain. The hard edged ladies also do a great job, with Jessica Alba, Rosiaro Dawson, Carla Gugino, Jamie King and the rest all giving great performances.It's all in the style of such films as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, so it may be wise to use those films as guidelines of what to expect in terms of content. It's true that Sin City is not for everyone: the violence is brutal and unflinching, most characters are disreputable, manipulative and sleazy, and the whole feel of the film is undesirable, and not too cheery. But if none of that deters you, Sin City should be known as a must see, for the superb visual stylistics if nothing else. But the style and feel of the comic books is perfectly captured and thrust into our faces. Frank Miller must be proud.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
caught the Philly sneak preview,"I caught the Philly sneak preview of ""Sin City"" yesterday, and I have to say my hat is off. Few comic book movies have ever looked good on screen. The X-Men and Spider Man movies have done a good job breaking that stigma. In my opinion the aforementioned flicks have been a perfect melding of Hollywood and the Comic book universe, but ""Sin City"" elevates it to an art form, literally. It is hands down, the best representation of a comic book turned film ever. After catching the trailer on a TV commercial, I was intrigued, to say the least. So I went to my local comic book store and bought the Frank Miller books the movie is based on, and enjoyed them for their off beat humor, incredible violence, and stories of love, lust, friendship, honor and seedily-earned redemption in the underworld of fictional Basin City. Upon further contact with the Comic Book store owner, he clued me in to the sneak preview on the 16th of March (yesterday as I post this), so like a kid on his way to pick up the latest issues of whatever comics are popular these days, I took the day off and went to the showing. Having recently read the stories that are included in the film (""Sin City,"" later renamed to ""The Hard Goodbye""; ""The Big Fat Kill;"" and ""That Yellow Bastard""), I was amazed at how much of the dialogue and narration of the books actually made it to the big screen translation. This coming from a guy whose heart was ripped out by the bastardization of ""The Sum of All Fears,"" bear in mind - I know what it's like to have a book you love not be given the loving attention we feel it deserves when it hits the big screen. The dialogue isn't always the best (it's a comic book, not Shakespeare, people) and even the best acting in the world won't change that. But seriously, if you're paying attention to that minor blemish, you're missing the point of the movie to begin with. Aside from the dialogue, the imagery in the film is something to be appreciated, whether you like the stories or not. Equally beautiful and gritty black and white, with occasional brushes of color that all but explode off the screen- the comic books (graphic novels to you purists) act like storyboards for this movie- as life is breathed into the still images on the pages. The ""From Book to Screen"" section that is no doubt going to be a feature on the future DVD release of this movie will no doubt drop a few jaws for those that haven't bothered to check out the source material. Cold, cruel humor and over-the-top, audience-wince-inducing violence are blended in the style of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""From Dusk 'Till Dawn"" for obvious reasons, but as I stated before, it's all direct from the books. Kudos to Robert Rodriguez for not compromising in the making of this film and for his commitment to the original source material; and also to his co-director Frank Miller for his obvious contributions. And to the actors in it- the cavalcade of them. My favorite performance was turned in by Mickey Rourke for playing Marv absolutely letter perfect from the book (and he demonstrates one of the best narrative voices I've heard in a movie since Morgan Freeman in ""The Shawshank Redemption""). Elijah Wood has a non-speaking role, but his Kevin will follow you home as much as Nick Stahl's Junior does. Clive Owen is solid as Dwight (and I know a lot of geek fan-boys out there were upset that he was picked for the character) and Bruce Willis does what he does best as a cop that won't quit, Hartigan. The standout female performance is a toss up between either Rosario Dawson for her valkyrie, warrior, hooker Gail, or (it kills me to say it) Brittany Murphy as a ""His Girl Friday"" cocktail waitress. The movie is definitely not for all tastes, and kids shouldn't be allowed in buildings even next to theaters showing this movie- but it will no doubt be a hotly discussed film as we creep through Hollywood's typically ""phoned-in, pre-Summer"" Feb/March/April offerings.",,Anonymous,Crime
Miller's art realized in fast paced nice film noir tribute.,"I'll put my bottom line at the top so you can decide whether to read on. I can't recommend this film to the average cinema-goer. Instead, I will recommend it to those who are fans of Frank Miller, film noir, Robert Rodrigues, and to a lesser extent Quentin Tarantino. This is also not a film for feminists. Others should read on and decide if this is something they want to see.The fact that Frank Miller was listed with Robert Rodriquez as co-director of this film, and the cleverly ambiguous film noir trailer hooked me. So, the spouse and I went to see it shortly after release, expecting exactly what we got - a very cleverly and interestingly shot film noir version of several Frank Miller stories taking place in Basin City, the locus of Miller's graphic novels of the same name as the film.Quentin Tarantino guest directs one of the segments. I'm not sure which - Rodrigues' style is as often violent, but a bit more comic. Based on some of the ridiculous violence of the film, I think it likely that QT had some influence on the other segments as well. My only objection to this film is really the quantity of absurd and frankly grotesque violence scenes. Though the violence is true to Miller's work, seeing it as a process creates a very different effect than Miller's art. Fortunately, Rodrigues' sense of humor also prevails in most of the most violent scenes. The use of colorization emphasizes the film's bloodiness through the only colors used in the film - red, ultra-white and yellow - comic exaggeration and a wonderfully eerie noir feel.Predictably, this is a very dark film, and quite a bit more disturbing than the average commercial stuff.What the spouse and I didn't expect was pleasantly surprising - one of the most artistically well done interpretations of the comic medium I have yet seen (and I have seen them all) and stand-out performances by Del Toro, Mickey Rourke and Willis. I expect nothing less from Del Toro, but I have to admit Rourke just blew me away as Miller's phenomenally ugly and invincible tough guy - Marv - who decides, for once, to do something good with his life. Rourke's character is played with such empathy that you won't want his segments to end - you will want him to become the final hero of the film. I was less enchanted with Clive Owen's portrayal of Dwight. Though this segment was good entertainment, I thought Owen could have given a more emotive performance. Elijah Wood was exceptionally creepy and well cast in his very brief role.All of the heroic male characters (and this film is VERY much filmed from a stereotype film noir male point of view) have one common characteristic - they are all very tough critters fighting against all odds against endemic corruption, murder and injustice, but not at all afraid to indulge in it to further their own ends. The vignettes are loosely but satisfactorily connected. But the plots are less important than the way the film FEELS. The film mixes hopelessness with fearlessness and fatalism to the extent that you'll feel like an honorable death ending a brief life is far more appealing than a lengthy life devoid of self-respect. It's a really well done homage to Comic Book as an art form, and the film noir motif. Whoever thought of putting Rodriguez and Miller together on this one deserves a nod from fans of both genres.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Avoid this stunning film if violence offends you.,"Channel surfing late one night I stumbled across this film and stopped to look because of the unusual cinematography. It's visually stunning, mostly in b&w and that evokes a film noir atmosphere punctuated with those brilliant flashes of color. Two minutes later I couldn't take my eyes away. This unique film is superbly executed, the casting, the screenplay, the special effects, everything about it. As we all know, there is an expansive library of film work out there for a wide range of tastes and sensibilities. If yours are delicate, if you are offended by gore and violence, then this film will NOT be your cup of tea. Stay away from it. But if both the horror and film noir genres appeal to you, you'll probably find this movie as captivating as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sin In Spanish Means Without,"A feast for the eyes but not the senses, well maybe one. That in itself is not a bad thing unless you go to the movies for entirely different reasons you go to a theme park and take a ride. I admired what computers can do in the hands of visual artists. Some of the images where out of a Gustav Dorè of the future, I mean the present. A Dorè with sudden bursts of red the reddest red you've ever seen. I must confess I was very unfamiliar with the comic ""Sin City"" is based on. A male fantasy of the first order. Blood, guts, huge guns and fabulous babes. The almost adolescent Jessica Alba throws herself in the arms of Bruce Willis, promising eternal love. Willis, by the way, is terrific so is Clive Owen. My God what a face! A heroic movie icon for the ages. Mickey Rourke picks up where he left off, deformed, full of blood and moving, very moving in a chilling kind of way. I didn't recognize Benicio del Toro until it was too late. Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy and the afore mentioned Jessica Alba are nothing short of spectacular. To boot Josh Harnett appears as beautifully creepy bookends. And yet, I was left with a sense of frustration. I was in the mood for a movie and found myself in a theme park ride. But if you're in the mood for that, I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Kind of disappointing,"I went in to ""Sin City"" with high expectations, and came out a bit disappointed. With all of the hype I had been hearing, I suppose I expected something more.The movie follows three overlapping stories of men seeking justice in the extremely corrupt city. Along the way they beat up and shoot a lot of people (it is an extremely violent movie, which didn't bother me, but it might bother some people).I had a few problems with this film: First, I didn't really get how the three stories connected to each other, besides taking place in the same city. There were a few overlapping characters and locations, but they were pretty superficial. Second, the whole movie came off (at least to me) as a two hour exercise in hyper-masculine fantasy. In part this is due to the nearly constant violence in the film, but a lot of it has to do with the role of women. Nearly every female character in the movie is either a hooker or a stripper, and all of them are completely reliant on the male characters for everything - and seem to pay them back with sexual favors. The only women who had any type of independence were the hookers - seemingly sending the message that women only get power through sexuality. And even then, the hookers need one of the main male characters to save them. Third, the dialog seemed awkward in many places. I don't know if it was the way the actors delivered the lines or the way the comic book was adapted to the screen, but in a lot of places it didn't really work. It was supposed to be kind of like old-school film noir dialog, but a lot of it just came off as laughable. Finally (and this is really a minor complaint) there seemed to be an excessive amount of male crotch smashing. Once or twice is understandable, but there must have been at least 10 violent acts (punching, shooting, etc) directed at the male groin throughout the movie. There really wasn't any reason for them (except maybe in one case), and after a while it got kind of weird.That being said, the movie was visually amazing. Some of the best and most unique cinematography I have ever seen. The music was pretty good too. As for the acting - Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke were good, and Elijah Wood was downright freaky, but Clive Owen seemed stiff, and Rosario Dawson came of as downright ridiculous in parts. And the story (or stories, really) itself was interesting - I just think that something may not have transitioned properly from the book to the screen.""Sin City"" wasn't bad, but I had some problems with it. I guess it just wasn't my type of movie.Rating: 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Truly a comic book brought to life!,"I must admit that I know, or knew rather, very little about the story or history of Frank Miller and his series of comic book novels - and maybe that is why I enjoyed this movie so much. Although, this is still a different type of situation where one who was a big fan of the stories might be seriously critical of every little detail of the comic book turned movie. I don't believe anyone who considers themselves truly knowledgeable about Miller's work can say that this was not represented well on the big screen. I'm now intrigued to go back and check out some of his work.That aside, as far as it being a movie and a work of art, I would give this movie high marks in both categories. For it being a movie, it was nice to see something so different as far as the approach to making it go. Also, having such an incredible cast makes it all the more intriguing. I don't see anyone else having portrayed any of these characters any better than the cast that was hired to do so.On an artistic level, it is extremely hard to think of any other movie that comes close to being in the same league. I did not see Sky Captain, but I would say that anyone who liked Pleasantville for its cinematography and graphic elements, would love Sin City. The use of black and white photography with only specific colors added later make for a far more dramatic effect. And so much of the cinematography being so close to a ""moving picture"" version of comic book art simply makes this movie worth seeing.Take the artistic elements of this movie, and put it together with the amazing cast (both looks and talent) and throw it together with a very different but coherent plot, and you've got yourself an extremely enjoyable movie that is definitely worth seeing. And seeing at the theater no less!My hats off to Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and the rest of the cast and crew for putting together something different for a change.My only complaint about the whole movie - the use of labeling Quentin Tarantino as a ""Special Guest Director"" is almost too lame to deal with.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Visually striking and memorable. Dark fun.,"""Sin City"" is gritty, dirty, sleazy and violent. It's an excellent adaptation of the graphic novels by Frank Miller and even if you haven't read the original material, it's a lot of fun. This anthology film features characters that are memorable and likable (or despicable) so it will grab your attention and hold on tight the whole way. There are a lot of memorable scenes and lines that are sure to stick with you too but the best part of the film is the art direction and visual style. An element I'm glad they kept from the original source is that the stories are told almost entirely in black and white, with sharp contrast accentuated in many scenes to not only make certain actions more visually striking, but also to make it easy to follow. Then, the movie does something unique. There are dashes of color in certain scenes to make certain actions and characters even more striking. There's a certain character that is highlighted with the color yellow. His physical appearance already makes him stand out, but that use of color makes him feel extra creepy and it's very effective. The sets and character designs (because some characters here are fitted with heavy makeup and prosthetics to make them stand out and look even more unique) make every frame look like a comic book panel, Every shot I saw looked like it had been meticulously planned out, like a piece of art you could have framed on your wall. The bold style isn't just a gimmick though. It's all blended in seamlessly with the story and helps to reinforce the grittyness and themes of corruption while helping accentuate the prevalent violence of the film. My only real criticism is that some of the performances aren't great (Bruce Willis plays it too low-key). It's a disappointment considering some of the others are quite good, and not in the ways you would expect either. I had to do a double take when I realized that was Elijah Wood and Mickey Rourke I just saw! It's a bit of a mixed bag in that department, but everything else is top notch. Once you see ""Sin City"" you'll be hard pressed to forget it, and not only because of the visuals. (Extended cut on Blu-ray, August 25, 2012)",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wow! Comics done right...,"Went to a sneak preview of this movie today, and I was blown away. Over the years people have tried to emulate the feel of comics on the screen, and met with mild success(Dick Tracy), minor failure(Hulk), and solid success(Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow). This is hard to do, but Sin City hits this dead on. The film is entirely in black and white(Except for about 20 seconds that I noticed in one scene.), except for highlights of color(Gorgeous eyes, splattered blood, and red Converse All-Stars to name a few.). This gives the film a feel that immerses you into the storyline. Add to this the overly corny duologue and scenes where scantily(And I DO mean scantily) clad women pull Uzi's out of literally nowhere, and you have all the right makings for a transfer of a comic book to the screen. The duologue had me laughing almost constantly, but it's easy to tell that they wanted you to laugh, even when they lines were incredibly corny and melodramatic...The performances in the movie were great as well. I believe my favorite male character was Marv, played by Micky Rourke, and my favorite female character was definitely Miho, played by Devon Aoki. It seems that everyone and their dog was either in this movie, or lent some of their talents to it, and it shows.I would definitely suggest that you see this in the theatre the very first time, because it will NEVER have the same impact on your TV at home as it does on a 30-foot screen in a dark theatre. I was actually able to note a few times where the digital cameras were able to outperform anything film could do.A lot of violence in this movie, although most of it is either totally cartoon-style, or off camera, and some gore as well... A good amount of nudity in the film, ALL of it on camera, so you'll probably want to leave the kiddies at home.All in all, one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, and I'll probably go see it again while it's in the theatres, so that my fiancé can enjoy it as well...",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Stunning...,"If I was to use one word to describe this film it would  have to be....Violent! if i was allowed two words I would add  'Visceral'.  The movie is two hours long and is structured in a similar way to Pulp  Fiction. A bunch of stories set in a consistent world, with characters  falling in and out of each others plot lines. On the whole it works  brilliantly, and for the duration there isn't a boring moment. It is  High octane, million miles and hour storytelling, and it EASILY Robert  Rodriguez's best film.  Allowing Frank Miller to write the script was a fantastic move, as the  dialogue is edgy, witty and VERY faithful to the original material. In  fact, many many lines are just taken straight from the pages. likewise,  the camera behaves like a moving cartoon box out. The framing of all  the key scenes is SO faithful to the printed page that it produces a  truly original look that is fairly incomparable. Visually its a true  original. Sometimes these visuals fall down, there are some very very  obvious digital shots that don't quite gel, but on the whole the  cinematography is jaw dropping. You could literally pause the movie at  almost any point and just hang that frame on a wall, its that  beautiful.  Performances are good all round. Mickey Rourke absolutely nails Marv,  and the girls of Old Town are all as beautiful as they are deadly. The  other standout for me was Elijah Wood, who was truly chilling. Bruce  Willis puts in a solid, if unspectacular turn as Hartigan.  The film isn't entirely void of criticism. there's some fudging of time  lines with Hartigans character (do we really buy Bruce Willis as a  nearly 70 year old man?) and the jumps from story to story are jarring  initially, but once it settles into itself the ride is fantastic.  My other main criticism is the same I have with Quentin Tarantinos  work. That every character and every voice in the movie is the same.  This is more a fault of the source material, but when every single  person is a wise cracking, hard boiled tough guy (even the women) then  it kind of distills the effect of their toughness. In a film that is  predominantly voice over driven, it is hard to differentiate characters  when they all sound exactly the same, both tonally, and in the language  they use. Even Marv, who's supposed to be a meat head, talks in  gravelly prose that would make Bukowski feel like a Nancy.  Other Minor niggles are hardly worth mentioning. From a technical  standpoint the sound effects are WAY to loud. All of the punches,  gunshots etc are given such ridiculous prominence on the track that  they threaten to make mockery of the violence. I actually found that i  didn't want any more guns fired cos it was hurting my ears! all in all  though, its one hell of a ride, and only a couple of notches below Pulp  Fiction on the 'Oh my god that film was cool-o-meter'.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Great visuals, disturbing world.","Sin City is (like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow) a visual achievement, and deserves credit for bringing realism to the graphic novel of the same name. It's hard to criticize a movie that does in spades what it sets out to do.I will say, however, that if you're not a fan of graphic novels, and their predispositions for violence, sexual stereotyping, and grim looks at humanity, then you'd be better off skipping Sin City. With only a few exceptions, every character in the movie is a psychopath, complete with a killing and/or torture fetish and the expected lack of remorse. We are given ""good"" guys and ""bad"" guys, but they're hard to tell apart sometimes. And I don't think I've ever seen a movie in which 90% of the female characters are strippers or prostitutes. But of course, this is a depiction of a fictional city, in which there is a lot of sin. Hence the title.This is an obvious generalization, but this movie will go over really well with guys who like violence and naked women. It will offend just about everyone else. There will be a few who will accept it as a well realized comic book fantasy, but they won't like the aftertaste. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Beautiful!,"I'm only a marginal comics fan - I read a bunch of stuff over the course of a year or two in college and haven't read much at all since.

The story's were interesting and the cast including Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Benicio Del Toro, Rosario Dawson, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Elijah Wood and the late Brittany Murphy were great.I can't say anything else because this movie was really excellent. So in the end, ""Sin City"" is worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Special Guest Director Tarantino Organised a lot of the Cinematography,"I think Quentin Tarantino organised a lot more of the cinematography than what was said. If Quentin Tarantino didn't help direct this movie, I think almost all the cinematography would be different. In the first scene after the opening credits, the way the camera zooms in on Bruce Willis (Hardigan), facing him as he's driving. It is a very similar camera shot as as the beginning and end of Kill Bill Vol. 2 facing Uma Thurman and as the end of Jackie Brown, facing Pam Grier. As I've said before the cinematography in every Quentin Tarantino movie is absolutely brilliant, one of the qualities is that he often goes into black and white (probably because sometimes it can be a lot more affective than colour) and that same quality is used in Sin City; my guess is that it's a mixture of Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino's idea. The whole element of the character ""Mi-Ho"" and her weaponry tactics is like a page out of Kill Bill's book.Even though I am disagreeing with people saying that Quentin Tarantino was involved a lot more than what is said, this is not a negative comment. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, because the combination of Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino made the cinematography perfect!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
My favorite style of film,Sin city changed the way I looked at films. Frank miller really created a style all his own when he shot this film the way he did. It was the look and feel of the film that drew my attention fully. I love the idea of the red blended with the black and white. It's just capturing in every way. When I shoot my films I always do a noir style like sin city cause it's just such a great film. Also with the blend of Robert Rodriaguez and Quentin Tarantino this film is easily the best of it's genre and an all time favorite of mine. Another great compliment is to the casting of the film. Jessica alba really brings the sexiness as always and josh hartnett plays my favorite character of all. I can't say I love every scene about many other films but this one I can honestly say that.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sin City is Sinsational!,"Just watched the Advance Screening last night and I must say that this movie pulls all the punches in violence. It deserves its hard R rating in the first five minutes and doesn't let up until the end credits roll. It has it all - bullets, boobs and be-headings - beautifully set in a grim atmosphere that really keeps you on the edge of your seat. All cast performances were excellent - especially Mickey Rourke's ""Marv"" character. Fans of the comic will not be disappointed in this film adaption. This movie is definitely not for the squeamish or faint-of-heart.Sin City grabs you by the nuts and doesn't let go! A must see!",,Anonymous,Crime
Frank Miller's best masterpiece ever!!!,"Sin City (2005) is one of the best comic book Frank Miller's thrillers ever made! It is one favorite best Bruce Willis movies. He just rocks in this role as Detective Hartigan! I just wish his character had a better ending. Great directing, acting and action throughout the movie. Amazing how the movie ties together, plot is perfect. The variety of characters in the movie diversify the story so well and not the mention the characters are very believable and played well. Definitely a must see for all Tarantino and Miller fans. This is the best movie ever made from the year 2005, it is been 10.years since this movie was released. 10 year anniversary and is still one the best entertaining thriller movies ever made. I just love this movie and everything in it. The movie is fun and it is a joy to watch and you can never get bored.It is a Frank Miller's masterpiece and one of the best graphic novel! The best movie delivered from three directors Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. The movie has full, I mean full of famous actors in it. Everybody does a great job. The acting in this movie is realistic and really awesome! This movie can satisfy audiences that either want a simple fight movie along with those that want to look deeper and find an intricately woven story beneath. The numerous stars in this movie all go on to create unique characters that case viewers to actually care if something bad were to happen to them. Being based off a graphic novel, it also stays true to the original formula while being able to be easily viewed by those that have never read the graphic novel. The styling and art of the movie are both is interesting but also don't distract from the movie itself. The fight scenes stay vibrant and fresh and throughout the course of the movie, events seen in one part have unique and interesting ways to appear or connect in other scenes.Bruce Willis stars as a cop with a bum ticker and a vow to protect a sexy stripper (Jessica Alba), Mickey Rourke as an outcast misanthrope on a mission to avenge the death of his one true love (Jaime King) and Clive Owen as Dwight, the clandestine love of Shellie (Brittany Murphy), who spends his night defending Gail (Rosario Dawson) and her Old Town girls from a tough guy (Benicio Del Toro) with a penchant for violence. Also starring Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl, Michael Madsen, Carla Gugino and Michael Clark Duncan.That is the main plot about the movie. It has more story's to tell and it also has action in it. Even for black and White color movie it takes the vision of the most imaginative directors on earth. The film itself is outrageously entertaining. Director Robert Rodriguez does a masterful job with Frank Miller's material while also bringing filmmaking to a whole other level. This along with a spectacular cast makes this one of the best films of the past 10 years and one of the best graphic novel/comic adaptions. The biggest surprise of Sin City is that I enjoyed it.. a lot and Robert Rodriguez was one of the directors! Sin City gives us Four different stories with multiple different characters doing their parts in many different ways, we are given a Pulp Fiction type movie that has a grand finale and draws the audience into each and every tale told. The cast in this movie is superb! we have actors like Bruce Willis, Nick Stahl, Jessica Alba, Powers Boothe, Benicio Del Toro, Mickey Rourke, Michael Duncan Clarke, Rosario Dawson, Carla Gugino, Josh Hartnett, Brittney Murphy, Jaime King, Clive Owen, and Elijah Wood. all these actors have their moments to shine and nobody overlooks another. They all handle their roles beautifully in this. The artistic view in this movie are like something we haven not seen in the movies ever. Frank Miller wanted his ""baby"" to be exactly like his Dark Comics and RR did just that. The movie is in Black and White with certain colors brought out in certain scenes. Now when i say Black and White I am not talking about your regular B&W movie, imagine a comic book page taken out of the comic and placed onto the big screen. The whole movie looks just like that, and its AMAZING!This movie is a perfect 10, the greatest thing about themovie is the theme that is just awesome.Sin City (also known as Frank Miller's Sin City) is a 2005 American neo-noir crime thriller anthology film written, produced, and directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez.

Comic Genius,"""Walk down the right alleyway in Sin City and you can find anything.""A film for which the term ""Graphic"" (and all its connotations) was invented for, and quite simply the best comic book film adaptation I have ever seen (with ""Batman Begins"" probably coming up slightly behind it in 2nd place) Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" is an extremely brutal, wonderfully violent, incredibly stylised tale of cops, criminals, and stunning-looking prostitutes.With a cast to die for (and believe me many do in quite graphic ways) Bruce Willis, Michael Masden, Rutger Hauer, Jessica Alba, Benicio Del Toro, Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, Rosario Dawson all shine through in a heady ensemble, but it's Mickey Rourke looking almost unrecognisable as Marv who steals the show, giving the performance (so far) of his chequered career.A must see for all comic book fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
An absolutely amazing experience,"The first thing you will notice about Robert Rodriguez's violent comic book crime masterpiece is the outstanding visual style. While many comic book movies are happy to simply take the story from their source material and turn it into a film, Rodriguez has gone further and took both the story and the comic book's own style, and the result is a movie that really feels like a comic book brought to life. The way the action quickly jumps from one scene to another, the over the top dialogue and, most importantly, Frank Miller's use of colour, are all there; and all in all, Sin City has raised the bar for comic book movies. Sin City is very positive for cinema on the whole, as it proves that there's still some originality left, and it also shows that if used properly, computer generated environments definitely can compliment a film and, in this case, even make it what it is. I had designs on what I thought the movie would be like before viewing it, but even so; after the first scene, which is completely in black and white except for the red on the dame's lipstick and dress, completely took me by surprise and throughout the movie you cant help but marvel at the unique visual treat that is being put before you.Robert Rodriguez is a man that often loses out in the credibility department to his more popular friend (and special guest director on this production) Quentin Tarantino, and this is unfair in my opinion. Let's not forget that Rodriguez is the man that made El Mariachi for a mere $7000, and made it GOOD. The rest of the Desperado trilogy showed that Rodriguez has a real flair for comic book style action, and all in all I don't think there could have been a better man for the director's chair on Sin City. Rodriguez has applied his trademark of rounding up a host of popular stars to this film as well, and simply put; this film could not have been better cast. Mickey Rourke is the standout as the brute Marv, and he gives an amazing performance in that role. The way he commands the screen is great and his ugliness compliments the role excellently. Bruce Willis and Clive Owen are the other two lead men, and while Willis doesn't quite look old enough to be playing a 68-year-old copper; both of them do well in their roles also. Jessica Alba is scintillating as the very sexy Nancy Callahan, and the guys will be pleased to know that Sin City features a plethora of scantily clad women!The film is split up into three stories, each based on a different Frank Miller book. Mickey Rourke's section of the film is the best, with lots of torture sequences and a beautiful dame at it's centre. Clive Owen's story is a treat for the eyes, as we enter 'old town'; a part of Sin City run by a load of prostitutes. And finally, Bruce Willis' story sees him on the trail of a child molester who he 'disarmed' years earlier. This tale is the creepiest of the bunch, and that story's central character, 'The Yellow Bastard', is a masterpiece of scum and villainy. The entire movie plays out like a film noir from the height of the era; only the comic book style gives it an extra ounce of muscle, and describing this film as 'film noir on steroids' wouldn't be a misplaced description. The melodramatic acting and dialogue help the film to capture the 50's style, and it's a treat for a fan of those sorts of films, such as myself, to see a modern day take on it. Overall, Sin City is one of the best films to come out this millennium. It's visual style is superb and this, when mixed with some invigorating stories and a fantastic cast, make Sin City a winner all the way.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sin City,"Many movies based on comic books (or graphic novels, if you insist) have been somewhat lackluster, but Sin City certainly delivers what it promises. The episodic film consists of four partly intertwining stories, each having different emphases even if they look superficially similar. The film opens and closes with an enigmatic hit-man (Josh Hartnett) taking care of his customers. The second and penultimate story arcs recount the fate of a somewhat honest cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who saves a young girl from a pedophile, but sees no justice being made. The next story is about Marv (Mickey Rourke), a big and gruff man of the streets who avows to avenge the death of a hooker he once briefly loved. The remaining story deals with Dwight (Clive Owen) who gets in trouble with the police while protecting his girlfriend and has to resort to the help of the vigilante prostitutes of a special region of the city.In Sin City everything is exaggerated: the starkly contrasted black & white cinematography, the sparse but powerful use of colour, the pulpily poetic narration and the caricature-like characters. On the one hand it's awesome, kick-ass and all that, but on the other hand it is also distressing, overwhelmingly devoid of hope and even disgusting in spite of the over-the-top comical coolness it oozes. Especially Marv's story carries a sense of gruesome beauty in his devotion to the memory of the dead whore and his antagonist, a silent cannibal killer Kevin (Elijah Wood), is extremely creepy in his cold enjoyment of his fate – there are no signs of Frodo Baggins to be seen here. If Marv's story is the most dramatic, the Dwight one is the most comedic and provides more of the kick-ass type of action. It's all good, but I don't think the impact is as great as with Marv.Hartigan's story is decent too and conveys the sense of isolation and diminishing hope within the bars of Hartigan's cramped solitary confinement cell. His antagonist, the literally Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl), is rather overblown but who isn't, in Sin City? The hanging scene particularly (and literally) captures the feel of suffocation in the world where hope is a luxury. In contrast with the other stories, the Hit-man tale with Josh Hartnett bookending the film remains the shortest and the most enigmatic. Very little is revealed about the hit-man and he himself admits he doesn't know the reasons for the violence, but at the same time it comes out so naturally that avoiding it is not an option.The constant, even ridiculous exaggerating of the cruel nature of Sin City could have been just a funny action movie or a laughably heavy-handed overstatement of Man's nature, but I think it works both as an actioner and an emotionally draining experience. If the viewer allows himself or herself be sucked into the world of Marv or Hartigan while looking beyond the obvious and intentional silliness, there's beauty to be found. It may not be very subtly or exquisitely presented, but in my opinion the pieces really fall into place here and everything makes sense – Sin City can only be strongly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Violent,"I saw ""Sin City"" last week. It was technically very exciting and innovative and I really enjoyed that part of the movie. I had a problem with the gun violence though and I had a problem caring about the characters in the cast. I really wouldn't want to meet or know any of the people in the movie, except for biblically knowing some of the women. The women were in the movie just as sexual diversions and their acting, besides maybe Rosario Dawson, was pretty bad. Jessica Alba is stunning but she can't act. This was a perfectly prurient piece with no hint of redeeming social value. I know it was meant to emulate a comic book and I think it did do that job extremely well but I can't help think that there should be some small bit of social consciousness raising in our entertainments. Why are we so surprised when a teenager takes a backpack of guns to school and emulates what I saw in this movie. I don't mind violence in movies just as I don't mind sex in movies. I do mind gratuitous sex and violence and this movie was gratuitous in spades. If the sex was more graphic it surely would have gotten an X rating but would it have gotten one due to the violence. Could it get too violent to ever get an X rating? I think Hollywood has this love affair with guns. Many, many, many Hollywood movie plots are resolved with gun violence. Moral dilemmas are solved with guns. I recently saw ""The Hostage"" and it was about guns, guns, guns. I think guns are a substitute for decent writing. I find it distasteful.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hyper-Noir for today,"I just came back from an advance screening of Sin City, and I can tell you this is one salient reel of pitch of a film. Think of it as film noir amped up for a post modern century. It comes across like most of Frank Miller's writing, modestly fantastic for the comic environment, but steeped long and hard in the tradition of the underground crime writers of the '40's. Visually, the juxtaposition of the rich B&W with digitally-hued Technicolor makes it hard to take your eyes off the screen. This film was tailor made for most of the people who have been following Miller's writing for the past twenty odd years, brimming with many of his trademark elements and visual style that he, along with Messrs. Rodriguez and Tarantino, capture brilliantly. Not for more sensitive or under aged souls, Sin City will burn like a fire that you have to watch for everyone else.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
I honestly didn't expect this...,"Given the cast lineup of this film, I expected no less than greatness. It's hard to believe that everyone involved even agreed to shoot this film. Did they not realize that they would be working on complete trash?First of all, Rodriguez is not renowned for greatness. He's know for mediocrity; he's even more known because of his friendship with Tarantino. None of his films can be considered spectacular; his first major attempt, EL MARIACHI, was worth the viewing, but it all went downhill from there. So because of the fact that all of his films since his first attempt were less than wonderful, it can only be expected that his latest be even worse. And man, oh man did he deliver. There was absolutely NO artistic originality or integrity exercised on his behalf in SIN CITY. What did he do? He made Frank Miller's graphic novels into a movie. Word for word, bit by bit. And that's hard to understand considering the graphic novels; they are only truly known for their vulgarity and perversity.So here we have this little film. Two hours and five minutes of sixty-nine million years on screen. It gives off the impression that it will explode onto the screen and choke the life out of its viewers. Instead, it CREEPS its way on and grosses you out with less than admirable writing(dialogue, etc.) and lame, lifeless, thoroughly non-engrossing story lines. The only plot line of the film that even resembles anything interesting is the main story, which revolves around Willis's character. It is violent and deplorable only for the sake of being violent and deplorable. EVERY BIT of nudity is entirely useless. The effects were cool to see; but if you want truly brilliant directing while dealing with entirely green-screen effects, go watch SKY CAPTAIN.SIN CITY's characters bumble through their fabricated world like blind men in a musty maze. Rodriguez didn't direct this film, he simply enacted what need to to be done in order to show Frank Miller's work, which, again, is HIGHLY overrated. This film is disgusting and it is a disgrace to the art of cinema. Some will say that because of the approach taken towards this film and because of its ""originality"" it is worthy of high acclaim, but don't confuse greatness with experimentation. This was an experiment and it failed. It only shows what it shows and is the way it is in order to push the boundaries. And that need NEVER be done without a worthy subject or without making a statement on something important(usually to/about humans and human nature).This one missed the mark by miles, and it is depressing to see the raving it's getting all across the country. But still see it; it's a film, and they were made to be viewed. After that, know you saw it because you're a film buff: for that reason and that reason alone should this abomination to cinema be screened.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The one and only Masterpiece of the comic book genre!,"Sin City is based on three different stories in a place called Basin City. The way the three stories unfold and collapse against one another is captivating to see. Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, Sin City is perhaps the first film ever made to really have the authentic tone and look of comic books. Even if you have not seen the film, you probably had heard of this film for it's original style and unique touch of black-and-white special effects. I thought this was one heck of a movie. I thought this was one of the few films to actually have a really powerful narration, which is done by the three main characters played by Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Bruce Willis. I thought the first third with Marv(Mickey Rourke) was one amazing story. I loved the beginning, and I loved this story the best out of the whole film. The second story which focuses on Dwight(Clive Owen) was to an extent different, although the same menacing feel is still there. Whereas Marv's story relied more on suspense and mystery, this part was more action-packed, which had really amazing uses of violence and gore. The third and final act, about Hardigan(Bruce Willis) was more similar to Marv's story, and also had the right use of violence, mystery, and action. I thought the ensemble cast was certainly one to marvel at. There are a lot of movie stars in this film, and some of them are brilliant, whereas some of them not so much. I thought Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Rosario Dawson, Elijah Wood, and Benicio Del Toro were the best of the film. They all delivered their best. Especially Benicio Del Toro, who really gave us a creepy and menacing villain. There were others who were not as great. Clive Owen was mixed. In some parts he was great, in others he seemed so dull. Alexis Bledel, Jaime King, and Jessica Alba also had some good parts, but in others they were all sort of bland or bad. But the biggest problem was Brittany Murphy. I thought Murphy was just horrible. In her only scene, she was just talking and acting so mediocre, did not like her one bit. I have seen her in other films, and I thought she was a good actress. Maybe something happened with her here, but she was by far the worst. The writing is also something to appreciate. It was cheesy in parts, but I thought everything, from the dialogue to the events, were all done as they would in a comic book, or in this case graphic novel. I especially liked the imagery and figurative dialogue and the narration that was used, and really enhanced the film to another level.Overall, Sin City is one of the most ambitious, original, entertaining, captivating, action packed, visually stunning and artistically magnificent films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I expect a lot of repeat viewings, and action films had never gotten better than this. A one and only film that needs to be watched, even if only for for its incredible style and ambitious craft.",,Anonymous,Crime

Style and Substance!,"It's full of substance; just so you know. This movie depicts the essence, if not the definition of a hero. Self-sacrifice. Love. In some cases vengeance.

They all have their strengths, weaknesses, heart, and don't give a s h i t what happens to themselves, as long as they can dish out some h e l l to the evils that lurk in the shadows of SIN CITY!It's full of style. In an amped-up noir style, these stories cover the lives of the men and women of SIN CITY. All is not what it seems. Beautiful black and white noir shots and angle.

Though this film is not for everyone, I have to say that all will agree that SIN CITY gives all new depth to movies that are made from comics.I honestly found no flaws with this movie. I gave it 10 for honest reasons. Acting and directing melds together to create a film with breath-taking ""color"".

Everything is bigger in Sin City,"IMDb Top 250: 108Can you tolerate extreme violence, lavish sexiness and black comedy? It all awaits you in Sn City: an unbelievably cool and gritty film, a heavily, heavily stylized neo-noir, and a 'comic book come to life'. Take a still shot from the film and you could confuse it with a detailed comic. Before discussing the rest of the film I'll get this out of the way: Sin City is the most visually arresting film I have seen thus far, and is an artistically amazing piece of art.After an interesting prologue to hotwire a viewer into the Sin City style, we are treated to a very Grand Theft Auto-esque opening credits, with comic book characters and their respective actors, accompanied by the slickest theme music in recent memory. Then we are thrown into the first of several tales of crime, hookers and violence- which at their core are really stories of love and its... derivatives. The stories a very engaging and twisted, and offer good closure. And they're refreshingly straightforward, surprising considering Tarantino is onboard as a 'special guest director'.As over the top as the art style is, the characters are just as big. There's no singular protagonist, but a cast of heroes and villains. Hartigan is a true hero, the incorruptible savior. In contrast, the other major 'hero', Marv, is just a simple and passionate man. Much less physically imposing than these two is Dwight, the closest thing to a straight character, but who still has his quirks. The entire support is great, including Jackie Boy and the sickening Yellow Bastard, as well as by all the female cast, who are either strippers, dancers, or an assassin. Special note goes to the character of Kevin, played eerily by Elijah Wood. He's absolutely terrifying, especially with the hypnotic theme that always plays in his presence. The cast is amazing, and everyone has a large dose of 'comic' in their performances.As stylish as the visuals are, the action equals. Men go flying after punches,blood sprays, and cars fly over bumps. There are many astounding scenes of violence, as well as monologues and narrations only possible in a film like this. The action is over the top, the carnage outrageously brutal, with hints of absolute black comedy. (Swastika shurikens? The Yellow Bastard?)Sin City has fantastic, loving direction, and is a magnificent technical and artistic achievement that cranks to '10' in every category but swearing. It's a top tier noir, and a very unique film. If it was a wholly original concept for the screen I think it could have been lauded even more.

Jessica is goddess <3,"""Sin City"" is a neo-noir omnibus of four stories adapted from the comics of Frank Miller, directed by Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino. Camera and directing mimic the style of comics. The film is in black-and-white technique, but some details are highlighted with bright colors (red blood, red lipstick, red dress, red sneakers, yellow monstrous blood and the like) whose contrast leaves a powerful impression and enhances the story. The cast is fantastic and packed with sexy (un)dressed beautiful women. Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Carla Gugino, Josh Hartnett, Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen, Frank Miller (writer, producer, director and actor in this movie), Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Elijah Wood,... Such a team gathered in the same movie is quite promising. When you see Jessica Alba dancing on the stage of striptease bar you'll completely forgot about Salma Hayek's performance in ""From Dusk till Dawn"", and her chemistry with Bruce Willis is fascinating. An unforgettable experience that can be repeated many times. In my opinion, this is one of the greatest movies of all time.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"everything for the eyes, nothing for the brains","I've just come home from seeing this movie, and I'm torn. I can't really decide how I feel about this one. On the one hand, you've got three terribly uninteresting crime stories. All three of them as clichéd as they can get. With characters so void of any emotion, it's impossible to feel for them. And on the other hand, you've got one visceral thrill ride of a movie. A non stop visual treat from beginning till end, that accomplishes what other blue screen movies can only dream of. To me this film is a close second to Tarantino's ""Kill Bill 1+2"" ... but it also suffers from the same weaknesses. Both films rely on grainy ""I'm gonna get revenge"" cool talk combined with overwhelming visual treats. Now Tarantino has proved he can pull off violent non story movies, but Rodriguez has always failed to do so in the past (Desperado,...) Luckily with this film he delivers such a feast for the eyes that you almost forget about the non existing storyline ... almost.

"Just ""good"" but nothing is special.","Last week, I went to see Sin City and I really can't say that I either hated or liked the movie. I just thought the movie was just ""good"". But nothing is special going on around here though. The color visual effects were great for a difference in a black and white film. And the reason that I was not very impressed with the film was because the camera techniques were not that good. It was done so much same as other films out there today. I felt Robert Rodriguez didn't do anything special with camera techniques such as how Paul T. Anderson, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese (in some way), Alfonso Cuaron and whoever is a truly master in film-making. So this is why I said there was nothing really special about Sin City except for that color visual effects. Sometimes I just got myself thinking about this film...boy... it got similar style as From Dusk Til Dawn and Kill Bill.

Sin City piles on the sugar...,"(Max Payne + Queens of the Stone Age ""Go With The Flow"" video + film-noir + violence) x Frank Miller = Sin CityEasy viewing fans need not apply. This film was certainly not what I had expected - being a fresh latecomer to this one, free from reading reviews, hearing hype-talk and seeing promos (in fact, all I saw was the poster designs) - I really went into it without any real idea as to where it would go (the reason I mention this is because this rarely happens with me, and if you can, go into it the same way -- ironic, seeing as you're still reading this now). Set in Basin City, the film is made up of 3 Frank Miller novels that loosely interlink with one another in a kind of chronological fashion, mixed with a hint of Pulp Fiction (see, you're still reading this). I hadn't read any of these novels beforehand, but having looked up the content of each book (the script as well as the illustrated frames) the film itself stays extremely true to the original in every way. I can imagine Frank Miller fans loving this film regardless, so if you've read the books, this review isn't for you. The mood itself takes film noir to new depths: and I was surprised at the heavily stylised Basin City being one of the more sinister locations I've seen on film as I didn't think the film had it in it (anyone who has seen Dark City will also relate): in fact, you literally never get to see the light of day during the whole picture (not a good idea to watch this with a reflective TV screen next to window in mid-afternoon). This, though, only lends itself to the equally dark storyline and superb lighting effects that make it intense viewing, bordering on illustrative (remember the novels). The CGI effects, make-up, costumes, prosthetics, stylisation and moody voiceovers also push this to it's outer limits, further than any other comic-come-film has gone. Stylised violence, loud sound effects, big muscles, bigger guns, dominatrix queens and lots of death and revenge - the storyline certainly knows how to get itself noticed (rating this film R was probably the easiest job the ratings office must have ever had) and taken from that point of view this film gets a 10 out of 10. The film's general mood is certainly pulled off by both director and actors throughout, and the big Hollywood stars don't disappoint. So, why a 6 out of 10? Well, as a rule of thumb, I extremely dislike anything that is an excuse to use brilliant aesthetics tapped to a much weaker idea - and there is most definitely a lot of that here. I couldn't shake the feeling that it was a film about violence for the sake of violence. The novels, themselves, can been seen as a separate item in this respect - they are what they are. However, the film differs in the sense that it most definitely falls in love with itself all the way through. It feels like it's more than it is, when in reality it is a brilliant storytelling idea and aesthetic doused in gruesome violence, iconic characters and slick anecdotes all chained to the location in which it is set - nothing much more than that. Although it never tries to be a realistic depiction (in fact, it is the original stylisation that does give it some emotional substance in my opinion); the fact that one story, for example, is entirely based around a man set out to get revenge on a cannabalistic killer who eats a hooker he met that very night (""killing his way up the food chain"" as the film openly states) makes me think: what's the point? I got the point after about half an hour, the other hour and a half is just filling the holes and finishing the tale, not showing me anything new or giving me something to take away. As far as Sin City goes, Frank Miller fans will love it for it's superb depiction of the novels and the strong performances from the big stars (especially Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis) - and having seen the books, I do recommend them as separate an virginal entities from the film. For those who aren't familiar with the novels and going fresh into this, they can never take Sin City too seriously, even though it tries to make you believe it's epic viewing (pushed heavily by the gravelly voiceovers and dry, hard, slick talking characters), or they will be disappointed. If you remember that films are about storytelling and entertainment, then this does have some meat on it, but to see it as more than a violent, sinister, bad-city-bad-people novel made into a film would be a mistake. It is definitely one to see, even for it's aesthetic emotional value: but remember that it's a cake covered in many layers of beautiful icing with a the filling doesn't come close to the exterior. Those of you who have 4 sugars in your tea, this is essential viewing. Anjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
An illustration of where we are...,"I own Pulp Fiction, Mad Max and Once Upon a Time in Mexico, and was looking forward to this, given the talent behind it.Stylistically the movie captures the comic-book feel amazingly well. The quality is impeccable, and it moves at a good rate.... However...Both my wife and I got progressively more uncomfortable as the film went on. The violence slowly got more and more sadistic and graphic, and seemed to be a celebration of torture, mutilation and pain.Women were reduced to their component parts, and tokenistic ""sassiness"" given to their characters to disguise the fact they were pure eye-candy for the male element of the audience.We didn't care about the characters. There were no differences. The 'hero' liked to dismember villains, and get dogs to eat them whilst still alive. I'm not sure why this was OK, or any different to what the villains were doing.What was this movie about? 2 hours of what could be the greatest guide ever for serial killers to keep their interest piqued? I think the purpose of this movie was to make us realise the world we live in. If you step back from the stylish production, and the white comic book blood, the content and message is very cold and dehumanising.Neither my wife or I finished watching the film, and both felt angry that we had wasted as much time as we did watching someone else's nasty fantasy.The only thing that disturbed me more than the film was the fact that people I like recommended it to me with no mention of the violence. Are we really that numb?",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Rodriguez' brilliant, eye-opening, maddening tale of all things noir and nasty is one of my favourites.","The night comes across as glum; she's pretty, and he's handsome. They stand on a balcony, well dressed and looking smart. She seems scared, he seems allured but the actual reasons for his presence are deeper and more sinister than you'd first think. They look at one another; the male narrates to us how he feels; colours light up, as do the final cigarettes one of the two parties will ever have. The cigarette smoke jostles with the death that is in the air, only we cannot see it just yet. They embrace, and after this fatal exchange we crash backwards off the balcony overlooking a peculiar skyline before zooming out to encompass a bird's eye view of the entire town. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Basin City.On release, Sin City was a noir like nobody had ever seen before, indeed, I have seen few films since that have come close to matching the film as a whole. The film is a strange mix of down-to-Earth basics and homages to noir mixed with out and out escapism. The film's dynamics see characters shot, stabbed, run-over, blown-up and beaten senseless yet still manage to soldier on; whereas cars can shoot along rainy cliff-side roads at dizzying speeds but maintain on course and in control without ever crashing off. Despite all of this, the film maintains a focus; it sticks to its noir infused guns like nobody's business, delivering three stories of unrelenting passion and energy that unfold in a manner that is respectable enough to most things it takes on; be it difficult subject matter, levels of realism or attitudes to women.The film is broken up into three tales of respective men in crisis, three tales that you might say are linked by their leads' attitudes and dedication to women. The first, and last since it's revisited later on, sees elderly cop John Hartigan (Willis) involved in a rescue mission before a somewhat taboo romance tale; the second is a frothing mad revenge tale driven by love born out of the respect a woman had for a hulking thug named Marv (Rourke); while the other one is a causality inspired, MacGuffin driven piece detailing the misadventures of a certain Dwight (Owen), as he strives to rid a section of Basin City of a particular object that'll spell disaster for hundreds. Some are more violent than others, some more far-fetched; Hartigan's story is the easiest to latch onto due to its obvious connotations of good vs. pure evil playing out; two stories will end somewhat unhappily and one particular tale will straddle the line that pushes subject matter into the realms of horror. But all three will draw on inspiration from decades of Hollywood noir and deliver powerful, gut-wrenching fables of down and dirty people striving to get by told amidst levels of exciting entertainment and escapism.Director Robert Rodriguez knows where he's coming from with Sin City. By way of updating a series of graphic novels, littering them with a number of homages and using the latest in computer green-screen technology, he's created something that he will not match for the rest of his career. From the off, the first story entitled That Yellow Bastard is littered with nods and references. Hartigan, the gruff talking and close to down-and-out cop, drives his car down a straight road although needlessly twists his steering wheel in what instantly calls to mind 1945's Detour, amongst many other B-movie noirs, and their dodgy backdrops. A few miles away, a young healthy girl named Nancy sits tied to a chair, scared witless, as a door opens and Rodriguez tosses in that element of expressionism as a creepy and evil being casts a shadow over the wall, perhaps calling to mind Fritz Lang's 1931 film M. Later on, we will come to understand the Sunset Blvd. reference Rodriguez was, like that respective film, playing us with the whole time.On another strand, we're told Marv was unlucky to be born in the wrong century thanks to his uncanny ability to reach distressing levels of violence. This plants some dangerous seeds in our minds as to what he's capable of. We don't get to see him in a Roman arena, swinging an axe into some other gladiator's head, but later on we get to see him swing a hatchet into a corrupt police officer's. Marv is a human tank; a self-identified border-line psychopath whose tale tiptoes over the border that separates noir from horror, all for sake of Goldie (King), a lowlife hooker that made Marv feel important and wanted. Rodriguez will have him struggle (as he will Dwight in the tar-pits) in the rural farm setting before breaking trend and have him come to dominate this locale. The punishment Marv takes throughout is reminiscent to that of those 1980s Hollywood action stars, and how their bodies would be beaten and bashed and put through a grinder.Dwight is one-part mockingly, one-part knowingly referred to as 'Lancelot' in his story entitled The Big Fat Kill, since his role as protector to domestic abuse victim Shellie (Murphy) might see him as a knight in shining armour. Later on, he becomes a knight of sorts to Old Town based dominatrix Gail (Dawson) and the rest of her red-light district girls when a group of dangerously sexually active men enter the fray; their sexual appetites costing them their lives by Japanese bodyguard Miho (Aoki) and her phallic samurai sword. But the film is not all men protecting women by way of holding their hand. Indeed, it explores the lengths certain men are willing to go for the female and Shellie's and Nancy's repeated attempts to stand up to their male aggressors in Jackie Boy and The Yellow Bastard, respectively, see them more than mere objects that need saving. Sin City is one of my favourites of the decade; a whirling, spinning experience of a film – the likes of which all should see.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Depressive art with bullets and violence,"Alright, I have to admit, I'm a fan of anything in the film-noir genre. But this simply blew me away.At first, the story seemed a little hard to grasp since it started off nowhere, flew to another personage, gave me a sneak peak of yet another, and then went back along the road of person number two. By the end of the film, everything had become clear, and my only regret left here is that the characters of the three different stories never truly meet.The camera, the acting, the gray blur... It was all exactly where it had to be. As the story truly kicks off with the beginning of Marv's story, you immediately get violently pulled into the movie. Marv might remind you of the incredible Hulk at times, but he's far from it. You hear him voice-over his own story as you see blackened glimpses of his wrecked face. When the story flips to Dwight, it's the ladies' turn to relieve their anger. The women shown in his part of the movie know how to row their own boat, and this is gruesomely but beautifully demonstrated while Dwight comments on his own story. Last but not least, Hartigan's story rolls over you like a tidal wave, as he fills you in on what happened to him since we last left him at the very beginning of the movie.This is a movie in exactly the way that I like it; cold dead reality with a whiff of fantasy, filmed by a depressive camera while a man with nothing to lose adds in the fitting one-liners. I can't say anything for people who have read the book, but I can say this; If you liked the Max Payne games, go watch this. If you like a movie showing the slum-like sides of life, go watch this. And most of all; if you like art consisting of bullets, violence and depression, go watch this.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sinsational Comic Book Comes To Life,"'Sin City' is a fantastic and very stunningly accurate adaptation of Frank Miller's comic book series. Rodriguez and Miller wonderfully bring out the essence of the very graphic books. Though it is told in a 'Pulp Fiction' type, non-chronological manner, it keeps one amazed and makes full use of CGI. The editing makes it slick while the cinematography brilliantly adds to the haunting gory atmosphere. Colour is both effectively and minimally used as it further gives a comic book noire feel. 'Sin City' is filled with guns, blood, babes, murder, sickness and so many kinds of danger.While the cast is very impressive as most of the actors blend into the characters well enough, Willis isn't convincing as a 70 year old and he seems to be a little too popular which makes him the odd one out. While many praise Elijah Wood's performance, I fail to see anything remarkable. Throughout the whole film, all the actor does is sport the same expressionless look. That may have been all the character required but then it didn't require much acting and a lot of special effects was put into it. Hartnett does not seem to convince as the Salesman, particularly when he's using his charm (which Hartnett lacks). Roarke is superb and hardly recognizable. Owen and del Toro provide some of the best moments. Stahl is quite adequate. Hauer and Booth are menacing. The women hold their own and all of them do great. Dawson is particularly effective as the dominatrix/godmother while Gugino, Alba, King and Murphy are very good and Bledel and Gugino are particularly stunning to look at.Though 'Sin City' has been claimed to be a guy film, I don't see why women cannot enjoy it. Yes, most of the women in 'Sin City' are prostitutes but these women are just as powerful as the men and they defend their own territory, their own kind. They are not portrayed only as mere sex objects, mind you.Everything finely fits together in 'Sin City'. It's Rodriguez's best work to date. Everyone involved in the making should be commended for their effort that's wonderfully paid off. It's certainly not a film to sit down with the family (Yes, it's deservedly and strongly rated 'R') but a great watch with friends or otherwise. I'm eagerly awaiting the next installments of 'Sin City' and hope to catch it on the big screen this time.",,Anonymous,Crime
Very Violent and Overrated,"""Sin City"" has just been released in the Brazilian movie theaters and, when a saw the IMDb Rating #93, I said to myself: ""- I will see ""Sin City"" in the theater"". However, some movie lover's friends of mine were very disappointed after watching it. When I read the review of ""Sin City"" of the Brazilian director and journalist Arnaldo Jabor (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413020/) on the newspaper, I definitely decided to rent the imported DVD and watch it with my family at home. We saw this movie yesterday, and we all did not like it. ""Sin City"" is visually impressive, with a magnificent black & white cinematography; the cast is a constellation; the opportunist, commercial and overrated director Robert Rodriguez indeed transposed a comic magazine to the screen using Tarantino's name and violence. However, the story has too much free violence and most of the characters are very nasty. I did not find ""Sin City"" a bad movie, but completely overrated. The spot of #93 is totally unfair and a complete disrespect with other films of the history of the cinema, some of them masterpieces of the worldwide cinema and not considered in IMDb Rating criteria due to the quantities of vote, as if quantity could mean quality. Further, I noted in the breakdown that most of this votes belong to young people, making me sad when I see how used to violence they are. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sin City""",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Based off the comic books.,"Now I've never read the comic books. Didn't even know they existed until this movie came out. Even seeing the trailers for this movie I couldn't tell what it was about just knew it looked awesome. My older cousin was really waiting for it to come out. He reads lots of comics and ended up being the one to take me to see the movie when it came out. I happy to say the trailers didn't lie to me. This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen in my opinion. For going into it not knowing anything about it I came out quite impressed.I'm normally not one for black and white movies, I have been working on getting over that though. Not to say this movie doesn't have any color in it, just to say for the most part it's black and white. It takes nothing away from the film though. In fact I think it makes it better that way. The cast that was chosen were all great in their rolls, the way the movie was done on a whole was just great in my opinion.This movie is in no way meant for children. It went all the way and didn't hold back. It's gritty and the CGI is at its best. This movie is definitely in my top ten favorite movies. Id recommend it to anyone who likes a good action movie but who can also handle the violence that this movie delivers.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

a brilliant job of producing something completely unnecessary,"It is true: Sin City is the most faithful adaptation of a comic or graphic novel to date. And yet, and yet Back in the old days, about a decade ago, comic-book movies were not respectable, Joel Schumacher hammering the last nails in the coffin. And then the renaissance: Unbreakable (not an adaptation, unless you count the steal from Grant Morrison's Doom Patrol), the Spider-Man movies, and Hulk (most people thought that fell badly between two stools  too artsy for the explosions crowd, too explosive for the artsy crowd  but I love it). These were movies giving us what we loved about comics. And now here comes Sin City, essentially Frank Miller's work converted directly from page to screen. Which is the movie's biggest problem. In their heroic efforts to stay faithful to the source material, Miller and Rodriguez seem to have missed a rather banal truism: movies are not comic books. What worked so well on paper does not necessarily succeed on film (or computer, as the case may be). On paper, the whole thing is literally two-dimensional, and the stylisation is pretty much the raison d'etre. But when you actually get real people (well, actors, at any rate) saying the lines and doing the things the characters do, this brings a whole new level of meaning to light. The graphic novels could get away with the violence and the stock situations (clichés, if you like) and the intense misanthropy because they were firmly rooted in a particular kind of pulp fiction. But if you start looking at Sin City the movie in the context not of comic books but of other movies, what were once virtues now look horribly like flaws. In a movie with so many characters, and fine actors, it's a shame that only two of them (Marv and Hartigan) are anything other than cardboard cutouts  and in both those cases, the depth of character comes more from their thoughts rather than their actions. Both of these stories involve violent revenge and the search for redemption through the love of a beautiful blonde. The middle story involves ah, I got bored at this point gun-toting prostitutes feminism's not my strong point but alarm bells were ringing at the idea of women who seem fully in control of their own lives and yet choose to be sleazy hookers which gets me thinking about Nancy  was there any particular reason, plot-wise I mean, that she had to be a table-dancer and not, say, a law student? You can get away with these things in comics but in the cold light of cinema it all starts to seem a bit adolescent. As for the male characters, there is, intriguingly, rather a lot of crotch-related violence. Oh the violence. Again, a still image of violence is one thing, but on screen it careers between too-real and too-cartoony. ""I didn't scream, Hartigan"", breathes Nancy after getting a sound whipping from a psycho. Good for you, love, they could have done with you back in Billy Budd's time.Which is not to say I hated the film. I did quite like most of it. I haven't addressed the technical aspects here, because I think it goes without saying that Sin City is technically brilliant. There is a time and place for style over substance, though, and while I hate to admit it, I think possibly that at 34 I'm getting too old for this sh*t.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Super cool,"Sin City is a Frank Miller graphic comic brought to the screen by Miller as co-director along with Robert Rodriguez. It is violently entertaining ride from start to finish. Mickey Rourke is Marv, wearing such incredible prosthetics, that I didn't realize it was him until I read the credits. There are several story lines and Rourke's is my favorite. He awakens next to a murdered prostitute and is framed by corrupt policemen. He is in and out of the story while seeking the real killer and uncovering a web of deception.The second most interesting character is Rutger Hauer as Cardinal Patrick Henry Roaring, a rather nasty man of the cloth with disgusting tastes; a deeply disturbed individual. The confrontation between the Cardinal and Marv(Rourke) is one of the most vicious and memorable scenes since Michael Madsen's ear cutting scene in ""Reservoir Dogs."" Of course co-director Rodriguez is good friends with Quentin Tarantino's, and Q.T. directed one of the segments here.Bruce Willis also appears as a older cop in bad health trying to save a stripper played by the beautiful Jessica Alba, in a father-daughter relationship which is one of the plot lines from Miller's books.Many other characters appear including Brittany Murphy and Rossario Dawson as prostitutes and the aforementioned Michael Madsen as a cop. The ensemble is without weakness and this looks like a comic book translated to film with vivid colors of same. A sequel is in the works and I have high expectations.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Target audience will love it & it's a nice contrast to the usual summer fare but the sexual violence and depiction of women will be a problem to some,"There is no denying that, for a mainstream Hollywood summer blockbuster that visually Sin City is impressively different, stylish and quite daring. Not only does it provide George Lucas with a simple lesson in how to effectively use a blue screen, but it also provides an experience that looks unique and fascinating to be worth a look. The characters are all larger than life, the backdrops drip with smoke, grim, corruption and hopelessness and only occasionally does the CGI look clunky or the actors have the body language of people who are totally disconnected from their surroundings. The mix of black/white and colour is perhaps a bit obvious but is still a nice touch and, although I didn't think it pulled it off, the attempts at film noir played well with genre clichés.Because the stories and characters are larger than life, the narratives do struggle a bit and it is only their pace and unrelenting grim violence that makes it possible to stick with it. However after about an hour I had got the idea (it is stylish, gritty and violent) and it didn't have much more after that  I never got bored but the more time went on the less impressed I was by it. The style of the film is grimy but it is no film noir in the sense that those familiar with the genre with be used to  instead of being suggestive it is blatant, instead of being sensual it is vampish, instead of being dark it is gory. While this is not a major problem in itself, the film does feel like it is dressing in clothes that are too big for it and aping films that made this all look so effortless many decades ago. Despite this, it was still so far so good  not enough substance perhaps but the style and genre clichés still were enjoyable.The only really troubling aspects of the film come in the form of the women. All the characters are stereotypes designed to appeal to the adolescent male in the audience  whatever age he may actually be; men are grizzled, bloodied and yet somehow invincible until their heroic poetic deaths while the women are gorgeous, sexual and available. Although hardly useful for a character driven film (which this never is) it would have been acceptable  certainly these are roles that endless action movies cast the two sexes into. However with Sin City there is a constant, unpleasant air of sexual violence and fetishistic domination of these women that left a bad taste in my mouth  I'm sure the film is just being true to the material but it is difficult to swallow nonetheless. In noir, the women are often controlling of the men and if anyone destroys them, it is often themselves. Here women are beaten and they like it, they need men to protect them from other men, they are gorgeous but give it up like it was a bad habit, generally they are not defined by who they are but by what they are  ""dykes"", strippers, whores, rape victims and killers; that they are not real people is not a problem but the film's depiction and use of them within the narrative goes beyond the mere ""trophyism"" of music videos and adverts and is very close to being misogyny so harsh and spiteful it is.Thanks to the pace and style though, I was mostly able to put this out of my mind and enjoy it as a comic book noir that appeals to those who like the noir style without having to watch old films and miss out on extreme violence and MTV flesh. Miller deserves credit for the style but Rodriguez brings it to life convincingly well. His cast are mostly good because they buy into it with such conviction, although, lets be honest here, other than the makeup and gruff voices, the male actors didn't have a massive stretch of their skills. Willis plays a role he had played so often it must be like second; Rouke is better because his character seems dumber and driven by love for a woman that didn't care for him (see  that's film noir) and I liked what he did with it. Stahl is pretty good and Clive Owen takes to the ""hard man cool"" like a duck to water. The male support cast are pretty good even if Boothe, Duncan, Hauer and Wood just come and go in minor roles. The women all look great and that is pretty much all that is asked of them. Dawson is gorgeous and playful but can't have been comfortable in those clothes; Murphy does her usual playful smile thing but just don't expect her to bring any gravitas to a character thrown between abusive, doomed men  not only doesn't she, she never tries. Alba is OK for all she does but the presence of Aoki proves that it is more who than what you know in the business. None of the women are that good but then this is not a women's film and they are only there for one thing.Overall, complaining about male/female stereotypes in a summer blockbuster is a bit like taking a bath and moaning about getting wet, but the degree of sexual violence and the depiction of women does take some swallowing and will be a big problem to some viewers. The grimy style may smack of someone aping noir rather than ""doing"" noir but it is at least refreshingly different from the usual summer fare. The lack of depth is a minor problem but it still works thanks to the pace and engagingly gritty and dark story lines leaving me in no doubt that (as shown by the presence of Tarantino) that this will have the geeky ""fan-boy"" target audience hunched over, furiously loving every minute of it.",,Anonymous,Crime
Visual Rape vs. Brilliant Neo-Film-Noir,"Robert Rodriguez is something of an enigma. Take a look at what he's directed: Once Upon a Time in Mexico, the Spy Kids trilogy, Desperado, and now Sin City. Frankly, I don't think that Rodriguez has much of an identity as a director, except to use some sort of show-offy stylish direction in his action films. Sin City is more of the same, even though I would like to think that there is a method to Mr. Rodriguez's madness.Sin City is indeed stylish, and is filmed in a way that is different any other film I have seen. Black and white are the two predominant colors, but Rodriguez (with the help of Miller and Tarantino) also infuses certain objects and body parts with color (eyes, blood, etc.). It was especially interesting to me why certain things were colored, while others were not. Again, I would hope that there is a specific and symbolic meaning behind each use of color, but I fear that color was used sporadically and spontaneously to catch the viewer's attention.Indeed, this strikes me as a film dying to keep the viewer's attention for over two hours. Ultra-violence does just the trick, so Rodriguez makes sure that, every five seconds (literally), there is some kind of explosion or blood-splatter. If for some reason the violence misses its five second cue, there's always some nudity to add to the mix. On this level, the film is a repulsive bit of excrement.Yet on another level, Miller and Rodriguez are merely going to extreme length to show the corruption of modern urban culture, where the good guys love violence and the bad guys love it too. There are no answers here, and the line is very thin between good and evil, so possibly this too is Rodriguez portraying his bleak view. There's also the mandatory Shakespearean reference that was of interest to me.Then there's the acting and the dialogue. Again, I'm not sure whether the acting is just plain bad or if it is purposely cartoonish to fit the whole comic book scenario. The dialogue is the same way: performed in such a way as to set the mood for a stylized neo-film-noir.Overall, I'm really not sure what to think of this film. On the one hand, it is viewer rape, a method of forcibly taking from the viewer every ounce of adrenaline he or she is worth by any means possible. On the other hand, it is a eye-catching statement regarding evil and total depravity.Whatever Sin City is, it forced me to leave the theater feeling somehow cheated.Final Grade: C+.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
'That's one damn fine looking coat youre wearing....',"Has to be one of the greatest graphic novel adaptations ever made; cinematic yet faithful to the source and a crazy experience! Set up as four different stories (The Customer Is Always Right, The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow B******) all intermingling, its a masterpiece in gritty noir storytelling and the best use of voiceover you're ever likely to hear! It's hard to choose a favourite section as they blend seamlessly and it's really well crafted. The cast are fantastic; from the opening tinged with seductive romance starring Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton, the document of a tired Sin City Cop who has one last mission to exact justice on starring Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba, the iconic Marv seeking retribution for his murdered lover starring Mickey Rourke and Jaime King, a man seeking revenge on a sadistic drunk starring Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro and Rosario Dawson. That's just the beginning of the talent with great supporting roles all over too, particularly Elijah Wood and Devon Aoki as Deadly Little Miho! I think what makes this stand out also is that every character is fully rounded; it'd be easy for something like this to be all style over substance but it is lovingly made with a passion for telling the characters story while being a fast-paced piece of entertainment.It's full of action and is a beautifully unique visual experience; I think it may be Rodriguez's definitive masterpiece co-directed wonderfully with Sin City creator Frank Miller and featuring a delightfully blackly comic sequence directed by Quentin Tarantino!

Thin gruel for a starving palate,"This movie should have been much better. Visually impressive, it lacked any story whatsoever, and left me wondering, well into the ""Marv"" bit, when this movie would actually get started. It simmered long enough, but fresh scenes of gore, or the dialogue to seed the ideas, does not make a good movie. ""Natural Born Killers"" was all the rage when it came out, but its groundbreaking visuals grew dated very quickly without the solid writing and strong acting of the ""Badlands"" example it tried to update.I haven't looked at Miller's graphic novels, but having read other IMDb reviews raving about ""Sin City"" (the movie's) great story lines, I don't intend to seek out the originals. Truly, the one saving grace of this movie was Rourke's performance; as with Travolta's resurrection in ""Pulp Fiction,"" I predict we'll see a lot more from Rourke in the future.It seems to me that ""Sin City"" capitalizes on the same energy as ""Kill Bill- Vol. 1,"" but just doesn't pull it off nearly as well. It's sad, but there will never be another chance to do ""Sin City"" the right way, the first time, again. And really, if this WAS ""the right way"" to do ""Sin City,"" it doesn't say much for Miller's graphic novels.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A shabby and scurrilous use of the genre.We could be forgiven for believing Bruce Willis did not actually appear in this movie but was digitally recreated from a dozen or so identical roles he has played previously.As for Clive Owen, if some clever nurd could digitally improve his patent lack of acting ability he may one day aspire to the position of stardom consistent with the appeal of the squareness of his jaw.On a more positive note, Mickey Rouke gave an outstandingly good classic comic book performance. Hellboy sprang to my mind as perhaps his inspiration. Whatever, he was the highlight.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Technically interesting, but no heart","Three stories from Frank Miller's celebrated series of graphic novels are loosely intertwined here in what is undoubtedly a highly personal project for director Robert Rodriguez and co-director Miller. The film certainly captures the visceral nature of Miller's work, with its curious focus on genital mutilation and dismemberment (but is surprisingly coy when it comes to Miller's penchant for nudity). As an experiment in aesthetics, it works - it's fun, it's technically interesting. As a film for an audience of more than two? Well, that's something else. The three narratives are insufficiently connected for this ever to gel as a single piece, and whatever chance there is of immersing yourself in the Sin City universe is constantly undermined by the insistent use of voice-over narration. You're never allowed to fall into the world, but rather are distracted by a never-ending string of ""hard boiled"" one-liners that describe precisely what you're seeing on screen or could reasonably deduce from the performances if the camera were ever allowed to linger on them. They could be interesting stories about complex, damaged people, but Rodriguez fails to get the most out of the material because he doesn't seem to trust it - or trust himself. In his obsession to replicate the precise look of what's on the page he fails to use more of the power of the screen - strong performances, real atmosphere, temporal and aural control rather than just visual. It leaves me wondering why he bothered. If you're not going to use the power of the other register, why bother with a transposition? The result is a film which is technically accurate, visually stunning, but ringingly hollow at the core. The whole piece seems overly cruel as a way of masking its lack of character, humanity, or actual story. And rather than growing out of the long noir tradition, it feels like a postmodern hijacking of it. Worse, it isn't even hijacked for good reason - it doesn't add to the tradition, nor critique it, nor say anything new or interesting about it. Miller has said repeatedly that his central theme is love. But in a town this self-indulgently violent and artfully superficial, it's hard to take any such subtext seriously.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent Style!,"Sin City is one of those rare films from the film noir genre that I seen. This movie certainly impressed with me with its unique style. The whole film was shot in black and white with the exception of a few colors here or there. Also, this movie is very violent. The violence reminds me of the Kill Bill movies.This movie basically tells the story of three hit men who are thirsty for righteousness in a way but in order to get that, they do nothing but kill.The cast is impressive. There are many stars such as the great Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke. Jessica Alba looks hot as she usually does.Now this movie is not for kids. There is plenty of death and prostitution here. But I like it one these kind of movies come out once in a while. They usually have great visuals like this film.Overall, this is a great though violent film. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Visual originality on good old fashioned film noir themes,"It's hard to rate a movie that has its focus on style, rather than story, but still manages to use good plots with interesting rich characterization. Is it a perfect film or just a niche genre that cannibalizes comic books and dazzles us with nice visuals and huge stars?For me it was a bit of both. I loved the visuals and I liked the noir theme, but then I am of a certain age; I grew up with stories like that. The indomitable males that can resort to violence as easily as they breathe and only need a fantasy woman to get into action are kind of an endangered species today, when every hero must obey the politically correct guidelines of the present and all the women must be more than good looking damsels in distress, but you can see how that way of thinking was the archetype of all the hero action movies in the last 50 years. It feels strange to see a 68 year old cop kissing the 19 year old girl who is truly in love with him. Today only Michael Douglas can pull that off, and only in a film that shows how pathetically misguided he is. And how strange it is to get those morally ambiguous endings when the hero wins and also loses. Fair trade?I can only recommend watching this film. Even if it would have been worse, I would have still recommended it. The unique style, the modernized noir, the amazing cast. The only thing that I kind of disliked was that it is a mosaic film. There are actually three stories and one very short one. They kind of intersect, but only accidentally. Well, watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Sin City"" - Digitalized violence, film-noir, steroids, and comic book greatness!","""Sin City,"" directed by one of the greatest directorial trifectas - Robert Rodriguez, ""Sin City"" graphic novel creator Frank Miller and special guest director Quentin Tarantino - is a visually stunning and breathtaking piece of film-noir graphic novel, cinematic greatness on steroids.By and large, this is what a movie based on a comic book should be. It's flawlessly adapted from the source material, with only a few slight changes (presumably to avoid the more explicit contents of the original comic book) and many of Miller's panels come to life on the screen through Rodriguez's skillfully placed camera. Comic book movies represent one of the remaining avenues for truly original film-making, and ""Sin City"" takes full advantage of its digitalized violence and groundbreaking CGI vainglory. And the cast (and what a cast!) brings the shady, corrupt characters to life, along with the amoral Basin City metropolis they inhabit.As a newbie reader of Miller's work on ""Sin City,"" I was amazed at the care that went into Rodriguez's attention to the story as it unfolded on the screen. As mentioned earlier, the visuals are lifted right out of the original ""Sin City"" graphic novel panels, so audience members would not have to be readers themselves to understand what's going on.Although the world of ""Sin City"" exists through seven transversal story arcs, the film primarily focuses in on Miller's three tales ""The Hard Goodbye,"" ""The Big Fat Kill,"" and ""That Yellow Bastard."" It's brutal, it's violent, it's vicious, it's beautiful, and it's sinful. The events in ""Sin City"" kickoff after a brief narration by The Man (Josh Hartnett)...In ""The Hard Goodbye,"" a hulking, hard-luck loser named Marv (Mickey Rourke, under about 15 pounds of prosthetic makeup) wakes up in the bed of a run-down motel room with a dead prostitute laying next to him. The hooker, identified by Marv as Goldie (Jaime King), apparently picked him up in a seedy bar and showed him the time of his life. But, somehow, someway, somebody sneaked into the room and offed her while she slept, and Marv, framed for the murder, now scours the streets and alleys for her killer.This is my favorite of the three, as ""The Hard Goodbye"" was the first ""Sin City"" graphic novel I picked up at Barnes & Noble Booksellers a few months ago. Rourke is a total bad-ass as Marv, virtually unrecognizable underneath such heavy-duty prosthetics and bandages. He eventually finds his quarry, Kevin (Elijah Wood), a nerd-looking, silent psychopath who kills women, eats them, and hangs their heads on the wall. Rutger Hauer co-stars as Cardinal Roark and a scantily-clad Carla Gugino also appears as Marv's lesbian parole officer, Lucille.In ""The Big Fat Kill,"" corrupt cop Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) is about to break down the door of his stripper lover Shellie (Brittany Murphy). What Jackie Boy doesn't know, is Shellie has a new man in her life, and that man is Dwight (Clive Owen). Dwight is a wanted murderer who underwent plastic surgery and has found unlikely love with the hardened Shellie. Well, to make long stories short, all hell breaks loose when Jackie Boy and his lackeys wander into the wrong part of town and are killed by chop-soki swordswoman Miho (Devon Aoki).In this part of the city, known as Old Town, the whores are their own enforcers as they have an uneasy truce with the corrupt police. But with Jackie Boy and his loser friends getting wasted, that truce has gone bye-bye. Gail (the luscious, the leather-and-chain-bound Rosario Dawson) is the leader, and Dwight formulates a plan to dump the bodies into the distant tar pits. But between getting there, narrowly evading the cops (including Michael Clarke Duncan) and assorted foreign mercenaries and his own stupidity, each of these almost prove to be Dwight's undoing.Oh, wow, where to begin. For starters, Rosario Dawson!!! I never knew this woman could look so hot in S&M, not that I'm into that sort of thing, but damn, I at least partially bought this just to see her in leather and chains. As Dwight, Clive Owen hits all the right notes as an outsider anti-hero in way over his head, and Devon Aoki is pretty vicious as Miho, who serves up some delectable sushi bad guys with the same swords used in the ""Kill Bill"" films. But ""The Big Fat Kill"" is big, bloody, and fun.""That Yellow Bastard"" is the only one of the three I haven't read (not that it really matters), so I have to go on what the movie says. The yellow bastard in question is an unrecognizable Nick Stahl as Roark Jr., the psychopathic son of Senator Roark (Powers Boothe). He's racked up a nasty reputation on the Basin City streets as a vicious serial killer who loves to torture women, and his latest target is stripper Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba). Hartigan (Bruce Willis), one of the only honest cops left in the city, has a bad heart and little patience for incompetence, which only intensifies when he is stopped by his partner Bob (Michael Madsen) from killing Roark Jr. and is then sentenced to a lengthy prison term. Hartigan escapes, and then goes after Roark Jr., who is setting his sights once again on the innocent Nancy.""Sin City"" is already one of the most talked-about films this year. It's definitely not for the faint-of-heart, as the stylized and incredibly bloody violence should ruffle a few feathers. The numerous unsavory characters are truly right out of a comic book, as they make no attempt to rise above their amoral existences in Miller's decadent Basin City.There are few heroes in ""Sin City"" and there are even fewer identifiable characters, but there's no two ways about it: ""Sin City"" is a visual masterpiece, a pumped-up comic book come to life on steroids, and is one of the best movies I've seen this year.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Sin City - sorry, guys...","Just saw this for the first time and, oh boy I wanted to enjoy it. But while I appreciate that I am probably in a sulky minority of one, I'll admit to being a little disappointed. Praise has been heaped on the film by fans who see it as one of most successful realisations to date of comic book to big screen, and the stylisation was striking which one imagines is, alongside with the dialogue, Miller's chief contribution. But to this viewer it still seems a shallow film despite (or because of) these origins, another to add to the increasingly empty tally created by Rodriguez, even if not quite so annoying as the macho posturing of Once Upon a Time in Mexico - another film in which the director thinks showing 'cool' is the answer to all the requirements of an action narrative - or the self indulgent mess of Lava Girl, come to that. Aided by the author himself (and by Tarantino as well, apparently) Sin City has mostly the same tone throughout, either a gravelly-voice gravitas instituted by the principals or a continuous tone of humourless, hard boiled pastiche - fun in a short film maybe, but wearing after half an hour or so. When lighter-hearted moments did occur - such as when a henchman idly contemplates an arrow through his chest - it was much needed contrast. God help the viewer who opts for the 140 minute expanded edition coming in December.This while the joining together of different stories, even if it cemented Miller's vision, wasn't exactly subtle either. Gone, certainly, is the narrative skill of Pulp Fiction and perhaps Tarantino could have been brought earlier at the script phase as the arch dialogue, while initially fun, is a million miles from the memorable banter between the thugs of Reservoir Dogs. But perhaps Miller thinks what fits in the speech balloons of a comic is good enough to carry things along on screen over a much longer stretch of time - sadly, it's not.One doesn't have to be a feminist either to find the treatment of women less than enlightened: either conniving, weakling or, (as a token gesture perhaps) temporarily empowered by the plot only to have the masculinity of events take them over. The whores of Old Town may fire the guns down onto their enemies, but its the men who always do the significant talk and walk. (And wasn't that female-samurai sword killer a new stereotype, something we've seen already in Kill Bill?) The film makes up a sort of adolescent wet dream of 'cool' violence and mild S & M which shows the influence of Tarantino and crowd more than any particular imagination. I've nothing against screen violence, cool or not, but when most else is stripped out so that it becomes the raison d'etre of the narrative, leaving only style behind, it left this viewer at least feeling sorely cheated, and desperate for some variety. A good word here, though for Micky Rourke, who in Marv created the most memorable character and who elicited genuine sympathy; a bad word for Clive Owen who seemed miscast to me, as well as the variable female actresses who populated 'Old Town'. And what's with Bruce Willis' Hartigan? A tough guy who complains about being an old man, close to retirement, on one last case etc, only to be shot endlessly, all this before leaving prison '8 years later'... looking as spruce and as youthful as he went in (greeted by a similarly unchanged Michael Masden I may add)? Maybe I am getting too old, but I found it hard to finish the film, and ultimately I found it irresistible to imagine some of Sin City's most fervent adherents uncritically watching the show on offer with the same rapt, brain-dead expression as the prematurely de-limbed Kevin..",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A perfect translation from page to screen.,"Well before I left the theater, the first time I watched Sin City, I knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies, ever. It's one of the rare movies that I went to the theater to see multiple times, forcefully dragging along any of my friends who hadn't seen it (and the smart ones who already had). It's just that good. It's the best film ever based on comic books or graphic novels, and I doubt that will ever change (until Sin City 2, that is).Robert Rodriguez realized that the source material was basically perfect, all he had to do was get the cinematography and casting right. And he succeeded brilliantly. The nearly frame-for-frame creation of the comic panels works so well, because there's nothing really that could have been added to improve what was on the page. And the sheer amount of great actors and actresses collected here is impressive, to say the least. They embody the characters without overwhelming them.This isn't the perfect movie for everyone, but I don't see how it could disappoint anyone who is familiar with the novels, a fan of Miller's style, or anyone who enjoys a dark, funny, and stylish action movie. I love it from the very first scene to the very last. Which is great, because I'm sure I'll have watched it at least 20 more times, before a sequel gets made.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Intriguing visuals, but the stories are getting tedious after a while","The big problem with ""Sin City"" is that it probably doesn't make for a good transition to film. Robert Rodriguez adapted the look of the comic book faithfully and the visuals are indeed pretty intriguing, but the different stories aren't particularly gripping. The monologes of the respective characters are getting tiring after a while and even the comical quality of the exaggerated violence in this movie doesn't make the whole experience any more exciting. There are some fine actors in this movie (great to see Rutgar Hauer coming back to a big budget production), but Rodriguez directs them all to act like cold, emotionless bricks. Maybe that's what he thought the comic demanded, maybe it's supposed to be super cool, but for me that kind of acting plus the neverending monologes just made the movie monotonous. While I did appreciate the original and affectionate approach and to a certain extend the ridiculous acts of violence, the movie left me indifferent and bored in the end. Still, Rodriguez made a much more honorable effort with ""Sin City"" than he did with ""Spy Kids"". It was about time.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
It's just one of those films that you cannot call anything but cool,"Frank Miller's Sin City is simply, the best comic book film ever made. For every film with characters based in comics, you always hear the critic commenting on whether the film was good or not, and you always hear the fanboys screaming out how the film completely ignores the comics mythos. For Sin City, both camps were raving. Robert Rodriguez, in his bold move of making Frank Miller his co-director, has helped to create a fantastically dark and sick looking film that feels more authentic than any other comic book film ever has.The film mainly chronicles three of Frank Miller's stories (with tidbits of a fourth). The opening and closing story, ""That Yellow Bastard"", is about Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a hardnosed cop with a ""bum ticker"" (as he keeps mentioning), attempting to end the cycle of sexual depravity for Junior (Nick Stahl). The second takes off right after the opening of ""Bastard"", and is ""The Hard Goodbye"". It recalls Marv's (Mickey Rouke, behind layers and layers of face makeup) quest to find the killer(s) who set him up for the murder of Goldie (J'aime King), the one woman who treated him better than the monster he is. The final story, sandwiched in the middle of ""Goodbye"" and the ending of ""Bastard"", is ""The Big Fat Kill"". This story chronicles Dwight (Clive Owen) and his desire to ensure that a pack of thugs, including Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro, again, under heavy face makeup), do not harm any girls in Basin City (notice where the title comes from?).Revealing any of the other elements of the story only ruins the film, as all of them tie together into one collective story.Having read the comics after seeing the film, I can only stand even more amazed than I was after getting up in the theatre. Rodriguez, Miller and Co. have literally taken the images off the comic book pages, and put them to celluloid. Every bit of the dark and brooding atmosphere of the books, is here in the film. From the black and white with splashes of choice colour, to the provocative clothing, to the strong graphic violence, even down to getting actors who look distinctly like their characters in the books (including those with horrific makeup); it's all here, and it all feels distinctly authentic.The story lines, no matter how darkly bizarre, brutally violent or how bleakly funny they become, all stay true to the comics. Every single actor breathes life into the words of Miller, and acts out their parts very well. When you look at the actor acting out their part, you cannot help but feel you are reading one of the books. It's that distinctive, and that much true to the books. Yes, there were a few changes in regards to the excessive nudity of the books, but the change was an obvious one that does not take away from the films at all. If anything, it only adds to weak areas of the books.Even more amazing than anything however, is the visual effects. The entire film was filmed on a green-screen, with only a few sets actually built. The rest is fully computer generated, and was filmed in parts (with many of the actors sharing the screen, never meeting each other until later on). The way Rodriguez has helped capture the film, is a testament to what digital technology holds for us in the future. It's sharp and is clearly, the only way Miller's stories could have ever been justifiably shown in a film. Every character looks like they are on every set, and nothing looks fake at all.For everything that is done right in the film, it still is not absolutely perfect. The pacing is a bit off in many of the scenes, and having ""Yellow Bastard"" bookend the three stories really was not a wise choice (as it is the most uninteresting, and is mainly filled with exposition). There's just something off in the editing, and it really takes away from the strength the rest of the film packs. It's a fantastic film, and the clear-cut best film of 2005. But I will be damned if I say that the editing and pacing does not feel right.It may not be for everyone, but for anyone who can see it, Frank Miller's Sin City is just one of those films that you cannot call anything but cool. It's a masterpiece, and is a film that will be remembered for a long time, if not, as the pioneer of what digital photography can do for a film. It's fantastic, and is authentic. What more could a comic book fan ask for?9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good, Bad and Ugly","Four slices of life: Detective Hartigan(Willis) saves a young girl from a pedophile; tough guy, Marv (Rourke) is framed for a murder of the prostitute he was just with; Dwight (Owen) helps the sisterhood retain control of Sin City; and Hartigan again meets the young girl he saved years ago.The Good: this is like looking at a comic book (from which the stories are derived) come to life, literally come to life. I mean every scene looks like a panel in a comic book that springs to life. And, this is awesome. Almost like magic. The action is what we see in our mind's eye when we read comics. It literally comes to life as we read on. Isn't that what a comic book panel is supposed to do? Well, it does it perfectly in this movie. The special effects are stunning and I have never seen anything like them. Most of the movie is in black and white with color thrown in at certain times. The acting also is good, but the cinematography and special effects win here.The Bad: I would have enjoyed this even more if the stories weren't as violent as they were. I saw no purpose in the overkill (the only word for it) when people were being maimed, tortured, thrown here and there, and then killed. In a comic book panel it probably doesn't have the same negative impact because we go quickly to the next panel (well, most of us do), but here the comic book panel comes to life and we can't go on until the director wants us to move on. So we stay and watch something almost real happening. Repeat: almost real. Overkill because it continues (when it should stop) and stays there when you think it should be over. Yes, I had the FF Button at the ready, but I wanted to see how long the butchery would last. It lasted too long. No purpose served here except to titillate. Much too violent.The Ugly: We see hands and legs sliced off, bodies still alive being eaten by wolves and body parts being yanked off and jettisoned every which way. It got to be a bit much. Truly Ugly. We need this?Hartigan, Marv and Dwight are ordinary people until someone tries to kill them. Then you would think they were Clark Kent aka Superman. They are hard to kill or stop and they keep coming back when you know they don't have any more breath in them to continue. I ran out of breath just watching. But continue they do. Somehow, they find their second, third, fourth etc winds and continue to fight and try not to be taken out or killed.If you thought there was too much violence in Pulp Fiction or Natural Born Killers, you have a big surprise waiting for you with this one. The cinematography and special effects are outstanding and you could say that it is a true work of art, but the violence is really too much. And, that brings it down for entertainment value.

I was in a movie theatre, watching the latest from the guy who directed ""El Mariachi"" You know the guy with the hat. This is his movie. Everything can be a movie now more than ever.

Now and again Hollywood hits home with something really great,"As comic book adaptions go, you just don't get any better than this. Sin City does a rare thing where it scores equally highly as a piece of innovative visual art as it does as entertainment. Much of the success must surely be put down to Robert Rodriguez working alongside Frank Miller the creator of the comic. With Miller on board it meant that the movie was unlikely to end up being watered down and safe. In actual fact Sin City is a fairly uncompromising movie as far as comic-book adaptions go. It's full of sadism, sexuality and perversion. This is in keeping with the original comic which was based in a place full of corruption, sleaze and violence.The narrative is made up of several inter-connected crime stories, á la Pulp Fiction (in fact Quentin Tarantino directed the scene where Dwight and Jackie Boy talk in a car). Much of the information is given via voice-overs that detail the central character's inner thoughts. All of this comes direct from the original comic's pages which adds further to the faithfulness of the adaption. But over and above everything Sin City is a film of amazing visuals. Alternatively beautiful and grotesque, the look of the film is always highly inventive and experimental. The choice of doing the film in black and white with selective colour was a very bold one. But it's a decision that paid off massively.The cast is outstanding. Amongst others, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson, Benico Del Toro, Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl and Rutger Hauer star in a selection of very memorable roles. Rourke, Owen and Willis are the three central characters and all are very solid. Wood and Stahl are both seriously creepy as respectively a serial killer and a hideous paedophile. While Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba simply melt the screen such is their sheer sex appeal. In general, Sin City is considerably sexier than most Hollywood movies. Its sensuality is in fact one of its main strengths.Violent, sexy and cinematically inventive. That's Sin City. A real triumph.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

One word sums this movie up: Masterpiece! *****(out of five),"Kudos to directors Robert Rodriguez,Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino for ''Sin City'' a landmark film. Its a landmark not only for the astounding cinematography (which mixes black and white and flashes of colour to sumptuous effect) but also Rodriguez's decision to bring the man behind the comic books on which this is based - Frank Miller- on board is throughly groundbreaking and gutsy. Rodriguez actually had to resign from the DGA to bring Miller on board as it was breaking their rules. But this decision well and throughly paid off and Miller's emphatic influence on the style of the movie is there to be seen. A third director-Rodriguez's buddy Quentin Tarantino- also came on board for a few days as a ''special guest director'. Tarantino directed one brilliant sequence with Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro in a car on his own and also co-directed a few other scenes with Rodriguez and Miller.This is adapts Miller's books more faithfully than any movie based on something else before. And that is throughly what the genius that is Frank miller deserves. The film is quite simply a masterpiece and so far this is my MOVIE OF THE YEAR by a country mile and I really can't see it being topped. It ingeniously interweaves three of Miller's stories into one whole movie through a pormanteau structure similar to that of Tarantino's masterpiece ''Pulp Fiction''. The film is clever, fast-paced, exciting and sickeningly funny. The entire cast is superb but the standouts are Bruce Willis who excels as hard-boiled cop Hartigan, Nick Stahl who is terrifying as a deformed sadist known as ''Yello Bastard'' and comeback kid Mickey Rourke who is absolutely outstanding as violent thug with a heart of gold Marv.You simply cannot miss this film!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

That, or an overkill of action, special effects, violence, explosions, and rapid camera movements that make my stomach turn and my mind puzzled. Is this all the movie entertainment business has to offer? The first half hour I was impressed with the movie. Beautiful and 'stylish' black & white imagery, comic wise camera views, all very slick. Then I began to wonder why I kept on looking, while getting more nervous every minute. Beneath that superbly styled skin of the movie was this constant tone of stupid violence, aggression, pure negative energy. Do I really want to look and feel that for two full hours? What's the point? I have to say I like comic movies like the first two Batman movies, Spiderman, X-men (very good balance between story, characters and special effects), and even Hellboy or the not so very good Spawn. And although I must say this movie is an extremely good adaptation of the original comic, I have to say ""So what?"". Is it a good movie? Well, technically speaking yes. Very good indeed. Is it worthwhile watching it? Well, if you're a designer, photographer or something like that, it can be very inspiring. At least for some time. But for the rest it's a complete waist of time. And I can stand some violence in movies if it's meaningful or 'human'. I liked Kill Bill and I like the movies of Kitano. But this was all just so negative! And if that was the intention you might say this film is a success. But do I ever want to see it again? Never!",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Live Action Comic,"Watching Sin City is probably the closest thing to having a comic on the screen. The effect of having a black and white film with the occasional splash of colour is stunning. Where ever that colour is it draws you into that part of the screen, for example it was impossible not to look into Becky's blue eyes.In another film the dialogue would seem forced and possibly silly but here it fits the tone perfectly, giving it both a Film Noir feel as well as being an over-the-top comic. The acting is solid both from the well known actors and the less well known ones.I haven't read the original graphic novels so can't comment on how accurately the stories were translated to the screen but all three of the main stories were exciting and well told. It does contain quite a lot of violence but this too has a comic book feel so is less disturbing than the same acts would be in a more conventional film.The action is set in the highly corrupt Basin City where there are few good people, the heroes of the film are for the most part people you'd cross the street to avoid in real life and the villains are evil people for the most part in positions of power or protected by those with power.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliant,"A brilliant adaptation of the Frank Miller series of graphic novels. Great plot. Or should I say plots, as there are a few stories which seem to run in parallel, and then briefly intersect.Incredibly original in its combining filmed material and animation (through the use of green screen technology, apparently).

A hard-boiled and bone-chilling movie formed by various thrilling stories from Frank Miller's comic books,"Sin City provides a great technical achievement , but the stories are variations on the same righteously paternalistic vengeance narrative and by the end of Bruce Willis's tale the sadistic vigilantism and stock characters . The Pulp Fiction-style structure offers three peripherally interlocking tales : It begins in Basin City, The Man : Josh Hartnett approaches the stunningly gorgeous Customer : Marley Shelton on the balcony of a penthouse apartment and then things go awry. Mickey Rourke's conscientious brute investigates the slaying with a heart King . Upright Clive Owen takes on slimy Benicio Del Toro with the help of an army of Valkyrie prostitutes : Devon Aoki, Alexis Bledel , Rosario Dawson , Jaime King. And Bruce Willis's cop Hartigan defends a young girl who grows into Jessica Alba , from the psycho son : Nick Stahl of a powerful senator : Powers Boothe. Hell of a way to end a partnership !. In a City, There is a Shaky Truce Between Those Who Rule the Streets, and Those Who Rule Everything !. Walk down the right back alley in Sin City and you can find anything !. She smells like angels ought to smell !. Skinny little Nancy Callahan !. She grew up , he filled out !. You're gonna love this, baby !. Do I take this cop down and risk it all? There is no justice without sin !. Deadly little Miho !.A non-stop action movie with thrills , pursuits , mayhem, and lots of violence , shootouts , blood and gore . A well-developed film with high quality , several surprises and nicely paced . A hair-rising and disconcerting action-thrilller in which there are chilling images , nudism , extreme violence, and abound gory scenes. There're also various nutty roles and improbable happenings that wind out at a final apocalyptic . This violent as well as unstopped action movie is a sort of live-action equivalent of the crazy cartoon style , adding action scenes in John Woo choreography style . The surprising and twisted script besides having more than its fair scraps of funny lines , throws up unsympathetic characters . Sin City occupies a hyperfictional , nocturnal territory between Film Noir and action comic , the kinda place where men are vengeful muscle , women are curves for hire , and heart attacks , bullets and the electric chair are for pansies . Adapted with astonishing fidelity from Frank Miller's characteristically smart-macho graphic novels , the film marks a new water-shed in CGI shooting , its green-screen interpretations and digitally rendered environments slickly meshed to yield the sort of aesthetic cohesion and expressive interiority so palpable lacking in the equally stylised Lucasverse . Stand-out here is Mickey Rourke bringing wry, weary acting to a prosthetically sculpted , increasingly bandaged face that comes a granite cliff that a flock of gulls has smacked into . Nowadays, it is considered to be a cult fave of the early 2000s thanks to its twisted violence along with the state-of-art special effects. Followed by a decent sequel : ¨Sin City: A Dame to Kill For¨ (2014) with similar artistic and technician team .The motion picture was compellingly directed by Frank Miller, Quentin Tarantino and mainly by Roberto Rodriguez . Moving musical score , special cinematography , edition and nice direction by Robert Rodriguez himself . Robert Rodriguez's big hit was Mariachi trilogy formed by ¨El Mariachi¨ 1992 with Carlos Gallardo , ¨Desperado¨ 1995 with Antonio Banderas , Salma Hayek , Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino , Steve Buscemi and ¨The Mexican¨ (2003) with Banderas , Hayek , Willem Defoe , Eva Mendes . Rating : 7.5/10 , above average and innovative film. The film will appeal to action/thriller enthusiasts and star-studded fans .",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Nice Coat you Have There, Mr Miller","I feel sorry for those familiar with the graphic novels from whence the stories and framing come. They are likely to take Rodriguez at his word that this is merely a ""translation."" I suppose you can believe that and that alone and still enjoy this.But I am much luckier in that I can take this on its merits as a film, with decisions that are made because it is a film. After all, much of the art here is the selection of just which stories are used, how they are woven together and what the rhythm of the thing is. None of that came from Miller.For background, you need to know that one of the three great inventions of cinema is the notion of noir, that particular framing of narrative where the very act of watching creates a cosmology that neither belongs to the world of the watcher, nor the characters but which tortures both by arranging coincidences. All these coincidences include the coincidence that you the viewer happen to be there together with the narrator.The act of watching transmutes the vision into something you'd see, in well... a comic book.In this case we have noir become cinema, become the genre of ""graphic novel"" become a specific movie that in its collage is neonoir.That collage is three stories in a wrapper: Willis is a convict, framed by Senator Roark protecting his son, who protects a stripper; Rourke (the actor) is a convict, framed by Cardinal Roark protecting his adopted son, who gets revenge for the death of a prostitute (and is protecting other prostitutes); Owen is a convict targeted by Roark, protecting a whole society of prostitutes. Each has a hospital stay.These stories cross at several points as if they were independent threads in the same city. But wait. In neonoir, we have folds that the noir of the forties didn't have. That means that to some extent these stories all collapse into one. And yes, all three main characters (not counting the salesman who is our surrogate) hallucinate to such an extent that they could be imagining their situation into the other story.In other words, each of the three stories contains a ""dream sequence"" which is the others, each within themselves, and all within the bar. The wrapper is the salesman who seduces us, selling us one thing and slyly slipping in another.It must be hell to be a filmmaker with a flood of ideas, the digital means to make many of them happen and have no story to animate. Miller's stuff is just an excuse  a passable one  for the real artistry here. If Rodriguez makes three of these (as we expect), let's hope he tinkers with the idea as much as he did with the spy kids and desperado notions.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Crime
Over rated and pretentious,"This is by no means a 'bad film', but there is no way it deserves the coveted position of #89 (or whatever it is) on the IMDb top 250. Sure, it is inventive with the greenscreen thing, but lets be honest, a true Film Noir has to be in real surroundings, with the bleak and colourless backdrops, that actually look real.The scrip, based almost entirely on the comic book, is true to the source material, but unfortunately doesn't transfer too well to film. Clive Owen is in no way the ideal man for the job, nor the majority of the narration.There are many other points that emphasize my dislike for the film, but I can't be bothered to list them.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Comic strip action for adults with a low mental age,"Watched this movie because of the hype and quite frankly was disappointed. In a world where the criminal use of knives and guns is becoming ever threatening, I wonder do we really need to have this sort gratuitous ""bloodfest"" offered to us as a supposed work of art.When a good guy shoots a child rapist in the genitals or beats a villain to pulp are we supposed to feel relieved. This is the behaviour of the mob. Such is the mob mentality that legal justice is not an essential part of its outlook. All that is needed a target, whether guilty or innocent.The storyline was poor. The movie would have been better at 20 minutes in length. The narrative was tedious, have found it easier to stay awake watching poorer movies than this. Had no empathy for the characters. I did not care whether they lived or died.The portrayed Sin City is a nightmare world. Can't believe that anyone with goodness inside them would want to live there.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
violent as only Tarantino and Rodriguez could do it,"Before ""Sin City"" came out, I had never heard of the comic book (oh, sorry, I meant to say ""graphic novel"") on which it was based. Well, if the movie is accurately following the graphic novel, then it must be ONE COOL GRAPHIC NOVEL. The movie features several vignettes happening in a lawless town. Only a few individuals have the will to fight the nastiness that reigns supreme. Among them are Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop who always has an axed to grind; Marv (an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke), a disfigured man who won't be double-crossed; and Dwight (Clive Owen), who shows why you don't want to annoy some people.My favorite scene was when Marv was dangling a man out of a car, so to speak. And violent? This movie is V-I-O-L-E-N-T-issimo. But don't worry; it's done in good taste. ""Sin City"" is awesome almost beyond belief.

Queasy.,"For two hours, chivalrous psychotic sadists with square jaws hunt down sleazy psychotic sadists with greasy hair and physical deformities. That's more or less it -- the heroes torturing and killing men who hurt women (beautiful prostitutes with hearts of gold, mostly). The rest is gravelly voice-overs of them explaining how much they expect to enjoy torturing and killing those men when they find them.Not to say it's a bad movie. The look is great. It's just that it's a lot like the fantasies of a very, very troubled fifteen-year-old boy. That the overall rating for Sin City is over 8 provides an insight into the minds of adult comic book fans that I didn't really want or need.On the plus side, Sin City should get some credit for including a lot more shootings, clubbings, impalings, eviscerations, toilet-bowl dunkings, decapitations, knifings, machine-gunnings, neck-snappings, amputations, beatings, gougings, blowings-up and tar-drownings than you'd ever believe could fit into 124 minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
How do you spell overrated?,"Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino are no doubt thanking their lucky stars that there is a new generation born every day that has no memory of what went on before their birth. I say this because I read comments to the effect that this is the most violent mainstream film ever or such rot. Calling Sin City violent is like calling an Archie comic strip erotic. Nonetheless, this would not be a problem if the film did not have such a hype train following it, telling all and sundry how cooooooooool it is. What Sin City is, well, I describe it as being forty-five million dollars worth of digital imagery in search of a plot or an enjoyable cast. For around two hours, one spends the entire time watching distracting scenery pass by as actors recite lines they clearly are uncomfortable with and act in nigh on total darkness. Half the time, actors cannot be made out because of how dim the images are. One could be forgiven for thinking that Mickey Rourke's makeup was a dog dropping face mask.If there is a saving grace to the film, it is Jessica Alba's portrayal of the nineteen year old Nancy. She gives the character a human edge that the entire rest of the film utterly lacks. She still has too much of a tendency to speak like a Californian stoner when it is inappropriate, but in the absence of a human quality in any other part of the film, I will take whatever I can get. Bruce Willis also manages to make a decent fist of his role, but the almost complete surrounding in green panels makes it difficult for him to react. Actors will tell you that the eyes are one of the most vital acting tools, but so too is the sheer ease of having something to react to. In their scenes together, Willis and Alba really give the impression of a pair who met when one of the inviduals was a mere eleven years old. Unlike the rest of the film, Willis and Alba manage to build an emotional investment in their scenes. One constantly hopes that things will work out for this mismatched pair, even though the rest of the film makes it clear that things working out is not an option.Unfortunately, it is the selling point of the film that becomes its undoing. Professed by some to be an overly violent film, Sin City only demonstrates how much more squeamish cinema and audiences have become since the late 1980s. Much like Death Race 2000, none of the ensuing violence in Sin City looks real. Making it worse is that characters are repeatedly shot, blown up, or jump through panes of glass without suffering any of the injuries one expects from these events. After watching the end of Ransom or a true ultra-violent piece like RoboCop, Sin City comes across more like a no-consequence piece like Narnia than any sort of brutality. The almost-monochrome photography helps matters little, forcing the eyes to strain whenever the luminance does not quite jibe. Scenes in which Elijah Wood's glasses shine into the camera are particularly annoying in this regard, becoming bright enough to cause headaches in the photo-hypersensitive. Are Hollywood directors really so out of story ideas that they have to make their films unique by excluding nonstandard individuals?Actually, the idea this film has that lots of fake blood and gore is any substitute for consequence when depicting violence is not so surprising. One of its helmsmen was involved with the second and third RoboCop films, if that tells you anything. Quentin Tarantino is a moron who thinks that individuals talking about how hardcore they are is any substitute for individuals showing the audience how hardcore they are. Robert Rodriguez gives it his best shot, but the man has not directed a decent film since Desperado. It seems the amount of cash one allocates to his films and his ability to make something out of it are inversely proportional to one another. Sure, he can do a lot of easy tricks and timesavers with his digital camera, but the story or sense of adventure seem to fall by the wayside. Add these three together, and you have a problem. There is an old saying that too many cooks spoil a broth, and three directors is certainly my idea of too many. One can almost tell who directed which segment by taking careful note of the clashing visions. While Frank Miller's vision of his own comic book won out for the most part, having an author adapt his own work is not always a good thing (Maximum Overdrive, anyone?).I gave Sin City a three out of ten. It is not bad enough to be good, but it is better than the mediocre garbage I normally give a two. Aside from its tedious subject matter and artificial dialogue, there are some legitimately effective shots in the film. Elijah Wood puts on a nothing-face like no other, convincing me the boy might have some talent after all. So I guess you can say that the film did in fact achieve something.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
One word? Rocks,"I read the three full books from where the stories for this were taken before I first saw this at the cinema. I was thrilled beyond words by it then, and it still has that effect on me. This is probably best classified as noir(and my how they hit the nail on the head in how they do such a genre piece) with a shot of adrenaline. It is also the way to do a direct adaptation. Characters perfectly brought to life by a cast laced with star actors, all of whom hand in amazing performances. The tone fits that of the original material. And last, but not least, perhaps even most important: it is copied pretty much straight from the source. Frank was present during production and with Robert they put almost all of the comics on the screen. With the former's strong writing and the latter's knack for energetic direction, it's a recipe for success, and they do not let us down. The plot evolves nicely throughout, and is interesting for the entire running time. The pacing is spot-on, never letting you get bored, nor overwhelming you, in spite of the amount of cool stuff. The action, plain and simple, is awesome. There's a ton of it, and it's all well-achieved. The cinematography and editing are masterful. The humor, much of which is quite black, is great. Rodriguez throws in some of his cartoon-like bits, and they work. The score and music is all magnificent. The script is immensely well-written, and the lines are so memorable and quotable it's not even funny. There are some mighty violent and disturbing images herein, and unless you're certain you can take it, you may want to consider sitting this one out. There is also a good deal of nudity and sexuality, albeit it has been cut down considerably from the pages. There is rather little language, and what there is tends to be relatively mild. It doesn't feel restrained, in my opinion. You have to admire the guts and integrity it took to make this... anti-heroes and darkness aren't always received kindly by the masses. Among the DVD releases for this, there is the Special 2-Disc Edition... if you want my advice, I'd say to get that, if you're buying a copy of this. There are several featurettes, two audio commentary tracks(one with Miller, where Willis also briefly dips in, and one with Quentin Tarantino, and RR is on both), another audio track which is of an audience reaction(and they're all listen-worthy), and the extended cut adds some(although it isn't many minutes) of what was cut from the Theatrical(do also note that it splits the segments back up into separate ones), in addition to featuring that version, as well. The FAQ goes into more detail about exactly what is found of extras, as well as what footage remains missing. I recommend this to any fan of the graphic novels, Frank Miller and/or Robert Rodriguez. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Rough and tumble entertainment at its best,"Surreal and artful, this movie hammers you through two hours of abstracted gore with stylistic vengeance that says ""Gotcha!"" It takes itself seriously - as a time-piece (which time, however, is arguable) and as a living graphic novel. It is truer to comic-book form than any sissy ""Spiderman"" or ""Hellboy."" It's characters are disgusting and lovable - from a blood-drenched Mickey Roarke to the scantily-clad women of old town; Samuri-sword yielding Devon Aoki and the chronically-naked Carla Cugino. If there's room for improvement it's that Mickey Roarke dies too soon, and that Bruce Willis shows too much restraint in the face of great temptation... sometimes, as is the case with Jessica Alba, less (clothing)is better!

A Sin to Miss,"Miller fans had always been waiting for a film adaptation of his graphic novels, and when Sin City finally hit the silver screen, you can imagine the kind of cult following it brought with it. But not only did it bring a long awaited adaptation for fans, but it also brought a brilliant, artistic film, blended with a mixture of film noir and modern cinema that amazed masses.Sin City is an achievement in the comic-to-screen adaptation genre after countless failures from predecessors. With an absolute A-list cast, stunning cinematography and flawless direction, Sin City delivers everything anticipated. The translation from the comic to the film is almost identical and Rodriguez keeps everything true to the novels. The black-and-white film mixed with emphasized glimpses of color is a beautiful addition and the performances are absolute spot on for the most part, especially Rourke, who completely shines. Elijah Wood was another impressive, diverse performance, regardless of how brief or speechless it is.I have very little to criticize this film about - it truly is a fantastical, fresh experience. Maybe some of the script came out a bit corny in places, just as expected when translating from a graphic novel but I have seen this film many times and never tire of its brilliance.

Tribute to film noir with a mesmerizing visual style,"Film noir. A genre often about violent men stuck in a corrupt, crime-ridden city filled with menacing thugs and succubusses. The main character's situation is often a result of past mistakes, current mistakes, or just plain bad luck. This genre has been revamped over and over again, but not with such a strong flare as ""Sin City."" The movie itself is not only an example of the popular genre, but it is also like watching a comic book brought to life. Based off of the short stories from Frank Miller, ""Sin City"" is a unique tribute to the good old crime films combined with the visual style that Zack Snyder and ""The Spirit"" has copied from--desaturated tone, with strong emphasis on bright colors like red for blood, blue for eyes, and yellow for well...the yellow bastard.To explain the story of this movie would be like trying to read its outline aloud. It is not necessarily complex, on the contrary, it is straightforward. The best way to put it is a collection of four stories spread out through the two-hour film, and they are somehow tied together. Sounds very similar to Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction."" This is not surprising since he was a ""guest director"" for the film. That aside, the pace and various plots are never dull or pretentious. Each separate plot stands on its own yet has the magic to relate to the movie's whole picture. All very good I say.The all-star cast makes this movie very impressionable. Mickey Rourke stands out very strong. The hard-ass he plays feels so in character for him, like with his wonderful work in ""The Wrestler."" It may seem unfair to mention Rourke first. However, each actor, no matter their length of screen time, fits their characters with sublime perfection. Willis, Owen, Wood, Duncan, Dawson, Alba--all of them match Rourke's caliber in this film.In short, ""Sin City"" is a great movie for people with an acquire taste for comic books and film noir. The down-to-earth people who like to stick with romantic comedies and conventional action flicks may not like this so much. ""Sin City"" is not meant for everyone. It is full of gratuitous sexual content and bloody, stylized violence that ranges from cartoonish to borderline sadistic (cannibalism and castration are actions that are explored). As a viewer who relishes such debauchery put to the extreme though, I love it. A fun, visually gripping, and on occasion ridiculous, ""Sin City"" succeeds.

"""She doesn't quite cut his head off. She turns him into a Pez dispenser.""","Frank Miller is a graphic novel icon, his works becoming ever more popular due to the advent of numerous film adaptations. Probably one of the finest ever offered up to an audience has been ""Sin City"". I'd just like to note that while I definitely enjoyed the theatrical cut of the film, I prefer the extended cut. The special edition DVD (I thoroughly believe that blu-ray is a very big scam, and all I indulge in is the blu-ray player itself seeing as they boast it upgrades DVDs to 1080p regardless) allows you to watch each of the four stories in their entirety without the intercutting and you can watch them in any order you like. That being said, my personal favorite of the stories would have to be ""The Hard Good-Bye"", which stars Mickey Rourke as the bad-ass Marv who is after the murderer of his star-crossed lover Goldy (Jaime King). He's the probably the most masochistic of the protagonist (though rightfully so considering what he's up against) yet he still comes off as a very likable and you could say almost heart-warming character. Even though I enjoyed the ""Lord of the Rings"", I never cared for Hobbits but here Elijah Wood is fitting and plays the role of Kevin quite awesomely.The movie has one of the greatest cast ever assembled, starring the likes of Nick Stahl, Carla Gugino, Bruce Willis, Rutger Hauer, Rosario Dawson, and yes even Jessica Alba in one of her few good roles. The world set up by Miller is brought to screen by Director Robert Rodríguez who does have a knack for stylish action films. One thing I definitely want to say is that of the many, many comic book and graphic novel adaptations Hollywood produces each year, this is probably one of the most panel-for-panel accurate ones out there. I would know, as an avid reader of Miller's work. The film, in a similar fashion to say ""Mulholland Drive"" or ""Batman: Mask of the Phantasm"", is a neo-noir treat, which if you're a classic film buff should be easy to see with its snazzy dialogue and distinct use of shadows. Plus the score by John Debney and Graeme Revell also alludes to this nicely. The use of CGI is elaborate but necessary to make a unique presentation for the visuals, which as I said before matches the books perfectly, right down to the awesome use of color.The tales being told are violent, sensual but an awesome film experience not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Sin City — Good versus evil, blood, violence, action, in comic book style","Sin City comes straight out of its comic book pages with its incredible visuals. It presents you with gritty heroes who'll get their hands dirty to make sure good triumphs over evil, and you'll cheer them on with all your heart. They are confronted with the worst of the worst kind of human beings imaginable.Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez team up, with extra director Quentin Tarantino to deliver a violent and very bloody movie that fortunately doesn't show it too much because of the visual style.My favorite story is gladiator one, then the cop with a heart problem.Mickey Rourke is perfect as the violent yet dame-friendly super killing machine. Bruce Willis is just as good with the cop who will give anything to protect a young innocent girl. Jessica Alba is the sweetest, hottest, most adorable stripper you'll ever meet. Rosario Dawson is spectacular as the valkyrie hooker. Brittany Murphy is right on as the abuse victim waitress. Rutger Hauer has the small part of the cardinal but plays it well. Finally, it's probably Clive Owen's best career performance, since his acting range is rather limited.The dialogs might be a bit weak at times, but it is keeping with the style of the film, so there's no faulting them. Some acting, mostly from the extras is rather unsatisfying, but it's not too distracting.In conclusion, if you want action, violence, and good versus evil, all done in a very special visual style, this is it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Sin City, a fantastic Miller's concept, near Masterpiece!!!","According mostly reviwers they love or hate it, watching this picture on 2007 as great reader of comic books on my teenager years I found it a upper class production from Robert Rodriguez, with a little help of Tarantino, Rodriguez tried persuade Frank Miller by any means, but the slippery master of comics finally had accepted watch a demo, he likes it and gave his endorsement if Mickey Rooney could be Marv, Rodriguez agree and also got a robust casting including Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Benicio Del Toro, Michael Madsen and Clive Owen and a dozen extensive casting, the movie has three segments, being the first one too short and just finished on the close ending, however all them are linked altogether, the stylized format on Frank Miller's concept was stringently ensured, the dark atmosphere follow the Noir genre, the picture has his own dynamic intrinsic on comic, each single scene has a meaning, the character are extremely colorful, even the most minors ones, but the highlight are quite sure the gorgeous and sexy girls wearing those exciting tight clothes, engaged on a wise screenplay it flow easy, I won't give a highest grade due it was made on blue screen and excessive CGI, it was a unexcusable sinfulness to me, therwise I will against my own principles, absolutely near masterpiece!!Resume:First watch: 2007 / How many: 2 / Source: DVD / Rating: 9",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Cinematic Hell 101.,"Sickening and stressful mess uses that ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" technology to get its shocking points across. Four stories intertwine and twist together in an otherworldly metropolis known as Basin City. An old washed up detective (Bruce Willis) tries to stop a child molester (Nick Stahl) who happens to be the son of a high up government official (Powers Boothe). Stahl has kidnapped a young girl (Makenzie Vega), with Willis and shady partner Michael Madsen hot on his trail. Two-time felon Mickey Rourke wakes up one night and finds his lover (Jaime King) dead. He vows revenge and learns of horrific events just outside the city's landscape as quiet psychopath Elijah Wood and Catholic cardinal Rutger Hauer are going around and indulging in cannibalism with helpless prostitutes as their victims. Rourke, along with lesbian parole officer Carla Gugino and King's twin sister (King again), go on a disturbing journey to stop the deviant duo. But will they become victims themselves in the process? On another side of town a bar-room waitress (Brittany Murphy) is having a love affair with the enigmatic Clive Owen to the dismay of abusive boyfriend Benicio Del Toro. Del Toro is a rough customer who has his own entourage of thugs. Soon the friction between Owen and Del Toro drifts into a dark part of the city where a gang of prostitutes (led by Rosario Dawson, the meek Alexis Bledel and ninja Devon Aoki) rule their territory with violent street justice. Del Toro has a secret though and eventually a war with underground criminals (led by Michael Clarke Duncan) seems imminent for all concerned. As all these stories transpire, a beautiful stripper (Jessica Alba) pops up again and again. How does the ultra-hot Alba fit in to the complicated puzzle? These three tales are bookended by yet another side-story of a quiet assassin (Josh Hartnett) who always seems to be around beautiful women. ""Sin City"" starts off as a nightmare and does not let up until its finale. Based on Frank Miller's graphic novels from a few years back, the series of stories was never really more than glorified comic books for underground groups. Miller, (who co-directed with Hollywood maverick Robert Rodriguez), has a jumble of ideas running through his over-active head. Some look at his concepts as edgy and innovative, but to me they are just sick and silly. Most American junior high students could come up with similar ideas and their ability to translate those ideas to celluloid form would likely be as good as this (not a compliment). A real study in watching hot women, ugly characters, stupid stories, and charnel house violence. ""Sin City"" is not a place you would want to live and it is definitely not a place you should ever visit. Nothing to recommend. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).",,Anonymous,Crime
2nd time Watching and at least this time I had a clue what was going on,"So it's from a set of comic books and the 1st time I watched it . I was completely lost as I thought it was all supposed to be interconnected and make sense as 1 whole movie. There are actually 3 distinct plot lines that exist in the same world. But don't need each other to make sense. This threw me big time. So on second watch after some research I had the benefit of my study. And would recommend anyone not up to speed with the source material to familiarise yourself in advance. What you then get is three short stories with a film noir feel. Ultra violent and, full of sex and gore. With some unpleasant storylines and characters. It is quite unique and the art style is something that I enjoyed. Also the cast is really good. But thats about the fill of it. It's an o.k watch. But not particularly thought provoking. It's probably the most accurate and true to a comic book you will get. But I don't necessarily think that's a good thing as it only translates well to a degree. The literature provides an opportunity for your imagination to fill the gaps. Whereas here those gaps are filled for you and therefore limited my enjoyment. Not much more than a 6 for me. Although it's unique feel and style is something that gives it appeal.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sin City,"A pulpy and slick noir film that's easy on the eyes and heavy with the blood. Sin City is fun, it's solidly acted and it's very artistically stylized. To me, possibly the best part though is the color. The way certain things are given color in this otherwise black and white world is a treat. It's also very much rated R for blood, violence, language and nudity so if that's a problem, this probably isn't for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A CGI-concocted mess that makes a mockery of both the medium it's told in, and the medium from which it's derived","Scott McCloud, in ""Understanding Comics,"" made the important observation that in comics, and media in general, there is a tendency to confuse form with content. Every medium has its own tools for storytelling. The best creators make full use of the distinct language of these media, and overcome their limitations. When adapting material from one medium to another, good creators take heed of these different tools, resulting in masterpieces like Sidney Lumet's ""Twelve Angry Men"", or ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan."" But with movies based on comics, there's this bizarre fallacy that the fact that the story is derived from a comic should somehow affect what the movie looks like, which doesn't hold for movies based other media.Say someone adapts a play into a movie. Do they show, on the movie screen, curtains being closed and opened in between scenes? Of course not. When adapting a best-selling book, do they show pages being turned on the screen? The very notion is silly to suggest. Each medium has its own tools for telling a story, and these things are merely aspects of the medium from which the film is being adapted. To suggest that the ""mechanical"" nature of the medium from which a film is adapted should somehow inform the look of the film (""The film is based on a comic book, so we have to show pages from the comic book in the opening title sequence"") is to engage in non-sequitur. Hollywood doesn't get that, and gives us a Batman TV show with actual sound effects written on screen, not realizing that such things are in comics because they don't *have* sound, or even dumber, a ""Hulk"" film that attempts to use actual panels, as if the otherwise-lauded director doesn't get that panels are only used in comics because they are, by nature, told through a composition of static images. Some, get it right with the ""Superman"" and ""X-Men"" films, but some seem so focused on making good ""comic book movies"" that it doesn't seem to understand that they should instead be setting out to make good ""movie"" movies.But if Rodriguez and Miller's travesty of a film shows no wisdom of this point. Why is it necessary to include narration in which the sound of a gunshot with a silencer is described? In the movie, we *hear* the silencer, so we don't need this cornball musing on it. Marv's ranting about the ""blood-for-blood good old days"" or Dwight's saccharine ""Valkyrie"" metaphor for Gail, made me cringe.Why the obsession with having so many shots mirror actual panels in the books? The white-silhouettes-on-black backgrounds, which work in the comics, look utterly ridiculous on the screen. Is the story really enhanced by fluorescing Hartigan's tie, or the bandages on Marv's body so that we can see them when they rest of their figures are in shadow? The almost entirely-CGI backgrounds, which Rodriguez cluelessly lauds as making his work easier are lifeless and artificial. When Josh Hartnett walks onto the balcony in the film's prologue, never once do I feel that what I see behind him is real, and any suspension of disbelief is lost. The subsequent pan of the buildings when this prologue ends, is equally about as vibrant as a bowl of oat bran. So oblivious are the directors to the simple reality that elements that work in comics may not work in film that no attempt is made to modify the scenes of Marv getting hit head-on with a car, or dragging a perp from his own car at 50 miles an hour, or Hartigan gushing blood when getting perforated by bullets, and the result descends into cartoonish preposterousness.The directors would rather bury a big-name star like Oscar-winner Benicio Del Toro under gobs of facial prosthetics, despite the fact that there is nothing particular about his character that would require it . Squandering a film's star power like this underscores a total lack of judgment on the part of the directors.What they did change is mind-boggling. Why was Bob, who shot Hartigan, his partner, several times, the one to greet Hartigan upon his release? Why was ""That Yellow Bastard"" cut up so that the first Act was shown before the rest of ""The Hard Good-bye"", and the rest of ""Bastard"" shown later? Why is Kevin seen in the beginning when he's about to kill Goldie, thus destroying the suspense of knowing her killer's identity? Why do Rodriguez and Miller include Manute's mention to Gail about ""serving a new master,"" which is a reference to the events of ""A Dame to Kill For"", which isn't in the movie? Why did they hire an actress to play Nancy Callahan who refused to do nudity, when that scene is so crucial to the story? I don't mind that the others didn't do the nude scenes in which their characters originally appeared, but the moment when Hartigan sees Nancy performing in ""That Yellow Bastard"" is a vital plot point in the story, because when we see that the little girl he saved is the same stripper we have come to know and love from previous stories, we're able to feel the same creepy feeling Hartigan does.Armond White nailed it: ""Graphic art has its own principles and justifications that become inane when converted into live action. Rodriguez and Miller try to resolve this problem through digital photography that simplifies the imagery, recreating the starkness of print panels. Their wasted effort does little more than turn cinema back into two-dimensional flatness.Rodriguez (uses) the same elastiviolence as in the ""Matrix"" movies: Killing and brutality are absurdly amplified yet have no effect. Rodriguez and Miller don't actually have an esthetic's, just a gimmick.As shot by Rodriguez, ""Sin City""'s digital b&w lacks the mystery of photochemical b&w photography. A noir without the enveloping quality of shadow or the tactile sensation of smoke, it fails at what makes movies a great visual art form.""",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Gives 'movie violence' a new meaning.,"Out of all the in 2005 released movies I have seen so far, this one takes the cake. It's renewing, stylish and just simply overall brilliantly made. It really is a breath of fresh air. This movie sets (or should set) the new standards for film-noir for the 21th century. It's straight to the point, very direct, dark and violent but yet all done with lots of flair and style. I really do hope more movies in this sort of 21th century film-noir style will be made, in the near or distant future.I didn't wanted this movie to stop! I truly enjoyed every second of it. I have to admit that at first I had to get used to the unusual style of movie-making but once I was accustomed to it I didn't wanted it to stop. The first few minutes of the movie with Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton perfectly works as an introduction to the movie and its style. This movie is unlike anything else you've experienced before. The style perfectly captures the Frank Miller's comic book feelings. It flawlessly captures some of those typical comic book moments and its atmosphere.The movie is ultra-violent and features lots of bullets, other weapons and limbs flying around. The movie its essence is not on the story but truly on the violence in it. The violence is done in such an over-the-top way that it isn't 'shocking' in terms of sickening. It's done with style and lots of dark-humor and that's why it should be perfectly watchable for everyone. It really gives 'movie violence' a new meaning.The movie features a few actors that truly surprised me. First of all it is great to see that Mickey Rourke is really back again. He is perfect as Marv and perhaps plays the best character of the entire movie. Actors that mainly surprised me were; Clive Owen and Elijah Wood. Clive Owen is a great actor but I always thought he also was very boring and had little charisma. Granted that that gave him a certain coolness in movies but in ""Sin City"" he is cool, cool and not boring cool (hope that made a bit sense to you). He suits his role perfectly and is really awesome to watch. And who would had ever known that that sweet little looking Elijah Wood was able to play a convincing and genuine scary psychophysic serial killer/cannibal. The entire movie is filled with well known actors but all of them are cast to suite their role and not in the first place because of their well known names. Some of the big names in this movie are; Nick Stahl, Brittany Murphy, Michael Madsen, Jaime King, Rick Gomez, Rosario Dawson, Powers Boothe, Michael Clarke Duncan, Jessica Alba, Rutger Hauer, Josh Hartnett, Benicio Del Toro..should I really go on? All of the characters are cool and unique in their very special own way. The movie mainly consists out of three separate stories set in Sin City. Three main characters in those stories are being played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen. The movie also features some strong female characters. They might look cute and sexy but you better not mess with them!Robert Rodriguez delivers with this movie a brilliant new sort and daring movie that is made with an incredible amount of style. The use of black and white and the use of some colors in some scene's works great for the movie and its special kind of atmosphere. It makes ""Sin City"" a certainly unique but also definitely awesome movie to watch. Besides directing Robert Rodrigueze also once again does his own cinematography, editing, sound re-recording mixing, visual effects and the musical score for the movie, along with respected composers John Debney and Graeme Revell. You really have to respect Rodriguez how he makes movies and what he achieve's with it and how it also appeals to a wide range of audience, even though his movies are often unique and something new that hasn't been done and shown before.Finally a movie again, that lives up to the hype. Looking extremely forward to the new Sin City movies, I simply can not get enough of it!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Extreme violence, great writing, great direction and for the most part, great acting!","Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, Benicio del Toro, Devon Aoki, Nick Stahl, Michael Clarke Duncan, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy, Carla Guigino, Elijah Wood, Michael Madsen, Rutger Hauer, Patricia Vonne, Josh Hartnett and Frank Miller as the priest.This movie is so entertaining, most of all because of the fabulous direction. The black and white, with spots of vibrant colors....it's cool! This movie is made up of three stories. The first story is about crazy man Marv(Rourke) meeting beautiful Goldie(King). He's really ugly, but she shows him compassion, but when they sleep together, someone kills her in the bed, and Marv is blamed for it. He goes on a killing rampage to find out who killed his girl. He ends up getting help by several hookers, including Becky(Bledel) and Gail(Dawson) and help by exotic dancer Nanci Callahan(Alba). The story runs at 34 minutes long, and is my favorite one.Story two is about Shelley(Murphy), a skimpy waitress getting a visit from her ex-boyfriend Jackie-boy(Toro) and her new boyfriend Dwight(Owen) teaches him a lesson. When Jack leaves, Dwight follows him around and sees he goes to Whore's Alley and tries to pick up girls and with the help of hooker and his new girl Gail(Dawson) they stop him and stop crime boss Manute(Duncan) from taking over the alley. 39 mins.Story 3 actually starts the film off with the first ten minutes of it, and ends it also. Nice cop Hartigan(Willis) has to retire from his job due to his bad heart condition, but he's not through. He needs to catch Junior(Stahl) who has skinny young Nanci Callahan(age 11) and is planning on raping her. Junior's dad is the senator and very powerful. Hartigan's ex-partner Bob(Madsen) realises that they will go down with Junior, and after Hartigan shoots Junior's ear, hand, and penis off, he shoots Hartigan and leaves him for dead. Hartigan is hospitilized and beaten merciless until he admits he raped her. He is put in jail for eight years and gets cleverly disguised letters from Nanci every Thursday. When he gets out, he sees Nanci, age 19 and tries to protect her from Junior, who had work done to grow his ear, hand and penis back, and has become a fat yellow freak. This segment is 38 minutes in length.The opening/closing involves a romantic hit-man(Josh Hartnett) that seduces women and then kills them.my review-A. Excellent coloring, when there is color. The blood looks even redder. The eyes look even bluer. It's cool!rated R for non-stop extreme violence, sexuality and nudity.*Beware..this is extreme violence including men getting limbs ripped off one by one, nonstop heads coming off, blood and guts all over and even a man getting his penis and testicles getting ripped off on screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pop Art,"Every year we're lucky enough have a fresh comic book adaptation forced down our throats like one of Buffalo Bill's chrysalises but here's something a bit different - a comic book adaptation of a movie. Sin City is a paper to celluloid transfer for Frank Miller's bleak Film Noir pastiche, now itself a Noir but one with a level of stylisation unprecedented in the genre. Rodrigeuz and Miller have fashioned a movie in which every shot is a meticulous recreation of the source graphic novels. The ontology of these shots even mirror the books because it's all been painted in using computer graphics. The plot, three stories set in a metropolis of human filth and brutality is pitched, as you might expect in the event of having the author as Co-director and screenwriter, perfectly in a recreative style that renders the men as aggressive, nihilistic, tortured characters loyal only to themselves and their own moral code and women as objects of lust - sexual objects through and through. Fans of Film Noir should love it frankly - it's all moody streets lit in shadow (though not really of course), voice-over narration, murky criminality and femme fatales. The misogyny will be unpalatable for some but that's the genre kids, this isn't a documentary and such criticism has no place in this kind of movie. The male oriented approach that the material demands allows for a great deal of violence which I enjoyed enormously. On the subject of the women incidentally, they're as gorgeous as the men are aggressive and Lucille's breasts in particular deserve to be awarded a couple of Oscars in-addition to the striking visual effects which mix beautifully toned chiaroscuro virtual sets with some striking and clever use of colour. If there's any criticism to be had its that the film's strength, its rigidly faithful recreation of the source material could also be construed as its weakness. For all its energy and vivid visuals it lacks depth, inevitable when your characters are direct recreations of comic book characters. They're types rather than fully three dimensional human beings and so lack the humanity of the heroes or rather antiheroes that populated the great Noirs of the 40's. Sin City also has the occasional slow moment and some moments of humour that feel like false notes in an otherwise watertight production. Not perfect then but when you consider that this is the first movie since Beaty's Dick Tracy (1990) that has successfully presented itself as a living comic book and goes further than that film ever could, its something of a new sub-genre and if the sequels are crafted with the same care and attention to detail as this film then we should be in for a bit of a treat - the visual equivalent of a giant slab of chocolate cake. It's a bit too insubstantial for my taste but I can't say I didn't enjoy visiting Sin City and its lavishly created world.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Just like watching the comic book come to life!!,"Brilliant, just brilliant!!!I remember reading somewhere that there was no real script to speak of, just the original frames from the comic books. It shows.. and it is this which makes the movie such a wonderful experience. Think about it. 1. A comic book has only still pictures and therefore there are certain styles of drawing required in order to portray movement, depth, action, which by necessity must appear exaggerated. There were many such shots in this movie that copied these exaggerated styles into film and the effect was awesome (particularly when characters were running). 2. Also, in a comic book there is only so much space for speech bubbles, therefore dialogue must be brief, stinted and straight to the point. In the movie this was wonderfully recreated. Many scenes of dialogue comprised just one-liners going back and forth...perfectly recreating the comic book experience. I have read in some reviewers comments that they feel the acting was sometimes poor and put it down to the script - completely missing the point. 3. More subtly, have you ever noticed in comic books that static (often background)characters never stand straight, upright and facing the reader directly? This would never work. Always, characters are portrayed from unusual angles, striking exaggerated poses. In the movie you will see many examples of this, (note particularly some of the shots with the hookers standing around, and the car thieves when discussing their marks) I am certain that if you did not notice this, it will subtly have added to your enjoyment. 4. Finally, in a comic book you will never find scenes remaining in the same place for long. It is necessary for the comic to remain dynamic and exciting to keep the action moving. This is why almost all such genre comics have the following sequence (or similar); Location shot: Short dialogue: action: leave: fast car: new location shot: short dialogue: action: leave: fast car.....and so on. Watch the movie again to see what I mean.All of the above (with a few less easy to explain) added enormously to a moving comic book experience and was all intentional I'm sure.

A Noir Exploitation Masterpiece,"Primarily based on three Sin City graphic novels by Frank Miller--The Hard Good-Bye, The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow Bastard--the film tells a non-linear story centered around three primary threads. In the first, Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is a seasoned cop who is about to retire, but not until he saves a girl from Rourk Jr./Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl). In the second, Marv (Mickey Rourke), a hulking brute of a man who looks a bit like (and has the physical prowess of) Hellboy (2004), tries to track down a woman's killer. And in the third, Dwight (Clive Owen) tries to protect Shellie (Brittany Murphy) from Jackie Boy and his thugs (Benicio Del Toro). Although at first it feels more like an anthology film, writers/directors Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez eventually tie all the threads together in a very clever way.Sin City is the rare comic book film that should please purist fans of Frank Miller's work as well as viewers who aren't familiar with the comics. It has an incredibly unusual visual style and plot structure, and it is extremely visceral and humorously cynical. Film noir is an obvious influence, as is the gritty, gory and sexy exploitation approach of Quentin Tarantino, who ""guest directs"" a segment of the film.Visually, Rodriguez very closely matches Miller's stark black and white style, complete with the exaggerated perspectives and angles typical of comic book art, by shooting his actors digitally in front of green screens. Backgrounds are then put in by computer. A number of shots are identical to panels from Miller's comics. That everything is digital enables a number of fantastical ""camera"" transitions and an often surreal physics--made most conspicuous in the shots of vintage automobiles that frequently race along a winding, precipitous mountain road (somewhat similar to Los Angeles' Mulholland Drive) high above Sin City, as well as during the frequent bouts of spectacular violence. Both of these aspects are frequently accompanied by splashes of color, ala Francis Ford Coppola's Rumble Fish (1983).Violence is extremely important in Sin City and it's one aspect where Tarantino's influence, especially his more recent work on the Kill Bill films, is most clear. This is Sin City, after all, so one shouldn't expect characters and behavior that would please the morally conservative right wing in the U.S. Except for Hartigan, even the heroes are wantonly hacking off limbs. Not that Hartigan isn't violent, but his violence is more traditionally retributional against the ""immoral"". Most of the women in the film are prostitutes, strippers and such, and most are either skimpily dressed or naked. They are also fond of powerful weapons, ala the ""Chicks with Guns"" segment from Tarantino's Jackie Brown (1997), which itself is rooted in 1970s exploitation films. If that's not enough to get the ""Moral Majority"" up in arms, my favorite segment--the story of Marv, features a religious leader as the big, cannibalistic villain. And even though Hartigan is the relative ""good guy"", he ends up in love with a woman whom he first met when she was 6 years old and he was nearing 60.Surely many of these non-conservative elements will turn off viewers with more delicate sensibilities, and cause some others to search for a more mainstream ""moral"" message beneath the veneer, as has been done in not a few other reviews. I think there may be subtexts, but I don't think they're necessarily anything mainstream. The subtext is more an exploitation aesthetic taken to an extreme, offering (at least slightly) alternative mores. Sometimes the mainstream (especially the left and pacifist-leaning side) gets wrapped up in believing that everything must serve their desired message or be damned. Art shouldn't only have one kind of ideology behind it. It should say challenging things. I believe that's more the message of Sin City, if indeed there is one, than any kind of damnation of ethical anarchy or violence through an exaggerated, parable-like example.With such a huge cast, one would think that Sin City would quickly become a confused quagmire of plot threads. Rodriguez and Miller deserve much credit for keeping everything clear and easily understandable, even despite a lot of motor-mouthed, jargony character narration (somewhat like a psychotic, anti-social film noir on speed) and the circuitous timeline.The cast is excellent. Willis is every ounce the action hero he ever was. Owen should be an action hero (why had I never noticed him before?). Rourke is transformed into a hulking, unstoppable behemoth whom you love even though he's killing more people, in more brutal ways than Jason does in four or five Friday the 13th films--and all just because a hooker slept with him for one night. Del Toro is deliciously evil. Elijah Wood, as Kevin, is extremely creepy. Jessica Alba, as Nancy Callahan, is incredibly complex, not to mention beautiful. Devon Aoki is exquisite, elegant and equally beautiful, even as she's chopping off heads. I could go on and on, but you get the idea.As great as the cast is, they cannot trump the biggest star, the overall style of the film, which surprised me just as much for its mordant humor as its intense action-oriented brutality. It may take a couple scenes to become acclimated to the unusual approach, but it is well worth it. Sin City is a film that can likely be watched over and over again, acquiring new appreciation on each viewing. If you're at all a fan of any of the cast or crew, or if you enjoy film noir and don't mind violence, you can't afford to pass by this film. I have a feeling that its unusual tone and structure will likely be very influential in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Bruce Willis tag line,"This film is one of my favorite films ever.In this movie Bruce Willis says something that it should have been mentioned in this page.

An extremist exercise in violent based-upon style.,"Robert Rodriguez doesn't make movies, he plays making movies. His last effort could have really topped my list along the KILL BILL VOL. 1 section, problem is that VOL. 2 didn't do it for me and the IT list quickly vanished.Back in the 90s we saw guys like Quentin and Robert having their shot at movie-making. Today they have total access or freedom to do whatever the blip they want. Now that they've made it, it doesn't taste as good as it was supposed to. How come I didn't like this movie entirely?SIN CITY is based on Frank Miller's graphic dark comics. To tell you the truth, I've never seen any of his printed master work. As if I care! When I go to the movies, it is the frigging movie that matters, not the previous subject that translated into cinema. I mean, I saw BATMAN without caring about Bob Kane, OK? The same goes with the recent SPIDER-MAN 2 and its comic sources.Full of visuals and insane characters, SIN CITY wants to be more than just a moving postcard. It's black and white with distinguished colors, most notably red: drips of blood, lipstick and a femme fatale dress. Some weird negative image techniques and really repetitive and boring voice-overs proves that it wants to overcome its own self-indulgence so much that you cannot escape two options, that is of becoming a geek freak or just tuning out. Yes, it is that violent and gritty to unbearable extremes.Everything is background here, only the actors are real. Would this be Rodriguez' PHANTOM MENACE and SKY CAPTAIN statement? The acting is worthwhile, though. It's good to see Rourke involved in such better material, it really fitted him. Owen's and del Toro's chapter was by far the best of the three interconnected stories and they pulled it out really nice. Willis is (almost) always watchable, specially doing a Sonny Chiba's STREET FIGHTER homage here (I hate comparisons, but if it's the Bruce between this or HOSTAGE, I stick with the latter). Jessica Alba still has a long road ahead as a certifiable actress and not just a movie babe. Rosario Dawson was dangerously wicked, representing the movie's extreemness. And, Carla Gugino, oh, I just love you! No one shines here, that's for sure. Don't get me wrong.Conclusion? Too much Frank Miller, too much comic book. Too much geeky hype. Not enough Rodriguez (he's never given his best, I hope) and not enough cinema. PULP FICTION is definitely the CASABLANCA of this grunge generation. It is sad because I thought these guys were on to become the filmmakers of tomorrow, instead we're facing acclaimed imitators or tracers right here today.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"visually great, but...","Sin City is a visually stunning film. I am not familiar with Frank Miller's work so I can only assume, like the previous posts have mentioned, that the movie is a faithful rendition of the comic book. It unrolls like an urban nightmare...a city that has lost all hope, doomed heroes, murderous whores, insane politicians, grotesque characters who commit unspeakable deeds. All of this in black and white, with a few glimmers of color. It's all somewhat anachronistic...the cars are all from the forties and fifties...but many of the weapons seem quite up to date.From a style standpoint...this movie is great. I think it lacks on substance however.It's over-the-top, unrelenting, obsessive violence completely overshadows the plots. The blood, guts and gore eventually begin to overwhelm the entire movie. Every scene tries to out-splatter the one two minutes before. I went to this movie with a friend who bailed out about three quarters of the way through it. It's by far the bloodiest, most violent movie I've ever seen...and I've seen many of the nastiest.When people left the theater, it was sort of a stunned silence.

Sin City,"Sin city, I believe is one of the better movies all year and I haven't even seen a lot of them. With a lot of action and story, I believe that it is one of the better comic book movies you'll see...EVER! I'm impressed. Frank Miller, who is the creator, has actually helped produce the film. Unlike in Daredevil, witch I think wasn't good, Stan Lee didn't do a lot to help the film be better or even write the screenplay. He didn't write the screenplay for Spiderman either and that was good. The point is, is some comic books are a good idea to make a movie out of. Daredevil wasn't at all. Sin City, I thought wasn't at first, but after seeing it twice in the same day, It is one of the best movies I've seen in a good while. Since Pulp Fiction maybe.

Best comics adaptation so far BUT not for kids (screen),"This is the proof that the author's intention (Frank Miller) has been respected.The diverse comics of Sin City are for mature readers and the movie is the same. Whatever the reason of Miller for very hardcore violence (fighting for freedom of expression ? and the difficulties tied with this-an unconscious appeal for sadism ?), the Hollywood interest has not turned down the subject. Worse, the violence going from pencils to live action with real people, what was left to the imagination of the reader is now totally watched: So, even if i knew what would happen, i felt a bit shocked to see what was the reality of the drawings...But, Sin City is a lot more than violence. The ""heroes"" believe in honor, strong code of value (and cynicism...), so you can't be disgusted. This morality surely explains why so-much Hollywood stars (Alba, Willis...) gave their will to do it. Mickey Rourke does an amazing performance. His mimetism with the comic character is evident.In conclusion, every feeling of the comic book is truly present in the movie: the play with the black & white, the rare touch of colors (blue eyes baby, yellow bastard, babe wearing red), the dark atmosphere of the city,....If i gave a very positive review of ""Spiderman"", I must admit that Sin city surpasses it, watching a wall-crawler can be entertaining, but watching a torrent of violence is educational ......A movie with depth & forms deserves an award: ah Cannes, Maybe Oscar...",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A must-see for comic-book fans,"Sin City - A series of largely unconnected vignettes and directed by Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, Sin City just drips from comic book atmosphere and style. Be it the fact that everything is in various stages of chrome (and anything the directors felt you should pay attention to, such as blood, is overly colored), or that everyone smokes, or that there is more narration than actual dialog. The characters make most of the movie, rather than the plots, which are not that important. There's Harigan (Bruce Willis), the hard-as-adamantium-nails cop with a heart of gold for Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), as he takes on The Yellow B@stard (Nick Stahl). There's Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is pretty much invulnerable to pain, and kills with a warm smile and fun disposition. These two vigilantes, through their glorious comic book violence, make The Punisher look like a cream puff. There's also Dwight (Clive Owen), who similarly never seems to go down, and is very fast with his dual pistols. Oh, and I shouldn't even have to mention the super scary, super agile Kevin (Elijah Wood). You will remember him. There's more unique characters, but it'd take all day to describe them. The fight scenes are bloody and just plain jaw dropping fun, if you like that sort of thing. I do. There are some minor down points, mostly pacing. once or twice. The movie is kinda long near the end. And if you didn't like either of the Kill Bills for violence than you should stay the heck away from this.

A finely crafted piece of garbage.,"With the most appropriate movie title in recent memory, ""Sin City"" is likely to be divisive among moviegoers, and more interestingly within a moviegoer. Rarely has such a dichotomy existed between technical prowess and moral & narrative bankruptcy.""Sin City"" is an anthology of three stories set in the noir-ish, crime-riddled metropolis of Frank Miller's graphic novels (he also co-directed). Each segment has its own storyline with unique characters, although they do transpire simultaneously in the same space, running roughly parallel rather than criss-crossing. This gives the movie a fractured and episodic nature that limits its overall narrative power, inexplicably dragging despite its breakneck action and pace.Shot by jack-of-all-trades Robert Rodriguez in sumptuous black-and-white, high-definition digital video, the movie was done largely in front of green screen, with flashes of color and cityscapes that are primarily CGI meshing seamlessly with the live action to produce some of the best and most pervasive visual effects ever seen. In the process, the sheer visceral look of the picture entrances, as each shot seems worthy of being frozen and hung on a wall due to the slightly out of kilter comic-book style framing. This careful craftsmanship and attention to detail plunges the audience so deep into an alternative world that it's almost enough to distract from the complete absence of any moral compass. Almost.As fantastic and jaw-dropping as the visuals are, the principles of ""Sin City"" are equally heinous, emphasizing the dark side of the monochromatic world. There are no white-hat heroes, and even the protagonists are villainous. The only remotely good character is Bruce Willis's detective, who would fill the ""bad cop"" role in most worlds. But his aggressive approach, which is not by the book to say the least, falls on the tame end of the the movie's violent methods spectrum, which combines the bloodiness of ""Kill Bill"" with the brutality of ""The Punisher"". I can sometimes accept such actions if the motives are somewhat pure (the relatively justifiable homicides of either aforementioned movie for instance), but such motives here are minimal at best and predominantly non-existent.Don't get me wrong. I don't necessarily require high morality out of my movies. I'm not demanding the pure motives of Frodo or Atticus Finch, but give me something to latch onto, some semblance of a moral reference point. Someone like Kevin Bacon's flawed but justice-seeking cop in the murky crime drama ""Mystic River"", which was based in a right-and-wrong world even as it portrayed a darker side. Even a sliver of ethics will do, but there is nary a sliver to be found in ""Sin City"". Even people who are ""supposed"" to be good are likewise black-hearted. Without any sort of orientation, the movie stumbles over itself throughout. I realize that is the nature of the source material; and I accept that, commending Rodriguez and Miller for their cinematic vision, while simultaneously reeling from the depraved soul of the books.With a cast of familiar names and faces that you can't count using your fingers and toes, the acting of ""Sin City"" is...well, it's there. No one except perhaps the disappointing Michael Madsen (who apparently thought he was still on ""Tilt"") detracts from the film, but no one is given much opportunity to supply good work either. Most of the parts are virtually interchangeable, requiring merely an attractive stone face. The casting and appearance are therefore all the more praiseworthy, as image overrides and dwarfs character development. Fortunately the celebrity never distracts from the movie, but rather produces an aura of respectability in what would likely have been regarded as an awful B-grade flick without such star power.Despite my major ethical issues, I still find myself getting juiced whenever I espy artwork from the film. It looks that good. But I still don't recommend it. The bifurcated ""Sin City"" excels in every technical aspect, but the heart is cold, and the story is shattered.Bottom Line: Like Snow White's polished apple, ""Sin City"" gleams on the outside, concealing a rotten core that ultimately disheartens and disappoints. 6 of 10 at best, exclusively for technical merit.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Film noir for dummies... but great,"Sin CityRating: **** (Four stars out of five)Based on a graphic novel, the labor of love that is the new film Sin City exemplifies a case of style ruling over substance. But what a style it is!This style is brought to life by director's Robert Rodriguez (the guy behind the Sky Kids trilogy believe it or not), Frank Miller (the creator of the graphic novel) and special guest director Quentin Tarantino who all present an ugly world that is beautifully framed. The film is meant to be a modern type of film noir, a sub-genre of film that gained massive popularity in the golden age of Hollywood (think Humphrey Bogart in 1941's The Maltese Falcon).To bring this old style to a new audience, the visuals are perfected on the computer thanks to state-of-the-art technologies. The original graphic novel contained only black, white, and a few other solid base colors. The film helps recreate this look cinematic ally by cranking up the contrast and using bright colors that distinguish themselves clearly from the otherwise dark landscapes. It is a world that aches of the past.Make no mistake, this is a film that has been crafted and not manufactured. Every detail is lovingly placed. It is also a film that aims to sucker punch its audience in the head with violence, twists and overall absurd antics. That's not to say violence is all Sin City has to offer, though. There is romance, action, drama and even black comedy (perhaps the entire affair could be looked at as a black comedy.) The experience Sin City offers is much more alive than last fall's listless Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, another film that achieved majestic visuals through CGI.A gigantic cast helps Sin City move beyond the status of a few fanboys wet dream. With this cast three major story lines taken from the graphic novel are fleshed out, all of them evoking the sensibilities of true film noir. One involves Mickey Rourke's character Marv and his revenge scheme while another plot line follows Clive Owen's Dwight through his bloody exploits. The final story deals with framed cop John Hartigan, played by Bruce Willis. The three stories work together well as characters intersect and situations become more and more twisted.Still, Sin City is not without its flaws and at the end of the day the visuals have much more depth than anything the script has to say. With the radiance of the visuals, though, that's not necessarily a major complaint. Yet, the mostly one-dimensional characters do take away from the lasting impact of the film. The film has got more to it than many effects-laden blockbusters, but that's not saying much.Overall, film noir is a genre capable of great expression, able to tap into the inner workings of the human condition. What Sin City does is takes the most interesting aspects of this style and throws them all into a big mix. The result is a stunning experience that is filled to the brim with entertainment but also lacking in some of the subtler details that give noir its ability to strike into the darkest, deepest sections of the human soul.Critic's Conclusion: It's a bloody, violent affair full of cruel characters and broken spirits, but yet Sin City is beautiful in its bold yet simple vision. It is a film created to entertain the darker side of the human spirit, memorably appealing to the senses more than the intellect.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"If you looked up the term ""bad-ass"" in the dictionary, you'd see a Sin City poster right next to it....","I saw Sin City back when it came out on April 1st. It was a nice day. Birds were chirping, children skipping in the streets, old people sipping tea and reading the newspaper in their rocking chairs, and everyone had a smile on their face.but who gives a crap if that really happened? I sure as hell wouldn't, because on April 1st, Sin City came out, and as far as I was concerned, nothing else mattered. That's right, peoples. This movie rules so much ass, that if you saw it one day, and when you came home, you found out that a bomb of s*** landed on your house, you wouldn't care one bit.because you saw the orgasm-inducing Sin City.Let me start first with bad-ass aspect number 1: The look. Just by watching pieces of the trailer, you can already tell that this movie will basically make your eyes orgasm. Instead of having a basic color scheme like every other movie these days, this movie is all black and white with little splashes of color here and there. This is probably the coolest looking movie on Earth. It eats every other movie for breakfast and s***s it out an hour later.Bad-ass aspect number 2: The characters. The characters in this movie are so cool that you'll almost feel bad because people in real life can't pull of what some of these characters do. Example: (spoiler, for anyone who cares) Marv (Mickey Rourke) is in and electric chair. While the Priest is babbling on, he tells him something like ""I haven't got all night."" They pull the switch, he's gets electrocuted, then they stop the voltage. Bleeding from the mouth, he raises his head, and says, ""Is that all you got, you pansies?"" Then they electrocute him again! This character is so bad-ass that it took not one but TWO tries to finally kill him. Elijah Wood stars as Kevin, a messed up, psychotic religious dude who never talks, and never changes his facial expression. The fight between him and Marv kicks-ass, plain and simple. Nick Stahl plays as Yellow Bastard, a guy who looked normal once, but after getting a couple bullets in his package and various other places, he turns yellow because of the treatments he receives. This character stands out in the movie because he's yellow. That's all you need to know. He's weird lookin', he's crazy, and the fate of his character is brutal and harsh, which brings me to my next point:Bad-ass aspect number 3: The relentless violence. Everywhere you look in this movie, blood, gore, bones, decapitations, explosions, everything you could want in an action movie. The characters often beat one another to death, sometimes with weapons, sometimes with guns, and sometimes with their bare hands. This might offend some people, but who cares? This is movie violence at it's absolute sickest and best. I know what's going on. I know that if you haven't seen this movie yet, and you're somehow still reading this, you're asking, ""But dude, everything you've explained is so bad-ass as it is. How the hell can it get any better? It's not possible."" It's possible. The fun doesn't stop at the violence, which brings me to my next pointBad-ass aspect number 4: Hot actresses. This movie is full of them. Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Rosario Dawson, Jamie King, Alexis Bledel, the list goes on. Never before have I seen a movie look absolutely cool, have kick-ass characters, relentless violence and nonstop action, and a horde of hot women. You can't watch this and think it's bad. It's just not possible.Sin City is one of the most bad-ass movies of this year. Believe me. All of your senses will have gushing orgasms, especially your eyes.

"Stylish and solid neo-noir movie, with tons of creative ideas.","I have never read Miller's graphic novel, but I have to say that the cinematographic adaptation is very convincing to me. It is truly a technological and artistic achievement that still holds well today. This is an anthology film that contains four different stories. In the normal version some of these are splitted in two different parts, but I have watched the extended recut edition, which basically shows the entire episodes without any interruption, being more cohesive and easy to follow. It also adds twenty minutes of extra scenes. I did not equally enjoyed all the stories; my favorites are for sure ""That Yellow B******"" and ""The Hard Goodbye"", the other two were pretty average and predictable. Surely screenwriters managed to immerse the audience in this filthy city, full of criminals. Directors were not scared to push boundaries, there are a lot of explicit and gruesome sequences.The black and white style, the lighting and the use of color is masterful, from a pure technical level ""Sin City"" is simply perfect. Visual effects are always on point and very well done. It is a really peculiar style that we are not used to seeing that often in Hollywood blockbusters, and it is definitely risky to produce, because you never know how the public will react to something that is so different from the normal cinema standards. There are a lot of big names involved such as Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Jessica Alba. Even if more than ten years passed since its release, this is still a solid film that aged really well and that will never really get old. I just wish that we can have more neo-noir crime stories like this one. ""A Dame to Kill for"" was released in 2014, and we never got such a mainstream production with the same quality since then, regarding this genre. Definitely recommended, if you want to see something unusual and with a different kind of narration.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The sin of Sin City,"Predictably, some critics have labeled Sin City a 'gorefest', have dismissed it as yet another example of tarantinesque gratuitous violence designed to appeal to the crudest instincts. If only it were that harmless: in my opinion this film is a manifestation of a disturbing sexual pathology lying deep within the American psyche. Worse still is that it seems unlikely that its makers were unaware of what they were doing while they created and then released this pathogen into the world. For many years now psychoanalytic knowledge has been in vogue amongst filmmakers, and in particular screenplay writers, there being numerous books, symposiums,etc devoted to this trend.Sin City deconstructedFrom a psychoanalytic point of view the film is messy and confused: numerous substitutions and role reversals come into play, making it hard to identify any clear-cut syndromes, and at times it's even as though neuroses are battling each other for supremacy. Despite all this mess it is possible to point out a number of prominent emotionally significant features present in the film, motifs which are not exactly subtle, given the heavy-handedness and emotional loudness which are typical of films by Tarantino, (here only a guest director).Firstly, there is the film's heavy glorification of women: although nearly all the film's female characters are hustlers who injure, mutilate and kill men, women are excessively glorified, almost deified: ""She smells like angels ought to smell, the perfect woman...the Goddess. Goldie"" (Marv).The adoration of women, often at the expense of reduced sexual feeling, often indicates what Freud called'castration anxiety': One coping strategy for the sufferer involving an effort being made to demonstrate to the threatening father-figure the 'cleanness' of their feelings toward the mother-figure. Sexual feeling toward all women may eventually become habitually sublimated into a chaste glorification. But, to complicate things, one of the role-reversals in the film involves castration anxiety being safely acted out in that the 'little boy' wins the mother by turning on and defeating (usually by mutilating or castrating) a threatening father-figure, (and sometimes the mother-figure herself performs this task). And no less than four acts of castration are graphically depicted in this film.Most of the film's villains live in order to exercise sadistic violence toward females: they are violent and threatening father-figures, unworthy of the affections of the mother-figure. The only sin an inhabitant of Sin City can commit is hurting a woman, and revenging that hurt (always using extreme methods), is the only virtue and the sole motivation for the film's 'good guys'. The sickening violence in the film is in this way legitimized: made into a 'good cause'. And, strangely enough, the film seems to assume that the audience shares this value system. It is furthermore easy to interpret the numerous acts of mutilation performed on the male characters as symbolic castration : by being gravely injured, sometimes dismembered they are rendered powerless and impotent.Most of the film's male characters, heroes and villains alike, are really put through the grinder, they are shot, cut stabbed, mutilated..and, well damaged in just about every way imaginable. And yet none of them shows any pain: it's as though their sufferings are unimportant, it's what they deserve. They seem to derive masochistic pleasure from this treatment, are positively invigorated by it. (An extreme example of this is the Buddha-like serenity shown by the character played by Elijah Wood after being dismembered, partly eaten by a dog and finally, decapitated).Like Bruce Willis in one of his earlier films, Die Hard, the picture's 'good guys' undergo bodily mortification and suffer all sorts of injuries and hardship in order to avenge or rescue a female mother-figure, (in Die Hard represented by Bruce Willis's wife).For a lot of masochists the overcoming of physical pain is felt to be an act of purification: the masochist 'paying' for having shameful sexual feelings. It is also noted that for many masochists these shameful feelings stem from homosexual urges. And sadomasochism, as we all know, does indeed figure large in 'gay culture', which has several sadomasochistic icons: the passion of Christ, and the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian (who was tied to a post and shot full of arrows), being the most prominent.Combine this with the heavily-overstated unresolved castration complex and mother-fixation and you have a reasonably solid case for interpreting the film as a sort of tour-de-force of homosexual angst. This interpretation does not seem to apply to all cases. Sometimes the guilt feelings cannot be suspected as having their source in homosexuality : Bruce Willis's later relationship with the girl he saved is obviously incestuous ,""I'm old enough to be your grandfather"", and after a passionate kiss in a motel Bruce Willis finds himself with a noose around his neck.It is no coincidence at all that such a film, one which seems to be maliciously working overtime to corrupt and pervert a young audience, is a faithful transference of a comic book onto celluloid. The creator of the Sin City comic series, Frank Miller, is credited with the screenplay for this film. In the past the corruption of youth seems to have been the aim of many comic book writers. In fact the problem got so bad that pressure groups were formed to combat it. It is an interesting trivia fact of comic book history that DC Comics was brought into life in order to create an alternative to a genre which had become characterized by violence and perversion.Sin City can thus finally be regarded not as a worrying new trend in film-making, but rather as a relic from a past best forgotten: an undeserved tribute to a corrupt art-form.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

disgusting and pathetic,"First, I don't know the comic book, and I don't care. ""Sin City"" is a film, so I judge it as a film.The stories that the film tells are ridiculous, pure banality, devoid of any imagination, suspense or interesting characters. People are shot and fatally wounded again and again and still live on. When they finally die, how can I believe that they're really dead? Pathetic.There is constant violence. Neither does the violence hurt nor is it fun or beautiful or provocative or does it say anything else apart from the author/director saying: ""Look how proud I am of my sick mind"". It's simply childish, cynical violence without any meaning. Disgusting.This film was meant to look great, to be a feast for the eyes, right?. How come there's NOT ONE SINGLE frame in it that I could call a ""beautiful shot composition""? How is that possible? Even Lars von Trier's endlessly dreary ""Dogville"" had one beautiful picture in it. If you like Black and White and Film Noir, go see the classics: ""The Big Sleep"", ""Kiss me Deadly"", ""Out of the Past"", ""Rogue Cop"", ""Killer's Kiss"", anything. Just stay away from ""Sin City"".With this film Robert Rodriguez proves once again that he has very little imagination and very very bad taste.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Rodriguez, Miller, and Co. Triumph with ""Sin City""","Before I begin my review, let me just say that I've recently become familiar with Sin City. After seeing the trailers and Comic-Con footage, I decided to buy the first five books to see what I was missing and what to expect.Anyhow, I recently attended an advanced screening of Robert Rodriguez/Frank Miller's Sin City in Houston and hot damn, what a movie! The movie is based off three of graphic novelist/co-director Frank Miller's books and a short story from Booze, Broads, & Bullets: The Customer is Always Right  An assassin (Josh Hartnett) and his target (Marley Shelton) have a discussion on a rainy balcony that ends in bloodshed; The Hard Goodbye - Marv (Mickey Rourke), a hulking brute, is out to find the person who murdered Goldie (Jaime King), a kindly prostitute he met and fell in love with one night; The Big Fat Kill  Dwight (Clive Owen), an ex-photographer with a new face, is out to protect his two loves, barmaid Shellie (Brittany Murphy) and Old Town leader Gail (Rosario Dawson), from Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro), a rough hero cop who really doesn't know when to take no for an answer. And when his temper leads to his bloody murder, it's up to Dwight and the Old Town girls to get rid of the body before the cops and the mob find out about it and wage war on Old Town; and That Yellow Bastard  Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is the only clean cop in Sin City and out to get Roark Jr. (Nick Stahl), the pedophile son of the corrupt Senator Roark (Powers Boothe), who has kidnapped a young girl, Nancy (Mackenzie Vega as a child; Jessica Alba as an adult), and plans to rape and kill her. Hartigan rescues Nancy and puts Junior in a coma, but suffers the wrath of Senator Roark and gets blamed for Junior's crimes. Eight years later, Hartigan gets out and has to protect Nancy, now an exotic dancer, from the Yellow Bastard, a deformed yellow ""man"" that shares a disturbing tie with Roark Jr.Before I discuss the film itself, let me discuss the cast.Mickey Rourke is BACK with a vengeance. He owns the Marv role, just like Ron Perlman owned Hellboy last year. After years of bad cameos and roles, Bruce Willis finally gets it right with Hartigan. Clive Owen is great as Dwight (hell, he even gets the best monologues out of the three lead characters). Nick Stahl well, if you've seen Bully, you'll know what to expect, except that he's now a deformed pedophile instead of a violent surfer kid. Once you see Elijah Wood as Kevin, you will never look at him the same way again. That's all I can say without spoiling anything big. Benicio Del Toro is freaky as Jackie Boy and you honestly can't wait to see him get what's coming to him. Michael Madsen has an interesting extended cameo as Hartigan's semi-corrupt partner (the character also appears in A Dame to Kill For). There's also Michael Clarke Duncan, Josh Hartnett, Powers Boothe, and Rutger Hauer, but there's not really much to say about them except that they're effective in their brief roles. Jessica Alba proves once more that she's more than just a pretty face as Nancy. She could've easily played Nancy as some dumb bimbo who's in love with Hartigan (even though that would've been disrespectful to Miller's vision), but she brings vulnerability and sass to the role and it works. Chiaki Kuriyama, step down. The crown for Menacing Asian Warrior goes to Devon Aoki's deadly little Miho (and boy, is she deadly). The best thing about Miho, excluding her fighting abilities, is the mystery surrounding her. Like Uma Thurman and David Carradine in the first half of Kill Bill, you know nothing about Miho, except that she's silent and the deadliest woman in all of Sin City. For those worried about Brittany Murphy, don't worry (much). She makes cameo appearances in THG and TYB and plays a semi-pivotal role in TBFK (hey, at least it's not her repeating Little Black Book). After her embarrassing appearance in Alexander, Rosario Dawson makes up for it threefold as Gail. She's decked out in bondage gear and loving every minute of it. Jaime King is good as Goldie and her twin sister, Wendy. Alexis Bledel sheds her good girl image as Becky, the Old Town girl who brings chaos wherever she goes. And Carla Gugino has an interesting small role as Marv's lesbian parole officer who supplies him with his pills.Now, onto the film Rodriguez KNOWS what he's doing. By bringing Miller on to supervise and Quentin Tarantino to direct one scene, he helps bring Sin City to life. The movie has an amazing 1940's film noir look to it, even with the sequences that had splashes of color, thanks to Rodriguez's cinematography and editing, which closely follows the images in the books. The art direction, completely CGI with minimal sets, is so realistic, you'd think they spent a fortune on it. The score, an action/jazz mix, is perfectly done by Rodriguez, John Debney, and Graeme Revell. While Sin City will likely be forgotten come Oscar time, mainly because of the insanely violent nature of it, I am hopeful that the film garners a Makeup nomination because the work done to create Marv and the Yellow Bastard is just phenomenal.As I mentioned earlier, I bought the first five books and eagerly await the re-releases of Booze, Broads, and Bullets and Hell and Back just to see what Rodriguez and Miller are cooking up for Sin 2. If Rodriguez was right about wanting Maria Bello as Ava Lord in ADtKF and Johnny Depp for Wallace in H&B, then it could be even better than the first.To keep it short and sweet: Sin City is THE movie of 2005. It's visually astonishing and has a great ensemble and director(s) to back it.A+",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Nutshell Review: Frank Miller's Sin City,"The long wait is over. After 5 long months, Sin City has finally made it to our shores, passed uncut. And watching it somehow brought a smile to my face, not that I'm extremely pleased with the gratuitous violence and nudity, but because it stuck to the source material so well, you feel as if you're reading the book and hearing the audiotape (if there is one) at the same time.For the uninitiated, the Sin City comics consists of various story lines, some of which are adapted for the screen. Created by Frank Miller, he also serves as co-director, which probably explains that this big screen adaptation is as faithful as you can get.I've read The Hard Goodbye, and watching that segment on screen, wow, every narrative dialogue and monologue, every scene in the book is right there on screen. The action and violence too, every frame adapted the look and feel of the book. Heck, even Marv (Mickey Rourke) looked the part, thanks to prosthetics. Jaime King rocked as Goldie, his goddess, while Elijah Woods rounded off the cast for this segment as Kevin, the chillingly fast and deadly killer.The other major story lines consisted of That Yellow Bastard and The Big Fat Kill, which I have been slow in picking up, but after viewing the movie now, you bet they'll be added to my comics collection soon. The stories are presented as a whole, so there is no intercut scene which brings you from one storyline to the next, and no confusion. Timelines in which the stories happen however, follows the books, so at some points you might see certain scenes and characters from other story lines.Casting is wickedly accurate, with the likes of Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson, Benecio Del Toro, Carla Gugino, Nick Stahl, Alexis Bledel, Devon Aoki, Michael Clarke Duncan, the list goes on. Most of the look like their comic book counterparts, which is simply amazing. The only inaccuracy I can spot is with Alba's character staying clothed in the movie (heh). Too many characters? No worries - the opening credits shows the character as drawn from the book, together with the actors name. So far, only Spider-Man 2 made use of comic book panels in its opening credits (drawn by Alex Ross).For those with weak stomachs, you might want to think twice watching the show. Most of the violence are shown on screen, but the lack of colours (it's black and white, like the books) somehow cushions the splattering of fresh blood. You have mutilations, shootouts, decapitations, castrations, explosions and the likes. The technique used in Sin City is similar to that used in Sky Captain, and all the backgrounds do not really exist.If you like Kill Bill, you'll probably enjoy Sin City too, shot and cut by Robert Rodriguez, with Quentin Tarantino having a hand in directing one of the scenes. Fans will probably clamour for a sequel (Marv+Dwight in tag team action in A Dame To Kill For?), I know I would too!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Special Effects are good, but I expected more","I think if this film didn't have the special effects, it wouldn't have been as good. I haven't read any of Millers graphic novels, so I guess I don't have much to say about the story, but I think as far as a movie, if it didn't have the effects it would have been a lot like other movies with multiple story lines. Something akin to Once Upon a Time in Mexico, or Pulp Fiction. Sin City was cool, but the effects made the movie. The Benicio del Toro and Clive Owen sequence was my favorite part of the film. I think the worst sequence was the Bruce Willis part. It just seemed lacking. I will definitely have to pick up some of the Sin City GN's and check them out. The style seemed to be represented well in the movie. Maybe in the future somebody will make a movie out of Ted McKeevers work. I think his style would suit the big screen.

A graphic novel almost literally brought to life,"Frank Miller's, Robert Rodriguez's, and (sometimes) Quentin Tarantino's Sin City is the very definition of a graphic novel brought to life; a beautifully photographed, realized depiction of a smutty city, soaked in saturated black and white photography, with only sporadic primary colors blue, red, and yellow finding their way on screen in the occasion. A dark, moody crime thriller, easily publishable under the category of film noir (or even neo-noir, as it's known in its contemporary form), Sin City offers the viewer and immersing two hours in a seedy city known as Basin City, a fictional, crime-infested, and three of its shadiest characters.The first is John Hartigan, an aging, veteran police officer played by Bruce Willis. In a town thriving on the self-fulfillment and gratification of others, Hartigan is selfless, always putting himself on the line for the greater good of Basin City's questionably deserving souls. We see Hartigan work to stop a serial killer who's victims have been children and is about to rape and kill fourth soul, as well as try to involve himself in more corruption that plagues Basin City.The next character we see is Marv (Mickey Rourke), a physically undesirable but thoroughly interesting soul. Marv is about seven-foot tall, broodish, unattractive, and build like a werewolf in leather clothing. Scars litter his face and ice seems to run through his veins, substituting blood. Marv is hung up on a hooker he met named Goldie, who looked like the human descent of an angel, desirable, illuminating, and unbelievably lovely to him in every way. After she is murdered, he looks to avenge her death in the only way he - and the rest of Basin City - knows how, which is through uncompromising, brutal, and bloody violence.Finally, there's Dwight (Clive Owen), who is caught in the middle of a vicious and abusive love-triangle between his current girlfriend Shellie (Brittany Murphy) and her physically-tormenting ex Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro). Despite being seeing Jackie armed with cronies and an arsenal full of tricks and manipulative tactics, Dwight fights to keep Shellie safe, as well as banding together a group of Basin City misfits, drifters, and prostitutes in order to form an uprising against Jackie Boy and his demeaning ways.Basin City is far too diverse and populated to simply make a film focusing on one character for the full one-hundred and twenty-three minutes, so it's nice to see that writers Elizabeth Avellan, Miller, and Rodriguez make the film as fleshed out as possible in terms of the numbers of characters there are, yet still work to develop them all. Immediately, however, the film attracts and dazzles because of its visual scheme; an almost consistently black-and-white color palette, with other occasional colors sharing small parts of the screen (like red dresses, blood, a blue-eyed prostitute, and a venomous ""Yellow Bastard"") makes for a rich style that completely complements the original graphic novel of Miller's. Basin City is captured in a dark, muggy light, always caught in the middle of a light rainstorm/drizzle, and consistently finding ways to be simultaneously bleak yet wholly immersing. Never has a film in the 2000's look and bled (quite literally) like a film noir).Sin City's only real misstep is that it occasionally becomes too kill-happy, focusing on the murderous rampages, excessive violence, and brutality and forgets either the characters behind them, or, predominately, the story, which can often be a muddle. While film noir movies are sometimes known for their unclear plots, Sin City does have a pretty clear one - mainly functioning as an anthology between characters - but its narrative richness could be more compelling had a foot been taking off the gas of the violence a few times. Yet this is not enough to derail the aesthetically sublime and, for the most part, well-acted display of neo-noir affects that work to create one of the most immersing films based solely on location that I've ever seen.Starring: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood, and Powers Boothe. Directed by: Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino (sometimes).",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Presumably hyped by avante-garde visuals, not substance. (spoilers)","I was disappointed upon having seen 'Sin City' the day after it opened in theaters. I am not immediately a fan of films based on comic books or graphic novels, and have not yet seen (or plan to see) any of the recent slew of adaptations. But, this one caught my eye, probably just as it had tempted everyone else because of the director's (and the art director's) tremendous loyalty to the comic feeling (thanks to the film being directed in part by the comic book's creator, Frank Miller, who knew best how he wanted his adaptation displayed). Making some landmark visual innovations that will long outlive the story and probably be copied or spoof more than the aerodynamic slow-motion sequences of the Matrix or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This is truly the most amazing element of the film, a comic book come alive in nearly every manner from the noir-ish scenery right down to the most minute details of the performers.However, looking beyond the surface, and getting past all of the consistent hype of 'Sin City,' I found myself rather bored with the plot. The story, probably better understood by loyal fans of Frank Miller's 'Sin City' comics, is essentially a series of stories of revenge. In each, the grizzly, misunderstood male hero comes to the aid of the damsel (or often, damsels) in distress, inflicting the most grueling punishment upon those who have wronged their lovers in one way or another. To me, it reminds me of a series of 'Kill Bills,' though sometimes, the villain appeared anti-climatic. If you place 'Kill Bill,' and the simplistic story of revenge in a black and white context, a 1950s noir setting, with monotoned, drawn out dialog, you have 'Sin City.' The various stories become repetitive, the same grizzly character (who often defied the laws of physics as did Mickey Rourke's character, Marv, did numerous times--he is shot, slugged in the face, or run over with a car in nearly every scene) to the rescue of nearly the same woman played out like a broken record.Moreover, the filmmakers appeared to be trying so hard to please, given the thin plot. The cautions of extreme violence were no bologna. Gratuitous violence as it was, the only apparent purpose for it (outside of visual novelty such as white blood that stained up men's suits so bad it looked like bird crap and references to the filmmakers like the removal via firearm of Rourk Jr's ear), was violence for the sake of violence. I have seen my fair share of needlessly violent films and do not complain about the fact that it was violent, but for me, even this element became just as tiresome as the plot because, necessary only to fill the time in the story, which was reduced to a black and white simplicity.I need not suggest that prospective viewers see this movie for the amazing visual innovation it provides, as this was probably responsible for much of the (overrated) hype that surrounds the film (and would this extend beyond the opening weekend?). I would however, caution, that unless you are heavily interested and can tolerate the predictable stories and rather melodramatic dialog, then you would probably fare much better with this movie than I (or any of the other three people I saw the movie with) would. (I would prefer Kill Bill Vol. 2 over this one). But, then again, there's only one way to find out. Right?",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Every middle-aged, comic book geek's wet dream","Before you read into my review as the ramblings of some whiny feminist, consider that I am a man who normally likes a good action film with a reasonable amount of violence, sex, etc. Now consider that I found this film extremely insulting.Could this film be any more chock full of bad, sexist clichés? Yes, the film is visually stunning and original to look at, but the film noir, Chandleresque narrative storytelling gets tiresome after a while, the violence is ridiculously over the top, and worst of all: behind the eye candy lies a pathetic concept that falls under the weight of it's own creator's ignorance, especially towards women. You've got to love people like Frank Miller who would swear that they're trying to make bold advances towards representing women equally by introducing female characters that are strong and independent, only to fall flat on his face in the process by making ALL of the female characters either hookers, exotic dancers, drug addicts, or lesbians. (Nothing against lesbians here, but my point being that EVERY woman in this film is the product of a MALE fantasy, and a sad one at that - sad as in the type of guys who are pushing 50 and live at home, go to comic conventions, and jerk off to Star Trek reruns). Miller clearly doesn't have a clue about women. Hell, even the purest female character here, an 11 year old VIRGIN (very important to state that here, as Miller thought to as well), can't resist the temptations of Sin City, as she matures into a 19 year old exotic dancer who has the hots for ""pushing 60"" Bruce Willis. Woo hoo! Another male fantasy cliché! Are you counting?Overall, incredibly dumb and immature.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
The most entertaining film ever made.,"Sin City was the greatest experience I have ever had in a movie theatre. It delivered everything I have ever wanted in a film. The acting was terrific, the direction superb, and the style was simply astounding. This movie oozes style from it's every pore. There's just something so inherently cool about it. I never thought I would say that a movie was straight up cooler than Pulp Fiction, but Sin City has done it. The only thing it is missing is Samuel L. Jackson, but The rest of the cast more than makes up for that oversight. Even actors I normally don't enjoy, such as Britney Murphy, come off as hard as nails people living in a hard city.The fact that it's the most faithful adaptation ever made doesn't hurt either. I've been a Frank Miller fan ever since I read ""The Dark Knight Returns"", but I hadn't read the Sin City comics before seeing the film. This means you don't necessarily have to be a fan of the comics to appreciate the genius of the film. But you better believe I'll be reading the comics first chance I get.In my life I have seen hundreds and hundreds of films without ever thinking to myself ""This is it. This is the one.

Basically, it is a flawlessly elaborated and structured noir film with a solid cast! The edgy and icky atmosphere of the city full of corruption, anarchy, lawlessness and social chaos makes you see the human nature from a different angle.Each hero had his own background, each scene was permeated with filth and despair, each story represented the dark side of reality.

The years passed by and I became a true cinephile and today I decided to give it a try after noticing the high rating and that Tarantino was a part of it and well, was one of the best decisions of my life! Cinematographically this is a masterpiece, a 10/10 on visuals with a perfect direction with amazing angles, shots, a beautiful photography, I loved the black and white tones and that only some things had real color, visually this is really perfect, it's like reading a comic book with your own eyes, they couldn't have done it better. Story wise I thought that I wouldn't like it due to the fact that I don't like action movies because most of them have awful plots with disproportionate action, but this has the right amount of everything. The right amount of action, the right amount of comedy and the 3 stories were pretty good and I loved every single one of them and the fact that they were 3 different actions and not only one. The movie keeps you one edge the old time and intrigued of what's coming next and it's hard to get bored watching this. The script is amazing and the narration of the characters thoughts in such a poetic way is just another huge factor for making this a true masterpiece.

generally effective comic book film,"Robert Rodriguez' ""Sin City"" is a highly stylized adaptation of the graphic novels by Frank Miller (who, along with Quentin Tarentino, assisted Rodriguez in the directing). The film draws its look and inspiration from those old film noir movies from the 1940's, the ones set in dark, rain-soaked, crime-infested cities and narrated in florid fashion by a world-weary private investigator or gumshoe. ""Sin City"" has that in spades along with deliberately arch dialogue, self-conscious acting and a visual schemata designed to knock your eyes out.""Sin City"" tells the episodic tale of three virtually unrelated ""super heroes"" (played by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke) who take on crime and corruption in what is, as the title implies, a veritable metropolitan den of vice and iniquity. The three leads are supplemented by Rosario Dawson, Josh Hartnett, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer in various smaller roles.""Sin City"" is far more about style than it is about substance, and, indeed, the story is the least engaging aspect of the film, often becoming repetitious and aimless and devoid of cohesion and unity. The look of the film, however, is what keeps us interested. Filmed primarily in black-and-white, the movie adds splotches of color at key moments and for various thematic purposes and relies heavily on rear screen projection to give it just that right post-modern/retro look it needs to be effective. As in the ""Kill Bill"" movies, the violence in the film is graphic but so highly stylized that we never take any of it very seriously, although there may be just a tad too much dismemberment for some people's taste - though, strangely, the people who are killed never seem to stay dead for very long in this movie. The art direction is less sensational than it is in many of these comic book movies, but the streamlined simplicity of the look keeps it from overwhelming the film.The child molestation theme that runs through the movie may be off-putting to some and it does result in a few queasy moments later on in the film. Still, this is an intriguing and generally entertaining comic book movie that really does a good job recreating the look of the source material on which it is based.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Miller found the perfect directors (Robert Rodriguez with Quentin Tarrintino doing some ?guest? directing) to show off his standard fare in amazing style. The light, shadow, and spot use of color was simply superb for the story and source material. Unfortunately the directors never thought to refine the script to provide a true hardboiled film noir where the double-crosses are a surprise and the dames are as savvy and smart as the men. Instead they indulge Miller's obsession with tough, ugly guys who seem to win the attentions of the perfect hookers. Miller doesn't have a Madonna/Whore problem writing women, he has a Whore/Whore problem. I've never seen so many thongs, black leather studded outfits, and gun-toting dominatrixes in a film outside the XXX district. Russ Meyers has nothing on these guys.

"The atmosphere is dark, the violence raw and the women as deadly as well-curved!","Sin City is one of the best efforts I have seen until now to transfer to the big screen a comic book. It totally respects the comic artist's (Frank Miller that is) perspective and makes a decent (and in a great part very successful) effort to transfer it to screen. A great deal of this achievement should be credited (in my opinion) to Frank Miller himself, since not only he co-directed the film with Rodriguez, but also in the first place his Sin City graphic novels are sketched in such a way as to oftentimes give the impression that you have in front of you a storyboard for a film. He has a very cinematographic way of sketching.The aesthetics of the movie is fascinating and the way Rodriguez shot it (having the actors play most of the times in front of blue screens and then drawing the background scenery) in order to give it a more comic-like look has paid off and contributed dearly to the accurate transfer to the screen the biggest part of the comic's dark, claustrophobic and at times surreal atmosphere. I believe that Rodriguez, with Sin City, has set a new standard for the films that are comic book transfers (as was his intention in the first place).A special credit should be given to Mickey Rourke's acting which is excellent. Rourke completely and inspiringly brings to life one of the most touching characters of Sin City (Marv) exactly as presented in the comic. One of his best performances of late.The movie's violence may disturb some, but nobody said that Sin City is a movie for housewives. A rather hilarious remark about the film I heard was while waiting in the line outside the cinema when I went to see it. It came from a middle-aged woman, coming out of the cinema some minutes before the end (god I hate those people) and ""warning"" us: ""Go grab a straw while you are at it, to suck all the blood"". It is true that the movie is not kind with its audience, but that is the least to be expected when Rodriguez and Miller co-direct and Tarantino special-guest-directs.In the bottom line I thoroughly enjoyed Sin City. Not so much as reading the graphic novels though, but I believe that many will find it even more exciting. Rodriguez's and Miller's inspired direction provides a compelling, dark atmosphere. The great cast gives very good performances (with best of all in my opinion Rourke's) and on top of it all is the scenario with as original stories as any, in our times, can be.A flick definitely worth seeing at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
badass movie for comic lovers,"When i'm watching the movie i thought i am reading a comic series and then i learned it is already based on a comic. When i saw the fight scenes i really thought this was a tarantino movie and yes that was. Cast was really good, every scene was fascinating and well thought out. There was a lot of bad men and brave, beautiful women out there and there were always in a war for something. There were a lot of blood in movie so its good to made this a black white movie and make the blood different colours is really a nice idea for audience. The movie will make you focused and feel you like you are in the movie. I like whole the idea of the movie so i rated eight points here. I just not like the some ideas on the movie but i wont write this here but consequently i will recommend for anyone if reading this for sure.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Dark, violent yet humorous, the nearest American has ever got to Japanese Manga","it is a strange weird comic book adaption of a set of graphic novels by Frank Miller (he's done batman stuff in the past) which i have never read... anyhow, this is a dark set of stories which loosely overlap in a place full of hardened prostitutes and criminals (and heroes who don't seem to die easily). Very violent in parts, although due to it being in black and white mostly the violence doesn't come over as graphic as it could be... Its the nearest that America has ever got to Japanese Manga i guess..But would i recommend it? yes and no... not one to take the Mrs, but if there is nothing else on then it is worth a push especially as there are loads and loads of great looking women in the film... i'll give it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"empty, empty, empty","SIN CITY is an okay movie, but bothersome. It's just empty, vigilante nihilism, basically, except for Bruce Willis' character. It's a set-'em-up, knock-'em-down kind of movie -- establish protagonist, establish villain, establish heinous deed(s), kill villain heinously; next story. The three main stories which make the lion's share of the movie are also pretty similar, so it gets repetitive and feels too long. There are lots of acts of violence, but for the most part they're very cartoonish, so we can squirm happily and know that nothing's really at stake -- certainly not our notions of the world or anything.This is the part that bugs me: stuff like this and Kill Bill are these constructs, these exercises, just as much as something like Wimbledon or Summer Catch are. It doesn't bother me so much that we as an audience will go see a fluffy romantic comedy as it does that the better directors in the machine are now cranking out vengeance scenarios with witless but kind of inventive brutality, and that's our popcorn. I'm not thrilled with what that says.There's nothing there; it's not like the constructions of, say, the Coens or Kubrick, which you can argue are cold, but at least are recognizably informed by life and thought; this stuff is informed by movies, basically, so you get hallmarks of characters without any fleshing out which really lets you get lost in that world. There's not a lot to think about when it's over (except how empty it is). And I know the argument against wishing for more is ""it's just entertainment."" Well, okay: then that turns it back to us. What are we seeking out as entertainment? But, yeah -- I bought my ticket, so I contributed. I should have gone with my instinct.Yep -- it looks good, but that pleasure disappears pretty quickly. It's not Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow -- which was ridiculous in a whole other way -- but it suffers a similar effect: good technology just can't take the place of a gripping story. If this movie had been as cleverly plotted and populated as, say, Blood Simple, and we actually gave a damn about the characters except as action figures, it could've been a masterpiece; it had all the elements except for some bad acting here and there (Jessica Alba, and especially Michael Madsen, who is just awful).It's just sad.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Sin City is sinfully good!,"Robert Rodriguez's take on Frank Miller's graphic novel ""Sin City"" is ground-breaking.

"Instant Classic!  Hardcore, Violent & Still Sexy!","Frank Miller's Sin City is an instant classic. I have never read the comic book so I can not tell you how true to the book it is, but never the less, I enjoyed it immensely. The style of the movie made to look like a black & white comic book with splashes of color was excellent. I assume that maybe the color was meant for a deeper purpose, but thus far, have not been able to figure it out. The comic look came off very comic book like (couldn't come up with a word) at times. The absence of color did not deter me or hinder my enjoyment in any way.The story is actually 3 different stories that come together in the end, similar to Pulp Fiction but easier to follow. Hartigan (Bruce Willis) was the star of the first story. He was a cop who would stop at nothing to insure an 11 year old girl's safety. Marv (Mickey Rourke), my personal favorite character in the movie, was a man who was set up to look like a murderer and must overcome incredible odds to clear his name. Dwight (Clive Owen) is the star of the 3rd story, which begins as he must protect his girlfriend, Shellie (Brittany Murphy), from her evil ex-boyfriend, Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro).All three stories are extremely violent and very adult oriented. That is probably why I liked it. It was a very adult themed comic book movie. I can not find any faults in any of the characters or actors. I enjoyed all those I wrote of earlier as well as some honorable mentions, which include Jessica Alba, Elijah Wood, Rosario Dawson, Jaime King, Devon Aoki, Carla Gugino, Alexis Bledel, Michael Madsen and really the entire cast.Overall, this movie is full of hardcore and violent images, yet still maintains it's comic book feel. It is very different from other movies of the genre such as Spider-Man or Hulk but closer to The Punisher but felt a little darker. If you like dark movies full of violence and sexy women, then I can highly recommend this to you. 9.5/10",,Anonymous,Crime
Dark City with a bit more humor,"I must admit to never having seen any of the material this movie was based on. Never the less, I'm going to guess that it was a challenge to transfer to the big screen. On the positive side, I watched this the whole way through, only checking my watch once or twice, which is a good sign. The characters are all pleasantly unpleasant, and the film noir storytelling makes it fairly easy to follow along. However, with several plot lines, I kind of expected a better wrap-up at the conclusion, but not all movies are completely understandable on first viewing, so maybe I missed something. The film is shot in black & white, with a few colorations, mostly red and mostly blood, which gets a bit hard on the eyes after an hour or so. Regardless, this is a good movie to rent if for no other reason than it is different from anything else you will have seen lately. But watch it after the kids have gone to sleep.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Visually stunning masterpiece,"""Sin City"" is a cinematic tour-de-force that redefined the boundaries of comic book adaptations. Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, this 2005 neo-noir masterpiece is a visually stunning, adrenaline-fueled ride that will leave you breathless.Faithful Adaptation
The film is a remarkably faithful adaptation of Frank Miller's iconic graphic novels. The screenplay, co-written by Miller and Rodriguez, stays true to the original material, capturing the dark, gritty essence of Basin City. The result is a film that feels both authentic and innovative.Visual Storytelling
One of the standout aspects of ""Sin City"" is its revolutionary visual style. The film's use of high-contrast black and white, interspersed with bursts of vibrant color, creates a stunning visual landscape that's both beautiful and brutal. The animation and special effects are seamlessly integrated, enhancing the overall cinematic experience.Ensemble Cast
The ensemble cast delivers outstanding performances, bringing the film's complex characters to life. Bruce Willis shines as Hartigan, a grizzled cop driven by a desire for justice. Mickey Rourke is equally impressive as Marv, a hulking, vengeance-fueled giant. Elijah Wood, Jessica Alba, and Rosario Dawson also deliver memorable performances.Non-Linear Storytelling
The film's non-linear narrative structure adds to its complexity and depth. The story is presented as a series of interconnected vignettes, each exploring a different aspect of Basin City's dark underbelly. This narrative approach keeps the viewer engaged, as the various storylines intersect and collide in unexpected ways.Influence and Legacy
""Sin City"" has had a profound influence on the comic book genre, paving the way for future adaptations like ""300"" and ""The Dark Knight."" Its impact can also be seen in the work of filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino and Zack Snyder.Conclusion
""Sin City"" is a groundbreaking, visually stunning masterpiece that redefined the comic book adaptation genre. With its faithful adaptation, innovative visual style, and outstanding ensemble cast, this film is an absolute must-see. If you're a fan of neo-noir cinema, comic book adaptations, or simply great storytelling, then ""Sin City"" is an unforgettable experience waiting to be discovered.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Frank Miller: The Movie,"Comic book movie or not, ""Sin City"" has got style coming out of its pores. It's a vast understatement to call this an adaptation; translation is more apropos, as if Robert Rodriguez physically lifted the content from the page and threw it up on the big screen. Whole panels are right up there for all to see. If Frank Miller painted the figurative picture of a city that no sane person would want to live in, the movie does it justice and adds the necessary realism to populate it with Hollywood actors. Its only weakness is that the viscera bogs things down after a while.But this movie's a treat for the cast alone, which is top-notch. Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis are ideal choices for Marv and Hartigan (respectively). Rosario Dawson's warrior woman is something else (man, oh man). I can't really think of a weak like in this group. I have to say that Brittany Murphy was my favorite here; she has the toughness and the vulnerability for the role, but she also has a real presence. That says an awful lot when she's able to stand out among heavy hitters like these.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A real comic book of a movie,"SIN CITY is a living, breathing comic book of a movie, not surprising since it is an adaptation of a graphic novel by former BATMAN writer Frank Miller. The production values are some of the best I have ever seen, combining live actors with CGI and matte sets to create a near-flawless visual experience. What the episodic movie lacks in plot, it more than makes up for in some terrific acting and great gobs of graphic gore, nudity and violence -- the last three being some of my favorite things. The only thing missing was a decent sex scene. In the first story, Bruce Willis shines as a -- what else? -- grizzled, older cop trying to stop a child killer. In the second story, Mickey Rourke plays an over-the-top quasi-superhero with a fright mask for a face (shades of real life!) up against a veritable army of goons who are killing prostitutes. Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro costar in the third and final episode, which is about two quarreling guys and a gal -- well, actually, make that gals, lots of gals, and all of them great looking. Touches of BLADE RUNNER, KILL BILL, PULP FICTION and BATMAN can be felt throughout. SIN CITY is aimed primarily at a young and hip crowd familiar with today's stylized comic books.

As Bad as It Gets,"I know it sounds like an exaggeration, but I will say it anyway. 'Sin City' is probably the worst high-profile movie I have ever seen.I wasn't too happy with Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' and Rodriguez's 'Dusk Till Dawn' can hardly be called a masterpiece, but their flaws seem almost negligible when compared to 'Sin City''s total lapse of reason.It is a film without a heart, made by people who have drifted so far away in their extreme vision of cinema art that the resulting product could not be saved by the impeccable acting, solid direction and innovative looks.'Sin City' is so full of pointless violence that there is hardly anything else in it.Do I need to be a fan of the original comics to appreciate how 'true to the original' the film managed to stay? Is that such a virtue? The story lacks any coherence, the dialog is so flat, they could have omitted it altogether.The fact that the film's overall rating on this site is way above 8.0 comes to illustrate the sad truth that no matter how bad a work of art is, there will still be people who admire it.For an Artist that should be a depressing thought.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Amazing to look at.,"Really, I have to congratulate Robert Rodriguez on a fantastic job of bringing a graphic novel to the screen exactly as it is on paper. This is not a new idea, but Rodriguez does a masterful job of giving this film the look of the novel, not just the feel. By shooting only on digital film, the entire movie looks like a graphic novel brought to life, which is what it is. The acting is very good, especially by Clive Owen and Bruce Willis, who I think does the finest job as the honest but doomed cop Hartigan. For the most part, this film keeps your attention, but I felt that some of the stories lacked real depth. Of course, we can't blame Rodriguez for that as he is making a direct adaptation. Still, this is film is amazing to look at. Combined with the high-quality star power, the crazy, blood-filled action of the action sequences, and the best scene in the film directed by Quentin Tarantino, all this adds up to a crazy thrill ride that does not let go.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
the best comic book film,"I loved reading two of the Sin City books in this film, one of which is the famous and first in the series ""The Hard Goodbye"" it's the story of Marv, who is played by Mickey Rourke and he does an amazing job, he basically wakes up to find out that Goldie is dead, and he then goes on a rampage to find out who done it, don't worry what I said doesn't give any of the story away.The one thing that stands out in the whole film is the way that it looks, it's very much like Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow, in terms of it's a very 1950's comic book feel, but this however is done in the better way. It's done in Film Noir basically another way of saying ""like kill bill"" everything is a bit over the top, such as the gun shots and the blood, etc. but thats the idea of the comic. The film is also done in a monotone effect (thats right your thinking what the hell is that) in other words only the primary colours are shown (so red, blue and yellow).The opening scene to the Marv story is scene for scene the same as the comic, while I sat and watched it on DVD I had to go and get my comic book from upstairs in my room and see how close the book it was, and believe me it's perfect. I thought that Batman Begins was close when I saw that but then this come out and I thought perfect.However I preferred the Hartigan story ""that yellow Bastard"", I thought that this story was better in terms of the way that it looks as a posse the the story (though the story is excellent and Bruce Willis is Hartigan, Mickey Rourke steals the spot light in this film) the Night club scene is the best scene ever when the lighting changes, and the whole editing is spot on, it's again how the comic is.Most of my friends were put off by the Black and White effect and found it to be a bit dull, however with the Special Edition version (which you should get because it has an extra 30 minutes) you see it all in colour and see that it's so much more different. For my A level media project I actually used the Sin City style and watched it in colour and could see how much of a difference it made.There are other famous actors and actresses in this film Jessica Alba, Benicio Del Toro, Michael Clarke Duncan, Michael Madsen, Clive Owen and Elijah Wood and they all do amazing performances. If you like the Sin City comics then you will love this film, it's true to the comics, and is actually directed by Frank Miller (creater of Sin City) it's perfect in the way that it's shown but I think to get the most out of it you need to see the Extended edition, it's a bit more expensive but it does explain the story and also you don't have to worry about watching them all you can watch the one you want when you want.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stylish to its Credit and Detriment,"Sin City is a three part movie consisting of three shorts loosely intertwined. The overall production is uneven as it's coated in black ink giving some shots an overall boring void look while others are lit with enough vibrancy to capture accurately the emotions of the characters and the superb acting from the cast.Out of the three acts Mickey Rourke's story is the most entertaining. His character is deep, compelling and realistic with the added brutality that the comic style demands.It's satisfying enough in parts, with a good deal of sophistication and cleverness, but held back by too much empty blackness and a structure that feels more suited for a TV show.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"An extremely entertaining, innovative experience. And Mickey Rourke is BACK!","There have been some rather faithful comic-book adaptations in the past (particularly recently) but ""Sin City"" takes it to another level entirely  it mixes the medium with another, taking away the familiarity and standards of cinema and replacing them with new styles and techniques.The first thing I noticed was the pacing  it's totally off. The movie skips from one scene to the next with free abandon. As a result of this, the characters are never really given much depth, the dialogue is unbelievably stiff and the acting is wooden. This would never receive a passing grade in film school. ""Sin City"" is  by almost any acceptable standards  a rebel. It doesn't even attempt to blend in with the rest.And yet this may very well be the next ""Pulp Fiction."" It's entirely appropriate, seeing that Quentin Tarantino is attached to it (and even ""guest directs"" a scene in the film). He's also the best friend of Robert Rodriguez, who shares directorial credit here with graphic novel artist Frank Miller. (He has a cameo as a priest whom Mickey Rourke kills.) This is a bloody, brilliant masterpiece of invigorating cinema  one of the best examples of how a film can become a testosterone ride, a breathtaking tour de force of images, exotic settings and virulent, destructive images. On top of this, it's the most misogynistic mainstream American motion picture I can remember in years, matching the sexist misdemeanor of the crude sex films of the 1980s  but even then women were treated as unattainable objects. In ""Sin City,"" women live their lives to please their men  they are beaten to a pulp, shot, tortured, hacked away at and stabbed when they disobey.No, ""Sin City"" is more like a trip back to the 1970s, when Burt Reynolds got away with slapping a woman across the face in the opening credits of ""The Longest Yard"" and lived to tell about it. Thirty years later, the remake stars Adam Sandler, and is rated PG-13.To see a movie like ""Sin City"" exist in this day and age is a miracle  I thought the producers would have stopped reading the script after the part where a brute named Marv dismembers a man and hand-feeds his limbs to a dog  all shown clear as day on the screen.Is this a good thing? I'm not saying it is. We don't need to see a woman being beaten on-screen for no reason, nor do we need exploitative violence  but ""Sin City"" doesn't use its violence for shock value. It's vital to the stories. Taking away the violence from ""Sin City"" would undoubtedly leave nothing other than a standard PG-13 action film  you have to hand it to Rodriguez, he aimed to make a good movie rather than sell out for the cash.""Sin City"" opens like a kick in the face, displaying the narrator (Josh Hartnett), a hit-man, as he introduces the world of Basin City, a dark and smoggy place nowhere in particular, where crime runs rampant.Soon we're following Marv (Rourke), a worn-out ex-con who is framed for the murder of a prostitute named Blondie (Jaime King). Marv swears a vow of vengeance and sets out to obliterate the soul who killed ""his Blondie""  even if it means crippling the innocents who interfere.After that story ends, another begins  a thug named Dwight (Clive Owen) fights a corrupt cop (Benicio Del Toro), the latter of whom winds up dead. This storyline essentially follows Dwight's struggles to get rid of the body  with the help of a pack of inner-city hookers who are afraid the police will invade their turf if the crime is revealed.Lastly we have a mini-narrative following convicted cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who saves a young girl named Nancy from a pedophile. He's sent to jail after the Senator  who happens to be the father of the pedophile  pins the crime on Hartigan. Flash forward a few years and he's out of jail on a mission to save Nancy, now 18 (and played by Jessica Alba), from the same creep. (Played eerily well by Nick Stahl.) The movie never slows down or runs out of steam. It just keeps going and going, becoming bloodier and more gut-wrenchingly brutal as its runtime elapses. I can't recall a single moment that went on too long.The best storyline is probably Marv's. ""Sin City"" has gotten a lot of publicity on behalf of Rourke  they're claiming this is his big comeback. I hope so. Rourke has long been one of my favorite actors and he is absolutely stunning as Marv, totally disguised under a layer of makeup and bandages.Marv narrates his own story like a gasoline-chugging tobacco addict, his voice raspy and gruff; Rourke's boxing years pay off, as his bulky physique totally eclipses those around him. ""Pulp Fiction"" had Travolta and ""Sin City"" has Rourke -- I can't wait to see where this takes his career.Don't get me wrong, though. The acting is bad. Purposefully so, too. The actors really ham it up, and the dialogue redefines stiff. If this were a serious film, I'd have been cringing throughout  but it's not. It is an homage to film noir and a thematic translation of the graphic novels. In that perspective, the cheesy qualities are absolutely perfect.I have never read a single ""Sin City"" graphic novel, but after seeing this, I feel as if I have. Rodriguez has remained faithful to his sources and created a dazzling new form of film-making; expect to see more of these kinds of movies in the future.

Some of it was passable, for example the Mickey Rourke sequence I thought was well done, well acted, and the dialog was clever. But I felt that the acting by most of the woman character's was weak, almost sounded like line readings. Perhaps these women ( Gugino, Murphy,Alba, Dawson) are just nice to look at, and not much else. I have never fancied Rodriquez, he's a bit of a schmuck. His films are terrible, his writing is terrible, and he's an obnoxious creep, much like his pal Tarantino. I got an idea for a film, Tarantino & Rodriquez should hold a big love fest, where they do nothing but compliment each other, then at the very end, they blow each others brains out. I think that would be a great movie, and it would get rid of some waste in the business. Now if they'd only toss in Affleck, Damon, Edward Burns and Kevin Smith, I'd pay to see the sequel.

A Film I Did Not Like,"Often I read negative comments in IMDb about films that I have loved and I wonder why people could feel so differently to how I felt about a film.

I hated it, and very rarely do I hate a film. I like all types, including PULP FICTION, and even SEVEN, and two of my favourite films are FARGO and VERY BAD THINGS, so violence, per se, does not worry me. However, today I walked out on this film and I have never done that before.Why did I dislike it? I found it almost pornographic in its enjoyment of violence, torture and gore. I really felt that those aspects, of what I consider to be the dark side of our humanity, were being presented to us to enjoy and to get kicks from. I found this abhorrent. I recognized the great skill in the making of the film but, for me, it was just too terrible in its aims. Here in Australia there has been a little controversy about a varvellous (to me) film about Padophilia (rated R) called MYSTERIOUS SKIN involving an attempt to ban it.

"not quite going along with the pack of others- I recommend Sin City, but...","...I think that maybe I have seen too many movies in this vein and style, or I have been privy to too much in the realm of dark, violent, and intriguing noir stories, but there's just something about Sin City that doesn't quite make it a masterpiece, at least for me. I wouldn't dare tell you to not see the film, especially if you're in its target area (if you look at the IMDb votes, the primary 10's are given by those under the age of 18, or 18-29, mostly males), and for auteur Robert Rodgriguez (his number of credits practically solidifies him as one), he has here achieved a different style that stands out pretty well in today's muck of Hollywood films. What can be criticized, I think, is with Frank Miller, who is more of the brain, brawn's, and flaws of Sin City as writer/co-director of the film, and originator of the comic books this film is practically copied and pasted by.I have read a couple of the Sin City comics, and I have no doubt that Miller is a gifted artist. But as a storyteller, he's hit or miss for me. Not that I am unaware of what goes into these noir stories- there's the consummate anti-heroes (haunted cops, big tough guys with a heart), the strong femme fatales, and the twisted, corrupt villains. Yet even in the best parts of Sin City there's something, well, too expectable. Not to say the actors don't do what they can or there's not enough juice in it. But at times I felt Rodriguez, through Miller, was so faithful to the original text (he called it a 'translation' as opposed to an adaptation), some of the real interesting parts were left behind. There is something in Rodriguez/Miller that speaks of talent and strength, but also total dependence on standards in the genre(s).There is no question that the content in the film is rather graphic and surreal in the violence (the ripping off of various body-parts, blood sometimes red or b&w or yellow), and on the visceral level I mentioned it serves the brutality of the stories. Take Elijah Wood's character, Kevin, whom he plays with perfect stone-cold, calm insanity. He is likely the most violent character in the film (Marv is violent, though mostly by defense), even if we don't see him committing these violent acts. Scenes involving him and Marv (Mickey Rourke, also one of the highlights of the film) are well shot, but somehow I felt a kind of by-the-numbers quality as well. It's strange to say it, and many will not feel the same way (many have commented on the film's brazen originality, which I do and don't see), there is something about the film that tries so much (and maybe too hard) to be easily liked.Rodriguez, in keeping with a very similar storytelling style of his friend Quentin Tarantino, is confident, but because it's a familiar style, it doesn't make the last segment- That Yellow Bastard- as exciting/unpredictable as it might have been as the last segment. The Big Fat Kill, which Clive Owen and Benicio Del-Toro's characters (I preferred the later's performance, Owen in his one-tone voice isn't as effective as Del-Toro) should have been last and made for a more effective ending. The story itself involves strippers, a bad-ass cop (Jackie-Boy, Del-Toro) who barks up the wrong tree, a scary hoodlum (Michael Clarke Duncan), and a possible gang war. This segment includes some of the better parts of the film, however overall feels like the weakest. There's more interest in the core of Marv and Hartigan (Bruce Willis, also good) in their stories, but with the Big Fat Kill there are, like in the other parts, flashes of genius without a distinct direction.It's not to say that Rodriguez doesn't have his strengths as a filmmaker, but one can sense when the style shifts in Tarantino's directed segment. Throughout the film, Rodriguez and Miller test with the possibilities of different colors amid the black and white texture used in the completely digital backdrop. Aside from the Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl, not quite as terrifying as Wood's Kevin), the usage of different colors isn't as fulfilling as one might expect. Except in the Tarantino scene; it reminded me of a cross between a crazy scene in an Italian horror film (Del-Toro being a zombie in Owen's head space) while including a color layout of an art film that was unique. This is one of the best scenes in the film, and something about Tarantino's direction- even within the confines of Miller's writing- rises a little above (some of) Rodriguez's work.I've realized more on the subsequent repeat viewings- which do reveal there's more to take in than at first is apparent- that Sin City is, more often than not, a good success of style over substance- the film should've received an Oscar nomination for visual effects, and even cinematography, as it is of a highly professional quality. Rodriguez and Miller, in being so in love with the technology and look of the film at their disposal, at times miss what possibilities are in the actors, what they can do with the story. Aside from some exceptions, the performances in the film are less than great, trying to sound too much like how one would picture it. The difference between a modern film-noir like Pulp Fiction and a modern film-noir like Sin City isn't necessarily with the story, but how real the actors get with the characters. 'Pulp' does that, while Sin City doesn't as much, at least to me. It's got a lot of skill and juice, at times excellent, but there's something missing in it. A-",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Totally Badass Film!,My Rating : 9/10Sin City. It's movies like these that make movie-watching so interesting. This is masterpiece-level badassery in gorgeous black and white using mainly green screen technology.Mickey Rourke's Marv is epic and one of my favourite onscreen characters ever alongwith Benicio Del Toro's Jackie Boy. I'm not sure why Pulp Fiction is regarded higher than Sin City.Sin City is an excellent anthology-type crime neo-noir.,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Like Swimming in a Pool of Cheap Rotgut,"It was the grimiest grind house in town. Yeah. The Carmike. Williamsburg, Vee Ay. My town. What can you say about a place whose best day was 1764? Guess it was all downhill after Washington and his French buddies gave Fat George and his boys the bum's rush.I shuffle up to the box office. Cash only. Figures. Only jack talks in this town. The goateed guy behind the window doesn't even look at me. Just at my sawbuck. Guess he'd rather be at a comic book store.The floor's so sticky that I have pry up my Doctor Dentons with my shiv just to take a step. The first seat I try folds like a bad poker hand, and I barely keep my keister out of a pile of melted goo on the floor. The place stinks. I haven't smelled this much coconut oil since I passed out on Virginia Beach after a three-day Sterno binge. Seems like the right place to see Sin City.Yeah. Sin City. If a movie had a smell, this one would reek of cigarettes, cheap hooch, and even cheaper sex. Looks like the kind of town where the main cause of death is lead poisoning contracted during a smoke in a filthy toilet stall.But, at the get go, it's all about love. Boy meets girl. Boy kisses girl. Boy whacks girl with his big 44 mag. Love sure makes people do funny things.Bruce Willis shows up as Hartigan, the only honest cop in Sin City. Smart move when your acting career is in the tank. Go back to the old Pulp Fiction well. Too bad he has a bum ticker. He shoots the equipment off some creep who's favorite song is ""Thank Heaven for Little Girls."" He saves a little girl, but the creep has low friends in high places.Mickey Rourke shows up next as Marv, a big gorilla who looks like the Frankenstein monster after he's finished a hitch in the Marines. A beautiful hooker named Goldie gives him a night of sweaty bliss. Too bad she wakes up dead in the morning. Poor dope. Looks like he's being framed. What did he expect in Sin City? Marv ""kills his way to the top"" to find out who's framing him. But he didn't figure on getting his butt kicked by Frodo Baggins. Yep, Elijah Wood with the kung-fu grip takes big Marv down. It's like watching the Lollipop Guild wail on Sergeant Rock. But Marv don't stay down long.The next story is another heart warmera killer, a bad cop, some Irish mercs, and an army of hookers. You'd swear this was a Disney flick--maybe ""Herbie Goes to the Tenderloin"" or ""Pollyanna's Big Score."" Clive Owen is Dwight, a ""killer with a new face"" who's after Benicio del Toro, a bad cop whose been slapping around Dwight's new girl. Dwight chases the flatfoot into Old Town, which is the territory of the Fighting Hookers of the 101st Prophylactic. Seems that the hookers have a deal with the cops and the mob that gives them Old Town. Seems that they didn't know del Toro was a cop. Seems that this kung-fu hooker killed the copper by plugging his gat so it backfires (never let this happen to you). Seems this breaks the truce and gives the mob a chance to retake Old Town. Seems it's up to Dwight and his old hooker girlfriend (Rosario Dawson) to keep this from happening. Seems like nothing is ever like it seems.Remember Hartigan? Well, he's been framed, too, by the creep's old man, who happens to be a senator (Powers Booth). Tough break. Hartigan gets out of the joint after eight years, but he's a tool for finding the little girl he saved at the beginning. She's found a fulfilling career as dancer with a rope act at this dive where Marv hangs out. I never meet classy broads like that. Anyway, Hartigan has to save her from this yellow-skinned creep who who looks like he was on the losing side of the War of the Rings. No prizes for guessing who he is. Seems that the creep's old man found some drugs that grew back what Hartigan shot off, but with some nasty side effects. Never use that stuff they hawk on the Internet.But remember, all this is in the name of love. Sweaty, grimy, blood-soaked l-o-v-e.I shambled out of the theater, my feet crunching on half-eaten Lemonheads and sticking to stinking puddles of Cherry Coke syrup. So, what about this Sin City? Definitely looks cool, but I doubt that Suzie Sunshine and Larry Lawnmower in Suburbia are gonna take to it. Not too multiplex friendly, this flick. But I bet they sneak it out of video stores in plain brown wrappers.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Puts the ""GRAPHIC"" into ""Graphic Novel""","I have to say that like others, this is probably one of the best adaptations to screen ever. You can even find frame-to-comic comparisons that match up completely. However, in comics they may show one quick frame of blood and gore to illustrate what is happening. When translated to screen, these frames last much longer. Instead of a quick flash of this, we get 30 minutes of this bleeding, 45 minutes of that bleeding. I fear the marvel of film-making this movie is will be lost on a large audience due to the amount of blood and gore. This is probably the only movie where they have to warn you about castrations in the plural sense. Marve's part seemed to drone on a bit, especially since the violence just seemed to get repetitive.Much like ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" the violence level will ward some people away from a good movie, but I think Kill Bill did a better job of making the movie violent without putting so much in you get bored.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
AWESOME The movie for comic fans,"This movie is beyond AWESOME. The Rodriguez-Miller team was perfect. I don't think I could have wanted a better comic book movie than Sin City. All of the actors were awesome. I loved Mickey Rourke as Marv, and could Bruce have been any better for Hardigan? I cannot praise this movie enough. And, the fact that they took the comic panels and created the movie right out of the Graphic Novels is just amazing.And, Jessica Alba was really really good as Nancy, after all of the hoopla over her not being naked in the movie, I think she pulled off the part of Nancy very well. You did not need her to be naked, she was able to convey that innocent nature within the context of her being a stripper.I LOVED LOVED LOVED This movie, saw it twice, and would have gone for a third time if I had the chance.

The definition of a cool movie,"That is what 'Sin City' is. A movie full of a great actors, perfectly shot and very well directed.BUT... There is the problem. 'Sin City' is not a good movie.

There is coolness in this movie and that is what made it successful. But there is not anything else.It's pointless to talk about the plot and the story of the movie since it is divided on five parts without any connection between them. I guess most of the people think this is very original but it is not. There are many movies shot by similar way there. The acting is pretty strange. I mean, there are great actors in the movie but they are not allowed to show what they can do. The acting is not bad but it is not anything great. Just cool. Very cool. The only thing that is really good in this movie is the visual. It is great. It is not very original actually but it is really good. But it does not make the movie good.And that is it.

I just loved Mickey's character, dunno whether the way he acted was true to the comic book but was one damn good piece of acting. Bruce can do these roles without even being given the script of the movie and Clive owen and Bencio were also pretty good.The surprise for me was the number of female leads in the movie.Elijah wood's role was pretty creepy along with a unrecognizable Nick.

Wow,"i didn't really know about Miller's Sin City series of comic books. I usually only follow in the Marvel tradition e.g Spiderman, Blade etc. but when i saw this film i was blown away. I'm not a big fan of film noir but i was amazed at how good this film was. the different tales of the characters intertwined perfectly, the cast was excellent (yes even Nick Stahl) especially Mickey Rourke!! Definitely one of the best films I've seen for a long time! I'm a fan of the director, Robert Rodriguez, ever since he made Desperado and i think he has done a fantastic job on this film, with a little help from Tarantino. I only have two things confusing me, though. First, why cast an English guy and have him do a very bad American accent, and secondly, what was the point of Josh Hartnett's character?? Apart from these two questions, everything else was perfect, and it's nice to see Bruce Willis back on top form again.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not as Good As I Remembered, But Still a Fun Time","I was a 13 year old boy when I first saw Sin City, and young film nerd me (with a serious crush on Jessica Alba) absolutely adored this movie. It wouldn't be an understatement to say that this film truly had an impact on my taste and love for film.Revisiting it almost twenty years later, I can confidently say this movie has a lot going for it, but definitely doesn't hold up as well as I thought it would.Visually, Sin City is a marvel, shot in black-and-white with pops of colour to emphasize certain characters and motifs. This film really nailed the aesthetic of its source material in a way that we'd come to miss with later comic book adaptations. There's a clear love for this source material that shines through that you can't really deny.I also really like the film's structure, an anthology of sorts following various characters in titular Sin City, often lifted straight from the graphic novels themselves. Like the comics, this film pulls absolutely no punches: it has all the violence, sex, brutality, darkness, and death that they did. The film also feels like a heightened reality, where people can jump from buildings or throw people half way across the room with ease.To say this film's cast is stacked would be an understatement. Mickey Rourke is absolutely perfect as Marv, who conveys both toughness and vulnerability in equal measures; it's hard not to leave the film not loving this hulking lug. Bruce Willis is also just as good as Detective Hartigan, perfectly cast as he brings the world weariness of the character to screen as if he was born to play the world. I also really liked Nick Stahl, Clive Owen, and Jessica Alba (not just because of the chaps, okay?), they seemed to really embody the characters they were meant to be. Benicio Del Toro, however, delivers probably the best side character performance as Detective Rafferty...I can't get over how good he was in this movie, and how I barely noticed it when I was younger.Where this movie falls a bit short for me is the dialog and some of the performances. Rosario Dawson looks stunning, but there's something about her line delivery that really bothered me. Michael Madsen and Alexis Bledel fall into that same boat. When the performances don't feel sincere, the cheesiness of the dialog is genuinely embarrassing at times.Then there's story number 2, which is undoubtedly the worst of the lot. There's just far less emotional connection between the protagonist (Dwight - played quite well by Clive Owen) and what's going on vs. What Rourke and Willis get up to in their stories. Old Town, for some reason, looks really bad and its here where the actors feel like they're hamming it up a bit too much. Even if this sequence has one of the most memorable moments of the entire movie, directed by the legendary Quentin Tarantino.Then, of course, there's Frank Miller. Miller is definitely more of an aesthetics guy and less about the logic, but there's a weird immaturity to the way he writes that's....fine, but quite noticeable when you get older. For example, why on Earth would Hartigan CONFESSING he's a child molester get him OUT OF JAIL? Or how would anyone know that Rafferty died in Old Town, even if the cop followed, there's absolutely no way he'd know who it was by his civilian car.That all being said, Sin City is a great time. It's visually stunning, as Hard R as it needed to be, faithful to the source material, and has some great moments and performances.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Know Thyself, and Stay True","One important aspect of any media that keeps coming up for me as of late, and appears to be somewhat overlooked, is the ability for a film, TV show or book to know itself. That is to say, they should understand the type of media they are trying to produce and stay faithful to that, not get bogged down in unnecessary cliche and exposition, and use every aesthetic and storytelling tool to realize the premise they started with. The ability to stay true to oneself is up there with dialogue and visuals in terms of its importance in creating a believable and impactful film. There's a reason that everyone from early morning children's cartoons to Lady Gaga tells you to just be yourself. One film that does this exceptionally well is Sin City.In one respect, Sin City starts with some advantages in this way. To begin with, it is an adaptation of an exceptional graphic novel. The film needed only to stay faithful to the original and it was bound to be something special, and that is exactly what they did, keeping the stunningly contrasting aesthetics and largely including the dialogue. Graphic novels have had a great ability to keep this authenticity. They can take the neo-noir visuals and translate them well onto the big screen in order to keep that feeling of turning pages and viewing something real but not too real. V For Vendetta (2005) and 300 (2006) are some of the best examples of this. The colors and the landscapes are not quite realistic, and the fighting is almost believable. They are clearly comic books in the form of film. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) has very literal moments of comic visuals, and the fight scenes make no excuses, they are wild and crazy just as we would expect. Sin City captures both of these concepts beautifully. The colorful blood, the ridiculous fighting, the wonderfully overacted dialogue all remind the audience that they are watching a comic book. There are moments to make you say ""What the hell!"" enough for five films.This is in contrast to comic book adaptations, which are significantly more malleable. Take the Marvel universe. Surely, there are wonderful and revolutionary films, but they take many forms. Ant Man (2015) is a comedy film. The Avengers series is epic sci-fi fantasy. And the Daredevil series on Netflix is a gritty crime drama. This is the advantage of having a huge amount of source material and an extensive canon to work with. You can pick and choose pieces to fit as you need them. Graphic novels are generally a lot more limited, and their ability to stay truthful to the source material is incredibly important in creating something that both new audiences and die-hard fans of the work will appreciate.The second advantage was having Robert Rodriguez as the director and Quentin Tarantino making a guest appearance. Rodriguez has an excellent ability to keep a film true to its intentions, even if the film itself is not particularly amazing. His later projects after Sin City show this pretty nicely. Planet Terror (2007) is a masterpiece of camp and gross-out horror. It is cartoonish and sarcastic without making any excuse to become realistic or heartfelt. Machete (2010) is a non-stop highlight reel of carnage. Just like the ""fake"" trailer that inspired it, it was ridiculous and amazing. Spy Kids (2001) and Spy Kids 2 (2002), which are altogether mediocre films, should have had no staying power whatsoever. Yet the film's names still resonate with many and the thumb people and guy with four heads still give me nightmares, at least. Somehow the success of these films was enough even to convince a studio to make a fourth installment ten years later.Sin City stays aware of itself from top to bottom, and from start to finish. The musical accompaniment is perfectly noir. Every actor has bought into the concept as so each character, no matter how minor, plays an important role in making the world (un)believable. The sets are clearly built in some studio, but it doesn't matter. We know that behind the walls is just some wooden paneling holding everything together, just like we know that a book is bound together by glue and threads, but it doesn't stop us from being totally engrossed.
Many films fail to maintain this truthfulness, and that brings them from great movies to something simply good or acceptable. Take, for example, nearly any major Disney Studios release from the last ten to twenty years. The Disney execs are so intent on keeping films inside of a basic and successful formula that they lose their sense of authenticity. They have to shoehorn in romance, rebellion, an evil villain and the hero's journey into any film whether it fits or not, because that is what the audiences want. These movies will always be successful, that's Disney's power, but they rarely get discussed in top lists during the years in review.Sequels also especially fall into this trap because they stray too far from what they originally intended. Perhaps there is a change in directors, producers or writers, but even when they stay the same this can happen. Take IT (2017) and IT: Chapter Two (2019). What made the original so terrifying was its portrayal of the monster and the feeling of helplessness that was inspired in every audience member. Thirty minutes into the second film, though, this feeling is lost. IT is no longer omnipotent or villainous. He is more mischievous and manipulative. These traits would be okay if the whole construct of this universe didn't hinge on the monstrosity of the villain. IT: Chapter Two has none of the authenticity, and therefore none of the power of the first film.Sin City is a fantastic film in its own right, but it is a lesson too. A lesson on how to take a concept and run with it for two hours to the very apex of that idea. Perhaps some artists are worried about taking something too far. Well, I say not far enough. Push it to the extreme and see what happens. Let your characters become caricatures if the framework is already a caricature of reality. No one will blame you for making something silly and weird if it makes them think. The feeling of Sin City resonated in my mind for years even before I rewatched it recently. This is not because it stuck to a formula and made some generically marketable, but because it took the truth of itself to the very extreme that it could and made something so cartoonish it became a lifelike work of art.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Glorified violence becomes glorious violence,"Yep, it's undeniably stylish, and surely it will be remembered, venerated for a while for its originality. But past the avant-garde beauty, of which the novelty does unfortunately wear off a few scenes into the film, there is not a lot to commend. You may be nodding appreciatively over the grey scale glamour of Sin City for two hours, in which case, great. On the other hand its veneer may stop amusing you once you've decided to start following the plot, in which case you're screwed for the remaining hour and a half. Sin City is wonderful in concept, every frame is eye-candy, but subject to a whole reel's worth of these frames the sweetness becomes a little sickly. The story serves mainly just to show off the capabilities of the camera, presenting itself as a series of anecdotal incidents that ultimately come to nothing. Had the film been shot in colour, it would be valueless, a minor blockbuster that showcases ultra-violence for cheap kicks, that gently stirs your appetite before the main course of the big summer blockbusters. It is the inspiration of designing this film to feel just like a comic that dignifies the plot and the shameless violence. In the name of art it feels perfectly natural to accept virile vengeance-seekers with a yen for castration and armies of gun-slinging prostitutes- you might even find yourself happily embracing all the action even if normally you'd make a point of looking decidedly disinterested to protect your dignity. Watch it and work out for yourself whether you like what the world is coming to.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Extraordinary - Highly recommended,"There have been many movies based on comics: Superman, and Batman preceded ""Sin City"" by 20-30 years, and there's the current rash of Marvel offerings. M. Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"" is a near comic book characterization. Until now, perhaps ""Dark City"" is the closest to come to an actual comic. Based on Frank Miller's ""graphic novels"" (OK, ""comic books""), this is the first movie that has the power, the look, and the feel of a comic book. Other posters will post a point-by-point plot of this movie, and it's not necessary to do so. This is a graphically violent film, with some very disturbing images - there are also also many laugh out loud scenes. Be forewarned: this is not a ""date"" movie, and certainly not appropriate fare for children.Three stories are intertwined, juxtapositioning time and space just enough to keep you out of step. Scenes include 50's autos and plastic garbage bags, compressing time by 20 years. Perhaps it's a method to indicate that sin transcends time and space, race and age. Is it any coincidence that several of the major actors look like actors from other movies? Powers Booth reminded me of Gregory Peck in ""Boys from Brazil"". Rutger Hauer does a turn of Marlon Brando in ""Apocalypse Now"". With his cartoonish physique, angular face, and haircut, Mickey Rourke looks all the world as Kirk Douglas in ""Spartacus"".The DVD will undoubtedly allow the directors a chance to discuss their individual and collective visions, and that will be a treat. The plot twists are sufficient to provide material for at least one sequel, and I can't wait.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
style over substance,"Bang. Boom. Blam.There you have a fine plot summary of this grossly overrated movie.If I were a teen, perhaps I wouldn't have minded watching scene after scene of testosterone-driven characters (including, seemingly, the females) spewing out line after line of instantly forgettable dialogue; however, since I much prefer movies that have interesting plots, I feel obligated to warn those expecting a lot from this movie because of it's high IMDb rating (8.4)to keep their eyes open and their ears closed.As the movie ""Sin City"" is a comic book adaptation, the director and his team chose to infuse the movie's cinematography with a heavy comic book feel-- the use of black and white color contrast and Gothic lighting is particularly effective, in this respect. And not only does the movie look like a comic book, but it moves like one as well; the tempo is brisk, and the lead characters are constantly on the go. Yet none of it's dynamic imagery and pacing compensates fully for the bland one-dimensionality of the lead characters. In the Spider-man movies, the viewer likes and cares for Peter Parker, who possesses, at the same time, superhuman powers and a nice guy personality. It's easy to empathize with Parker, who is shy and insecure but possesses the potential to accomplish so much more. By contrast, the lead characters in Sin City seem cynical and somewhat stoic, even as they scramble frantically across the city and its outskirts to accomplish various tasks.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
The closest you'll ever get to have a movie look like the original comic book,"That's right. Had it not been made to look so much like a comic book on screen, a lot of the ultra violence will become almost impalatable (no pun intended), such as the nice little guy Kevin (Elijah Wood) who makes Hannibal look like boy scout. A lot of that comic book look comes from the essentially blank and white filming, mixed surreally with partial colouring of mostly red and yellow. The black-and-white however does a lot more than creating a comic book look. It creates startling beauty, particularly with the deliberate contrast of light and shade. The feeling is at once both retro and contemporary.The movie consists of three separate stories, loosely linked in the Amores Perros circular fashion, just for the fun of it. What initially grabbed my attention is the opening credit, with the actors' names appearing in alphabetically order (with Willis and Wood coming last). I like it, the resemblance of a theatre ensemble in which everybody is treated equally (at least theoretically) and you're not a star just because you happen to be given a key role in the current production. Still, for each story, you can identify the three key roles: the hero, the heroine and the villain. Yes, they all pitch the hero against the villain, rescuing a damsel in stress on the way.The first story, with half of it shown at the beginning and the other half the end, has Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba and Nick Stahl. Willis plays an aging cop Hartigan rescuing an 11-year-old girl Nancy from sex pervert and senator's son played by Stahl. Eight years later, he rescues her again from Stahl's character that has become the yellow bastard. Things to watch for here are the spirit of the undauntable good old western sheriff (Gary Cooper?), the young girl's (at 19) crush for the aging cop who saved her and the grotesquely exaggerated villain.The second story has Mickey Rourke, Jaime King and Elijah Wood. Rourke plays a tough guy, looking almost like ""Jaws"", sworn to avenge the murder of a hooker Goldie (King) who somehow captured his tender heart in one fling. Of course, King wouldn't be wasted and comes back to play Goldie's twin sister Wendy. Not quite the chief villain but rather his tool, Elijah Woods plays a psychopath killer that, as I said, makes Hannibal look like boy scout. This is the most violent of the three stories.The final story has Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson and Michael Clarke Duncan. This is simply a story of all out warfare between a gang of militant prostitutes lead by Gail (Dawson), with the help of old lover Dwight (Owen), against corrupted cops. While Duncan plays the villain, it's Benicio Del Toro who steals the show, playing under-cover cop Jackie Boy, whose untimely death means the removal of the effective buffer between the two forces. As the dead body of Jackie Boy, Del Toro continues to act, beautifully, in the only sequence in this movie that is directed by Tarantino as the ""guest director"".There are other fun characters aplenty, such as Japanese sword wielding Miho (Devon Aoki), who might have come directly from Kill Bill. All told, it's a fun movie  great visuals, exciting action, weird humour and, if nothing else, it's such a pleasure watching the bad guys beaten to pulp.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Visceral, Visionary, Visual, Sin City kicks the big un!","Three grizzled stories from Basin City comprise the basis for Robert Rodriguez's adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novels (Miller along for co-directing duties as well). Man mountain Marv is out to avenge a murdered hooker, Dwight attempts to help the red light girls stay independent from the mob, and aging cop Hartigan is trying to protect a beautiful dancer from a sadistic pervert.I think the first thing I should say is that I have no frame of reference as regards the adaptation here, I have never read (or seen) a Frank Miller story, but from what I can gather from thE IMDb site is that fans of Miller's graphic stories were well pleased with the final result. I'm pleased to see that, because too many times comic book adaptations are roundly panned by the hard core fan base of each respective franchise for not being close to the spirit of the source, so here I'm doubly relieved mainly because I find Sin City to be a majestic assault on the senses.Sin City is a stark place, full of seedy residents thriving on misery and mistrust, and here we are privy to three stories that only serve to remind us that we don't want to be anywhere near the place. Playing out as some sort of horror comic noir, Sin City is for sure a very violent picture, yet the violence is formed so perfectly in its style, it cloaks the film in artistic class. Once viewed, Sin City is never forgotten, and I for one literally do tip my hat towards Frank Miller & Robert Rodriguez for bringing such a great and interesting movie to the masses. All of the cast do great work, so I'll not single anyone out for praise, the techniques and the whole structure of the piece is quite simply marvellous, and as for the writing? Well get a load of it!Sin City, a dark horrible place, Sin City, a wonderful wonderful movie. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A Brilliant,Ultra-Violent Visually Stunning Comic Book Classic.","Frank Miller's Sin City is one of the greatest comic book films of all time thanks to it's great direction,unforgettable characters,excellent cast,beautiful black and white visual style,great Hard-Boiled dialog and tough Film-Noir landscape. This film is one of my favorite movies of all-time,Robert Rodriguez's best film and not only a comic book classic,but a film classic in my opinion.Based on Frank Miller's Graphic Novels of the same name and set in a timeless Black and White Film-Noir landscape,Sin City tells three violent,Hard-Boiled stories that shows us the world of Sin City involving Marv(Mickey Rourke),a brute trying to avenge the death of his one true love,a prostitute named Goldie(Jamie King)by any means necessary in The Hard Goodbye,smooth talking killer Dwight(Clive Owen)who wants to protect a gang of hookers from corrupt cop Jackie Boy(Benicio Del Toro)in The Big Fat Kill and Hartigan(Bruce Willis)an honest cop who wants to protect exotic dancer Nancy(Jessica Alba)from a Yellow Bastard rapist named Roarke Jr. Nick Stahl)in That Yellow Bastard.There is many reasons I love Sin City and the reasons are the characters,Film-Noir dialog,Action,faithfulness to the Graphic Novels,timeless feel and visual style. True to the spirit of Film-Noir the male and female characters in the film,whether it's hardened criminals,corrupt cops,corrupt politicians,hookers or honest cops are very dark and cynical,existing in a violent world where the rules don't apply,everyone is dangerous and violence and brutality are the only way out. The three main characters(Marv,Dwight,Hartigan)are likable and you can relate in to each of them in their own way because of their motivations and reasons to why they do the things they do and you as the viewer are with Marv,Dwight and Hartigan as they go through their journey. The dialog by Frank Miller is masterful and unforgettable and said in a fast pace,quickness and wit,with Miller taking the Hard-Boiled style of Dashell Hammett and Raymond Chandler and taking it to new heights,where the characters speak in a style that is sometimes riddled with dark humor,one-liners and aggressive style. Each story(The Hard Goodbye,The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow Bastard)is terrific and unforgettable with each tale being different but just alike in tone,energy and execution that never stops until the very end. The narration is a classic Film-Noir trademark and this film embraces it,with the main characters speaking with a low-pitched,dark tone almost like the main characters are whispering in your ear almost as if you're with the characters in the film. The Action and violence in the film is well-done,brutal,bloody and over the top and fits with the style of the film and will have fans of the books foaming at the mouth. The movie's violence is stylish and over the top to the point where you are almost laughing,but be warned this film is not for the faint at heart or people with weak stomachs. What I also love about Sin City is how timeless it is,taking styles,costumes and talk from any decade and you're not sure of what time period the film takes place in. Is it the future or the past or somewhere in between time. The great thing is we'll never know. Robert Rodriguez obviously loved the material and stays true to the graphic novels with not just the dialog,but the Black and White visual style of the film. The tone,photography and visual style is beautiful,just like in the books,giving us a world where there is no sunlight and it's cloudy and rainy all the time where it is always night. The only brief time you see other colors is in red or yellow(you'll see). This movie is also one of the most faithful comic book movies I've ever seen because,like I said before Rodriguez loved the material and doesn't change anything for the film whether it's the violence,Action or dialog. You can hold the graphic novels next to the film and you won't see much of a difference between them. This movie took the words faithful and true to another level and I loved that Rodriguez stays faithful and true to the books and doesn't compromise the film and that's one of the things that makes Sin City a classic. The ending of Sin City is amazing and powerful because it's not only true to the Graphic Novels but to the genre Film-Noir with harsh violence,brutality and a tragic outcome. A terrific ending.The whole cast does a great job. Mickey Rourke is excellent and at his best as Marv,my favorite character in my favorite story(The Hard Goodbye)in the film,with Rourke bringing toughness and grit to the role. Clive Owen is terrific as Dwight,a killer who loves to help the ladies. Bruce Willis is brilliant as Hartigan,an honest cop with a moral code. Willis and Film-Noir go together well. Benicio Del Toro is delightful as corrupt cop Jackie Boy. Elijah Wood is scary as silent cannibal killer Kevin. Nick Stahl is frightening and menacing as Rourke Jr.,That Yellow Bastard. Jessica Alba is wonderful and sexy as Nancy,a girl Hartigan has to protect. Rosario Dawson is beautiful and tough as Gail,the leader of gun toting hookers. Jamie King is good as twins Goldie and Wendy. Brittney Murphy(Sheille),Michael Clarke Duncan(Manute),Carla Gugino(Lucille),Rutger Hauer(Cardinal Roark),Powers Boothe(Senator Roark),Alexis Bledel(Becky),Michael Madsen(Bob),Devon Aoki(Miho),Tommy Flanagan(Brian)Nicky Katt(Stuka),Josh Hartnett(The Man)and Marley Shelton(The Customer)give good performances as well.The Direction by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller is excellent,bringing a lot of energy and style to the film using great camera angles and moving the film at a wonderful pace. Great direction by both men. Also,Quentin Tarantino makes a special guest director appearance for the film.The score by Robert Rodriguez,Graeme Revell and John Debney is great,stylish and full with energy and fits in with the tone of this film. Great score.In final word,if you love Robert Rodriguez,Frank Miller,comic books,Film-Noir or the Sin City Graphic Novels,I suggest you see Sin City,an absolute classic of comic films and cinema and is a movie you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Truly an eye-candy experience,"Sin City is one of the first films that finally got the realism of animation/cartoon mixed with black and white film-making right. It's a visual masterpiece and probably one of the greatest of all time.Directors Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez hit this one out of the ball park.The all star cast of Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba was perfectly cast and a joy to see in this setting. Excellent screenplay and an amazing overall experience. This film is a must see!A perfect 10/10 from me!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A power-house of a film, simply brilliant. So good, you'll pinch yourself!","""Sin City"" is a modern day classic. Stylish, beautifully crafted, with an all-star cast and action scenes galore, this is a terrifically entertaining movie that takes Miller's tales and puts them well and truly on the big screen in a faithful and successful way.From the moment the film started, I was glued, awestruck, to my seat. ""Sin City"" looks beautiful, its pace is spot-on, and there's a real hook with the characters and plot. I didn't want the film to end - I've not had this much fun viewing a film since ""Pulp Fiction"".There's so much talent in this film, it's difficult to single out individual performers. Mickey Rourke's Marv is perfect casting. Watching this movie, you feel he was born to play this role. It's superb to see Rourke back on the silver screen despite his features being near-impossible to recognise.""Sin City"" has quite a high gore quotient and will appeal to those who like their comic-book violence splattered all over the screen. There are some terrifically over-the-top sequences and genre fans will be in their element watching this movie again and again.As near perfect as a comic-book adaptation will ever be. 10 blazing stars out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Visually striking but hollow,"Sin City is an experimental film seeking to bridge the gap between live action and and animation. Its main calling card is its look which it does deliver on. Shot in moody, retro black and white with occasional splashes of colour, the movie is a feast for the eyes which is just as well as there's not really much else going on. In terms of plot, characterisation and having something to say about the human condition, Sin City doesn't even make it out of the starting blocks, though it's obvious that these concerns weren't high on the filmmakers' list of priorities in the first place. The various plots are just perfunctory pastiches of vigilante/noir movies of old which service the film's visuals rather than the other way around. The actors blend into their surroundings well enough but it's hard for any of them to really shine as the characters they're playing are essentially cardboard cut-outs. The film is pretty violent and not for the squeamish but much of the violence is really of the Tom & Jerry cartoon variety with characters receiving blows which in real life would concuss or even kill them but which here merely leave them dazed for a couple of seconds. Overall, Sin City is a perfectly watchable film but is around 10/15 minutes too long and its unwillingness to engage the audience on any kind of emotional level ultimately lessens its potential impact considerably.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Simply Wow!,"For the first time ever i'm giving a movie a ten, and the reason is that i don't believe this movie could have been done better. I'll admit, i've never read the comic series, but having read them is not a prerequisite for watching the movie. If anything i'm glad i didn't know what was gonna happen next. The world in itself is simply awesome (think Seven, in that it's always dark, it's always raining and then add some extreme violence and film noir inspirations), and the way it is shot (greenscreen all the way), gives them a chance to make the background seem like a comic, and in this they succeed all the way. The acting's amazing (what a comeback for Mickey Rourke!), and it's probably the hottest cast of girls ever assembled in one movie! Jessica Alba is (as we already knew) a really promising actress and the biggest knockout I think i've ever seen. All the guys at the cinema i was at literally went ""whoa"", when she first came on in the stripper outfit! I can't wait for the DVD, when we get to see the stories, as Miller and Rodriguez really intended for us to see them, and of course the sequels that apparently will be shot back-to-back ala LOTR. I've you haven't got a weak heart or blood phobia, see this movie. You will not regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Graphic Novel was better,"Even though this was a good movie, it just didn't have the bite that Frank Miller's graphic novel had. i guess it just shows that most times, when a novel, comic or graphic novel is represented is a film format, it has to be adjusted for that very medium. for example, the novel TRAINSPOTTING, is very different from the movie, yet both the film and the book managed to capture the essential essence of what trainspotting is about. there's a similar feel, even though they're differently presented. you can't really turn an acclaimed novel into an excellent film by copying it word for word and converting that into film.one has to transform it to fit the medium of film. because what works in written word may not work the same way on film;unless of course its some rubbish that Dan Brown wrote, which reads more like a movie script than a real novel anyway. one example that springs to mind when i think about the Sin City film, is that scene where the wolf is taking a bit out of Kevin. It's almost an exact replica of that scene in the graphic novel, same picture almost. Yet in movie format, it really does not deliver as much of an impact as is does in the graphic novel form. However, i have to say that my bias is a result of my having read the graphic novel before seeing the movie, thus there were certain expectations involved. There was already a certain standard in my mind that the movie had to achieve for it to be worthy of the graphic novel in terms of quality. If i had done the opposite(seen the movie first then read the graphic novel) i might have a different opinion. however i think its important to remember which came first. The movie is merely a copy of the graphic novel, however it is in the graphic novel that the originality and genius lies.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sin City.....more like.......Sin Awesome....Yeah,"Sin City is from start to finish a work of SIN-ematic beauty. Robert Rodriguez remained true to the source material, and kept it dark and gritty. The acting is superb, except from a few of the females. The violence is non-stop and unrelenting. I overly enjoyed myself during this movie, and found myself chuckling at a few scenes. Mickey Rourke is the best part of this movie, in my opinion, this could mark the beginning of a huge career for him. This movie is not for the squeamish or weak of heart. While a few may be offended by the violence, it is a necessary evil, due to the source material. Overall, this movie was very well directed, acted, and faithful to the original Sin City comics.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The most amazing car crash ever.,"Sin City spins along like a Big White 1960 Chevy Bel Air and never lets up. The drunk behind the wheel has set the seats on fire and is running over cops and hookers. Fresh guts dangle from the bumpers and spark into the dark smoke of the broken exhaust. Bullets rip into the drunk, but it only makes him grip tighter to the wheel. As his eyes go dark, the car indiscriminately hits all the human scum stupid enough to stagger out and look. And the human scum keep firing bigger guns until the car fills up with blood and bursts into flame, only to sink into the foulest smelling tar pit just out of Sin City.A visual feast and an emotional thrill, but just one one long car wreck, but the best one ever. That is why I will give it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Straight from the comics,"If you discount the sleepwalking actors, the clunky writing, monotonous soundtrack and uninspired camera work, Sin City wasn't all that bad.Three-in-one and not a one of them was in any way anything more than an extended commercial advertising Frank Miller's misogynistic fantasies and Rodriguez's lack of inspiration.I know they were aiming to pay homage to the hardboiled detective noir thrillers of yesteryear, but Orson Welles pulled it off better (and in a shorter time span) than Rodriguez and Co. did. What we have here is all form, no substance.Fans of Miller's comic will likely lose their minds with glee over the fact that every frame, every line, every everything was taken straight from his comic books - heck, I even found myself going ""Hey! That's straight from the original 'Sin City' story in Dark Horse Presents!"" But you know what? Slavish attention to detail doesn't pay off when you ignore the big picture. It doesn't matter if Clive Owen's hair looks EXACTLY like Dwight's as Miller drew him if his lines are painful to listen to. Yes, they were taken word-for-word from the comic book, but there is a reason (or three in this movie given the different story lines) why Miller writes for comic books. A monthly serial aimed at a preteen audience in a format where words are read and not heard ahas its limitations... limitations that become all too apparent when the lines that sound tough-as-nails in black-and-white sound so laughably childish when actually read aloud.It's a beautiful movie to look at, the actors looked exactly like their counterparts in the comics, the sets (such as they were) were ingeniously and lovingly crafted - so why do I still feel like I wasted my time? Because movies have evolved beyond ten-second snippets of a man sneezing. Movies are not only the wardrobe and sets and pretty faces. They are, in a perfect world, an all-encompassing experience that give us something to look at, something to listen to, and something to think about.I looked. I listened. But I'll be darned if it gave me anything to think about other than ten different things I'd rather be doing than watching this film.2 out of 10.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
SIN CITY....IT WOULD BE A SIN NOT TO EXPERIENCE THIS NEW CINEMATIC LANGUAGE!!,"If You LOVE Cinematic ""ONIONS""......SIN CITY is Your Movie!But Before diving in... FIRST: Let us FOCUS on the Title's Content and Context...Perhaps the biggest dream of many moviegoers would be to go a movie with an expectation so astronomically high that it would be nothing short of a miracle to reach it....and then, low and behold, surpass it! Thank God for SIN CITY.... A round-trip ticket to cinematic HELL!!!Without a doubt, Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Spy Kids I, 2 & 3) along with authors Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino have created the highest impact visual experience in Cinema since The (Original) MATRIX! Part Video Game, Part Comic Strip, Part Cinematic Nightmare, (and unlike MATRIX, which really only had a handful of scenes introducing its Revolutionary 360 Degree characteristic ""Bullet-Time"" panoramic shots in slow motion) SIN CITY, from its opening credits to its last on screen seconds, speaks a new, intensely original cinematic language, which will keep you profoundly hypnotized for every second of its two hour duration!Bruce Willis, Benecio Del Toro (The Usual Suspects, Traffic, 21 Grams), Elijah Wood (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), Rosario Dawson (Men In Black II, Alexander), Jessica Alba (Never Been Kissed, Dark Angel), Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile, The Scorpion King), Brittany Murphy (8 Mile, Little Black Book), Mickey Rourke (Man on Fire, Once Upon a Time In Mexico), Nick Stahl (In The Bedroom, Terminator 3) Clive Owen (King Arthur, Closer, The Bourne Identity) and Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor, Blackhawk Down, Wicker Park), among many others, seem to present us with ""The MOTHER of All CASTS!""With such an awesomely impressive cast, I imagine that many of the actors involved agreed beforehand to receive, instead of a lump sum payment before filming...a small percentage of the box office after release and distribution. If this is true, they will make out like bandits, because SIN CITY shows up as one of the 15 or 20 highest grossing films of 2005! And if you saw a lot of Latin/Hispanic names in the above list, you are quite right.... Latinos abound in SIN CITY!Now, back to focusing on another chilling aspect of this amazing film... The TOTAL Metamorphosis of a good part of its cast. It is as if they had been transformed by a some sort of digital spell and assimilated whole onto the screen, and thusly, surpassing and supplanting the real for the surreal! So much so that I stayed a few extra minutes, at the end of the film, to analyze carefully the credits, because, and there is absolutely NO exaggeration in this comment, several actors were simply TOTALLY UNRECOGNIZABLE!But as nothing is perfect in this life, SIN CITY does have its very dark side. Generally, I hate violent movies. Unfortunately, SIN CITY sins, and SINS BIG in this area! Even, it is a relentless orgy of gruesomely violent scenes. I feel quite upset with myself for having enjoyed SIN so much!!! The only excuse I can think of to say is that perhaps precisely for its video game-like feel and quality, its resemblance to a digital cartoon, that it provided me the reaction it did! (Seemingly, it had the same effect on 90% of the audience) Anyway, the above is still a little unsettling. It left a bit of a bizarre after-taste!!Also, I must confess that perhaps, at least in the case of SIN CITY, my fervor and passion for Everything Original certainly exceeded my aversion to violence in cinema!One final note: SIN CITY, of course, is absolutely no place for kids!!!10************ ENJOY! / DISFURTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

outstanding movie,"Sin City was almost all I could have hoped for.They had to tone down some things to get the R rather than the dreaded NC-17... and at a guess a lot of the actresses have ""no full nudity"" clauses in their contracts (ie: I am certain of this for Jessica Alba)... but overall they maintained the integrity of the bleak and gritty tone of the books... and the visuals were dead on the money.It was almost perfectly as if the graphics had come to life. It is pure art. Unlike Sky Captain, which bored me to tears in spite of its visual perfection, this movie also has serious plot substance, which illustrates some very human and even philosophical truths.My only real complaint was the deadpan lack of affect the actors adopted for the voice-over narratives. I had always read the ""internal dialogs"" as having more emotive loading than was to be heard in the delivery in the movie. This was slightly annoying to me, though I recognize the resonance with old detective film-noir they were establishing.As I have been a fan of Sin City since its first appearance in DHP lo these dozen or more years ago, I cannot even begin to imagine how one who has never read the books would react to the movie. I knew 100% of the plot and over 90% of the dialog before the first frame hit the screen, so I was not surprised or shocked by anything in the movie, and saw nothing I had not long anticipated. I knew the punchlines to all the jokes, knew the answers to all the riddles, and had long been immersed in the gestalt of the world Miller had created. I cannot say how a n00b would take the visual style, the extreme violence, the gallows-humor, or the bleak plots.The thing to understand, if you are wavering about seeing this movie, is that the violence is NOT gratuitous. It is essential. Allow me to explain...The stories of Sin City are all about REDEMPTION.The protagonists are all ""bad"" people. Stained people. People who have made big mistakes, bad choices in horrid situations, people who were screwed at birth and getting by as best they can with what they have. Savages, fornicators, strippers, brawlers born in the wrong era, those who love too strongly and hate too deeply. People with little to lose but their last remaining shreds of integrity, people who stick by their friends because most of the world has ever been inimical to them. People who stand up for themselves, because NO ONE will stand up for them. People who do not flinch when the chips are down and hard nastiness is the order of the day. Such people as stop at nothing to do right by their small circle of friends.The antagonists, on the other hand, are all EVIL. Very realistically evil: corrupt, venal, gluttonous, perverse as only civilized sophisticates can be... Those who delight in inflicting pain and death not as a means but as an end in itself. Those who seek to rule others, who are offended that anything exists without their permission, who spend others' lives like a rich man spends dollars. Those who hide their evil in plain sight - dressed in the gaudy robes of false piety and social standing.The conflict between such groups as these cannot but be horrifically violent.",,Anonymous,Crime

Like reading a virtual comic book - filmmaking at it's very best,"Style and substance works equally well here. Sin City is probably one of the most impressive movies I've ever seen in terms of cinematography. It has the look and touch of a real comic book film; watching it is almost like reading a virtual comic-book. Actually, everything visual in the film is spot on, right from the editing to the direction. The film is just pure eye candy, and I seriously doubt that any comic book adaptation, besides Burton's ""Batman"", will ever come close. While cinematography is not the only main ingredient for a comic book adaptation to be great, Sin City has all of the important ingredients it takes to be a great film, meaning you don't even have to be a comic-book fan to enjoy this.For example a great supporting cast, with the likes of Michael Madsen, Elijah Wood, Benicio Del Toro, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy and Josh Hartnett. Pretty much all of them are providing great screen presence throughout the entire film. The lead roles carry the show perfectly. Despite Mickey Rourke stealing the show, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis deliver brilliant, arguably career-defining performances. The powerful narrative from both Willis, Rourke and Owen adds a lot to the atmosphere, and (on top of the cinematography and direction) makes you feel that you are actually part of the film.Sin City is hard and brutal. It is a pure comic book movie, yet it feels so realistic, both to look at but also the reality portrayed. I found myself rooting for the characters, and feeling sympathy for them despite their dark nature. To add the cherry on top, the screenplay was perfect.Art movies usually fail because they lack a certain amount of entertainment. Sin City walks a very fine line between style and entertainment, and holds your attention for two and a half hours, without a single dull moment. There's basically something for everyone to enjoy (except for minors, or for the faint of heart), but for those of us who want our comic book movies rated mature, with great writing, intriguing plot, unforgettable performances, excellently portrayed realism and absolutely terrific cinematography, this film is a milestone in the history of comic book adaptations.

"Good, but overrated","The lighting, direction and effects in this movie were all tremendous. Simply put, there is no way that this movie could have been made 15 years ago because the special effects would not likely have been capable or affordable to manipulate the shots in every single scene. I do not believe that you can hold that against a film, however, unless there is no plot to go along with the mass of effects (i.e. War of the Worlds).So it has come to this, though. Sin City certainly lives up to its name in telling a story with no real redeeming morality. Duh, it is called SIN city. For about half of the movie, I kept laughing at all of the violence because it was fairly comical. After the initial hour, though, I kept wondering if this is what our society has come to. Does it really require this much violence to keep us entertained? Even if it is not required, why do people keep asking for so much violence? I am not an advocate for any sort of censorship, but I am an advocate for personal responsibility for each individual. It is possible that I started thinking about this because the Clive Owen portion of the story wasn't really all that interesting to me.Sin City was entertaining, but I didn't fell that it was as interesting as its comic counterpart, Dick Tracy. There is a much more modern feeling to SC than there is in DT, but I don't know if that is a good thing. I found the characters and art direction in DT more interesting, perhaps BECAUSE it didn't rely on special effects. I really don't understand why there is such a mismatch between the two in ratings. Sin City was good, but I wouldn't consider it a great film. It seems to me that a lot of people like this one because it makes them seem sophisticated.

triumph of technology,"The good news is that directors Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez have brought the nihilistic noir comic to the big screen without compromising the outrageous violence.

And while the carbon-copy visuals are impressive, the movie becomes less an adaptation than a replication.

Extraordinary movie...awesome acting..incredible effects,"When i heard that the frank miller's stories was going to be adapted to the screen; i wasn't sure that it was going to work...but when i saw the movie..I just can say that Robert Rodriguez is one of the most creative and imaginative directors ever. He transported the dark and sad atmosphere of the comic to the screen of a fantastic way; the characters, the dialogues, the backgrounds; everything was almost perfect. The art direction was amazing, all the time you feel the darkness and injustice of the corrupted Basin City.At the other side we can see the characters...the heroes of the stories. Practically, in my opinion, Mickey Rourke stole the movie with Marv, the twisted and strong killer that seeks revenge for the murderer of his lost love.

A microplating of dynamic visual style over a steaming heap of trash.,"I was very disappointed. All form. No function. The stories were simple and juvenile with simplistic themes to match and almost no subtext. The acting was insincere and did little to sell the story or the setting. The audience laughed and even groaned at the horrible performances. The storytelling was ponderous and boring, catering to an overblown sense of itself, like a stupid pathetic loser strutting and boasting in an attempt to convince itself otherwise.But I see this as illustration that being a comic fan is like being a book fan or a film fan. Comics are a medium, not a story style or a genre. There are wonderful stories in comics and terrible ones. And there are some stories that work in the comic medium that will not work in cinema. I think that the only thing Watchmen and Sin City have in common is that they are not suited to cinema.Sin City might have worked on the page. I don't know. I didn't read the graphic novels. But on screen, this story was shallow and clumsy, suitable only for children or the equally unsophisticated... but with too much sex and violence to make it appropriate for them. It would seem that the appropriate demographic would be mildly retarded teen-aged boys.After two hours of boredom broken only by eye rolls, the only thing I was curious about was why the idiots that populated Sin City didn't simply walk out of it. As the credits rolled, I was glad to be doing just that.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Pretty Sick, but decent.","Sin City undoubtedly has a good premise.The revolutionary visuals,the A list cast, Rodriguez as director,and the fact its a comic book adaptation,due to the success of Spiderman etc.However this isn't your average comic book adaptation. Put simply,Sin City is sick.Alright,there's probably a lot more gruesome stuff out there I haven't seen yet,but i'm not the most easily repulsed person and I thought it went a bit far.Don't get me wrong,I don't object to a scantily clad Jessica Alba,or even a disgusting yellow guy,but the cannibalism and blows to parts of the anatomy better not mentioned here were just too much for me.To only mention this when reviewing the film however would be unfair though.Good performances come from Bruce Willis(yes,this is somehow possible),and perhaps Alba,although the sheer amount of stars on show mean some parts are clearly limited,such as that of Elijah Wood,who doesn't have a line,or Josh Hartnett.The story itself is OK,but it is difficult to take the film as a whole as the story is split into three,an understandable drawback of the adaptation from book to film.Basically three different characters pursue justice or love in a city filled with vice. Overall,Sin City is definitely something different and has its good points ,but is a bit too gruesome.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent noir,"Hey, this was noir for the 21st century! Sure the acting may ham it up a bit, but that's just aping the ""hardboiled"" style the director was aiming for. Slightly surreal elements - but hey, it's based on a comic! And as a fan of graphic novels this impressed me just as much as 300. Slightly odd choices in the casting actually work. Elijah Wood is creepy. Clive Owen is suitably rugged. (Though still needs to work on the US Accent). Alba equals very sexy. I guess Micky Rourke's continual plastic surgery finally paid dividends! The only part that doesn't really work is the whole ""Oirish"" terrorist thread - din't really work against the rest of the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Surreal Experience,"Saw Sin City tonight, and I can't remember a more bizarre movie watching experience. Five days after its release, at a 7 pm show time an hour north of Chicago, and the theater was dead. The same girl who sold my ticket also sold me my pop and popcorn. And this was a twelve screen theater complex. Two older kids walked up and asked for a a job application, but no one else was buying tickets or concessions. I walked down a short hallway to theater number twelve, and looked in. I was hesitant to sit down at first. The floor was sticky and the armrests greasy, and I saw a few broken chairs down one aisle, but what made me really pause was that it was five minutes before the scheduled run and nobody was there. I even started to walk out, just as the promos were starting, but then I saw trash left over from an earlier crowd and decided it must be a last minute kind of neighborhood. What the hell. I took the perfect seat, in the middle of the theater, two thirds of the way back from the screen. It was just me. I don't usually see movies alone, but the buzz was up. Buzz from IMDb, buzz from local radio shows, buzz from my wife who saw it on a girl's escape the night before. And still, an absolutely dead movie theater in Waukegan, Illinois. Lakehurst Theaters. Six bucks a pop, even though they charge ten bucks just a few miles down the road. Even odder, the promos were limited to one trailer, no ads, only three minutes long and suddenly the movie started. Two or three people drifted in during Bruce Willis's version of a Sam Spade narration. One person had a lights-up cell phone, even took a call about an hour into the film. She was courteous, though, and slunk down in her chair and talked quietly. Three more people walked in midway through the picture, apparently after their first choice ended. One of them was a kid, maybe eleven years old, the others his parents or guardians. They stayed ten minutes or so, which was longer than I thought they would considering the content they walked in on. Then it was back to just me and the first three, but by the time the movie ended and I got up to go, the others had already left before me. I left my trash and walked out in the hall, and still there was no one, no one in the halls between the twelve theaters, no one in the lobby but the one girl who doubled at the ticket and popcorn counter. ""Have a nice night,"" she said, and as I responded in kind, ""You, too,"" I considered that she might have been starved for social interaction. Me, too.When the theater is more surreal and dark than a movie that depends on those characteristics, it's probably not fair to rate the film, but I'll give Sin City three stars out of four, all for its cinematography and make-up and caricaturistic style. My wife compared it to Pulp Fiction, but please, baby: The soundtrack sucks, there's nothing remotely like Pulp's humor or witty dialog, and for all the names in the cast there's really no acting that rises above the make-up and flash. There is also an air of misogyny in Sin City, and, yes, violence. Tarantino used to pride himself on how his violent shock shots were more suggested than actually on-camera, but I guess the standards have changed. And where the story loop in Pulp Fiction was absolutely cool and original, it felt a little stale this time. Sure, I'll want to see it again, to figure some of it out. But next time, even if it's ten bucks, I think I'll find another theater.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Gothic show of ultra-violence.,"It's not a conventional movie. It's mixing comic book style with splatter B-movies with film-noir elements. The result is a Gothic show of ultra-violence. The characters are bizarre night creatures living in the sin under a non-stop heavy rain and stormy weather. Incredible camera angles, specially in scenes over the roofs of the skyscrapers. Comic action in the fights, the car chases and the acrobatic movements of the characters. A good tribute to Frank Miller (the man who transformed the Daredevil Marvel comic book). Predominant black and white on grey landscapes but plenty of deep red over the scenes. If you like comics, it worths. It's not recommended if you dislike the kind of Sci-Fi stories with people resisting more than five bullet into the body.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good film, AMAZING style","I just saw this film and all i have to say is wow! Not so much the acting, which for the most part was okay, but i have never seen a film done like this. It was so incredibly innovative and mindblowing. Shooting in black and white was the perfect idea, and especially adding colour for certain that dramatic effect. You know, someone's eyes, blood, lipstick, etc. It was just really cool because it was like reading a comic book..without the...reading part?Only downside to the film was that it got a little bit slow around the middle, but jeez what a story. I liked the Film Noir style narration, and the characters are all so extreme they are just so cool. Elijah Wood really freaked me out as Kevin. Brucy does a good job and so does Rourke, Del Toro, Alba, and everyone pretty much.I leave you with, see this movie, you will either love it or hate it, but it's worth the view.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Film Noir-2005 Style!,"Man, who hasn't said that ""Sin City"" was one of the best movies this year? I have not met one person that said they didn't like it. And I agree, I finally watched it.While I'm not sure if it was all that and a bag of potato chips;P, I really enjoyed the high action, story, and the visions. This movie was so uniquely made and great eye candy. The actors were so awesome to watch. I felt the 30's style of a detective type of Noir film with a hint of Kill Bill's personality. The story just fit in well together. Some questions were not answered, which is alright. I think I can leave it up to the imagination because there is a ""Sin City 2"" coming out.We are talking an all-star cast, everyone. Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Josh Hartnett, and Mickey York, just to name a few. This is a great movie.

I would recommend this for a decent watch if you want some eye candy and an exciting story.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Juvenile Revenge Fantasy,"This movie is a violent revenge fantasy for adolescents. You've got hot babes, you've got lots of blood. If that fills the bill for you, have at it. If you enjoy watching movies whose characters resemble actual human beings, stay far, far away.Since the enormously-influential ""The Dark Knight Returns"", Frank Miller (along with many other comic creators) seems to be in a race to the bottom to see how much filth and depravity he can throw into each story. Unfortunately, that's all he throws into each story. There isn't the slightest shred of human motivation, or characterization. Every single character is a bizarre caricature of extreme violence or perverse sex who bears not the slightest resemblance to any actual, live human being. I can only guess that this appeals to adolescent boys who imagine that they're watching an ""unflinching"" portrayal of the evils of the world (while they're really getting off on the hot babes who kick ass). For the rest of us, it comes off as an extreme parody that would be laughable if it didn't take itself so very seriously.Too bad, too, since the visuals are quite impressive. But they can't make up for the complete and utter emptiness that forms the center of this movie.",,Anonymous,Crime
Not bad.,"First off, I wholeheartedly agree with the critics on here who have suggested that passing off three totally unrelated short stories as a single feature length film is misleading. It wouldn't matter if the three linked up in any meaningful way, but they don't. As far as I can see, the principal male stars are all in the lap dancing club at one point. And that's it. The sad fact is that only one of the three stories is good, which is that of Marv (Rourke). This story is utterly fantastic, well shot, well told, and well paced, although the moralistics of the tale don't really stand up to much scrutiny. Certain sections of the dialogue is utterly contemptible, but for some reason they don't jar so much when the hero is so utterly likable as Marv. From the very beginning, although Marv does some pretty heinous things, we empathise and like his character far more than the other two male leads in 'Sin City', despite the fact (or probably because of the fact) that he's a monster. For some reason the utterly over the top violence that Marv commits seem to be an inescapable aspect of his character, part of his feral, barely controlled personality. This is not an excuse to explain away the excessive violence in the film, but it seems to fit in with the dynamics of this story far more than it does in the other two, where it just seems inserted for the sake of it. Marv is certainly the character with the most depth in the film, built up as he is of contrasts and contradictions. This aids the telling of this part of the story immensely.I'm not going to devote much space to discussing the other two strands, because they genuinely aren't really worth devoting much attention to. Rourke is a much better gravel and whisky voiced narrator than the other two, who really do just sound a little bit pussy, like little boys trying to talk like men. Willis' story is slightly better than the utterly puerile, misogynistic and poorly paced / plotted other story, which I would guess is justified as empowering to women, which is another way of saying we put them in sexy outfits and let them kill lots of stupid men. Because we 'respect' them ( *hollow laughter* ), this justifies us portraying them as sex objects. And the speeches where Dwight continually refers to Gina as his Valkyrie are so completely and totally corny and pathetic that it is actually insulting to the intelligence of the viewer. Furthermore, the Irish characters in this story are just feel like last minute insertions, hollowly characterised and stereotypical bad guys to put in there because all the other ones are dead and they needed to stretch the story out for another fifteen minutes by providing cannon fodder for our intrepid hero.I'm not familiar with Miller's work and as such am spared having to compare the film version to the comic, which seems to be a bone of contention with many people on here. For what it's worth though, I thought that the film looked utterly fantastic for the most part, although occasionally the darkness of the surroundings was an impediment. Stylistically, I also really liked the flashes of color, although they were usually on things totally unrelated to plot development, what there was of it.Sin City, on the whole is a classic example of testosterone fuelled style over substance, which relies far too much on conventions handed down from films like Pulp-Fiction to have much merit in it's own right. However, for me the film is redeemed by a top notch performance from Rourke, and it's awesome visuals. Not bad, could have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hard movie to rate,Visually stunning adaptation of some comic books. There's three stories in here: One has Bruce Willis as a cop trying to protect a young girl (Jessica Alba) from a rapist. Another has a grotesque man named Marv (Mickey Rourke) trying to avenge a prostitute's murder. The third has a man (Clive Owen) taking on a bunch of hoodlums (led by Benicio Del Toro) who once abused his girlfriend (Brittany Murphy). And the movie opens and end with a man (Josh Hartnett) killing a woman (?????)Visually this is incredible. It's shot in black and white with splashes of color in it. For instance...in the opening Hartnett and a woman are talking--everything is b&w except her dress which is in bright red. Really catches the eye. Also it's narrated by the various characters in tough guy prose that could have been lifted from a film noir of the 1940s. It perfectly fits the tone and visuals of the movie. Also almost all the acting is great--Willis is good but Owen is incredible and Rourke is just superb--this is a major comeback role for him. Also Rosario Dawson is strong. Only Jessica Alba and Brittany Murphy are bad.Sounds like a great movie--right? Well---I almost walked out four times.The violence in this is EXTREME--body parts are shot off or hacked off left and right and people are shot multiple times. The violence in here bothered me--a lot. Usually violence doesn't make me flinch but here I was squirming in my seat. Also all the women are portrayed as victims or vicious whores. And virtually every female character has a nude scene. I don't blame director Rodriguez for that--but I DO blame co-director and writer Frank Miller. The constant nudity gets a little bit embarrassing--the objectification of all the women disturbed me. I didn't see the guys get this treatment. The closest we get to male nudity is Owen with his shirt off. People could say that the women come off well--when they're killing people and wearing see through outfits.All this bothered me a LOT--more than it should. I'm giving this an 8 for the visuals and acting...but I can't deny it...I find this film disturbing.,8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""Sin City"" is Scintillating","""Walk down the right back alley in Sin City and you can find anything."" I recently decided to walk through the back alleys of Sin City and found a fantastically stylized film and maybe the best example of bridging the gap between the mediums of comic books and the movies. Primarily modeled on three stories from Frank Miller's graphic novels, the film brings together so many elements which leaves the audience breathless... and wanting more. There's sex, violence, revenge, kindness and anger all shot BEAUTIFULLY by Robert Rodriquez following the rampant pace and dialogue of Miller's work.When I first saw the cast list for this movie I was excited and worried; normally when this many stars are brought together the results are disappointing, but the most disappointing part of this film is having to leave this incredible world and these wonderful characters. It is so cliché to say it but it is as guilty a pleasure as watching a car wreck; the audience is so captivated by the gore and brutality and pure aesthetic perfection that it cannot walk away. If you are bored by or just interested in leaving your everyday existence, then I recommend you take a trip to Sin City, you may be surprised by how much you like it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Corny in all the good ways,"Most of the acting was almost good, most of the dialog was corny, but it is a great movie. But it is definitely a guy movie. Lots of violence and exploited female characters... but that comes with the story and the genre. The style does it all. The over all lack of color and the creative uses of white silhouettes are amazing. The characters are almost archetypes... but they are mostly played. There is not much of a story, that is why they use three in one movie but the plot has lots of good twists... I never read the comic books so every twist in the story was a surprise. I saw it in a theater with messed a up sound system and still got into the movie. Definitely worth seeing twice.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"There were 3 things I liked and 3,000 things that just sucked","What can I say about Frank Miller's, ""Sin City?"" This was the first time I ever went to a movie on a date and apologized to her for it. The hype, the ""film noir"" aspect, the ensemble, the directors, the Tarrantino guest spot, and the color scheme (black and white with a few primaries), made this look like something worth visiting. Then again, have you ever visited a relative when you were a child that had one redeeming artifact (Good cookies, Grannie's lemonade), but bored you to tears and had a horrible odor?Without a doubt, every attempt at piecing together this adaptation of a graphic novel failed like putting a straw hat over a cannon. As a 21st century guy who likes sports, beer, and action movies, even this movie had too much graphic and unnecessary violence for me. One can only stand non-stop be-headings, castrations, and cannibalism for so long before they realize that their date fell asleep for a reason. Between the gore, there was bad dialog, no unpredictable plot development, and nothing to even throw you into saying, ""that was interesting."" It just came together poorly, and what looked like a good investment for a night out, turned out to be about as good of an investment in a Yugo.I did say there were 3 things that I liked in this movie. 1.) Mickey Rourke was quite good in his role as the good-hearted torturing madman who fell in love with a hooker. 2) There was a funny scene with a skinhead thug and an arrow. 3.)

Original style,"Based on the Frank Miller graphic novel series and directed mainly by Robert Rodriguez, this has 4 stories of Basin City; The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, That Yellow Bastard and The Customer is Always Right. It's a highly stylized black and white visual with splashes of brilliant colors. It is completely unique and original. It fits the stories and the genre so well. 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' tried something similar but that one doesn't have the edge. That one felt lifeless whereas this one is overflowing with power. The actors are all embodying the old hard-boiled noir style of acting. They are successful for the most part. Mickey Rourke is the best of them all. For some reason, he doesn't seem to be acting whereas everybody else are just pretending. He embodies his character so well that it doesn't even feel like he's acting.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best comic book adaptation I've seen,"Welcome to the Basin City, also known as Sin City, where women are pretty and booze is cheap. Welcome in the Sin City, where women are deadly. Sin City, where being good means to be bad. To be good in any means possible, because the men who are bad make Manson look like a kitty cat.Whole base of Sin City, Fank Miller's graphical novels, are hard boiled, over the edge action, film noir influenced stories, in where even the most good men and women are capable of murder.The movie is told in three separate stories, which have nothing to do whit each other, expect the fact that they are based in The Sin City. Each story is too short to work as a separate film, but in three separate segments, starring different people, they give out very good image of what is Sin City: revenge of the innocent, revenge for the loved ones, protection of the innocent.Marv (Mickey Rourke) is on his way to avenge the dead of Goldie (Jaimie King), only woman who has ever loved him. Hartigan (Bruce Wills), a stand up cop in the City Of Sin, is jailed after stepping in too big toes, after saving Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) from a pedophile murderer Junior (Nick Stahl). And finally Dwight (Clive Owen) is trying to stop a war between police, the mafia and the old town hookers. As I said, these stories do not link up, even though there are some characters shown in the background of the other stories, there is minimal or none interaction between them. Each story roll in the end and after it's over the next one begins.Visually Sin City is stunning, black and white, with some colored patches in here and there, like the babe wearing a red dress in the beginning or the blue eyes of Becky (Alexis Bidel). Blood is almost in all cases white, sometimes red and in one case yellow. But the action is always brutal, and sometimes even cartoony. The flick is actually filled with dark and twisted humor. At least the people in the theater were laughing, as was I.There are lots of other stars as well in the movie, in fact the cast is impressive. All the parts are very surprising, like Elijah Wood as Kevin, a mute psychopath living under the protective wing of Cardinal Raork, played by Rutger Hauer.As for the final stars, I cannot give out ten, because there were some actors that bothered me, like Jessica Alba, who is without any doubt a beautiful woman, but her acting as Nancy left room for improvement.Sin City is the best comic adaptation I've seen to date: it sets new limits in both visual and in acting. The only thing I'm hoping, that directors wont start copying Rodriguez/Miller style mindlessly as happened whit Tarantinos style.Speaking of directors, there has been lots of commission about Tarantino being a special quest director. I found that his influence was barely visible and not the worth of the whole ruckus, it was just a marketing trick nothing more in my opinion, but it doesn't take anything from the movie: it stays as Miller's vision.

"Third One is much, much, much more than a Charm for Miller","It took about three tries, but finally Frank Miller will receive the credit he deserves as one of America's finest comic book writers after an excellent translation of Sin City to the big screen. While the other two movies (Daredevil and Elektra) tanked mainly because the directors compromised Miller's material in order to satisfy dim audiences and producers, the translation of Sin City is seamless, and while Miller deserves all the credit in the world for his amazing story that is noir at its best, Robert Rodriguez should also receive a fair share as well, as a director that perhaps is up there with fellow director and friend Quentin Tarantino. Without a doubt, Sin City is a film that will shock audiences and punch them in the mouth, but for a true fan of the crime and pulp genre, this is a film that is heaven on a silver platter.Of course, the most glaring positive of Sin City is definitely the cinematography, which should win an award at the Oscars if the Oscar guild knows any better. The fantastic mix of Black and White and color is amazing on the eye, and adds to the seedy tone of the movie, making the movie less of a big screen film, and more of a moving comic book. In addition, Rodriguez's idea of having the movie's backgrounds being completely computer-generated was ingenious, and without a doubt more of a technological breakthrough than the film that tried this method before, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Thanks to Rodriguez's idea of computer-generated background, everything from strip clubs to highways to even barns match the graphic novel exactly and give the film an even grittier feel that not even the best independent pulp film out there could give.Computer graphic can't make a movie though, and it is quite obvious from such stinkers as AI and Twister, where all the amazing special effects are only frosting on a bad cake. Yet Sin City amazingly exceeds even greater in other areas, such as acting where mesmerizing performances are given from nearly all the actors, adding onto the already fascinating story. The most breakthrough performance of the bunch is from Mickey Rourke, an 80's actor of previous fame from the also controversial film 9 1/2 Weeks. Rourke's performance as Marv is not only the best of the film, it is probably the best of his career and the best job of narrating in a film in a long time (it probably stands up there with Morgan Freeman's narrating in Shawshank Redemption even). In addition, while Marv is the tough guy that stands the most in the film, famous tough guys such as Bruce Willis, Benicio Del Toro, and Michael Madsen also give commendable performances that stand out and give extra balls to a movie that has more than enough to begin with. Clive Owen also does a decent job in the movie, but doesn't compare to the tough guys such as Willis and Rourke, making the 2nd part of the film, The Big Fat Kill, a bit tough to watch. This miscast though is only a minor problem though, for the other male actors make up for the slack, and the female tough-girl performances from Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy and Alexis Biedel surpass it by miles, making people forget all about Owen's slight miscast. Surprisingly, Biedel's performance is pretty much the most surprising of the film, for she does an incredible job of making the transition from her geeky and boring show, Gilmore Girls into an incredible movie like this and playing her role perfectly. She is definitely an actress that deserves much better roles in much more mature movies than the ""Teen"" dramas such as her newest film, ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"".Sin City is a masterpiece, no bones about it. It's a film that will get a lot of attention from angry Christian mothers about it's violence, gore and sexuality but the bottom line is, this movie is not meant to be made for children. Just like Frank Miller's comic, Sin City, wasn't made for children either. It is testament to pulp lovers everywhere, people who had fond memories of the hard-hitting in your face action from books such as ""I, The Jury"" by Mickey Spillane and ""The Maltese Falcon"" by Dashiell Hammett. However, the film is not limited to that, for it is a film that is hardcore enough for pulp geeks everywhere and mainstream enough for the casual, adult fan. Fans of cinema will adore it, bible bashes will be disgusted, but it is still an incredible film that deserves to be seen by film lovers everywhere, because it is definitely a film that lives up to the hype and goes much, much beyond.Bottom Line: Best Crime Movie ever, if you have a pulse see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Gorgeously filmed, Brutally violent","I can't say that this is the best film I have seen in my entire life but it does bring the comic book to the big screen in a spectacular manner. The screen shots alone make this movie worth seeing. This film requires some suspension of disbelief and as soon as you do that it jumps out of the screen and brings it to life. If your into comic books, even a little, you will like this movie. If you think their for geeks who play dungeons and dragons, save your money. Back to the actual look of the movie, the use of color in the film is deliberate and allows for the suspension of disbelief to continue which adds a tremendous element to the film. While the movie is in black and white, it helps to disguise the violence which happens every other second in the film. I am going to assume that the violence will be the biggest criticism of the film, and I can easily see why. I, however, would say that it truly describes the place of BaSIN City which is full of crime and evil people doing evil things and the heroes that try and make the world a better place, whether for others or them self I'll let you decide. This movie is groundbreaking in the way it was filmed and for the most part the story is intriguing and involving. I was a little disappointed with the flow of the three original stories being forced together in the film; I think they should have taken liberties from the comic books and blended the stories a bit more together. I enjoyed the film even though I didn't agree with a lot of it morally. It shows how corrupt things can become and how naive we are to react to it and blame those that may actually be in the right. Like every good comic, its good against evil, its just that everyone has blood on their hands in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Seldom so impressed by a movie,"Had to watch it twice. I felt compelled, magnetized, mesmerized. Never happened to me before. I only watched it to cool off one of the hottest nights in a long summer - and got my nightmare without sleeping.Is it technology? The movie is fully digital - and it shows in the amazing things it allows Rodriguez to do with dark Black and White and with colour details.Or is it the stories? Told in a contorted series of intertwining situations, characters and places that uncover details of each character as you watch - not unlike Tarantino's own Pulp Fiction - the apprentice besting the master.Or is it the action? Hyper-violent, over-the-top, splatter-prone, yet credible in its unfolding and never unwarranted.Is it the actors? Many among them turning in memorable performances, sometimes their best ever, including a totally unrecognizable Mickey Rourke who meets the end he was promised in Angel Heart, with a great visual twist.Or maybe the blood? It turns out White, Red and even Yellow streams, but it is unmistakeably it.Or possibly the mixture of reality and (pulp) comic strip fiction? Indeed this does to noir cartoons what Pulp Fiction did to pulp fiction: a new cinema translation that will leave a mark on cinema stories and how they are told.No. Of all the surprising features in the movie, I loved one most: an inordinate amount of extremely subtle yet all-encompassing movie quotations in the actual quotes, situations, setups, scenes, choice of actors in reference to their previous career roles, and, may I add, biographies. For example, take Rutger Hauer's rendering of Cardinal Roark's demise: isn't it a fantastic retribution for what he did as a replicant to his own creator in Blade Runner? This movie is a stunning mind-work of thousands of details merging into an epic story. Congratulations, Senor Rodriguez! What a sick imagination, Mr. Miller!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Teen boy heaven, urbane sophisticate hell","Sin City is a highly stylised, brutally violent and deeply puerile string of clichés that will appeal to gore-loving teenagers and older men who are still in touch with their inner pubescent.Its fans will say that the pictures count for a thousand words, and they are right. It does look fabulous, but the relentless corniness of the hard-boiled script often grates because it rarely crosses over from cringeworthiness into parody. It is Da-Vinci-Code bad. Teen-fan-fiction bad. It is studiously below the standard of mediocre but rarely so bad that it is funny. If you have ever played the computer game Max Payne, another graphic-novel inspired romp, you will know the standard.The plot is divided into three episodes that are mixed up chronologically but have little in common other than some locations (a bar and a red light district) and themes (an abundance of prostitutes). All are pretty simple, and two are very straightforward revenge sagas. Vengeance obviously requires a certain degree of violence, but the extremes used here are less righteous justice than a gimmick to make teenagers say: ""Whoah, did you see him rip that guy's dick off?"" I thought I was quite tolerant of film violence - at least until I saw Kill Bill vol 1 - but when one character caves a villain's head in with his fists I just felt alienated.In one sense this is a very satisfying film. It fits its stereotype perfectly. If you like hard-boiled graphic novels and extreme violence you will love it. If you like plots and characterisation, just walk away.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
"AWFUL, Save your money ... violent stylized stupidity","I can't remember when I left a theater more disappointed then I did when I was walking to my car after Sin City. I knew nothing going in about the story or the graphic novel but I knew Frank Miller's work. His crafting of both Daredevil and Batman is legendary. All I could think of as I waited for this movie to end (which I NEVER thought it actually would) was that either Frank Miller went insane after he left Marvel or else the comics code held that insanity in check.This movie isn't creative or artsy, it's just flat out bizarre. I can see why Tarentino wanted to be involved with this stupidity. Two words spring to mind when thinking of Sin City  stylized stupidity. OK, maybe three words violent stylized stupidity. This movie is only about testing the audience's tolerance for violence as EVERY actor takes an over-the-top approach to EVERY shallow character. It's nothing more then an ultra-violent cartoon pretending to be something more. How many ""tough guy"" characters can we follow around killing in spurts of blood? I enjoyed the early sexuality of the film but by the fifteen minute mark it disappears and all that's left is cartoonishly twist crap.The trailers and the TV commercials have showed EVERY frame of Jessica Alba's alleged striptease. Hard as it is to believe, there's NOTHING sexy about her character. The only redeeming factor about this waste of time was the extended nude scene of Carla Gugino who played Karen Sisco on the short lived TV show (I may have to check out Spy Kids 3 now!). Other then those two minutes, this movie was flat out awful.If this illogical and cartoony thing is any reflection of the twisted things going on in Frank Miller's mind, then I'm glad he's out of the mainstream. Save your money.",,Anonymous,Crime
High POW Factor for Audacious Thrill Ride Into Sin City,"A visually audacious movie and an unpredictably wild ride into palookaville, this is one unique film viewing experience. I am not familiar with Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" graphic novels, but my guess is that Miller, who shares a co-director credit with filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, has remained faithful in capturing the hard-boiled, crime-infested world of Basin City and its cynical inhabitants. It takes a visual cue from last year's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" by green-screening the backdrops and using digitally-produced images as the landscape, but that's where the similarity ends. Instead of Sky Captain's sepia shadings, this one is in vividly rendered black-and-white with carefully selected splashes of color (perhaps inspired by Steven Spielberg's use of a red coat in the otherwise black-and white ""Schindler's List""). It evokes the perfect feeling for its modern-day film noir sensibilities which includes pulp fiction-type dialogue and a rogue's gallery of exaggerated characters, some made up in prosthetics to make you think you've landed in the dark side of a Dick Tracy comic strip. But Miller's world feels much different, at once capturing the cartoonish, highly stylized violence of Quentin Tarnatino's films (he is identified as ""Special Guest Director"" though I'm unclear what he exactly did) and the special effects-driven black humor of Robert Zemeckis' ""Death Becomes Her"" (which coincidentally also starred Bruce Willis).The plot revolves around three separate stories that share some of the supporting characters but little more than that story-wise. Continuing to improve and deepen with age, Willis plays a tough-talking cop named Hartigan in the first one. Just before accepting his pension, he pursues one last case to save an 11-year old girl from the clutches of a murderous psychopath who happens to be the son of a US senator. The girl grows up to be a stripper, played blandly by a Lolita-esquire Jessica Alba. Completely unrecognizable as the actor who once enticed and coerced Kim Basinger in Adrian Lyne's ""9 1/2 Weeks"", Mickey Rourke portrays Marv, a contract killer who falls in love with a beautiful hooker who is murdered in her sleep. His journey in finding her killer creates the most concurrently harrowing and darkly hilarious joyride in the movie, replete with decapitated heads of beautiful women mounted on a wall, a mute psycho-killer played by Elijah Wood (stunt casting for sure but intriguing in exposing a dark side to his Frodo persona) and a comic electric-chair execution scene. Rourke is a revelation, grotesquely ugly and built like a Mac truck but strangely insightful and impervious to what happens to his character. The third story is the most surreal with a monotone-voiced Clive Owen, an almost heroic fugitive named Dwight, who saves a mouthy barmaid (an annoying Brittany Murphy) and a gang of empowered prostitutes (led by his former lover played in convincing dominatrix fashion by Rosario Dawson) from a corrupt cop. A Cyrano-nosed Benicio del Toro portrays the cop with his trademark fiery menace in what feels like a throwback to his career before ""Traffic"". Dead people don't stay dead in any of the stories, but in this one, the concept is taken to an extreme, and the clutches between Owen and Dawson amid the violence provide a surprisingly amusing touch.Everybody seems to be having a good time, and it's nice to see some otherwise under-the-radar actors get a chance to chew on some scenery in atypical roles, chief among them Carla Gugino as a perennially nude lesbian parole officer, Nick Stahl as the senator's son who becomes the comically disgusting Yellow Bastard, and in seething, whatever-happened-to-them cameos, Powers Boothe and Rutger Hauer. All the ingredients are so over-the-top that I was hoping the three stories would synthesize more than they do perhaps in the hope of a greater untapped theme. Moreover, for a movie so dependent on style to sustain itself over its two-hour-plus running time, it does feel a bit overlong and at times, repetitive in its visual elements. After all, one can take in only so many severed heads and limbs and heads shoved in toilets, as well as the inordinate amount of blood splattering in colors ranging from red to white to yellow. But no matter, as Rodriguez and Miller have fashioned something quite startling and entertaining here, a comic book come to life. Not for everyone's tastes but this is fun for those willing to take the ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
I give this 5 outta 5. no prob.,"I'm so f*n tired of those who try to make anything out of good old films, remakes, whatever. Also I'm tired of those who try to make a fancy, different movie, like Oliver Stone. This, however really got my attention. I'm not all into the background, but it doesn't matter! Even if you don't like the cartoons, you will love this if you are a true lover of cinema! It has it all, even if sometimes it's really hard to tag along, you'll get it! Although I am a big fan of Owen, the old bugger Willis did an excellent job and my old time favorite Rourke makes one of his best performances ever (He's done a lot of amazing ones), this makes for a great feature! I thought. And then I saw it. And all my expectations just crept higher after the first scene! It sort of culminated when i saw Alba in her scene, that was just about too much to bear. Even if it's a bit slow when Clive does his stuff (Da old bugger, he should be DA baddest AZ) it's still such a pretty picture of the old comics that Frank Miller gave us. And Mickey still has what we need. I just love this film. If you like Noir-movies and Noir-cartoons, you'd be a fool not to see it. It's all that and then some.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Innovative, original, gripping, unique","Too many films are described as unique or groundbreaking in some way. However when it comes to Sin City, those platitudes are well and truly deserved.Sin City is a vile corrupt cesspit of a town, where no one is innocent, even the good guys are bad, and the bad guys are truly evil. The film is made up of three distinct original stories based on Miller's novels, all cleverly interwoven, and narrated by each story's main character. This adds to the real adult comic book feel to the film. Shot almost entirely in black and white, with sporadic splashes of colour, the film is beautiful to look at, managing to capture the essence and feel of a classic 50s noir while also looking modern, thanks to being shot almost entirely on green screen. The girls and the cars are absolutely beautiful, and the guys are always anti-heroes, vigilantes or downright sick or evil.The scenes are almost frame for frame recreations of the original graphic novel source material of Frank Miller, and the characters really look their comic-book equivalents. The dialogue is superbly written, with an almost poetic quality, and all in all is extremely faithful to Miller's original work. The three stories themselves are all uber-violent and gritty tales of revenge, honour and justice (although the sentiments often prove somewhat misguided or self-defeating), and no one is entirely innocent  with the exception of Nancy, played to angelic perfection by the beautiful Jessica Alba.A superb cast make up Sin City, where virtually every single face is a recognisable one. However, the undoubted star of the piece is Mickey Rourke, who is a revelation in his comeback performance as Marv. Somehow he manages to make a manic psychopath driven by a need for revenge seem like a hero, if only because the guys he is killing are even worse than he is. Elijah Wood too is superbly creepy as the mute cannibal Kevin, and it shows how hard he is working not to find himself typecast as a hobbit. Bruce Willis, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro and Clive Owen, amongst others, are all also excellent, making Sin City a truly brilliant all-round ensemble piece. However it is not for the squeamish or faint-hearted, as the claret (and limbs) flows freely and frequently.The only quibbles are that the superb instrumental guitar riff which appears on the film's trailers and menu does not appear on the film soundtrack itself, and that the sequel is not due until late 2007! A truly brilliant film, probably the best film of 2005, (a year which also saw the release of Batman Begins and Star Wars) and a gripping comic book tale of corruption and justice, filmed in a truly unique and innovative way. A work of art, and a film that must be seen by any true movie fan. Sin City is simply a cool movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Mediocre for Rodriguez, Good for Anyone Else","I liked this movie; however, I was expecting more from the director of El Mariachi...The movie was violent and gory, but in glorious black and white so that the violence seemed a little further removed. The Marv sequence was the most fun; but, I believe that the Jackie Boy sequence was the best and most memorable. NOTHING in the movie was complex...and the plots intersect ever so slightly.Ms. Alba was the most memorable thing about the Bruce Willis sequence. Bruce Willis was just being himself...although, he calls himself ""old man"" a lot, despite the fact that he doesn't look particularly old...The images in this movie are probably the best feature.

Comic-book adaptation.Redefined.,"""Will that give you satisfaction, my son? Killing a helpless,old,fart."" ""No.Not killing.Everything up until the killing, will be a gas."" This exchange between Rutger Hauer's evil Cardinal Roark and Mickey Rourke's human bulldozer Marv makes it pretty clear that in this movie, happy ending is no option.It's never gonna happen, 'cos we're talking about a world where only two sides of the law exist:bad side and much worse side.All characters are redemption-less, with the exception of Jessica Alba's angelic stripper Nancy, and even if we sympathize with these fellas, we know they had it coming if something bad happens.Sin City is the first literal adaptation of a comic-book:panels are recreated shot-for-shot, dialogs are directly transposed, the black and white town is entirely CG so it will look just like Frank Miller's astounding graphic novels.Miller and co-director Robert Rodriguez don't hesitate when it comes to showing disgusting or surreal situations: pedophilia, castration, cannibalism, talking corpses, several mutilated bodies, nothing is left behind, as we witness an ordinary day in the lives of Sin City's ""heroes"".The ensemble cast is simply awesome: Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson, Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl, Alexis Bledel, Michael Clarke Duncan, Benicio Del Toro, they're all perfect. But the real STANDOUT is Mickey Rourke: his Marv is a brutal,sadistic,gladiatoresque psycho, but he's got a heart, and that's why we eventually end up loving him. Rodriguez has done to Rourke what Quentin Tarantino did to John Travolta with Pulp Fiction.Fitting comparison, since QT guest-directed this movie's most hilarious and weird sequence.In the movie Marv says""Hell is waking up every morning and not knowing why you're there."" Well, these guys know why they are in Sin City, and their return is already highly anticipated.Bring on the sequels!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"We've All Seen It, We've Oo'd, We've Aah'd, But Does It Hold Its Own With The Company It's In?","Everyone loves Sin City because not only is it an epic of blood-drenched action and sick, twisted violence and subject matter, but also filmed in black and white with specifically chosen and very richly realized colors and boasting both a cast riddled with names and faces we all love but the two directors that have delivered more on the super-cool blood-and-guts pulp entertainment level this generation than any other director. Well, as someone who has followed the careers of both directors, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, for nearly all of my life, I will say that I'm not impressed with Sin City at all. It is entertaining on the most basic level: It's sort of fun to watch when you're in a hotel and you're waiting for the other people you're with to wake up and it happens to be on TV. That's how much of an impact Sin City really has.Let's take the cinematography Rodriguez is applauded for so, with the black and white sprinkled with color placements. Steven Spielberg did the exact same thing with Schindler's List, which was filmed entirely in black and white and had a single scene wherein there was one girl in a jittering crowd of many whose dress was chosen to be pink. This meant something as well. I'm not saying that Sin City should be compared to a film like Schindler's List, because Sin City is all about style, and that's fine. Many of our greatest entertainments are only exercises in style. But Schindler's List actually filmed. Sin City was shot with a regular camera on Rodriguez's little pet blue screen and fed through a machine so the black and white with the colors can all be added later. The difference is so loud and clear I'm almost deaf. Can no one see how campy Sin City really looks? It really looks goofy sometimes. Take the image where Mickey Rourke is swimming from the duct under the river as an example. The majority of the film really does not look so cool.I understand that Rodriguez's intention was to create an exact cinematic replica of Frank Miller's original graphic novels. Well, that's fine. But why not make it a cool-looking cinematic replica? Rodriguez needs to learn to make movies like a real filmmaker makes movies. Real filmmakers know how to take risks by spending a little money, going to a real set, driving a real car, squibbing things instead of adding bullet holes later. Filmmakers are not little computer geeks having fun in their technologically converted garage in Austin, Texas. They're bold people who want to capture something intense or powerful, something personal that they imagine. Not some fluffy image anybody with that computer program could churn out. There is no talent in what he does. I am tired of him.The voice-overs delivered by the film noir caricatures that populate this movie are like the fragmented, raspy-voiced, overzealous voice-overs during movie trailers. Also, they go way too far explaining what characters are thinking. If we're watching the movie, we should be able to figure certain things out without being baby-stepped through it. It truly gets aggravating to hear Bruce Willis's voice narrating himself through getting up off the floor. Just get up off the floor. And some of these characters speak like grungy Dashiell Hammett types from New York or L.A., and some sound like Midwestern or Southern high school drop-outs with really bad grammar, and some speak in dialect that can only be found in its purest form in superhero comic books. What region is this Sin City in?! Or Basin City, as it is called in the film.Like I said, the film is very basically fun to watch. You stop over at your friend's house, and he and some other dope are watching Sin City, so you sit down and finish it with them, because that's exactly what you came over to do: Hang out. So let me tell you the good points of this film: Benicio Del Toro and Clive Owen, both very natural and very becoming in their roles, and also the perfect hero-and-villain match-up. Rosario Dawson, in quite a change of pace, is the highlight of the very conveniently male-pleasing female portion of the movie. Another good touch is Josh Hartnett's performance. In fact, I think his very small role, which is given zero backstory and the slightest indications, is perhaps the most clever of the entire ensemble.Tarantino's little guest director scene is an interesting little bit but not at all distinguishable from the rest of the movie. Really, if you know the scoop, you know that Rodriguez invited Tarantino as a guest director so that he could try to prove to him that blue-screen and CGI film-making techniques are better than hands-on techniques. Notice that Tarantino did not convert.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worth going to hell for. Amen.,"I will say this once, and preach it until the day that I die, but if Criterion does not pick up this title, I may  just maybe  loose faith in their choice of films. This was, hands down, one of the most stylish and innovative films to come out of Hollywood to date. The graphic mind of Frank Miller with the candy-violence ways of Rodriguez coupled together created an undeniable force of creativity and passion that continually lack in the over-budgeted Hollywood films. I have read several reviews that boast the cinematography of this film as being way before its time (thus the apparent lack of support at the box office), but while I did think the way that Rodriguez filmed this movie was outstanding, I thought that it was more than just a visual treat. Everyone in this film seemed to be giving more than what I bargained for. From the direction, to the actors, to even the darkened themes that resonated loudly throughout the film, Sin City was perfection to they eye, but also in every other critiquing category.What captivated me more than the visual eye-candy was the overall story of Sin City. Rodriguez and Miller both chose to keep the original narrative from the graphic novels to help tell the story that they had filmed. Not only did it help us get from point ""A"" to point ""B"" of the story, but it also helped us learn about the characters without the indecent flashback or long speeches. I learned more about the inside of Marv's mind through the battles that he was having with himself than with any other technique that could have been used. I think that brings me to another reason this film worked on more levels than anticipated, because I knew the characters. This is a character driven story. While they to commit graphic scenes of violence, it is the characters that literally steal the show. I can only think of a handful of films (mostly Wes Anderson movies) where I felt like the characters were the central focus, not explosions or sex. While these things surrounded our characters, it was the characters (the strength of the actors) that kept my eyes on the screen.Continuing with the story, one cannot help but be impressed with the consistency in Miller's stories. The overall themes of each of the stories, while told in different voices and situations were all the same. The theme of love, lust, and revenge seemed to follow all of our characters around the city and surprisingly, it worked. I was never more impressed to see the same themes reworked over and over. Love is huge in this film. Each character has a passion, or a love for someone else, which drives them to the brink of madness. With each character's love followed a moment of revenge. If you look at all three stories, the main narrators are fighting for someone that they love to bring justice to those that did this one person wrong. ""Revenge is a dish best served cold,"" they say, but in the case of Miller's pen, he serves it hot and heavy. Finally, there is a moment of truth with each of the stories. I didn't realize this until I had spent several days thinking about this film, but in each of Miller's stories we are not shown the full truth. It is a one sided story where we see the action through the eyes of the main narrator. We are only shown one truth, instead of jumping back and forth between good and evil. I really liked this because it created a sense of distrust in Sin City. Were the guys that we were cheering for really the ""good"" in the equation, or were they just all elements that created the chaos known as Sin City? Marv's story in particular exemplifies this idea. His blurred vision of reality resonated through me as the film continued to the other stories, and made me question several of the ""endings"". Think about this when you see it again (and possibly again and again) because remember, the title of this film is Sin City, those that reside in it are not always the ""good"" in the ""good vs. evil"" equation.Finally (and I know I have mentioned it already above, but I want to honestly put it aside from everything else), I would like to recognize the caliber of acting that came from our actors. Here we have the best in the industry proving that they can handle the pressures of a huge budget, yet also place 100% of their heart into a smaller scale. Their ability to create this noir-styled picture and stay with the style created back in the 40s was impressive. The 40s released some of my favorite films, and these actors paid a huge homage to them. Some will argue that the dialogue is choppy and humorously bad at times, but I say that you need to explore some of the 40s crime noir films and see that they are just building on an already beautiful structure. Everyone involved in this film was outstanding. I cannot think of one character that I disliked or thought could have done better. I think it is the fact that I have to give credit to Rodriguez for revitalizing the careers (and showing the world what amazing older talent we have) of Rutger Hauer, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Powers Boothe, and Michael Madsen. These guys proved that they are some of the heaviest hitters in Hollywood. Also, Sin City proved that Clive Owen will be in Hollywood for a very long time and will soon have every award imaginable. He is my new Hollywood God.Overall, and if you couldn't tell already, I thought this was a perfect film. Criterion, this film is all yours.Grade: ***** out of *****",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

My only big beef with the movie is how the 3 separate stories are placed together on screen. I didn't feel the connection with the other characters like I did Marv, and I blame Frank Miller for that. He had the entire movie storyboarded out and Rodriguez followed it to the letter. As a comic book this story works, but on screen people are owed better story structure and placement. He did tie all 3 stories into the main one, but only in a cheap way. Instead of a beginning, middle and end, he worked it similarly to the ""pulp fiction"" format. Now I'll be the first one to say the Rodriguez knows more about Directing then Tarrantino ever will, however Mr T is still the dialog and story teller master which is why pulp fiction worked.Overall this movie has all the visuals and violence that serious comic book movies need to get the point across.

More Parody Than Pastiche,"SIN CITY (4 outta 5 stars) Sin City is a very amusing film... a sampling of some of Frank Miller's Sin City comics some time ago never gave me an inkling that it was supposed to be *funny*. It always struck me as a slavish, fan-obsessed regurgitation of Mickey Spillane (with the gritty realism eschewed in favor of whatever bizarre costumes or weaponry Miller felt like drawing that day). The movie of Sin City seems to be more of a parody of those film noir clichés than a mere pastiche. It's funny... but without being overly silly. The movie is made up of three separate ""stories"" all of which follow the same essential pattern: big, brawny guys getting beaten up and repeatedly shot in order to protect a dame. The movie is very anti-PC... men are men and women are babes and the only real love can be between a man and a little girl. These subtexts that run through pretty much ALL of modern ""tough guy"" fiction are mercilessly trounced by the deliberately ham-fisted dialogue and overwrought situations that make up this film. It's the performances that really sell this concept though. Mickey Rourke in particularly makes the most outrageous pulp dialogue sound like poetry as it wafts from his rough-hewn voice-box. Clive Owen and Bruce Willis also add subtle dimensions to their own takes on the same character. Benicio Del Toro and Michael Clarke Duncan have some of the greatest villainous voices ever heard in film. (And it's particularly nice that Del Toro's character is still heard from even after his demise.) The women of ""Sin City"" are basically eye candy... but somehow Carla Gugino, Rosario Dawson, Alexis Bledel and even Jessica Alba are able to come across as more than just pin-up girls. Interesting direction by Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino (who did what? who knows?). I had doubts about the over-use of digital effects to beef up the action... but with a couple of exceptions (where the on screen action looked like bad video game graphics) the CGI worked pretty well.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Sin City, the Blade Runner of comic book films.","I just returned from the March 18, 2005 press screening of Sin City shown at the awesome Senator Theater in Baltimore, MD. Sin City will go down as the Blade Runner of comic book films. The film had an amazing feel to it and combined many visual styles to create a new filmic language. All the elements of a film noir action film were present: dimly lit scenes, monotone voice over narrative, and exquisitely placed one-liners.I am not very familiar with comic book art, but the film used a bunch of familiar elements. Bad guys eyes were masked behind opaque glasses lenses and the scenes with characters driving looked like the comic cell where the car is speeding off into the distance. Limited splashes of color are used to accentuate key parts of the film or characters that will drive the rest of the story. The film is like nothing that has come before it and I am sure many will try to follow its lead.The acting is great with no single character stealing the show. The makeup is amazing and even though the actors are often performing superhuman feats, the scenes do not poses any of the silliness of a film like The Hulk. Everything on the screen is believable because it is taking place in a comic book setting where anything is possible. Rodriguez crafts a world never before seen on film. He polishes it all off with a soundtrack is not at all intrusive and helps build the mood of the film.Rodriguez stays true to his art form and except for a massive continuity flaw with blood on Mickey Rourke's chin and mouth appearing and disappearing, he keeps the film moving along seamlessly. Elements of past films have been placed through out the film. One pivotal scene begins at a loading dock that looks exactly like the one in the Matrix just before Cipher drops the cell phone in the trashcan. The wrap around storyline echoes Pulp Fiction beautifully. Rutger Hauer's scene looks like it could have come off the cutting room floor of Blade Runner. Rodriguez pays homage to those that came before him and provides us with numerous familiar visual elements.Sin City will probably flop in theaters just because everything edgy and new generally does. Dennis Miller once appeared on the Ben Stiller Show and said, ""I love your show; you are doing cutting edge stuff. How long until it gets canceled like mine did?"" Sin City will have a massive cult following and influence many future films. Years from now it will get the recognition that its due. Rodriguez stays true to his beliefs and even resigned from the Director's Guild of America to make sure Frank Miller just credit as co-director. There should be more people like him in Hollywood. Sin City is far better than any Spider Man or Daredevil junk that has been produced in the past. Who knows, maybe people will even go rent Roadracers to see where that Rodriguez guy was coming from early in his career.Catch Sin City in the theater as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Visually innovative truly - story vast and flat. But as comic book adaption: great!,"I thought I needed to see this visual masterpiece as a mystery film genre set designer. Visually it is super innovative and I am really in awe with the digital sets, the lighting, the cinematography and the color key technique. The urban setting was splendidly executed! It really gives a strong feeling of watching a graphic novel complete with panels and the right feel of dark ""sin city"".
Apart from that, it is clear that these kind of comics thrive on voyeurism, cruelty, death, sex and crime. Sometimes for the pure entertainment, sometimes to criticise the dark sides of human nature. Nevertheless, I could not find any deeper meaning inside the story, but it might just be me.

Too much for me...,"I went to ""Sin City"" expecting a slick film noir crackling with sharp dialogue and arresting black-and-white imagery. What I got was a monotonous slop of gore, fast cutting, cartoony action scenes, and lame one-liners that sound like Raymond Chandler's unused cast-offs. In other words, I wanted a Bogart movie, and what I got was a sicko movie. Tarantino and Rodriguez are, quite frankly, beginning to scare me.I like violent stuff when it's well-done. Really, I do. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a masterpiece. But that movie actually has proper characters and suspense and style. ""Sin City"" doesn't pause long enough to have suspense, a meaningful scene, or even a meaningful moment. The male protagonists are all interchangeable - grizzled guys with a penchant for helping fallen women - and the villains are all equally repulsive and dull. There are so many scenes of violent revenge-taking that the whole thing becomes tedious; I was never satisfied by the ""payoffs"" because I was never emotionally invested in the proceedings. The film is figuratively monotone, as well as literally.And, needless to say, the treatment of women is repulsive.Did I appreciate the style? Yeah, but it got old, like everything else. At the end of the day, this is nonsense. Come on - there's an evil guy who manages to regrow his penis, but it turns him yellow and rancid. That's not noir...that's not stylized...that's not interesting. It's gross and stupid. Like the whole movie, then.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
could steal your soul - the result of arrogant pretension,"I had written a review and left it at work. Now i have the urge to comment, so here's a short version of the review. Weirdos, but particularly Mickey Rourke, hyperkill a bunch of people.Mickey Rourke hyperkills someone again, then, uh, Mickey Rourke hyperkills someone. Various violent sociopaths and demented victims say brainbeatingly dumb crap in hyperlurid noir-talk, which could kill your brain cells and steal your soul.As Joe Bob Briggs would have said, it has blood,breasts, bimbo-fu, mutant-fu. So, maybe it has bad-movie charm, right? No such luck. It's not live action, which changes a lot and, much worse, it seems to have been made to be in some way, art, so instead of being able to smile at how goofy and awful it is, you're very cheesed off, then overwhelmed by the arrogant pretension of the sadists who gave us this steaming celluloid turd.Watching this movie is like whizzing in the wind and then proclaiming ""damn i love being this wet and smelly!""You are warned.",,Anonymous,Crime
Bruce Willis has really let himself go...,"Here I was thinking a cast with so many acclaimed stars must make for a great film, but in truth, this was one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen (and coming from a man who has seen the likes of Dreamcatcher and Fear of the Dark, that is saying a lot). I was scrolling down the top-rated movies on this site and was appalled to see this up there in slot #63. There it was among such classics as Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and The Shining. Quentin Tarantino is losing his reputation with the Kill Bills and Hostel, and Bruce Willis is letting himself enter a career-threatening spiral of mediocre films with Hostage and 16 Blocks. And this after working his way up to the rank he did with such films as Pulp Fiction, Die Hard, and The Sixth Sense. The only real attraction to this piece of work is Jessica Alba's pretty figure. Needless to say, when Sin City 2 is released, there will be one less viewer.Terrible: 2/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Clearly one of the best movies ever,"Sin City, unlike other movies, has a feel to it that stays with you all the way...One of the best comic adaptations indeed. Its a symbol of one of the best performance by actors. To me this film deserves to be nominated for a coupla academy awards. The action as well as the violence and gore are just what make this movie more influential than ever. Personally my favourite character in the movie would be Marv, played by Michael Rourke, indeed the best suited for the movie and someone I can relate to. Unlike other adaptations, this movie seems to be very carefully done so as to keep it as fair as possible to the book and include everything.

If the word dark were a film,"Sin City = 10/10Positive:-The film brings together a great cast who fill their characters with a lot of joy.-The characters are dark, stand between good and evil and act dirty. There are no nice people in this film, which is brilliant. Each character is morally ambiguous and has their own backstory and reasons for being so cruel.-The film is a feast for the eyes. Every shot is a painting and stays in your head. The game plays with colors that always stand out from the black and white images. The tracking shots and shots often look like a comic panel. The film is incredibly aesthetic.-The action and violence in this film is cruel and vulgar. Every punch hits and the blood squirts in the most creative way. Violence is like art in this film. No murder looks cheap, every shot and blow is staged perfectly and the camera stays on it.-The plot is brilliant. The different stories from Sin City pull you into a cruel and dirty world. The film is an homage to film noir and plays with various elements from Hollywood. Topics such as prostitution, morality, good and evil, corruption and pedophelia in upper class circles. It is a disgusting, chilling and dark act that showcases the atrocities and scum of humanity.-Sin City is unique and creates an oppressive and brutal atmosphere, but is never too serious for a second and also knows that it is a comic film. It is intentionally exaggerated in order to present the human depths more clearly.-The film is the perfect comic adaptation and films every image perfectly.Negative:/Conclusion: The film is more than it seems at first glance. It is not just a bloodbath, but rather deals with social and political issues in a highly artistic way and creates a dark and cruel world that fascinates.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Stylish, if not much else","For pure visual presentation, Sin City is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. It does a beautiful job of brining a nourish comic book sensibility to life, with a fascinating use of color.And at first that and the movie's sense of degenerate cool is enough. As cop Bruce Willis goes after a psycho killer, the wit and the grit create a fascinating heightened version of film noir. I spent much of the movie wondering how one would describe it. It's not film noir, because it's so excessive, but while it is excess to the point of parody, it's not comical, and often the over-the-top grimness work.Because it is so over-the-top, the movie can slip into stupidity and a simplistic view of the world that is in many ways the antithesis of classic film noir. The film shows its worst is a sequence involving the prostitutes of old town, which with its Irish mercenaries and Kill Bill-styled assassins is just plain silly. And the movie tends to wear on you, because it's pretty much the same thing over and over.Still, it's high-cinematic cool pushes the rating from a 5 to a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Comic based movie ever!!!,"OK, so the first thing that i have to say is WOW!! I went into the movie not knowing much, and was just absolutely blown away. Both technically and acting wise, this movie was superb. Watching the beginning, I knew that Robert Rodriguez directed it, and was happy, for, i liked From dusk till Dawn. But sitting in the theater i was very excited when i saw that Tarantino guest directed. So, for those of you who have not seen the movie, get ready, it definitely has Tarantino flavoring. Now, if you do not like Tarantino, don't not go see the movie. He brings to the screen an artistic side of things. That being said, the plot itself is very cool. It follows the lives of three people in BAsin City. It twists from cops, to old hit men, to defending prostitutes. And it does it with flair. The movie does run long, however, it is well worth it. For in during the duration of the movie, there are many many many one liners, that will, i promise, have you in stitches. So without further ado, i tell all of you, go spend the 8 bucks to see it. It will be money well spent.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Visually appealing, but hard on the ears","If you don't mind terrible dialogue and only mediocre acting, then sin city is your movie. The visuals are everything that make this movie worth seeing, but a better script and acting could have made it great. Rodriguez's insistence on make a film as quickly as possible limits the actors' abilities to produce good work, and his script work is more like copying lines for detention, as the dialogue is straight from the graphic novels and that is obvious in the movie even if you haven't read them. Furthermore, the story revolves around four or five different stories which only have a connecting link of taking place in the same city, and are not interconnectable. All in all this movie is worth seeing for the use of digital film technology and Rodriguez's ability to tell an action packed story. However, the dialogue is cheese and the lack of a cohesive singular story make the movie difficult to sit through.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Great adult movie,"I am just back from seeing Sin City, a movie adapted from graphic novels (for that read adult comic books) by Frank Miller. The movie was shot and edited like those graphic novels as well. Mostly in black and white with a few bright red, bright green, bright yellow and fluorescent whites thrown in to catch the eye. The whole effect worked very well I thought to focus our minds on what was important in the shot and to add to the gritty feel of Sin City. It is a real Tarrantino-esque kind of movie, lots of blood, over the top violence and semi-naked women. It is also a throwback to the old days when the anti-hero was in, these people were all bad they were just not as bad as the folks they were killing. The movie was a series of stories all loosely connected to one another by people in the periphery. I actually quite enjoyed it though I am sure it had no redeeming value at all. There were plenty of sarcastic little comments scattered throughout that made me laugh out loud and it was shot so that no one could take the violence seriously. If you liked Kill Bill you will like this I think. Tarrantino is a ""guest director"" and there were two other guys - Frank Miller & Robert Rodriguez - listed as the real directors. I highly recommend it but not for any kiddies at all",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

As a movie it's hard to really rate it so highly, but this film can't be judged like other movies, this is a new strange cinematic beast. I give it 10 for the sheer audacity of the film-makers. If only Kubrick were alive to play with these new cinematic toys, what on Earth would he conjure up?

An anthology film that centers aroound sex and murder.,"I've never been a fan of anthology films. I like short films, but I don't understand the reason to package them together with some very loose tie. In ""Sin City,"" the link among all the segments is that they take place in Basin City (not Las Vegas), a fictitious city in the west, not the one in Washington state. The city is nicknamed Sin City. It's a crime-ridden place, and the segments each focus on some murder, kidnapping or other scandalous occurrence in this city. At one point, I thought the movie had circled back onto one of the segments, and was therefore going to tie everything together. I don't mind an anthology film as much if it doesn't something like that. Then I realized that portion was merely acting a sequel to the earlier segment. It's a gritty film, and done in a neo-film noir style. 
 This film is base on a series of graphic novels set in this city. In an attempt to duplicate the artwork in the novels, this movie is in black and white, with only occasional splashes of color, usually red. In many scenes, often those that are particularly bloody, anything red is colored in, presumably to symbolize sin. The common sins that seem to pop up in each segment are sex and murder. There is one character that is colored yellow (not I caught the symbolism behind that), but again this duplicates the artwork in the graphic novels. Well known actors make appear in some of the segments such as Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood. A raked up a ton of nominees and wins in various festivals for the film as a whole, for cast members and for technical aspects; but it was not recognized by any of the major film awards such as the Oscars, Golden Globes or BAFTAs. It's an artsy film, and most of the individual segments were entertaining. It's biggest drawback was that it was an anthology film.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ink and Intrigue,"Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, this film is a visually stunning dive into the gritty underworld of Basin City, where the shadows are darker, the dames are dangerous, and the guys are grittier than a sandpaper sandwich.It adapts Miller's graphic novels with a dedication to recreating the look and feel of a comic book. It's like someone took a black-and-white comic and injected it with a shot of adrenaline. The high-contrast visuals, stark silhouettes, and occasional splashes of color create a visual style that's both cool and menacing.Sin City is essentially a collection of interconnected stories featuring a cast of morally ambiguous characters. You've got Mickey Rourke as Marv, a hulking brute with a heart of gold (or at least tarnished silver), Bruce Willis as Hartigan, a hard-nosed cop with a sense of justice, and Clive Owen as Dwight, a guy who's smoother than a fresh jar of peanut butter. Its narrative is a bit like a jigsaw puzzle, with different pieces falling into place to reveal a broader picture. Each story has its own tone, from hard-boiled detective noir to an over-the-top revenge thriller. It's like the ultimate mash-up of pulp fiction genres, and the result is as unpredictable as it can get.The film's dialogue is a mix of hard-boiled detective clichés and razor-sharp one-liners that hit you like a punchline you never saw coming. It's a verbal rollercoaster of tough-guy talk and femme fatale sass. The action sequences are like a choreographed ballet of brutality. The violence is over-the-top, stylized, and delivered with a certain flair that makes you wince and appreciate it at the same time. Sin City doesn't hold back when it comes to exploring the darker aspects of human nature. It's a neo-noir fever dream that revels in its own darkness, and you're along for the ride, whether you like it or not.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Decapitations, severed limbs, mangled penises, buckets of blood, hatchets in the face, viciousness toward women (and a child), lots of nudity (okay, that part wasn't so bad!), cannibalism, pedophilia, a drooling yellow devil...shall I go on?It's one of the worst--no, wait, it's THE most violent/gory film I've ever seen on the big screen. However, it's all done in a stylized comic-book way--the blood is white instead of black. Otherwise it would be too graphic and sickening.Sin City had some dark humor.

"Great style, needs writing","""Sin City"" has great style, and the literal translation of graphic-novel to film is great. I'm fascinated with the blurring of the lines between comic/cartoon/live action/computer game, and visually this one makes it. The fault here is with the writing: too much sophomoric and wildly implausible dumbness. Quentin Tarantino avoids this in his own films: he makes his almost-cartoon characters work because he knows how to combine the surreal with the utterly commonplace. He does that with the story and he does it with the characters. Also, he knows when to be ironic, and when to play it straight. I saw little of this in ""Sin City"", despite Tarantino's involvement with it. The one good line in the movie has to be Tarantino, though, where Clive Owen describes what Devon Aoki does to Benicio del Toro. (You'll see why.) Some good performances: Benicio del Toro all the way over the top; Nick Stahl as a castrated proto-Ferengi child molester; Mickey Roarke (for real!) in way too much makeup but playing an Arnold Schwarzenegger character in the idiom of Mike Hammer - irrationally, it works. Powers Boothe and Rutger Hauer stole every scene they were in - wow. Lots of stunning but eminently forgettable women with seriously chapped butt-cracks. (You'll see why.) Bruce Willis was good, but his character is so implausible, even for a live-action cartoon character, that it doesn't work. Elijah Wood as Kevin and Devon Aoki as Miho needed to hook up--Miller et al missed an opportunity there. (You'll see why.)",,Anonymous,Crime

"Courageous, Smart, and a Hell of a Good Time","Before I saw this movie I had never heard of Frank Miller's Sin City and after the first time I saw it I am a fan. The characters grabbed me with their sleek way of going around town their dialogue...OH THE DIALOGUE!!!It is read just like a comic book. It's perfect! The combination of narrating and actually speaking to one another flows beautifully. The three stories intertwine slightly and leave nothing behind. The three characters in focus are Hartigan, Marv, and Dwight played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen respectively. The three men have run ins with others notables like Jessica Alba, Nick Stahl, Elijah Wood, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, and many more. All with qualities that define themselves, just like a comic book or graphic novel character in this case.The color choices are interesting. The majority of the movie is filmed in black and white, but certain items or features are colored in. Marv's pills are in color, as is the sky at one point when it becomes blood red. Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez did the stories justice.What makes this movie stand out ahead of all other comic book movies is the fact that it is set up like a comic book. The way the characters seem invincible and don't fear anything except to fail in their quest. These guys aren't super heroes either. They are just some of the people of Basin City, a town where anything goes...for a small price.With so many memorable characters and lines from this movie, there is no telling how much of an impact it will make.

Sick but Sensational,"I feel guilty for loving this film, but there you have it. ""Sin City"" is ""Pulp Fiction"" with even less redeeming moral value. If you're easily offended (pretty much by anything), stay far away. Otherwise, sit back and revel in this movie's noir-soaked atmosphere.I've not read the Frank Miller graphic novels upon which this film is based, but I've seen the illustrations, and I have to say that ""Sin City"" triumphs in bringing the look of the comics to the screen. I'm not usually a fan of style over substance (I seem to be one of the few that thought last year's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" a dismal failure), but I could have watched Frank Miller's and Robert Rodriguez's stunning monochrome compositions all day. Not since Dorothy opened the door of her house on to a Technicolor Munchkinland has black and white cinematography been juxtaposed to color more effectively. The CGI effects are flawless, and a terrific and audacious pulpy score pulses throughout the entire film.Three equally bizarre stories are interlinked, again a la ""Pulp Fiction,"" and brought to life by a cast of not-quite-above the title stars: Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen, Nick Stahl, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood (creepy as hell!), Michael Clark Duncan. The only box office actor is Bruce Willis, who plays a role that fits him like a glove, that of the melancholy hero past his prime who wants to prove he's got one more knockout punch in him before he's KO'd for good.The only reason this film rises above cheap titillation is that everyone involved with it commits 100% to a common vision of what the film should be. There's something admirable about the way the filmmakers refuse to compromise their (admittedly) disgusting visions to appease the moral conservatives, or to get a lesser rating, or to make more money at the box office.

"cinematic redemption in a world of ""Sin""...","In ""Sin City,"" director Robert Rodriguez remedies the problem that cripples many a comic-book adaptation: the appeal to reality. While faithful in regard to character and plot, many are too afraid to plumb the depths of a world warped into a full-blown perversion of our own, thus denying the finished product its eyeteeth and turning it into a mere distraction instead of a transformative experience that makes our concept of reality seem pitifully dull by comparison. True to its title, ""Sin City"" is a visionary epic rife with content so vicious that its true impact doesn't settle in until the movie is over. Set against a noirish, black-and-white background (with blood appearing as red droplets or inverted white splotches), the film grips you from the first frame and doesn't let go for 2 hours. The random insertion of color seems almost a parody of ""Schindler's List""--red blood, a rainbow of rain splattering a windshield, the yellow gore of a grotesque creature; these details are like traces of reality settling into a fantastic world, awakening the id-controlled demons that lie suppressed in many. These touches infuse ""Sin City"" with a dramatic pulse that is complemented by its throwback to 1940s film noir style. When the movie began, I was on my guard and a little defensive about what it might hold--some high-gloss adaptations expend a wealth of stunning visual style, yet are poor in story and character; ""Sin City"" is an example of the opposite--while the film follows 3 separate story lines, the main characters are well-drawn, supporting players sparkle, and plots twist with playful frequency. The vignettes consist of a hulk avenging a prostitute's murder; the accidental killing of a crooked cop that threatens a turf war; a detective's quest to save an earlier victim from a psychopath reincarnated as a yellow-faced monster. Contrary to (or perhaps irony inspired by) the film's title, each story suggests a desire to reform that leads to decisions which finally bring about closure, and, in a way, redemption for the characters. Even the narrative gimmick of having the film bookended by an ambiguous character (referred to only as 'The Man' in the closing credits)suggests that the random encounters in our lives account for more than we realize.""Sin City"" is Robert Rodriguez's most controlled cinematic work to date; even amid its fantastic chaos, he shows a maturity lacking in his previous films--whereas ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" were as loud and bombastic as they were hollow, ""Sin City"" succeeds in moments of quiet reflection, slick voice-over narration, and grizzled facial expressions. The world these flawed characters inhabit is drowned in unpleasantness and death, yet is transfixing in its own hideous beauty--in an era of pulpy, disposable filmed fiction, ""Sin City"" lends both comics and cinema fresh credibility.

I can say that they have done their best to make the characters become alive in your mind. The best idea here is, nevertheless, the black-and-white shapes of everything. And the few colors added - the cherry on the top of the cake (that's how we say in Bulgaria).

All the techniques of the fetish fantasy film maker (arch-exponent one Q Tarantino) are there: the ultra-violence, the juxtaposition of the extreme with the prosaic (example: a cannibalistic sadist with super martial arts powers called... Kevin... Oh! how I laughed!), a Columbinesque obsession with fire-arms; along with a sackful of other fantasies beloved by teenage boys: big-breasted women, samurai swords, suicide, leather-clad Amazons; happy hookers; seemingly indestructible heroes, more fire-arms, revenge, strangely-shaped knives, stabbing people and getting stabbed (often with strangely-shaped knives)... the list goes on.Overlaying the orgy of sad comic-book teenage fantasy is a wonderful visual landscape. It is peopled though by cardboard cut-out characters, who woodenly spout clichéd drivel (the chief graduate of the Chippendale school of thespianism on parade is Brit, Clive Owen... maybe he just gave up on the tosh). They perpetually do and say obscene things to each other with a botoxed lack of facial expression. In fact, everything other than the artwork is disgracefully poor in Sin City, which I suppose is indicative of its comic-book origin; indeed, it is a sort of animated ultra-violent comic-book. Even the soundtrack is dull; at least Tarantino produces ultra-violent fantasy films with interesting background music.Sadly, many teenage boys will drool over this film. Even more worrying is that many grown men I know think it's a brilliant film too... I think about them differently after they tell me this. I strongly suggest any parents with teenage boys encourage them to watch hardcore pornography instead... it will screw them up, but marginally less than watching a film like Sin City.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mesmerising film making!,"I don't know what I just watched but I really enjoyed it. It's masterfully shot with breathtaking imagery. The stories seemed dumb to me and did not interest me one bit, except for the first one. But I do understand that it's a comic book adaptation so it really their fault. It did feel like I was reading a comic book and thus they've done a phenomenal job making it into a movie.8/10 only for the film making!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mind Blowing.,"Being a big fan of the perhaps out-of-the-ordinary works of Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, i had to see this film. I hadn't actually heard of it being black and white, so that came as quite a shock to me- but it is used with just one other colour at a time to create a really nice effect that wouldn't be the same in full colour.Normally i rate films a ten just to bring the average up if i think it is too low. However with this film i genuinely think that it deserves it. I think that the cast is one of the best ii have seen, especially Clive Owen and Bruce Willis. This combined with the over the top action, and complex storyline lead to one of the top 5 films i have seen in my entire life. This is a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of my top favorites...,"Robert Rodriguez scores again! This man is neck-and-neck with Quentin Tarantino as being my favorite filmmaker. It seems like the man can't fail. This time around, Rodriguez brings Frank Miller's film noir graphic novel series ""Sin City"". For those wondering if you need to be a reader of the books to enjoy the movie, you don't. I went into this movie blind when I saw it in the theaters and it blew me away. The movie actually inspired me to start reading the books.The movie is a collection of stories from three of the graphic novels. I think this is where some viewers got confused. A lot of the people I spoke with regarding the movie didn't care for it because ""it didn't make sense"". People need to know: don't go into this expecting a two-hour, single plot movie!! It is three stories, independent of each other, that share the same characters. In this way, it is like Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"". Another concern people have with the movie is the gratuitous violence and sexual themes. This movie may not be for people who are easily offended by such things or are made uncomfortable. You need to watch this movie with an open mind and just try to enjoy the stories.And of course, you can't discuss ""Sin City"" without mentioning the stylized look of the film. The movie is gorgeous, shot almost completely against a green-screen and using digital backgrounds. The use of the green-screen also allowed Rodriguez to do some amazing lighting that could not be achieved through conventional film-making. It gives the movie a look that hasn't been seen before. After reading Miller's first book in the series (""The Hard Goodbye"", which is also the first story in the movie), you can see that Rodriguez stayed as true as possible to the look in the books.Finally, I have to mention the casting. I couldn't imagine a better cast to play these characters. You can tell the actors/actresses really got into their characters and had a great time playing them. They all gave strong performances and brought these characters to life perfectly.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wow!!!,This Movie was excellent. It blended three short stories by Frank Miller and put them into one heck of a movie.The cast represented the characters in the stories wonderfully. The chose of mostly black and white made this film almost artistic.This has become one of my favorite movies ever its a classic in my book.I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see something great just ignore the sex stuff and watch this great film.I would encourage everyone to see this film who's a fan of great thought provoking plots.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Film Review: Sin City.,"*Roughly Translated From Brazilian Portuguese.Film Review: Sin City.How are my dear readers? I hope well! Today I bring you something a little different, a little bizarre.Sin City brings out an almost ""cartoonistic"" side of cinema. With a cast and direction to make any production the envy, they did something completely out of the ordinary.This film brings out ""noir"" thrillers in a somewhat exaggerated way, and the reason is that they are not portraying ""noir"" from cinema, but from comics (the name Frank Miller, among the directors, corroborates my thesis ). It's like giving life to a comic book, and it's actually very interesting. It was the first time I ""watched a comic book"".Anyway, that wasn't enough to make it spectacular. It turned out good! Different, in a reasonably good way, and that's all. The special effects also cause a certain discomfort, and the impression that they are not that ""special"" after all. Despite everything I've written, the film is violent. For adults.But either way, it's worth the experience to watch something completely different.Watch when you want to see an out-of-the-ordinary proposal.Rating: 3/5 - Nice film.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sin City A Solid Movie From A Graphic Novel,"Sin City is a solid movie from a graphic novel brought to the big screen by Robert Rodriguez. A great cast of talented actors help bring this movie to the big screen. Most of their screen time maybe limited but they make the best of their roles. The movie is set in a city overrun by corruption where the ladies are just as dangerous as the men. The cast is full of great talent for the most part. Jessica Alba is okay as Nancy a stripper but her character isn't memorable like some others. Devon Aoki does a good job in a role with no dialogue as one of the prostitutes of Olde Town. Alexis Bledel is decent as Becky another one girl from Olde Town who ends up being a backstabber. Rosario Dawson is convincing as Gail the leader of the Olde Town girls in her short screen time. Benicio Del Toro makes the best of his brief villain role as Jackie Boy a cop with penchant for violence but his part is cut short. The two actors to stand out are Clive Owen as Dwight a murderer with a new face who tries to stop Jackie Boy and Mickey Rourke as Marv a thug after the one responsible for killing his love Goldie. They both leave an impression even with their short screen time and are the best characters in the movie. Rourke's Marv provides some much needed dark comic relief to the film and Owen brings an intensity to his character Dwight. Well done. Bruce Willis shows up early on and then disappears for most of the movie only to show up near the end again but he makes the best of his smart part to play in the movie as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Jamie King, Josh Hartnett, Carla Gugino, Michael Clarke Duncan, Michael Madsen, Nick Stahl, Rutger Hauer, and Elijah Wood in a non-speaking role as one of the villains do what they can in their brief cameos but aren't developed enough for you to care about them or understand the reasons behind their actions. The pacing was a little slow and the voice overs done by the characters was a bit much at times but the good outweighs the bad. Overall Sin City is an entertaining graphic novel turned into movie using state of the art special effects that is obviously CGI but it fits the tone of the film. What really makes this movie work is the talented all star cast who help bring these imaginary characters from the graphic novels by Frank Miller to life. Sin City is sure to please any fan of Miller, Rodriguez, or graphic novels whose looking for a good movie to watch with equally impressive performances by most of the cast.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Sun"" City","Clever. Very clever. Much of Frank Miller's original comic book feeling is here, but even more sophisticated.The hardboiled lines are delivered in a hardboiled way, but the emotions are strong. The interesting thing is not the violent vigilante stories, but the stories about love. Love is complicated here. It goes far beyond what you find in comics; even in the ones of Frank Miller. You get interested in these people. Their vigilante actions might be regarded as completely primitive fantasies, but their love actions and shortcomings are from life.Bruce Willis once again shows that he is a really talented actor. Usually he hides it well, but not here. See this, if you can stand lots and lots of yellow and sometimes even red blood. There is sun sometimes even in Sin City.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good but not great...,I liked this movie but Bruce Willis as usual sucked in it. This guy just can't act. It could have used a few more hot half nude women as well. :-) Visuals were great and not over done... some scenes showed separate elements however. Mickey Rourke was fantastic! On the other hand Brittany Murphy did not belong in this movie... she is the same character in every movie. Soundtrack and sound was poor... I expected a much better score than this. CLIVE OWEN shows why he will be an excellent Bond... I like this guy. Speaking of Bond... Benicio Del Toro was perfect as usual.All in all a good movie to get lost in for a few hours.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Most Overrated Movie of all Time.,"A silly slow movie with gimmicky visuals that lucked out by being the ""Hip"" movie of the year that it was uncool to dislike. Every year or two an unconventional movie comes out and becomes the trendy movie of the year that everyone loves. It's as if latching on to this unconventional movie gives the average movie going public some indy-cred amongst their friends. The unfortunate irony is that they are just attaching themselves to something they found was pre-approved, but whatever. Being John Malkavich benefited from this, Lost In Translation (a movie I like actually) did as well as Napolean Dynamite and Sin City. Even if you find something positive or personally satisfying about any of the above movies it is hard to deny that the blanket worship by the mass movie-going public is suspect. Ask yourself, Is this really the kind of movie that makes 200 million dollars? Not typically, but here everyone is, regardless of personal tastes and film smarts, worshiping it. Is this really a movie that appeals to the masses or just an example of group-think? Being that the movie has silly dialogue, a slow pace and a middle 30 minutes that is just embarrassing in it's cheesiness I am inclined to think people are just desperate to fit in and not look stupid for ""not getting it"".",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Grotesque, Nasty, and Pointless","First, let me begin by saying that I really was VERY excited to see this film. After the first twenty minutes went by and I realized what the film was REALLY about - I almost left the theater to get my money back, but realized that I would be leaving my friend stranded, without a ride if I did so.How they filmed the movie was great. I thought it was inventive and very artistic. That however, does not make up for the meaningless and endless violence.I don't understand why some people enjoy these kinds of movies. People do NOT need to see a man's testicles being ripped from him, or a man's head sawed off, of a dog devouring a body who's limbs have been severed.Also, the depiction of women in the film is despicable. Every woman is a whore, sometimes a whore with guns, and they are all punching bags. Now, this statement could be passed over by people saying, ""Yeah, sure....but look at all of the OTHER violence that happened to EVERYONE ELSE in the film!"" Exactly my point.I spent a good part of the film staring at the floor to avoid the gruesome and inhumane depictions of the human race at it's most horrific state. This world does not need to see that kind of violence.At one point, when yet ANOTHER person had a bullet blasted through their skull, the guy behind me said, ""That's f**king awesome!"" Well, how ""f**king awesome"" would it be if that man with a bullet lodged in his brain were his father - or, bringing it to real life - one of the soldiers that we've lost in Iraq thus far.I just don't understand how such gruesome and glorified violence is entertaining. It's one thing to have a wrench thrown at you to train for dodgeball and have that be funny, but watching a man graphically whip a woman he is about to rape and be told that THAT should be funny to me? I'm sorry - I think things like that are very real, happen every day, and I'm thinking they aren't so funny to the woman who has been violated.If you enjoyed this movie, I don't blame you. I blame society.",,Anonymous,Crime
Wow,"I went into Sin City with high expectations. I've been waiting 6+ months for this movie. I was blown away. The movie leaks style and coolness. The performances were top notch. Most notably Rourke as Marv. The black and white with color mixed it is just eye-popping. More often than not, I hype up a movie in my head and then, when i see the movie, are disappointed with it. Sin City was not the case. I loved every minute of it. I must caution everyone though. This might put some people off. This is the Sin City comics verbatim. This is the movie version of the comics. It's not like Spider-Man where they change a bunch of crap. The violence is like that which you'd find in a comic. Its over the top and plentiful here. I don't think there is one use of the f-bomb though. If you like movies, comics or both, Run to see this movie. RUN. YOUR NOT RUNNING! **** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sin City: 9/10,"I wasn't really cognizant of the release of Pulp Fiction, as I was at the age of six. But I can see how it could have changed the history of cinema and how it effected the times. And when fanboys all over the USA heard about Sin City, based on three of Frank Miller's cult graphic novel series, they all clamored that it would be the next Pulp Fiction. Why would these people say that? Maybe it's how the ads plastered ""Guest Director Quentin Tarantino"" all over the place. Or maybe it's because it has a similar ""neo-noir"" style. Or maybe even the three-intersecting-storyline aspect. Whatever the case may be, Sin City turned out to not be the next Pulp Fiction. But it's just about as cool.Sin City's comprised of three stories which all take place in Basin City, or Sin City, where prostitutes and hit men are rampant all over the streets. In ""The Hard Goodbye,"" Marv (Mickey Rourke), after sleeping with Goldie (Jaime King), finds her dead and goes on a rampage to avenge her death. In ""The Big Fat Kill"", Dwight (Clive Owen) helps out a bunch of prostitutes reclaim the streets from the cops. And in ""That Yellow Bastard"", Hartigan (Bruce Willis) goes to find Nancy (Jessica Alba), whom he saved years earlier from a man who's been colored yellow (Nick Stahl) after Hartigan...rendered him useless. Actually, there's a short fourth story as the bookends to the movie from ""The Customer is Always Right"" with Josh Hartnett.If there could be one clichÃ© phrase to describe Sin City, it would be ""style over substance."" Shot almost entirely in black and white (save for some well-placed color images), and with computer generated backgrounds (like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, except people saw Sin City), it looks great. It looks almost exactly like Miller's graphic novels, including some segments with pen-and-ink graphics to completely replicate Miller's novels. Anyone who dislikes Sin City says that it didn't have enough story. But when you see the trailers, you know that this is what you're getting. You're getting the best-looking movie of the past few years. It's better than all of these so-called ""advancements"" in CGI. It does for visual film-making what Peter Jackson's Braindead did for blood.Of course, there's also no denying the absolute...coolness of the plot. It's a complete guy's movie: every female character is either a prostitute, stripper, has a nude scene, or a combination of all three. All of the guys have guns and kill and torture people. It's almost like an old-time Western, or something like that, except with more blood and female nudity. The way that the plot is connected is done in a very cool way, with a little connection between them all. And we can't forget about director Robert Rodriguez's ultra cool direction. With Rodriguez, there's never a dull moment in the film. It's a non-stop ride, which is already getting me excited for Sin City 2 and 3.All of the actors were great in portraying their tough-as-nails characters. The standouts, though, were Owen and Benecio Del Toro (who was also in ""The Big Fat Kill""). They're just the coolest characters, played by two of the best modern actors. Their standout scene is the scene that Tarantino directed, with the two of them in a car. That scene can basically sum up the whole movie. It's absurd, violent, weird, and absolutely bloody fantastic.My rating: 9/10 Rated R for sustained strong stylized violence, nudity and sexual content including dialogue.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"oh Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind","Having supposed to have seen this on opening night, stuff always came up, so here I am commenting on it a day after seeing it two weeks after it opened. Hey better late then never. This is without a doubt one of the most faithful adaptations of a comic book that I've ever seen is this one based on Frank Miller's niorish Sin City. I've always been a fan of both Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke. Honestly, a fan of Willis by a bit more, so seeing him as Hartigan was great and I liked how he played him. But Rourke as the no nonsense hard-boiled Marv steals this movie. There's no doubt in my mind that it's Mickeys best performance in quite a while (almost enough to make me forget the horrid ""1941"" and ""Heaven's Gate"") Rourke just took the ball and ran with it. Now, yeah, this is a grisly violent film, but somehow, maybe due to how it was shot, one can at least detach one's self from the violence. Or at least that was the case for me. Is it over-rated by being in the Top 250? A reluctant yes, as this is far from a perfect film, (the middle story, while fun, pales in comparison with the other two, some silly dialog, etc...) but it's still a very enjoyable one. And if overly clichéd crap like ""American Beauty"", ""The Matrix"", and ""Mystic River"" can find a place in the top 250, then I won't begrudge this one if it stays there.My Grade: A-Eye Candy: Carla Gugino and Jamie King both have nude scenes and both are VERY stunning",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Sin City Joins Die Hard and Fight Club As One Of The Ultimate Guy Flicks""","Sin City tells three different stories, one which involves a dead hooker and a big thug. The other is filled with hookers left right and centre, a bad cop and one super cool dude. The Last story centres around a yellow bastard and a young hot stripper. These stories all take place in Basin City from the creative mind that is Frank Miller.Sin City had a trailer that I could watch over and over and never get bored of it. The film is the exact same way, only it's 10 times more fun. Sin City is based on the graphics novels by Frank Miller of the same name. Other then the fact that one is a book and the other is film, with some more bits of colour here and there, they are basically the exact same thing. Sin City joins Die Hard and Fight Club as one of the ultimate guy flicks and manages to become the best film of 2005.Robert Rodriguez makes great films, see From Dusk Till Dawn and Desperado, but every now and again he misses a step, Spy Kids 3-D and The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lava Girl. Here he makes his best film yet, mixing in great visuals, incredible music, the perfect cast and one hell of a good time. Everything fits perfectly for Sin City and it never misses a beat. With Rodriguez behind the camera and Miller by his side for more creative input, Sin City not only becomes the best film of 2005, but one that will go down in history.Each story is unique for it's own merits and makes you want to re watch it over and over again. ""The Hard Good-Bye"" and ""The Big Fat Kill"" stand out over ""The Yellow Bastard"" simply because they contain more action and move along quicker. That is why I can't give Sin City a perfect ten, The final act, which should go out with a bang, goes out on a depressing soft whimper. It does shock the viewer if they are not familiar with the work it is based on.What makes Sin City stand out from the rest of the films that came out in 2005? Well, aside from it's amazing visuals, it has the perfect cast. Mickey Rourke is back and is back big, with a bang, however you want to put it. Rourke got seriously overlooked by every award show, he became what he was suppose to become, right down to his chin. Del Toro shines in his role as Jackie Boy. Even the smallest bit of make-up that will make the role more believable helps and Del Toro knew this and wanted to make it as perfect as possible, he pulls it off. Clive Owen is super cool, as he is in almost everything he does. He just emulates it, although it does help that DWIGHT is super cool as well. They blend well together. It took me awhile to get passed Bruce Willis because everything I see him in, I don't see the character, I see Bruce Willis. He manages to pull it off, although it may take time to get use to him. The supporting cast help flesh out the film even more. Seeing a familiar face here and there is a treat for the audience.The films character were great, from the big brooding Marv, to the small agile and creepy Kevin. These comic book characters are brought to life by these actors and only in a world as imaginative as Sin City could these character exist and here they kick ass to the next level. Rodriguez creates his own environment and world for that matter. Much like Jackson did with the Lord of the Rings, and Lucas did with Star Wars. Rodriguez brings paper to screen and has made a world in which we will definitely see more stories evolve from.The music is beautiful. Rodriguez has an ear for music and uses it to it's full potential here. From the theme music that everyone loves to hear and gets excited about when they hear it, to the opening score. It fits the genre well. The visuals were interesting to see. The entire film was shot on digital, so the crisp look of the black and white is even more crisp then you would think. With dabs of colour here and there, Sin City catches the eye and makes the viewer glued to the screen.City is not for the faint of heart and is not exactly the first choice for date movie. The film contains some pretty graphic scenes, like decapitations, castrations, electrocution, explosions, stabbings, gun shots wounds, axe wounds, dog eating man wounds,and everything else. The bullet, the babes and the blood comes everywhere in here and if you enjoy this thing, as I do, then this is a film that you will definitely want to check out. Sin City has balls and it's not afraid of what it wants to show it's viewer.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Simply Awesome,"I love violent movies. They rock. And with this film, you get plenty. You get hacked off hands, heads, and cannibalism. It is simply brilliant. And as an avid reader of the Sin City comics, I am proud of the work they put into it to make a righteous film worth calling the best graphic comic film ever! If you were a fan of Pulp Fiction, or the Desperado series, this film is the only equal out there that you can find. It is just as brilliant, there is a wry wit to the dialogue, and the stars aren't ridiculous- they are their characters- not actors playing themselves, playing their role. There aren't any witty lines for Willis, they are all served cold, and powerfully. If ever a action packed r-rated film with animation were to win an Oscar it'd be this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

'Sinply' the best,"'Sin City' is one of those rare films which most people can actually agree on – and the general consensus is that it's excellent! And, I can't really disagree with that. I would say it's a film for men. It has pretty much everything a guy (and perhaps an 'action film' enthusiast) could want. But, there are also a lot of women out there who enjoyed it, too. And that goes to show that it's actually more than just shooting and hitting people again and again.It's not so much a story, but a collection of three main stories, all set in the same city ('Basin City' to be precise). These stories sort of play off each other and interlink, but remain mainly separate throughout the film. Then there's the look of the film itself. It's pretty much all actors being filmed against a blue screen and then having a weird, computer stylised background added on afterwards. It's about now that I should mention Sin City is based on a comic book series. Maybe that's why the black and white (with occasional relevant colour) computer background works so well. It really does add to the atmosphere, creating a seldom seen look to a film.Then you have the cast. Simply put, Sin City is an A-list ensemble of recognisable faces. And, like all the best actors, every one puts in a perfect performance (although some people have criticised Clive Owen for letting the side down a little – maybe, but nothing to really let the whole film down).So, if you like your action films, your comic book films, your stylishly shot films and interlinking stories in general, you should have already watched this by now. Even if you hate it, you'll probably appreciate that what you've watched at least attempted to be a little different to the norm.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sin City is One Guilty Pleasure Trip!,"In 2005, Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller joined forces in an audacious synthesis - a triptych of film noir adapted from a series of graphic novels – to bring us a world where the villains are ineffably evil, the heroes are compromised, and the city is filled with corruption while mayhem and mischief run amok. The plot, having the direct-action vividness suitable for a video game, is ingeniously constructed in three labeled chapters – 'The Hard Goodbye', 'The Big Fat Kill' and 'That Yellow Bastard'. It takes us into the heart of the dark, grimy Basin City, where crime and depravity are a way of life, through three stories about heroes battling overwhelming odds that circle around each other, amplify each other, and ultimately intersect.Sin City is a world of shadows, captured in beautiful arctic-white and inkblot-black visuals, where the sun never seems to rise. The makers send their heroes into such labyrinthine hells that it would have been depressing if it weren't so much fun. Frank Miller's potent black humor translates easily to the screen and lifts the often grim subject matter, keeping the film entertaining through the darkest of landscapes. Into this frenzied mix, Robert Rodriguez brings his own chromatic talents. He borrows Miller's panels in lighting and composition, but adds his own sense of timing and bits of color strategically disrupting the pristine black-and-white gloom. But what makes Sin City a gleefully gory gem is that the relentlessly dark story is balanced by visceral joy of pure noir storytelling. And, make no mistake, this is a dark movie. Aside from being black-and-white, it also features nothing but characters scraped off the underbelly of society - ex-cons, hookers, corrupt cops, general low-lives. Rodriguez drenches it in his usual monsoon of ironic, macho macabre, with his camera salivating over curves and cleavage of tough-dame females. But the strength of Mr. Miller's writing has always been his ability to give these bottom-feeders soul thanks to which Sin City exists precisely on the edge between exploitation and artistic statement, ultimately saving itself from toppling over with the sincerity of its tone, the beauty of its images, and the honor of its heroes.In a film that reaches for the pulpy heights that Sin City does, a lesser cast would be lost, even invisible. But here surprisingly, the cast is neither a distraction nor an aberration. Everyone involved in Sin City not only understands this lurid universe but has a grand time playing in it, especially Mickey Rourke, who captures Marv's subterranean humanity beneath his snarling brutality, using his hungry, manic eyes that peek from behind his freakish disfigurement and Elijah Wood who is the definition of creepy as the mute cannibal Kevin.Sin City is a gleaming pop revelation – an extremely stylish piece of crime drama that is relentlessly entertaining. For those with a penchant for pulp, Sin City is one guilty pleasure.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the Sins of this film is that it ended,"Whew. Finally a memorable movie this year. It is a different movie, a stylish movie. I really love the fact that it is in black-and-white with bits of color. It really reinforces scenes, detail, and meaning. The direction was marvelous as were the visuals. The acting was good and the characters were convincing. I followed through this film and it was one heck of a ride. Let me say this though: I have not read the comics. It was probably why I did not care to see this film even after the second trailer. But after reading up on it and finding out some details about the film and comics, I ended up thinking that I should give this a shot. Heck, the black-and-white gave me more of a reason. I already knew the direction and cinematography were going to be amazing. I was not wrong. This modern film noir is very entertaining to watch and the jazz music sets the mood and tone just right. People will say that there are no characters with heart in this movie, but I will have to disagree. Yes, everyone is corrupt (maybe with the exception of Nancy). Yes, nearly everyone kills someone. But we actually get a sense of these characters and root for the ""good"" ones--the heroes--to get what they want. That is what a good movie is about. Having not read the book, this must have been one great adaptation because everything went smoothly and I did not get confused and I was not full of questions. The three stories are intermingled and they do connect somehow, and I thought that was interesting. Everyone is basically a strong character in his/her own way, and that is one strength of this movie. Enough praises though. I am sure that you have read all the praises possible for this. I will go on to the few negatives now. Sometimes you will be able to tell that the background was generated and lose the authenticity of the setting. You start to remember that this was all done on green screen. Some other slight flaws are too insignificant to mention here. One of the Sins of this movie is that it ended. Yes, even with the few ""bad"" features this movie has, you bypass them and enjoy watching. When it was about five minutes toward the end, I actually wanted it to keep going. But hey, I was satisfied. To end off, I want to say that YES, this film is extremely violent and disturbing with characters killed and tortured in almost every way possible. So if you could not handle something like Kill Bill or Pulp Fiction, you will not be able to endure this one. But if you liked the above movies, you will be able to endure and enjoy this one =)7.9/10 Stars",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
I think I liked it,"To start, I don't really watch a lot of television, or go to that many movies. I'm a movie renter, skip the commercials. In the 2 hours max that I sit in front of a television per week, I stumbled across the trailer for Sin City. It looked pretty action packed and full of energy, so I thought I'd give it a go at the real theatre. I agree with the previous poster about the artistic talent (both actors and presentation) making this movie different, but the straight up killing is what I enjoyed. Granted, nowadays pretty much all movies have killing in them. That or sex. And yes, this movie has both. It's the way that the kills happen that makes this movie stick out. Or is it the way the women are dressed as they blast bullets into bad guys with no regrets? Or is that part of the way the kills happen? Perhaps it's the way the kills seem so un-un-real? And yes, I meant un-un-real. On one hand, death happens very easily and fast. On the other, death is only an illusion. Perhaps it's about sex then, there were quite a few topless women throughout this movie. No, No, it's about the killing. The fact that it does capture the \ comic book / \ cartoonish / \ fantasy / mood only gets you wanting more. Or does it grasp you into the mindsets of the killers' confusion that quirks your brain to want to know what happens next simply for the fact of satisfying your innate sense to hunt?",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome graphics fixation on screen,"3 creative & original geniuses Director & Graphic Novelist Frank Miller, Ace Cinematographer & Visual effects supervisor Robert Rodriguez & Stylish Screen maverick Quentin Tarantino teamed up together & the result is edgy, racy, stylistic, slick, graphic film. The mesmerizing graphic frame images of the film are so scintillating & wonderfully shot in dark tinted images with sharp contrast of B&W & highlighted flashy digital Colors that you can't stop praising Rodriguez for his creative camera touch & it's really very difficult to judge - who's the real full length director of the film - Tarantino or Miller. Because not only the look of the film (blood gushing graphics) but the rough narration style & the dialogues (read: slangs) gave me the feelings of watching Tarantino flick. The plot is set against a morally bankrupt sin city where cops are corrupt & streets are deadly with goons. Out of three narrations, its Bruce Willis story of an old man & the girl (whom he had saved twice & forever) stays something like a plot in the film. But it's not a plot which is so important here'Oz it's splendid graphic film noire. The movie has pretty glamorous star cast stuffed with Willis, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen & Mickey Rourke. But it's Rourke & Willis' characters who tried hard in their performances.A Must watch Film Noir.Ratings-8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sometimes sticking too close to the source material hurts,"I like comic books. I think they are beautiful pieces of art but where sticking to the book literally helps some stories i.e. LOTR (and even Peter Jackson new that some creative license was needed) the director of Sin City should have thought more about the possible audience for his film. I stories would have been good just in and of themselves without the naked women, endless violence and voice over. The characters were also interesting but if appealing to a wider audience is a consideration then sticking with the comic book violence and sex is a no, no. This film should as it stands if for seventeen year old boys who can't get real women and play hour after hour of ultra-violent video games. And since I'm not one of those I was disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
FILM NOIR AT ITS BEST! A MASTERPIECE,"For those who don't know what film noir is, it means dark film. It was one of the first genre's of film back when they were black and white. The murder mystery type. It's one of the first thing's that film students study in film school, if not the first. It set the stage for all of film back in the 20's and 30's. And since then has been lost, so that most people do not even know the phrase.That genre has returned in all of its former glory and more here in this glorious masterpiece. Sin City is a serious work of art. It's new shades and textures of black and white with little splashes of color here and there are just beautiful and entrancing.The movie is mysterious, inspiring, compelling, violent, shocking, romantic, poetic, glorious, and of course very dark. Robert Rodriguez is an incredible director who has done a lot of great action movies, but this work is revolutionary to say the least.It comprises a set of 4 different sub stories within it, each which intersect in the middle and each which will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Each one is an amazing story in and of itself that has a great beginning, middle and end. When you put them all together, what you get is just incredibly epic. So epic that it will literally blow your mind and make it hard for you to return to the real world after.Of course it helps that this movie has one of the greatest line ups of all time in it. Each one of the stories within it has several huge actors in it, both stars and character actors. You will see all of your favorite actors in some of the most animated roles they have ever played. It is a such a treat.This movie is like taking a powerful drug for any film students or connoisseurs or people who really love film. It is a really powerful experience I know you will enjoy. 10 stars easy.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore","Or perhaps that should read, ""Frodo, I don't think we're in the Shire anymore,"" considering how one of our all-time favorite hobbits mutates into an insatiable, head-collecting cannibalistic psycho in Frank Miller's Sin City, without even blinking an eye (literally).He's only one of the many deranged lunatics we get to spend quality time with in the dark, courtesy of Robert Rodriguez's undeniably faithful film version of Miller's intense and brutal graphic novels. With a screenplay by Miller himself and co-directed by him (with a guest-director credit to Tarantino - what would Sin City be without his contribution, I ask you!?), we get to take a trip the likes of which we've never taken in a movie theatre before, and hopefully we'll never have to take again, but that's just my opinion.Don't get me wrong, the film is a stupendous achievement, visually - if you've ever read any of the Sin City graphic novels, you'll recognize the place immediately from the very first shot: beautiful, bleak, barren, brutal - all the good 'b' words. And the stories weave together brilliantly, there's no question: the film works on a plot level too. The performances couldn't be any better either, particularly Mickey Rourke's portrayal of Marv: covered in band-aids, brandishing bucketloads of bile, with a prosthetic profile which looks like a combination of Kirk Douglas and Roy Scheider, this is most definitely the role he was born to play.And you want babes? There's plenty of babes, most of 'em decked out in bondage gear to beat the band, and they're just as hell-bent on kickin' major butt as their male counterparts, make no mistake. Sounds really swingin' so far, huh? But remember, this is a Rodriguez/Tarentino joint, so of course it's gotta be more than just tastefully violent, it's gotta be yer basic beyond-the-levels-of-human-endurance affair, with broken bodies, half-eaten bodies, Pez-dispensered heads and severed heads galore, and this is just in the first hour. The person I saw it with had her eyes closed nearly the entire time, but that still couldn't shield her from the carnage, because, this, being a Rodriguez/Tarantino joint, remember, has to also include the characters' graphic verbal rehash of the violence: what had just happened to the victim, what it felt like when it happened, and what was going to happen next. So if you're especially squeamish, bring ear plugs to the theatre as well as your eye mask.When I was watching the film, I couldn't help thinking how much fun making this movie had to have been, especially for Frank Miller, to finally get to see his vision brought so lovingly to life, and this got me through some of the most bombastically brutal sequences. Don't get me wrong again, Sin City is not an incoherent exercise in excessively over-the-top self indulgence (a la From Dusk Til Dawn). It's worth seeing, especially if you could sneak an extremely large flask into the theatre with you (which I kept wishing we had done).",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stupendously awful,"First I have to admit: I have never read the comics, because I usually dislike comics. Then again a film should stand alone as a film regardless of it being an adaptation of anything, be it a novel, comics or anything else. Indeed the cinematography in Sin City is interesting and the aesthetics is stylish and glittery. But that doesn't change the fact that Sin City is truly awful. It is perhaps one of the worst films I have seen in years. Its 124 minutes were excruciatingly dull, devoid of humour, interest or even a narrative that actually makes sense. Who cares about a disfigured bully on a campaign of mutilation, a violent cop craving for sex, or a good whore saviour fighting a bunch of Irish grenade freaks jumping out of no where? None of the characters have any human attributes to them. They all fail to become nothing more than cartoons. Sin City is boring, self indulgent, superficial, idiotic, childish, and perhaps more pertinently of them all, lacking any substance or insight with which I could identify as a viewer. It is nothing but meaningless fluff. There is something profoundly American about Sin City, and about the enthusiasm with which it is received. It is a vacuous concoction of all American themes, from the rotten cop to the good hearted criminal and the benevolent prostitute, packaged through recycled motifs and images of American consumerism. But it has no narrative, no tangible metaphor, nor any inkling of a remark on life or human existence. It is, to quote the lead character of 'Fight Club', a ""copy of a copy of a copy"", which amounts to nothing more than the collection of images that it reproduces. Like the fake tans and breasts which dominate Santa Monica beach, Sin City is nice to look at, but very unpleasant to touch. Behind the pretentious stylishness is an orgy of violence, sexism, chauvinism and fetishism, which is basically two vile and boring hours about nothingness.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"weightless, and worthless","Sin City is everything movies shouldn't be.

Should have been NC-17,"""Sin City"" is the most violent movie I have ever seen. Even though the splattered blood and cut off limbs look like they came out of of video game, I still think this film should have been rated NC-17. There is no reason any children should be seeing this film. There is also lots of gratuitous nudity.Despite that, I liked the film. In this day where I often forget what movies I've seen because they are so forgettable, this is one I won't forget. It looks different than any other film I've seen. The closest would be ""Sky Captain,"" but ""Sin City"" has much better stories.The 3 stories all follow the Noir formula. The tough loner with a soft spot for a dame in trouble stops at nothing to save the damsel in distress. The protagonists may be anti-social, but they have integrity.Because of the stunning visuals, you should see this one while it is still in the theaters.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Captivating, but...","Sin City is everything it's supposed to be. It's faithful to the original material, near-flawless in the execution, violent, visually engaging, and innovative. The latest definition of cool since Pulp Fiction. I thoroughly enjoyed it.However ..You can't blame anyone (male or female) for despising the movie. It's probably one of the most misogynist films ever made. With one exception, every female character is either a hooker or a stripper, and with no exceptions they all rely on a man to get them out of trouble. Jessica Alba tried to defend the movie in the press by saying she thought all the female characters were ""empowered"". I guess you could see it that way if you considered ""whores with guns instead of pimps"" to be empowerment.The problem, if one insists on seeing it that way, is the source material. Comic books are one of the last American bastions of chauvinism (along with Tom Clancy novels). Whether you're talking comics or graphic novels, the authors are almost exclusively male, and the intended audience is as well. Women  whether they are heroines, villains, or damsels-in-distress  are there to be provocative and sell copies, and that's about it. Granted Frank Miller has transcended and redefined the genre in many ways, but even he stuck to this standard with Sin City.Some would accuse the detractors from failing to ""look past"" the violence, chauvinism, and titillation to see the movie's real themes, but there's a fair question of whether the movie is really about these things or just using them to tell the story. In the end they are inseparable, because these stories can't be told any other way. And if someone can do without these stories being told at all, you have to respect that.As I guy, I would still recommend this movie. It's supposed to show you some dark places.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sin City,"How to describe ""Sin City"" - Twenty-First Century film noire with a splash of red thrown in, fantasy combined with comic book violence and sadism?

Brilliant!,"This film has exceeded my expectations, and my expectations where extremely high. I have great respect for Director Robert Rodriguez, more so than his little buddy Tarrantino, don't get me wrong I like Tarrantino, but Rodriguez deserves more credit. He does most of the work, Cinematographer, Editor, Director, etc. The Man is responsible for his own work. Anyway back to the film, I enjoyed every last minute of it, I thought that the stories where all so interesting and well written that I found my self lost in every one of them, to the point where I almost forgot that I was watching a different story, and that there was even a story before it. Whoever the critic is that writes in the Dallas morning News, let me just say that I do not like this guy. He said how the stories weren't deep enough or along those lines. Well they are short stories genius, and its not gone with the wind dramatic, for its genre which I would place it in new age film noir, its perfect, though it is 100% a guy movie, it is one of my new favorites, its perfect, the scene composition is beautifully done, and the colors, though obvious make the dominant and the intrinsic interest of the scene become alive, straight out of the comic.....

"Great visual appeal, but lacks story","This movie has more hype than it merits. First the positives. The cinematography was amazing. The black and white with the splashes of color were great, and the green screen effects were cool. The display of neon-white blood was innovative. The women were beautiful (although the girl I went with commented on how the movie's vixens created a gender bias.)HOWEVER, the movie lacked a real story line. The story of Sin City was actually three stories that somewhat overlapped. The stories alone, as a thirty minute episode, would have been cool, but they could not succeed all together. They were too similar. At one point, I thought that it was possible that Willis's character would end up being Marv. In reality, it was just a typical role that a few of the characters shared.At no point was a surprised or shocked by a plot twist. There was potential to really tie the three main characters together, but it never happened.I left the theater impressed by visuals, but disappointed overall by the movie as a whole.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pretty good comic book film.,"This is another excellent ""from-page-to-screen"" adaptation and it's obviously because author Frank Miller was throughly involved in it. Co-Director Robert Rodriguez ( EL MARIACHI Trilogy ) adds a bit of spice to the action scenes and supervises the soundtrack as well. Quentin Tarantino lends his sick mind as well seeming how he is good pals with Rodriguez and directed similar 4-part crime stories like PULP FICTION.The actors do a good job with the material: Bruce Willis gives a good narration of all the misdeeds and corruption around the metropolis; Clive Owen describes how mad/insane he and the city are; Mickey Rourke is merely in a torture story and the list goes on.The only problem with this film is that not everyone is going to like this type of film: It plays out a lot like a film noir, there is also lots of ""over-the-top"" violence to get through as well ( some which will either keep viewers interested or turned-off ). Also, all of the male and female leads are all in some sort of criminal activity with the exception of Willis's Hartigan character.This is mainly going to appeal to the male audience. ******* 7/10 STARS",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A little weak,"I really was looking forward to this, especially after reading who was in the cast and who was directing. Now I will say I have never read the graphic novel or whatever, but the premise sounded really cool and considering nothing has come out worth anything recently, I was looking forward to checking this out. I was pretty let down.The film tried too hard to be in the same style as ""Pulp Fiction"" - an opening part...a few stories about different people that overlap each other...and then and end scene that kind of goes back to the first. The problem was, In Pulp Fiction everything somewhat revolved around Marcellus Wallace...in this one there really wasn't anything of substance to tie everything together outside of the location. The segment with Micky Rourke was by far my favorite and could have been a movie unto itself...but the rest just seemed too thrown together.Maybe I'm missing something since I never read what it was all based on...but at the same time I never thought that should be any kind of pre-requisite to enjoy a movie. I wouldn't waste my time at the theater, just wait until it comes out on video if you have to see it.I just have this feeling this movie will be one of those that people rave about ""just because"", and if you didn't like then you just ""didn't get it"" if you know what I mean.",,Anonymous,Crime

Radical violence in a surreal world,"For your average Joe or Jane to enjoy a movie with such lurid scenes and direction; it truly needs a special entertainment level. Sin City meets that standard.Mostly via differentiation.Kind of a crime/horror/fantasy flick, it has the effect of an odyssey without the 'journey'.Mickey Rourke is over-the-top great and perfectly cast. The most evil person (in that story); is all that much more frightening based on his history of being cast as a nice guy.The absence of color doesn't just add to the desired effect, it's foundational for the effect achieved.I loved Miho. Who wouldn't. She's a doll. Willis as the faithful good-guy and so many more off-beat characters with bizarre behaviors and sometimes, impossible durability.Of course, there are 3 separate stories really within this film. I really liked the Marv\Goldie piece with Mickey Rourke; and, the Clive Owen piece with the gals in old town.And although I couldn't put my finger on it, the Bruce Willis piece, where he saves the little girl, etc., just didn't hit the spot. Sort of dragged on and this piece starts the movie and ends the movie. Love Willis the all American hero. Just a little bit predictable.My wife was very fascinated by this movie and to this day, is not eager to view again. That's completely understandable, guy or gal.It's shameful that many reviews are 1 star. I just don't understand why people view a movie clearly identified as, and categorized to a certain genre, and then shame the uniquely done movie for violating their own narrow-minded limits within that genre. Take a star or two off; don't bludgeon a movie that any viewer cannot take their eyes off of.Even with these unfair biased anomalies, this flick achieved an 8.0 here. Pretty amazing.I'm no fan of excessive violence by any means. But well done, is well done. As such, my frequency is about a bi-annual viewing.

Miller & Rodriguez brought the comics perfectly to life, and the cgi city is eye popping, yet still looks real.Filmed in B&W, gives it an old school noir feel (as well as the narration) with splashes of colour thrown in for emphasises when needed.The story and the characters are reminiscent of the noir crime thrillers, it's Grindhouse, it's VERY comic book, with touches of horror, and Marv's story arc feels like a midieval movie.At times, the dialogue does feel a little jilted on-screen but over all, it's not an issue and doesn't take away from the movie.All in all, this is a beautifully filmed comic book adaptation and is a much watch for anyone who likes the genre and has the stomach to handle the gore!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A film like I NEVER hope to see again,"Sin City is a modern rendition of a comic book told in the film noir style. It's shot in high-contrast black and white with an ever-present voice over narration that gives it the feel of this genre of old. In the old days, film noir gave us a glimpse of a gritty reality and a chance to see dime novels on the screen. They were cheap to make and got the job done.Sin City is an extremely stylized version of the film noir, and, because it is based on a comic book it looks like a comic book and has characters from a comic book. It's more of a comic book than a film. How artistic.Now, it's entirely true that blood and gore in black and white tend to appear, well, less RED. So it may be necessary to cut someone's arms and legs off and let a dog chew at the stumps in order to compensate for the lack of redness.

Brilliance. Another masterpiece from one of the great artists of our time.,"Rodriguez has done it again. There are so very few movies made that show such a dynamic range of deep craft and passion. From the basics- story and performance- to the minutae of production design and inside jokes, this masterpiece is pure joy to watch. Films of this quality are tragically rare.

And and extra hurrah to the production of elegantly bowing out of the DGA's constraints and allowing 3 world class storytellers (Rodriguez, Tarantino and Miller) to all have their hand in the direction.

Great movie,"Sin City is an unforgettable cinematic experience that felt like stepping into a living graphic novel. The stark black-and-white visuals, splashed with bursts of color, were mesmerizing and set the gritty tone perfectly. Each storyline gripped me, especially Marv's raw, tragic quest for justice and Hartigan's relentless fight to protect Nancy. Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis gave standout performances, embodying their characters' pain and determination. The brutal violence and morally grey characters added a dark realism, but the film's style and storytelling kept me hooked.

Sin City doesn't wrap up well at the end,"Yes, the scenery is nice, the atmosphere is cool, the actors do a greater job in front of blue screens on this movie than others on other blue screen movies do (wink, wink).However, the movie has a fundamental flaw: the final wrap up. There is none. We watch 3 disconnected stories for more than 2 hours and at the end there is only a teasing that these stories have something in common. But they don't have much in common, after watching the movie, they still feel disconnected, even if the characters are somewhat connected.The movie would have been even more successful if there was a major twist at the end, a twist that connects all 3 stories together *without* the viewer expecting it.Other than that, it's a good... violent movie.

"Not a truly Great film, but a spectacular one...","Sin City is a tremendously ambitious work from Robert Rodriguez, a director who formally only made films on his terms, leading to many films that were all entertaining but reasonably similar.With Sin City he changed things up, shot entirely on green screen in black and white with an entirely computer generated backdrop, and utilising only sporadic use of colour to highlight certain aspects and features, Sin City looks like almost nothing before it. (It was tried again by the Co-Director Frank Miller in The Spirit, with less than satisfactory results.)The events that occur over the two hour running time are taken from three comics *AHEM* graphic novels created by Frank Miller, whose vivid imagery and odd angles apparently convinced and influenced Rodriguez' own shot selection to the point he gave Miller co-credit.The graphic novels are set in the fictional BaSin City (hence the title), where crime, corruption and general naughtiness are commonplace and everyone has a story to tell generally not a nice one.The characters also think (and in the film talk) in short sentenceswith much use of and precious little wasted dialogue because comics are about the pics as much as the storyThe three stories intertwine quite nicely and wrap around so that everything is resolved in the most satisfactory way possible, with each story occasionally momentarily touching upon events from other tales, though not directly.The first story follows grizzled veteran cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis) as he closes in on the abductor of an eleven year old girl named Nancy.The second story follows the exploits of Marv (Mickey Rourke), a hulking, disfigured thug with anger issues, a drug dependency and perhaps mental problems – no wonder Mickey Rourke got rave reviews he was playing himself!The final tale involves a young waitress (Brittany Murphy), her violent prick of an ex Jackie-Boy (Benicio Del Toro) and her new flame Dwight (Clive Owen), and the subsequent trip that Jackie-Boy and Dwight take separately to Old Town, a scungy area that is run by the local hookers.The sparse use of colours only serves to highlight the reds and yellows when they are used, and even without colour the black and white film is exceptionally clear, even in the rain sequences.Each tale has its own share of depraved acts, dialogue and violence, with the oft spewing blood exceptionally lurid as it gushes over the screen in bright red yellow and white! The violence is more over the top than most manga films, with decapitations, torture and various severings and shootings.Before you ask ""well how bad could it be"" consider the following short list of characters: - An emotionless silent mass-murdering cannibal - A deformed miscoloured paedophile - A tiny Japanese assassin-hooker (or is it hooker-assassin?)And that's before I get to the cops, thugs, heavies, crimelords and the usual minions and sacrificial lambs.An All-Star cast fill the film with recognisable faces even in minor roles, without running down the laundry list though highlighted actors include Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Jessica Alba (whose contract as a stripper specified no-nudity bitch!).Sin City is never boring but rarely hits any great heights, you say Wow to everything on screen but rarely to any one moment or action – though there are some gruesome eye raising moments and a couple of effective action sequences.Sin City is perhaps best described as a great achievement – if not a great film but I welcome a sequel as I think this material has a great film somewhere in it.Final Rating – 8 / 10. Violent, noirish and filled with people you wouldn't invite to dinner even on a dare. Everyone in Sin City has a story, hopefully the sequel finds better ones.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sin City is devilishly satisfying,"This was one of the much better films of 2005!This was a complex and original conversion from the popular Sin City comic books by Frank Miller. The conversion is very effective as you feel like you are watching a comic book for the entire film. The cinematography and CGI effects need special commendation, as it is these factors which combine to make probably the best looking film of the year.Basically there are 3 story lines. Bruce Willis heads up the 'Hartigan' storyline. The classic good detective who is arrested on the day of his retirement, saves a poor little girl from being raped by the sadistic Nick Stahl. He returns years later only to find she is under attack again. A very decent storyline and in my opinion the best one in the film.The other one sees Mickey Rourke returning to better roles as 'Marv'. A large ugly brute, he has been shown the night of his life by the hooker Goldie only to wake up to find her dead. Realising he is being set up hearing the cops arriving too prematurely he is intent to bring the real killer to justice; but ends up uncovering more than he bargained.The last storyline sees Clive Owen in read sneakers bringing us the character 'Dwight'. After pursuing his lover's rough old boyfriend into the hooker dominated Oldtown, severe consequences occur when they realise that there is more to this old boyfriend than meets the eye.Overall, a very decent plot, great action and a superb cast. Sure, some of the lines may sound a little corny, and it might not be everyones cup of tea- but its a comic book! Its fun! Its nice to escape reality occasionally.Definitely my second favourite film of the year 10/10 (Sorry Crash was my ultimate favourite film of the past few years)",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
City full of boredom & sinful to watch it,"Another crappy film on IMDb top 250? Why? Maybe because mostly people have accidentally clicked on 10 instead of 1 out of 10.

I have committed a sin by watching this movie that is so called on the top 250 and I've been punished by boredom for it. The weirdo stuff like heads of prostitutes on the wall, people just can't die and that yellow guy with big ears what is that all about? Just complete nonsense. Frank Millar must have pulled the script & comic book from his bum and was running about in a circle with them then his wife must of hit him on the head with a rolling pin. I thought that it would be good because Quentin Tarantino is the guest director and he his one of my favourite directors but unfortunately it didn't help, I did not even liked one scene at all. Frank Millar is a genius that is able to make a film as bad as this, the movie is just like weird looking as him also that idiot looks like a shaved goofy monkey.

A Proper Graphic Novel Come to Life,"I've never read the Sin City graphic novels but the artwork I've seen from them is beautiful and this movie perfectly captured that. You're watching the pages of the graphic novel literally come to life with this film. It's so visually beautiful, no wonder it's been able to stand the test of time. The story is not hard to follow, provided you're not half committed to watching the film and the narration doesn't hinder it at all, I'm guessing the people complaining about narration have never watched a film noir or any 1930's-1940's films for that matter. It definitely demands your attention though, so if you're not fully focused on the film, you will get lost following the story. The performances are fantastic, each actor and actress really got into the spirits of their characters. I was particularly blown away by Jessica Alba, she does a wonderful job as Nancy. She naturally has an innocent expression and it works to her advantage with this role. Elijah Wood was another one I particularly loved. He doesn't even have to say a word and yet he excels at his role. Another actor who naturally has big ""look into your soul"" eyes that were needed to bring his psycho-demonic character to life. It can be very violent, so if you're squeamish about seeing decapitated heads or a guy vomiting pee - you may want to skip this one or better yet, just fast forward through the gore-y scenes. I highly recommend this film if you haven't seen it yet, it's quite the masterpiece and better than most if not all the comic book films you've seen. It's up there with 2019's Joker and 2018's Into The Spider-Verse.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Something Never Done Before. Something Never Seen Before. Something Never Experience Before.,"Adapting a comic book series on the film canvas is one thing but transitioning it into a live-action motion picture in a manner that it brings the comic book to life in an almost literal sense while mirroring the events of the novel frame to frame is something truly extraordinary. And that's what Sin City is; something never done before, something never seen before & something never experienced before.Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel series of the same name, Sin City is presented in 3 primary chapters (That Yellow Bastard, The Hard Goodbye & The Big Fat Kill), each lifted directly from the novel & is presented in a non-linear & overlapping order (unless you're watching the recut, extended & unrated version). A non-related short segment named The Customer Is Always Right also exists but it only serves in bookending the whole narrative.Directed, produced, photographed, edited & scored by Robert Rodriguez, Sin City remains the most accomplished film of his career. Also sharing the direction credit is Frank Miller himself & Quentin Tarantino is in as guest director for filming one scene. Cinematography is jaw-dropping gorgeous n groundbreaking, editing is deftly carried out & music is perfectly suitable. In short, Sin City is a marvel of technical filmmaking & an astonishing work of cinematic art.Featuring an ensemble cast of Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Devon Aoki, Jaime King, Alexis Bledel, Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Elijah Wood, Benicio del Toro & many more, everyone delivers a fantastic performance but the standouts for me were Rourke & Wood, both featured in my favourite story of the three; The Hard Goodbye. While Rourke impresses the most as the unstoppable beast, Marv, Elijah followed him closely with his sinister rendition of Kevin; a mute cannibalistic serial killer.Sin City may not be a flawless film on an overall scale but it still remains one of the most stylish, inventive, faithful, original & visually path-breaking films to come out in the 21st century. An extraordinary achievement in genre-filmmaking & a breathtaking cinematic ride from start to finish, this visual extravaganza from Rodriguez & Miller that's no less a cinematic feat is a must for every cinema lover out there. An instant classic. An unforgettable experience. A technical masterpiece.",,Anonymous,Crime

"base, banal, despicable in almost every conceivable way","Typical nine dollar Hollywood detriment that reels in a lot of soul gutted fish to the theater. I got this movie for Christmas, and I quickly exchanged it for about ten bucks. My sister bought it for me for 30, but I was more than happy just to get some little amount for itjust as long as I was making some kind of effect, a motion, a protest to the three people I was negotiating with to hopefully get the point across that this is less than 0 dog plop(And I do apologize on behalf of all dogs' excrement everywhere to belittle it by comparing it to this, because excrement can be used for fertilizer, so then this decrement is more like mad cow diseased hamburger burned to ash.). I think it's a most terrible, damaging, oversight to comment only on the depiction of women in this film. What about the MEN!!! Yes women are often (but not always) seen as sex objects of desire (even though the nudity is toned down from the comics while the violence is all there and then someand of course the violence is almost ALWAYS inflicted upon men, those of you who comment on the violence against women in this film need to watch A LOT more closely once more, but no I would never actually suggest such a stupid thing to do!). However, the depiction of men is juat as bad if not worse. There is hardly a scene where there isn't some man being mutilated, castrated, or cut up and lopped up in every degrading way possible. A fair amount of this old hat and mindless gore is perpetrated by female characters (but that's o-k because they're hookers, right?)against only men; a scene where a woman gets slapped (a slap in this film is by far the lightest account of violence) is not even shown in full display, but as a shadow on the wall. I'm sorry but after seeing the gratuitous, pointless, trite violence in this film, I'm not seeing how this slap should be shadowed (perhaps Rodriguez and Tarentino didn't want to upset women because then they'd might get less ""tail"") In a similar degrading fashion, almost all the women are hookers or strippers (with the exception of the parole officer for the Marv character), yet the depiction of the vigilante hookers in Old Town is obviously seen in a positive light, no men in the film are treated with such reverenceand everyone complains just about the depiction of women?! I abhor the depiction of both men and women in this film. One might say that ""well, all the men who got killed are bad"" but that's below the point; the violent images themselves have an affect on an audience just as much as they have an affect in the context of something.Another upsetting thing about this movie and together with certain misguided, thoughtless reviews is the chivalric dogma in which it wallows. Again, everyone talks about the sexist depiction of women (it's 2006 folks, let's start looking at the sexist depictions of both men and women, shall we?), well has anyone noticed the number of men who have sacrifice their lives solely for women in the film? For example that wretched, awful, gut-wrenchingly sickening character of Marv (and I ain't just speaking about how violent he is but that's definitely a part of it) who goes on a wild killing spree in the name of a one night wham bam with a hooker named Goldie? Really, if men weren't so cowardly to speak up about this, or weren't so incredibly deluded, there would be protests to this dogma. Sacrificing life and limb for women who show nothing but contempt or indifference to men is called oppression, too bad most men have not YET realized this. Clueless director Rodriguez(of, ya know, Spy Kids fame!!) obviously has no talent; look at what he ""accomplishes"": carbon copying something almost bit by bit from graphic novel stories from the early to mid nineties and this tricks a lot of suckers (re: this web page) into believing that he is a ""good"" director. He's a hack folks, pure and simple hack. And Tarantino hasn't made a good film since Pulp Fiction. The reviews here stating that this film and its positive reviews is an indication of how low our society has sunk are among the most perceptive and accurate ones; it is beyond passé to say that this kind of thing has no effect on how an audience reacts to real life. Films like these play well to all kinds of bad people, or latently bad people, and because there are so many deluded, delusional,bipolar, schizophrenic, lost,angry people, films like this prove to be a success (but don't worry we'll soon see that this will ultimately not be a success, ha, ha). It's not even a far stretch any more to say that maybe demons are infiltrating this ""realm"" at an alarmingly speedy pace when this film gets top ratings by so many so-called ""film critics"" as well as an 8 out of 10 rating on this website (fortunately though, there are a lot of no-nothings at this site). Even just five years ago I would have called someone a nutter for saying that thing about the demons, but really. Since this universe started with good and good has always won, I hope all the evil ones getting satisfaction out of their brethren reading this are not too satisfied(well, their brains are probably well liquefied or evaporated at this point, let's not be so cowardly to face it), because they will, of course, lose again in the short and long run, and good, quality, original films with integrity and a moral outlook will return sooner than later, let's just hope the littluns who ""loved"" this film are still young enough to learn the error of their tenuous beliefs, otherwise we'll have to wait another generation; oh well, I'll survive.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
wow!,"Ask any true comic book fanatic what the ""Sin City"" graphic novel series represents and they'll say it's without a doubt one of the most under-appreciated and thought provoking graphic novels ever. Written by Frank Miller, ""Sin City"" never strays too far away from its comic book roots and takes full advantage of the great story it was based on. Never before has any comic-inspired movie stayed this close to the work it was based on.Frank Miller, the writer and artist of ""Sin City"" graphic novels, who also directs this film alongside Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, is a true pioneer of the comic business with over 30 years of accolades. Miller is probably best known for single handedly bringing the Daredevil, Spiderman, and Batman comics back from near cancellations with his dark and explosive style; all at different points in his career. Those still unfamiliar with Miller's work should also know that he created the heroine Electra, which a hit movie was loosely based on not too long ago starring Jennifer Garner.The film adaptation of the graphic novel series ""Sin City"" screams Quentin Tarantino from the get-go, as fans of the ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", and ""Kill Bill"" movies will feel right at home with the ""story within a story"" telling and the frequent amount of irony and amazing fight scenes that ""Sin City"" have been sprinkled throughout. Be warned though, some scenes are not for the squeamish and are full of blood and mature themes that some may find politically incorrect and overly edgy. That being considered, ""Sin City"" accomplishes everything it sets out to do and then some by recreating the very same environment that made the graphic novel series a cult-classic on the big screen.Aside from the amount of great action scenes throughout ""Sin City"", the best reason to go see this movie is the myriad of visual effects through the movie. The movie plays games with your eyes in ways never thought possible before, as it was filmed in a semi- black and white state with vibrant colors sneaking their way in throughout the picture. Certain moments you'll be sure you're watching a black and white movie, while at others you'll think the directors dropped the film reel in a bucket full of ""Skittles"".""Sin City"" features an all-star cast, with the likes of Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Devon Aoki, Mickey Rourke, Michael Madsen, and Britney Murphy all giving stellar performances. Fans of the comic will scream in delight seeing all of Miller's great characters on the big screen being portrayed by such big name actors/actresses. Action fans will have scenes that they will talk about for weeks, and the casual movie buff won't be able to deny the amount of polish and hard work that ""Sin City"" contains in providing a great movie experience that should not be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Comic-neo-noir,"Sin City, Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez,and Quentin Tarantino (special guest director), 2005Frank Miller's comic book comes to life in a movie that has all the elements of noir but none of the sensibilities. It's quite a leap from the gritty realism of noir to comic book figures who are just affectations of the basic noir characterizations, but this one isn't shy about making the attempt. And it has all the elements: voice-over, tough guys, dangerous femmes, hard-boiled dialog, fringe characters, the 'bad part of town,' nihilism, and a dark ending that resolves nothing.The film makes no apologies about being a comic book which is, after all, a big part of its appeal for its fans. And the cast is top notch with more beautiful women than I can remember seeing in a film - ever. And the tough guys - there are three of them - are tough like only comic book characters can be (those guys can either take a punch or they were shot with really small bullets). But, really, they all come off as cheap knock-offs of noir characters. But hey, it's a comic book.And the movie is lots of fun. Jessica Alba's cowgirl bar top dance is a great Hollywood moment as she pulls off something that can't be easy: very effectively playing a stripper without taking her clothes off. There really is no plot just three loosely woven story lines but it really doesn't matter. This film caters to adolescent male fantasies about violence and women.But the movie is what it is.

Stunning and excessive,"A look into a few intersecting stories of people in the dark, dreary and dank underbelly of the notorious fictional metropolis of Sin City.The film is nothing short of a visual masterpiece and practically redefines noir cinematography. The smoke filled, tense, and dangerous atmosphere of the city is present in virtually every frame. All with the comic book spin to each image. The film looks both frighteningly real yet impressively imaginative throughout. Even die hard fans of the ultra-violent novel have praised it for its faithfulness to its source. Many adaptations, even if good, don't come nearly as close to being so visually and thematically similar at the same time to their sources.That said the film is definitely not for all tastes. The dark and uncompromisingly violent tone throughout seems to go even beyond extreme by the end and to the absurd. Beatings, shootings, dismemberment, impalement, spraying blood and pure nausea really test the viewers gut. It's the point and what else can you expect from a town full of criminals and corrupted people, but most will get that point well before the movie is even half over.Overall it's a good film noir and the amount of violent excess present is ultimately up to the viewer, but no matter who is watching it's there. --- 7/10Rated R for strong violence and brutality",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

This movie is a lot like Kill Bill.....but this film makes the Kill Bill's and Reservoir Dogs look like an episode of Power Rangers or something weak. Clive Owen is a bad ass in this movie. Just his actions and the way he talks makes him so a bad ass. I cant stress enough how great this movie is!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""sinfully"" delightful","From the moment I walked out of the theater after seeing this, it immediately jumped to the top of my all time favorite movies list, beating Donnie Darko, Return of the King, and Band of Brothers. The cinematography is astounding and the fact that only certain colors stand out makes it that much better. I'm definitely seeing it at least once more and buying it. Elijah Wood, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Jessica Alba (just to name a few) play what I think are Oscar winning performances. They all play the parts flawlessly and show how good they can truly act. This movie is not for those with week stomachs however because there is an intense amount of violence, most of the blood though is shown as white and looks like white out (an astoundingly cool effect when you first see it) but sometimes it will show up as red. So long story short, a definite must see for all crime-thriller people.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Know what you're getting into.,"I loved this movie however I've gotten quite few more refund requests from this movie than any other recently. Know that its extraordinarily violent and racy. Very few movies out in theater stress the artfulness of the presentation. Very few movies accomplish what the creators wanted to convey, this one does.I have to write 10 lines about this damnit. Alright whatever. The color affects are quite faithful to the comic book. The narration is wonderfully done. The story is confusing as there is time jumping as you go from character to character but its easy to pick up. The twist and turns are great, coming from a guy that didn't even know this comic existed. The violence is immense and humorous. The women are drop dead sexy and the protagonist men are inspiring.If you know someone who is considering seeing this movie let them know what to expect so I don't have to waste 5 minutes of other customers time processing refunds.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A bunch of superficial poop,"This movie truly blows. It looks awesome and has that film noir feel like in the previews, but it all boils down to simplistic testosterone fueled, superficial poop (i can't really speak my mind on IMDb). Have we, as men, not evolved past this? I guess not!! This movie is so awful, I am going to prevent myself from getting worked up and not sleeping. Warning: If you are a woman and want to be demeaned, objectified, and get ticked off, please see this movie. If you a man with half a brain, spare yourself the trip to the cinema for this one. But, if you are like most of dumb-ass drones out there, see this movie. You actually may look at it on the most surface of levels and enjoy all of the sexism, chauvinism, and Oedipal themes pervading through this sh*t of a creation",,Anonymous,Crime
Best Comic Book film ever made,"There have been many attempts to make a movie look like a comic book. ""Dick Tracy"" effectively used prosthetics and comic book colours and costumes to give it that look. However, the story suffered. ""The Shadow"" also made good use of creating a comic book reality, where people talked and acted like they were from a comic book. Even ""The Hulk"" had the innovative use of transitions by scanning across boxes on a comic book. And so on. The primary flaws of these films were both a gripping story and lack of complete immersion into the comic book world. (For some reason I am reminded of ""Cool World"", another disaster).""Sin City"" finally takes the comic book film genre into it's rightful place. That is, completely separated from reality. Here, Marv, a lowbrow dude, can't be killed by a hail of bullets or otherwise. Backgrounds are completely comic book in their illustrations, using CGI selectively to animate them. The broad use of monochrome design with splashes of colour works perfectly. The overall tone of the film feels like ""Pulp Fiction"", both comic in their ultra-violence. Indeed, this is the first film I have seen that is a worthy successor to the ""Pulp Fiction"" style, with ""Kill Bill"" a close second.But back to the true strength of this film - story. The three primary plots are original and fast paced. Simplified but not stupid, strong performances (although Bruce Willis didn't break any new ground) of characters who have strong personalities and strong motivations. Mickey Rourke, almost unrecognisable as Marv, gives one of the best performances of his career and carries the film more than anyone else. Rodriguez was perfect for directing, using his experience from his early films to create high energy scenes. The film is fast-paced, with little extraneous dialogue to bog it down.This film should be considered a classic, it certainly will be a cult hit for years to come. You maybe have seen close attempts of a film like this, but none in the past have achieved the absolute comic reality portrayed in this film.I give it an 8 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Overrated,"I was stunned by the reviews Sin City received. I was not bothered by the gore - I did think it lacked subtlety, though. The mistake was giving Miller such a presence - the man is a COMIC BOOK writer, not a novelist. He has no mind for character development or good dialogue - things that, you know, real writers are concerned with.The easiest example is the scene where Michael Madsen shows up to talk Bruce Willis out of going after the pederast in the first scene after the dreadful Josh Hartnett voice over vignette. In three lines, Madsen ticks down that they've been partners thirty years, this is a mistake, blah blah blah... a complete lack of imagination went into the dialogue and voice overs in the film.The voice overs are another problem, as there is a glut of them, and none of them do much to further our understanding of the story - honestly, they don't. Given that comic book conventions and clichés are known by virtually the entire movie going audience, I'm sure we could understand what's going on without the gravel-voiced, over-wrought inner workings of these anti-heroes.Another problem was the non-concurrent story-lines. It worked in Pulp Fiction because Tarantino is a great writer and director with good awareness of what works and what doesn't, and because the story lines coincided at meaningful points. Here, the approach is scattershot, and perhaps one of the reasons it doesn't work is because Robert Rodriguez is an awful director. How could you possibly think Desperado and Once Upon a Time in Mexico are any good, if you've seen them? The sense I got from the characters is that Miller was smitten with his characters - he couldn't believe how cool they are! The most gratuitous scene was the one where Mickey Rourke visits his parole officer - partly because she saunters, topless, around a man apt to become a psychopath without his medication, and partly because ""she could get any man she wanted with that body of hers"" but won't, because she's a lesbian. That's a 17-year old writer's insight. I'm not talking about the line, I'm talking about the whole scene. It just seemed like a really cool thing for Rourke to say at that time. Whatever. Rodriguez has similar flourishes with his own characters, usually involving slow-motion scenes of pistols popping out of sleeves and bazooka guitar cases. Please.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Written Review of Film- Journalist,"If Frank Miller, writer of the Sin City graphic novels, was skeptic of Hollywood before Sin City, director Robert Rodriguez has relinquished those worries from him. Miller had sworn that a movie from his novels would never exist, after all how could a movie capture the depth and artistic side of the city he had created. And then Rodriguez approached Miller with a short film that showcased how the movie would be made.The short film named The Customer is Always Right, featuring Josh Hartnett, is the opening scene of the soon to be, in my opinion, blockbuster Frank Miller's Sin City; a film that does not disappoint Miller's fans and those unfamiliar with him alike. Filmed entirely in front of a green screen with the backgrounds added in post-production the film offers the look and feel of a comic that has yet to be experienced.The film is based in Basin City and offers the audience a look at the ruthless, the love and the hate that exists in this film-noir setting. The film is askew with violence, gore, dismemberment, and yet it is a sinfully artistic, and at points amusing, saga that houses three of Miller's stories.To date probably the darkest, and excuse the pun again most cynical, film I have seen all year; although easy to say because it is only April. Miller, creator of the 1991 Sin City, and Rodriguez, Director of From Dusk Till Dawn, split the director's chair and even managed to give film violence king Quentin Tarantino some time in the seat.To set the scene one would have to imagine a city where the citizens hardly see daylight, the cops are corrupt and prostitutes run their own town through consistent gun power keeping the gangsters away. Sleazy bars are home to the largest and toughest of men and even they still seem to take a beating. But they become harmless at the sight of the gorgeous women that plague the city and make it much too easy to fall in love.Marv, as an example, played by Mickey Rourke is the largest of large who is thrown around by cars, spits blood with grin and still seems to dismantle three feet of concrete at ease becomes harmless once in the arms of a sultry lady of the town named Goldie. Goldie is found dead and the rest of the story Marv promises to, and succeeds to, draw ""gallons and gallons of blood"" in an attempt to find the killers.There's the surprising love that keeps the one good cop in the city, John Hartigan, pushing for justice while on the brink of retirement. He fights through corrupt cops and highly connected citizens in an attempt to rescue an eleven year old girl from the dark grasps of the city.The amazing visuals are not left alone but are supported by an assortment of mentionable performances. Rourke has found his best role as of late and Bruce Willis' presence offers his usual tough and tender performance. Benicio Del Toro, a jealous boyfriend named Jackie Boy, and the pleasantly creepy Elijah Wood as the psychopath Kevin gives the film the support it needs. The women are equally notable, including Jessica Alba as Hartigan's dream girl; Rosario Dawson as the gun-wielding hooker named Gail; Brittany Murphy as a street smart waitress who links all three stories; and Devon Aoki as Miho, the deadly sword wielding fighter that offers a Kill Bill worthy performance.The stories are magical, and to some extent become hypnotic with characters that create a hybrid mix of a comic and a film. You might enjoy the lengths and the intricate detail that has perfectly transformed the stories of The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow Bastard or you may not. It is a matter of appreciating the success of the film and noting the historic heights that it has created for this genre of film and the work that directors have done to uncannily mirror the comics.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

I LOVED this Film!!!!!!!!!!!,"Based on the graphic novels of Frank Miller, this is a movie that you'll either love or hate immediately. Directed by Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Miller himself, this film is ultra violence and ultra risqué. Filmed in black and white with hint of coloring throughout, this film is exquisite. It's a combination film noire 1940's style detective novel meets Pulp Fiction, and I just loved it.The film is a culmination of several short stories, all intermingled. From the opening sequence to the ending credits, the film seizes hold of the audience, and dares you not to be entertained. The black and white is grand and enveloping; which tones down the blood splatter being spewed across the screen. This effect turns a would-be mad-slasher movie into cinematic genius.This film has everything, from the A-List of stars which include: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, and Elijah Wood playing some sort of flesh-eating psycho that's just too cool for words and a far cry from his Frodo character of the last five years; to over the top story lines with ninja hookers, dirty cops, unstoppable vengeful superhuman hit-men, carnivorous were-boys, IRA mercenary militia and corrupt politicians. It's everything that you could ever want in a movie and more.To try to explain the movie in words, would take to long, and would end up incoherent; let's just suffice it to say, ""You'll have to see it to believe it,"" and leave it at that. I must also reiterate that this film is very adult oriented; if you're easily offended or overly sensitive to adult content and graphic subject matter, then I would think twice before viewing. However, since I am neither of these, I enjoyed this film thoroughly.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not without its faults, but generally a solid piece of Modern Cinema","A tempting collaboration between comic author Frank Miller, movie whiz kid Robert Rodruiguez and everyone's favorite eccentric Quentin Tarantino binds CGI and good live performances well. Produced in much the same way as Rodruiguez's other recent efforts, the filming was confined to a Green Screen sound stage and the backgrounds added in post production. This process seems to get better with every film, though I would not say that any of these cyber-movies have surpassed ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" in their mixing of CGI and actors.Sin City is a movie aimed at adults, but only specific audiences. Fans of either the comic series or gritty crime dramas will enjoy the film, but all others may walk away disappointed. The Bruce Willis/Michael Madsen segments of the film are typically Tarantino - the first portion of this segment is easily the best. The picture is divided into mini-movies, each with their own casts led by a name actor. The best of these is easily the Clive Owen segment, in which he helps a group of inner-city hookers defend themselves against thugs. Owen's good acting overcomes his slightly unconvincing American acting, and the segment passes through nicely.The film has its flaws, the Mickey Rourke segment for instance is at best tedious. Rourke seems suited to the roll, but the secondary characters and the plot of the segment don't really 'work'. Some of the plot points are boring and unnecessary and some of the sequences are so dark that they are simply not enjoyable. Small roles by Josh Hartnett and Michael Clarke Duncan add nothing to the film, Hartnett's part is especially silly and was obviously shot over one day or so.The best performance of the film comes from Bruce Willis, who is totally convincing as an aging cop. The on screen relationship between Willis and Jessica Alba are excellent, evidently displaying acting talent from the young actress and a return to form for Willis. Mickey Rourke is fine as Marv, perhaps only Rourke can play such a disgusting character who, despite being the hero, is revolted by the viewer. Elijah Wood does what it says on the tin as a demented serial killer, but the segment he appears in is far to vague. The random introductions of characters does not help and the story plod along.Overall, Sin City is a solid movie, ideal viewing for fans of the genre. But one thing constantly annoyed me whilst watching the film; I got so bored with gun shots and punches to the jaw that I was about ready to administer one on myself! I feel their was a slight overuse of weapons in the film - but I suppose that would be expected. This is possibly the closest Comic Book conversion in movie history, and fans of the originals will obviously love this. Be careful, you will either love this film or be disappointed by it. I myself loved it, but pointed out the flaws for the purpose of reviewing it.My rating is 7/10 - See it but be warned!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fantastic,"If film noir was not a genre, but a hard man on mean streets with a lost lovely in his heart and a gat in his gut, his nightmares would look like ""Sin City."" The new movie by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller plays like a convention at the movie museum in Quentin Tarantino's subconscious. A-list action stars rub shoulders with snaky villains and sexy wenches, in a city where the streets are always wet, the cars are ragtops and everybody smokes. It's a black-and-white world, except for blood, which is red, eyes which are green, hair which is blond, and the Yellow Bastard. This isn't an adaptation of a comic book, it's like a comic book brought to life and pumped with steroids. It contains characters who occupy stories, but to describe the characters and summarize the stories would be like replacing the weather with a weather map.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Robert Rodriguez is an undervalued talent,"I rarely hear anyone mention Robert Rodriguez as one of the best directors today, but he really is. He's the definition of an auteur. He does his own thing, and the movies he makes are completely his. Who cares that they're pap? There is such a thing as great pap, and Rodriguez, though he might not get the kudoz he deserves today, is the king of it. And, judging by his insistence at Frank Miller's directorial credit on the film, which led to Rodriguez's resignation from the DGA, he's a great collaborator and a grand example of modesty, as well. Sin City is an exceptionally entertaining film. It's not deep, but it's engrossing. The script is made up of three (and a half) short stories, starring some of the most wicked anti-heroes of filmdom. Mickey Rourke's segment will probably be best remembered. He plays a giant thug trying to avenge a prostitute who gave him the night of his life. Clive Owen plays a murderer just out of plastic surgery who wants to protect an abused girl (Brittany Murphy) from her ex-boyfriend (Benicio del Toro). Things get out of hand when the two men wander into a section of town run by lethal hookers. The final main segment, which actually wraps around the other two, involves Bruce Willis as a cop who saves a young girl from violence, only to be framed for that very violence. Rodriguez doesn't shy away from either the film noir or comic book origins. Instead, the two sources explode. The Raymond Chandler-esque dialogue is a hoot. This will be one film to be remembered when making our Best of 2005 lists.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overrated In Every Way,"There's some kind of credit at the beginning of the film for ""Special Guest Director: Quentin Tarantino."" I mean, like it's not enough that every geeky comic book freak in the universe is going to be in line at this film opening night, Rodriguez has to create a bona fide spoogefest by offering up Tarantino's name like he's the ""New Sucking Power"" on Rodriguez's spiffy vacuum.I'm all for shameless female nudity in movies, but Rodriguez trots out his actresses sort of like boxing promoters trot out ring girls between rounds. Hey, look, Rodriguez got the mom from ""Spy Kids"" to be butt-ass naked in a film. Then, the hooker played by Rosario Dawson is wearing a see-through top over a skin-colored piece of spandex and we're left to ponder the wording in her contract. Jaime King is naked. Jessica Alba isn't. It's kind of like breast roulette.""Sin City"" is not just an exercise in style over substance; it's a retread of a film that was itself a retread. Perhaps there's some lingo in postmodernism that would make that sound like an achievement, but I doubt it.",,Anonymous,Crime
A Triumph in The Town Without Pity,"I absolutely LOVED this movie.I've been a fan of Frank Miller for over twenty years, and have felt since its inception that the world of SIN CITY was the perfect place for the artist/author's talents to shine. Basin City presented the purest, most dynamic place (geographically and figuratively) for Miller to lay the groundwork for some of the most evocative stories to explode from the graphic-prose genre in years. A city of his own making, SIN CITY continued to evolve, becoming darker and richer and meaner with every issue. I loved them.Meanwhile, Robert Rodriguez earned my total respect and devotion for the slam-bang gusto and bravura that he's displayed in the MARICHI trilogy. (Not to mention FROM DUSK TIL DAWN, which I consider a world of delirious fun!) What was great about watching his own creation was seeing his talents also evolve before our eyes. A small yet inventive student's movie leaped to full-scale major motion picture to Texas-sized blockbuster epic in the space of three movies.And in SIN CITY the audience now has the perfect creative marriage of two virtuosos of the hit-and-run action drama. It's just a blast and a half! Having collected all the books almost from the beginning, I can say it's downright freakish how much the film matches the books, panel-for-panel in most instances. The choice of including three rotating stories makes perfect since, since they are each propelled along at such breakneck speed it's like clinging to a bullet for dear life. The actors were beautifully cast, and they do a wonderful job of inhabiting their characters. As much as possible with a film of this type, they bring them to life. And for at least one actor, the on-screen results are nothing short of astounding.Mickey Rourke IS Marv. (I read in an article that he took copies of the books to his psychiatrist lamenting, ""THIS is how they see me!"") Probably the single most larger than life character to emerge from the most-wanted list of Miller's protagonists, Marv was always the one I thought it would be impossible to cast. Physically, no one looks like him -- at least no one I'D care to meet. He's a hulking, brutish thug of a human being. Temperamental, insanely violent, a juggernaut of discord and retribution...and yet the audiences CHEERED for him each time I saw the movie. I wouldn't be surprised if some of his lines of dialogue are quoted years from now.Marv serves as the perfect representation of the driving instincts of the other characters (good and bad), the city itself, the graphic prose stories the movie is based on, and both Miller and Rodriguez. He has his own internal logic, and a moral barometer that doesn't fall into alignment with the rest of the world -- but it's there. He's loyal to a fault, unrepentantly so, and will suffer no end of damage to right an unforgivable wrong. Do his ends justify his means? Of course not, at least in the real world, but they explain them.The movie takes chances with its gorgeous black-and-white. It's so rich and absorbing it makes color seem tame by comparison. It also takes chances with its almost gleefully manic violence and in-your-face sexuality. It never panders and seems to be asking other action-adventure-dramas the question: ""Is that the best you pansies can do?"" all the while spitting blood and bile and mussing up their faces.The actors are a delight. When Rosario Dawson smiles, she IS Gail. The casting of Elijah Wood for his killer role was inspired. Powers Booth - a personal favorite from his days as Philip Marlowe on HBO - is grandly evil. Bruce Willis has a face and demeanor that exists perfectly in this cold, monochromatic world. (And I have to mention that I found the relationship between his Hartigan and the young Nancy at the beginning of the movie even more touching than it was in the books. This was something that could only be achieved by live actors, and good for them.)I can't wait for more movies set in the town without pity. And I also can't wait to see following movies stitched into the continuity established in this first one. Kudos to all involved; I can't praise the filmmakers - everyone in front of and behind the cameras, from grip to animator to publicist and beyond - enough for crafting such a sharp piece of work.Thanks for NOT holding back.

Comicbook masterpiece,"There is Spiderman, Superman, the Punisher, Wonderwoman, Batman and many other comic book adaptations floating around since as early as the seventies.

THE best film of this year and comic genre.,"Now, I had never heard of the graphic novels that Sin City was based on, and therefore i had absolutely no idea what to expect, espesh as over here in the UK, it hasn't been released yet so no-one could tell me.In a nutshell, it is an awesome film, artistically directed(mostly in black and white but with dashes of colour) and superbly written. If someone was to describe a stereotypical dark comic book to you, it would be an exact representation of what Sin City is. My personal description is Pulp Fiction vs The Punisher.The outstanding performance in it is undoubtedly Mickey Rourke, as he manages to pull off a 'hellboy-like' character, but Clive Owen surprises as a hard-guy(even his accent is believable), and there is appearances by so many other famous actors/actresses it shows that they really thought that Sin city was a project that they needed to be involved with,and rightly so.All in all, everyone should see this film. Even though it is pretty gory in places(be-headings aplenty), there is little red blood in the film, which takes the edge off a little bit and so means it doesn't go down Kill Bill territory.See this film. And anyone who says this film is anything but good to awesome, is(as Hartigan says in the film) ""As expert as a palsy victim doin' brain surgery with a pipe wrench""",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Definitely not Sin Sh!tty,"STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All CostsSin City is a dirty little place where a group of disheartened characters go about their downbeat little business. We open with Hartigan (Bruce Willis) a cop nearing 60 with angina problems who nevertheless remains hell-bent on bringing in the abductor, molester and potential killer of a little girl who happens to be the son of a prominent senator. This, however, leads him down a depressing personal path destined to end in disharmony. We then move in on Marv (Mickey Rourke) a go-it-alone tough guy whose downfall will be his need to bring the killers of a hooker he loved to justice. Then there's Dwight (Clive Owen) who wants to protect his new love Shellie (Brittany Murphy) from her ex-lover Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) and his gang and in doing so shatters a truce between the hookers of Sin City, the local cops and the mob. To round off this series of interwoven tales, we go back to Hartigan who has to go on trying to protect the little girl he saved in her childhood in her adult years.Filmed in distinctive film noir style, in terms of presentation at least, Sin City is the first must-see movie of the year. It's also a comic book movie of an entirely different kind. While similar ideas were expressed in the 2003 adaptation of Hulk, this comic-book-on-the-big-screen movie is aimed squairely at the adult market (certainly won't be appearing in no Saturday morning matinée!) with the emphasis on ultra-violence and as much flesh bearing sexual insinuation as you can imagine. In fact, it's one of those movies where at times it seems like the violence is so graphic it's almost parodying the notion of screen violence just as a knowing wink to the audience that it knows what they're all thinking.On the performances front, Willis can play the hard-boiled, edgy cop persona practically in his sleep (though his wise-cracking edge is conspicuously absent here!) with ten years added on his character here, Rourke too does his standard specialty to perfection as the brooding tough-guy and Owen obviously took my King Arthur comment to heart and became a better performer. The best part of it is his fabulous American accent. It's basically just the main cast doing what they've always done, but knowing what they've always done and doing it well.Overall, this is one that those without the blessings of strong stomachs might have trouble enjoying or those with a value that women have come on as more than just sex objects, but it's an impressively told collection of tales with a great cast and a presentation and style that really makes it stand out. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Modern crime-noir with flair -- elegantly expressed and entertaining,"Knowing literally nothing about the graphic novels by Frank Miller, I marveled at the glorious cast list on Sin City's IMDb page for so long before I finally saw the film. I used to check back every week just to see what hot new star they would add to the credits while it was in production. The only thing I did know was that a film starring Mickey Rourke, Michael Madsen and Rutger Hauer and that was being partially directed by Quentin Tarantino was going to be well worth checking out when it hit cinemas. Seeing the trailer later on, and the famous 'The Customer is Always Right' scene, the style took me by complete surprise and I realised this was not your run-of-the-mill crime thriller -- but something extra.Sin City combines Blade Runner film noir with... nothing I've ever seen before! It can perhaps only be described as cartoon- or video game visuals, and it glazes this with a lush violence coating and stylish gore effects. This is crucial for the tough, gritty Basin City and its many plots that all depend on its dark style to function. There is not a whole lot beneath the surface if you scratch it, or rather there is but Sin City features so many story lines and characters that it simply has no time to explore all events and people in the plot, and it ends up feeling occasionally both shallow and rushed. It almost falls victim to the grievous cinematic sin.. 'style over substance' but it just about makes it, I think.After a decade-long (or more) cinematic rut, Mickey Rourke is back in black as gasoline-chugging tobacco addict Marv and he plays this badass character superbly. The other actors do not disappoint either, but blend into their eccentric and freaky comic-book characters, creating an enjoyable mess--a freakshow. Alexis Bledel, Brittany Murhpy and Jessica Alba however, should never be allowed to work in films again because their acting actually wounds me. Although they drag Sin City down with their mere presence, this modern crime noir is still worth watching for its striking style.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Yesssssssssssssssssssssssss!!!,"Nothing more needs to be said about this film, just go and watch it! Mind blowingly cool, eye poppingly stylish, this ranks with some of the best films ever made! Uber violent? Well maybe, but its done with such a sense of fun and comic book mayhem that it seems quite easy to distance yourself from the emotional repercussions such carnage could actually cause, like in 'Seven' for instance.The acting is also spot on, and a big shout out has to go to Micky Rourke, who is possibly playing the hardest guy ever to grace the big screen. Elijah Wood shows us his dark side, Bruce Willis kicks ass as the 'last good cop', and Clive Owen is the king of Cool.If Robbo can keep this up for the sequels, we could actually be looking at one of the best trilogy's to come out in recent years!Sit back, let your jaw hit the ground and watch the chaos unfold!!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Brutally violent, not to be taken seriously.","Based on the famous comic book series with the same name (which I haven't heard of till I saw the film), Sin City is a brutally violent film set in the overly fictitious Basin City. One must not even remotely try to compare it with reality and just take it as comic book entertainment where unimaginable things can happen. The narrative consists of 4 short story-lines linked together in a particular sequence, similar to Pulp Fiction. Yet, it fails to achieve the same level of excellence with clichéd script and overly stylized action. I saw the directors extended cut where each of the 4 stories are completely separated, you can go for it if you can handle the long credits after each story (which was ridiculous).The first story 'That Yellow Bastard' follows the story of Hartigan (Bruce Willis), an honest cop who is in danger after facing off with the corrupt senators son. The second 'The Customer is always right' wont make any sense till you see the entire film. The third 'A Hard Goodbye' follows Marv (Mickey Rourke), a bad-ass hunk who is almost impossible to kill. He plans to get rid of a even more horrific cannibal-killer Kevin (Elijah Wood). The last one, 'The Big Fat Kill', follows Dwight (Clive Owen) who has to handle a delicate situation between cops and the kick-ass girls of Old Town. The ones with Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke were the best. Acting wise the cast is fabulous and has the commendable job. There are lots of things you need to link in order to get a proper linked story out of the 4 stories and the sequel (A dame to kill for). I would recommend forget it and just enjoy each story individually as in the end all of it wont make preach you anything. Everything is to be perceived only as entertainment nothing else. The level of violence is extreme. Each character feels like a nihilist. A persons head is smashed to pulp with bare hands, a mans hands and legs are cut and is fed to wolf alive. If you can handle such violence well and good, else don't bother to watch. The visual style of black & white with color to highlight works well with the neo-noir theme of the film. The dialogues feel a bit too cheesy at times and action sequences unrealistic. Anyways its just a comic book adaptation. Just enjoy it like that.RATING: [3.5/5]",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Movie Review: Sin City,"Movie Review: Sin City I just went and saw this movie tonight. I may have to go see it tomorrow, if my wife lets me. And cheap Tuesday. With luck, I can see it in a different city next weekend.But enough with the editorializing. This is a movie that will definitely polarize the viewers. From what I could tell from the gasps, yells, laughs, and hooting, my fellow audience-members liked it. Some people on the way out were saying bad things about it. It was hard for me to keep from pounding their skulls flat on the hard, cold, packed earth of an unholy barn floor.Whoops, editorializing again. My adrenaline is still a little bit high.From the man who brought respectability back to comics, and the man who could inexplicably produce ""El Mariachi"" and ""Spy Kids 3D"" in the same lifetime, comes Frank Miller's Sin City. Not once does it shy away from the source material (except for Jessica Alba, who has a no-nudity contract clause). Marv does everything that you'd expect of an indestructible killing machine with a soft fluffy teddy bear heart wrapped in bloody razor wire. Hartigan is the man... bar none, Hartigan is the man. Nameless the Salesman, although only in two scenes, perhaps drives home most poignantly the morality of Basin City. Nancy, skinny little Nancy Callahan, is perhaps the only innocent soul in the city.In Sin City, in the very, very broadest terms and with an extremely loose definition of the word ""good"", the good guys win. Marv finds justice in dispensing of pain and blood, but it is justice. Hartigan, in the name of the law and love, finds justice in sacrifice. Dwight and Gail protect the way of life of the Old City, and it just so happens that a whole mother-loving pile of bodies gets left in the wake. Elija Wood, good old Frodo Baggins, gets whats coming to him with a smile on his silent lips. That was such a weird sentence to write.The cinematography is dead-on. Some panels of the book look just like the movie. Some panels of the movie look just like the book. The attention to detail is remarkable. The Woman In The Red Dress's eyes glow green for the second that a lighter is held to her cigarette. The transition from two-color monochrome animation to four color movie (black, white, gray, and blood) and back is seamless. Only on a very few occasions can you tell that the background is green-screened, when the motion doesn't 100% synch up. Even so, 99% synch rate is pretty damn good.Although there were...two... five...ten.... uhm.... seventy-odd murders in this movie, and pretty much every main character (and even some hot supporting characters) end up soaked in blood at one point, this is still a marvellous set piece, beautifully crafted, and filled with characters as rich and colorful (if the tiniest bit wooden *cough*Madsen*cough*) as any you are likely to encounter. I recommend this for anyone who likes film noir, violence, or that feeling in your stomach when your entire life has led up to a single hard decision, and you go with what your heart knows is right, and the world can go **** itself if it doesn't agree.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Bring back the 30's and 40's Sin City is here!,"This heavily stylised distillation of all those great black and white movies of the thirties and forties takes every noir-tinged cliché, packs it into copper jacketed dum-dum bullets, and fires it at point blank range, in the head and the heart. Sin City is Violence and Emotion writ LARGEan excellent movie that ALL crime readers and viewers will lap up like the promise between the smooth thighs of a femme fatale! I loved this film, and it screams at me to get acquainted real quick with ALL Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels.One draw-back to the uninitiated; this movie is dialogue heavy, but the brilliant and original visuals make up a perfect balance. The film, as you all probably know is shot in the style of a comic book, with frames that carry the bare minimum of props ie, lit foreground revealing actor and single prop like a hospital tray and a drip feed. This style replicates the old studio pictures which were made on a tight budget, but it is used here to accentuate performance and scene. Many black and white film stocks are used in the telling of the tales within Sin City, as are vivid and garish sprays of stylised colour; blood is a sickly yellow, eyes glow green.I hear there are going to be two further movies shot back to back later this year. I await those with breath bated!!I give Sin Citynine out of ten!Now I'm off to re-watch some classic Cagney crime capers!!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great on so many levels, yet if falls short","I am a huge fan of Miller's comics and really dislike Rodriguez's films. The hype surrounding this movie was huge and as of today the movie is in IMDb top 100. But at the same time, so are Kill Bill and Kill Bill 2, two movies that I disliked with passion. So I didn't really know what to expect from Sin City. Unfortunately I walked out of Sin City with mixed reviews.First the good The attention to detail that went to transferring the comic book into movie is amazing. Backgrounds look exactly the same as they do in the comics, and to give the movie another dimension, many features, such as rain and scenes that show characters all white against black background, have comic book look to it. This movie take the technology introduced in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow to a whole new level. Mickey Rourke is amazing as tough-as-nail Marv. Perfectly cast, perfectly played out part. Elijah Wood creates perfect Kevin. I get the chills while reading the comic every time Kevin shows up. Movie is no different. Devon Aoki and Rosario Dawson do excellent job as well.The bad So many actors are not suited for their roles. Bruce Willis does not suit almost 70 year old Hartigan. Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Joshua Hartnett all are playing parts not suited for them. The inner monologue that each character work brilliantly in the comic, but for some reason looks ridiculous in the movie. Each character thinks as if they are all read Wall Street Journal and watch private eye flicks from 40's. Sometimes the end result is simply laughable. The scene when Clive Owen is being pulled out from the lake by Devon Aoki is a perfect example of that. Finally, when characters do talk, it is always as if the words are being forced out of them, always ending with a big sigh.Overall, I don't think the movie deserves to be in the top 250 of all time, let alone top 100. It is solid, but not great, and definitely not deserving all the hype it got so far.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Forget movie of the year, movie of all time!","This movie is just too good. When I saw it, I was shocked by the way that the movie stayed true to novels, and even had the definite Comic book feel to it. The backgrounds, the way of movement, and the narration all added to the vibe.In all fairness, everyone in this film was a great actor. Marv (Mickey Rourke) played an amazing part, Dwight (Clive Owen) also, and a stunning performance by Bruce Willis as devoted cop Hartigan, made it even better. This movie caught my interest completely containing 3 stories, that were interesting even by themselves. The way the stories are split up and joined together are phenomenal and well connected.I'm absolutely obsessed over this film, and can't wait for frank and Robert's follow up on the Sin City movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The BEST comic book movie ever.,"Sin City is without a doubt the best comic book movie ever. It was unafraid to take the chances that any others have, and every shot, and every pose was masterfully crafted to mimic the book. And the thing that makes it even better... Even if there had never been a Sin City book, this would still be a damn good movie. Robert Rodriguez has managed to, in one fell swoop, rewrite the rules of comic book movies, and reinvent and reinvigorate the noir genre. It's not a spoof of the genre so much as an homage, I think. It will now be placed with other classics like The Concrete Jungle or Little Ceaesar. I can only hope that all of the idiots (Lucas) that rely so heavily on CGI can learn a thing or two from this movie. Everything was done right and Sin City is a beautiful movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Makes Gotham City look like Munchkin Land ...,"Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are of the same generation, but not the same range of talent, there's one element where Tarantino surpasses his friend : writing and storytelling, and in Hollywood, that means a lot. So at the time Rodriguez made himself famous with the 'Mexican' trilogy and the 'Spy kids' series, Tarantino was already a unanimously acclaimed director and the standard-bearer of a cinematic revolution that gave witty dialogs and random Pop Culture references their significances to weird intricate plots. And I must add with style and an appealing overdose of fun and violence.Honestly, I'm not much a fan of the three last movies directed by Tarantino, I believe he got so wrapped up in his success that he never tried to get out of his comfort zone. However, I believe the ""Kill Bill"" series to be his last masterpiece, the pinnacle of the Tarantino touch, a vibrant, flamboyant and emotionally engaging, homage to the Martial Arts movies that influenced him. But the film had style too, and style was an area where Robert Rodriguez wasn't just comfortable but capable to outrank his gifted friend. So, it's just as in 2005, he came out with his own ""Kill Bill"", a no-less dazzling and hypnotic masterpiece named ""Sin City"", based on Frank Miller's graphic comic-book series. And that one of the best-looking movies of the 2000's never got nominated for Best Cinematography is as sinful as any of the sins in ""Sin City"".Dark and gloomy, the titular setting would make Gotham City look like Munchkin land, it's over-the-top film-noir photography reminded me of these Photoshop effects where I playfully augmented the contrast to give an eerie look to the most banal image. Rodriguez, a man of his generation, understood the endless implications of computerized images : basically, you could make miracles with it. And that's what the movie is, a miracle. The black-and-white look like painted with China ink, and colors are highlighted every once in a while in the most visually affecting ways, blood is like red stains soiling the frame, the blonde hair of that Marv's sweetheart is mesmerizing, and sometimes, colors get you to more sickening reactions such as the guts of that gutless Yellow Bastard. Color is like a protagonist in the film, images serve the story as the story serves them, it's like the perfect symbiosis of the form and the content.And with an extraordinary wizardry, Rodriguez edits the film to create another spellbinding symbiosis with the storytelling. I said Tarantino was superior in storytelling, but Rodriguez conceals his weakness by adapting the comics on-the-nose, straight-forwardly, an image speaking for thousand words but thousand-word monologues feeling like verbal caresses. Structure-wise, the film employs the same circular narrative that made ""Pulp Fiction""'s reputation. In ""Sin City"", characters meet each other, you leave them someplace and find them again in another, they're always part of the same universe like different pieces of chess game that only at the end, reward your patience and give you the whole scope, through its bunch of crooked politicians, corrupt cops, and 'gold-hearted' prostitutes observing a fragile truce with the Police. With all the gangsters, priests, dancers, lawyers, killers and cannibals, ""Sin City"" is like the matrix of sex and violence in urban Pop Culture, where being good is the exception... no matter to which side of the Law one belongs.Hell, what do you expect from such a title anyway? You have your share of Gothic sensuality, high-heels and G-strings, women are poetic sexiness in motion and men lustful and justice enforcers (the true justice), there's an odd mix of old-school characterization and modernity, and the whole movie is so dizzyingly good you never have time to analyze, it's a film to enjoy, to be entertained with. And it's a fun movie where you know all the actors had fun playing in it. In a way, ""Sin City"" is like Rodriguez' revenge on Tarantino, it's his own star-studded movie with Michael Madsen from ""Reservoir Dogs"", Bruce Willis from ""Pulp Fiction"" and a female casting instinct that has nothing to envy on Tarantino, from Rosario Dawson as a luscious dominatrix to the unforgettable Carla Gugino who makes quite an entrance in the film. But I must say Mickey Rourke makes the most durable impression, and I have the feeling that his come-back that pinnacled with ""The Wrestler"" started with ""Sin City"".""Sin City"" is a gem, one of the best films of the last decade, a masterpiece of Pop Culture, and Rodriguez' most mature and complete movie. He who asked his friend Tarantino to tell a joke in ""Desperado"" asked him to direct a part in ""Sin City"", it was the car scene between Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro. I have less to say about that moment than this touching interaction between the two directors, there is something of Lucas and Coppola in them, Coppola was already an established director in 70's yet he always supported Lucas and encouraged him to push the envelope as best he could. In a way, ""Sin City"" is Rodriguez' ""Star Wars"".",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""unfilm"" movie and mix of two media - but the wrong way","I really don't know if it's a mistake from Rodriguez, who couldn't tell a story in right way, or pedant Frank Miller, bad screenwriter (for example: Robocop 2 and 3), who wants an adaptation word from a word and comics picture to a same movie picture, but effect is interesting experiment and mix of two medias --- in a wrong way... Sin City is so silly, so manner (and over hyped) and schizophrenic (colour of the blood), and what's important - not a noir or neonoir! Noir movies have cynical main character, voice-over which tells what happens in the twisted story, but never says, what character thinks in a way of Sin City, and game of light and shadow was was never accidental. Some actors overplay (Rourke, Rutger), ""underplay"" (Del Toro, Owen), was funny in emotional scene (Alba, Dawson), or just totally out (Wood and Madsen)... ""Sin City - City without oar live"", how somebody said, has last 5 minutes of the film which aren't from any of the Frank Miller's book, but that sequence destroys all the atmosphere with a Mobil phone and medical machines, and it's bad pointed and timed... Movie wasn't have a temp or even rhythm, just static camera and circus music, bloody scene are so over stylized it's funny (maybe it was be funny?), but Sin City isn't glorification of violence. Sin City is just a wrap, nothing under it.P.S. I apologize for my English, but I'm from Czech Republic.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Relentless,"Sin City is incredible to look at. It's the boldest cinematic statement since early Coen Brothers. It's stark, compelling and the closest, most pure example of a graphic novel ever brought to life.That considerable achievement aside, I hated it.It's the story of a hard-as-nails hero, beaten and bloodied, who fights unspeakable evil in order to save the gorgeous girl, the flower growing in the gutter.Then it's the same story. Over and over again, until I felt as relentlessly battered by the film as poor old Marv.Yes, it's a little repetitive. Four stories are told - the story of tough cop Hartigan (Willis) bookends the stories of Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Dwight (Clive Owen). But essentially it's the same tale of twisted murderers, heroes who can take 20 bullets and still live and the most glamorous hookers you will ever see.I have to give the film credit for staying true to the source material, unfortunately that material is moronically juvenile as this, with laugh-out-loud risible dialogue, and lots of adolescent-friendly scenes of girls with guns.I just wish the same artistic vision could have been applied to a genuine noir classic novel. Sin City has all the cool of James M. Cain, but none of the soul. It's empty, it's shallow and a huge waste of talent.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the Year's Ten Best,"I always said that when it comes to a live concert you always know it's good when it appears like the band is having more fun than the audience. Well, in the case of Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" it appears as though Miller and veteran filmmaker Robert Rodriguez had more fun making this film than we do watching it.The film is compiled nearly panel for panel, word for word from Miller's groundbreaking series of graphic novels. This is obviously a labor of love and it is so evident to the viewer while taking it all in.There is no screen writing credit because they worked directly from the comics and Rodriguez was kicked out of the Director's Guild of America when he insisted that Miller get co-credit for directing the film. After all, he set up all the shots years earlier when he created the comic, both drawing and writing it from scratch.This film had me on the edge of my seat from the intro to the end keeping my eyes wide open, causing them to dry up a bit because I couldn't manage to keep my peepers off the beautifully glorious black and white opera of violence that unfolded before me.The film is three different stories, all taking place in Basin City. The sign entering the town has the BA in BASIN spray painted out, hence SIN CITY. The stories involve crooked senators and priests, cannibalistic serial killers, pedophiles, murderers, strippers and more. Surprisingly it all fits together rather well. Though the violence may be a bit much for some I found it to be justified right and proper. After all, this film is based on a disturbing series of graphic novels that never tried to dull itself down, but instead embraced its characters and respected the intelligence and taste of its readers.The cast is absolutely perfect from the amazingly beautiful Jessica Alba as stripper Nancy Callahan, to Bruce Willis as the over-the-hill with a bum-ticker Cop, John Hartigan, to Mickey Rourke as Marv, the revenge filled monster out for blood. I believe that this is Rourke's finest performance as an actor and I would probably award him as the Best Supporting Actor of the Year. Although Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain), George Clooney (Syriana), Ed Harris (A History of Violence), and Paul Giamatti (Cinderella Man) were all excellent, I don't think they carried their respective films the way Rourke did here. Let's also not forget Rutger Hauer and Clive Owen throwing in some head turning roles in this comic-book movie masterpiece.All in all, a brilliant Tour-De-Force from journeyman Robert Rodriguez who did everything from Visual Effects Superviser, to editing, to cinematography, to sound re-recording mixer, to co-directing of course.

Sin City:The Docs Review,"Probably the best film in ages a unique,brilliant,beautiful,and violent piece of art from Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez.Sin City contains some of the most beautiful visuals that are mostly black and white with highlighted colour creating an original,sleek,stylized look.The gigantic cast which includes Mickey Rourke,Bruce Willis,Clive Owen,Jessica Alba,Elijah Wood,Brittany Murphy and dozens of other big stars all give faithful and stunning performances particularly Mickey Rourke.Based on the graphic novel series Sin City is 3 separate stories of love,passion,betrayal,anger,violence,justice,and redemption.One follows a police officer who winds up being framed as a rapist when in fact he was the one who saved the little girl,another follows an ugly man who spends one night with a friendly hooker who is killed while sleeping,another is about a clandestine lady's man whose sole mission is to protect them from what they've already protected themselves from.Every story is a bloody tale of revenge with kills and death scenes more gruesome than Saw or The Devil's Rejects.The action is comic book style bar brawls,and contains plenty of gun action and hand to hand combat.The number one thing though is the violence is so brutal it becomes beautiful just by the way the film shows it.Generally you don't look at a man holding a severed head and say ""gee that looks like a really good painting"" but Sin City finds a way to make every frame look like gorgeous Gothic art.The dialog is 100% percent film noir and totally Quentin Tarantino like who by the way directs one brilliant scene in the film as a guest.Basically if you found Kill Bill,Domino,Pulp Fiction,From Dusk till Dawn,or Reservoir Dogs entertaining Sin City will please you guaranteed.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Awful from start to blessed finish,"The most striking aspect of Sin City, aside from its amazing cinematography, is that it's in the wrong medium entirely. Based on a series of graphic novels by Frank Miller, Sin City manages to be both provocative and ridiculous, and to achieve the former it requires that the viewer not only suspend disbelief but throw it out of the window of a moving car over a large body of water.The movie is split into three stories that overlap each other slightly: ""The Hard Goodbye,"" ""The Big Fat Kill,"" and ""That Yellow Bastard."" All of them take place in a mythical hellhole called Basin City, whose appellation is, of course, shortened by all who reference it, given the death and sex and violence and other varied depravities that take place in it.In the first story, Marv (Mickey Rourke) is an ugly, scarred thug who wakes up to find that the girl next to him in bed, Goldie (Jaime King) has been murdered during the night - and that the cops are on their way to get him for the crime. Marv doesn't go quietly, naturally, and vows not to rest until he's found Goldie's killer and avenged her. The second story is about an ex-photographer (Clive Owen) who - with the help of gun-totin', knife-wielding hookers - kills a cop and then has to cover up the crime. And the third story is about an honest-joe cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who saves a little girl from molestation and death - but is himself framed for the crime.If the movie had been presented in realistic animated form, it would have been such an easier sell. When I watch a cartoon, I know that the anvil landing on Wile E. Coyote's head isn't hurting the poor canine. But I do expect that most of the laws of physics should apply - if the coyote throws something into the air, it will indeed come down eventually. When I watch a live-action movie, I expect every one of the laws of physics to apply - or, at least when they don't quite follow those rules, my brain doesn't register it and instead focuses on the nifty special effects.But this movie is kind of stuck in the middle. Marv runs *at* a speeding police car and jumps at it, his legs driving into the windshield. Okay, if that were a cartoon I wouldn't give it a second thought. If it were a live-action movie, I might - unless Marv were some supervillian bent on world domination and his ability to jump into windshields at 80 mph could thus be explained. But because he wasn't - he's just some giant schlub with a lot of scars - my brain immediately did a double take - ""Huh? Wha?"" Aside from logic, there's the dialog itself. In comic books - sorry, graphic novels - the dialog is *supposed* to be melodramatic, even stilted, especially when the story is set in a noirish age (think 1940s New York City). But in a live-action movie, this just plain doesn't work. Indeed, the dialog was completely unconvincing and insincere; it sounded more fitting for the back of a cereal box. Miller's dialog was childish and absurd; at no point did his words allow me to buy into the entire concept of a ""translated"" graphic novel. (Example: On two occasions someone utters, ""Yeesh!"" in reaction to some kinda bloody mess. Who in the world says ""Yeesh""? Honestly.) The very first scene - a meeting between Hartigan and his partner, Bob (Michael Madsen) was howlingly awful, and I initially thought the dialog was intentionally being exaggerated for (melo)dramatic effect. Then I quickly discovered that the entire movie was going to be like that, that this wasn't some sly commentary about how awful the dialog was in old-time mystery films.Given that Robert Rodiguez co-directed (with Miller) and that Quentin Tarantino was listed as a ""guest director,"" I expected some wit, even if it were in the form of gallows humor. Sadly, none was to be found, and the movie was instead as soulless and empty as the denizens of Sin City itself. The bad guys weren't charming, the good guys weren't normal, and even the reverse wasn't true. No one was likable, which is a good thing in a purportedly gritty crime drama, but neither was anyone unlikeable; the fact is, I didn't care anything about the characters one way or another, and that's a serious misstep on the part of the screenwriter.Far too long (124 minutes, but it felt like five hours), Sin City misfired for me on all cylinders. Booze, broads, and bullets (to take a phrase from the film) are all great, but even the explosions and gun-play - not to mention scads of scantily clad women holding said guns - couldn't overcome the vast pile of ineptitude in nearly all aspects of the movie, from casting to dialog to pacing to good IL' fashioned logic. Only saving grace is the excellent cinematography, but it's not enough to rescue an abysmal effort.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Should hate it, but I love it.","Films, novels, and comic books (and everything in between) share one thing in common  they have to sell the world they exist within or else they will not succeed. The audience has to accept the rules and conditions of the said film/novel/comic book before they can get into it and truly like it. I have trouble getting into the world of comic books usually because I don't really care to accept their world and go with it; I'd rather do other things.However, I loved the world Frank Miller inked for Sin City.I loved how far over the top Sin City dared to go  utterly ridiculous and far-fetched that it almost begs critics to trash its silliness  I can't think of many films that match the sheer outrageousness of Sin City. A sense of outrageousness that has earned lesser films a razzie or two (or twenty). However, Sin City executes the impossible with such lighthearted expressionistic grace . . . a dark, twisted, perverted version of lighthearted that gets a hard-R rating for violence and nudity, but lighthearted none-the-less.This is the world of Sin City, presented with no apologies, justification, nothing. Either take it or get lost.I found it particularly intriguing how some of my usual complaints and biases towards comic-books didn't pop into my mind. Usually when characters die and come back to life, or refuse to die when they should, I wind up sighing, shaking my head, and thinking how much it reminds me of a certain overrated slasher franchise. Sin City commits these same crimes, and my response was along the lines of, ""Yeah Marv! Rock on!""Also, the film's structure sat surprising well with me. Usually following three (technically four) sets of characters through different episodal-style narratives yields shallower characters in a story that might as well be whimsical, or to be perfectly frank (no pun) it spells death. However, Miller, Rodriguez, and the film's entire cast managed to convince me that more went on in these characters lives  that the camera only follows them around briefly  and in a sense develop the characters without developing them (read: without regurgitating pages of boring back story no one cares about anyway). I was eager to hop into each new story and ride with each set of characters through their own individual adventure. Especially Marv . . . I liked all the stories and characters, but Marv (played brilliantly by Mickey Rourke) was the man.The visual style of Sin City is a sight to behold, and a landmark for Comic-book adaptations. I adore the look of Sin City  how in this world the laws of physics are exaggerated, key colors show through, how the weather obeys the right cues as the camera glides gracefully and naturally into position to capture that film noir graphic novel vibe. The cinematography, lighting, the cityscapes - they're all characters in Sin City, and prominent characters at that.In closing, I find Sin City most amazing in that it has dozens of elements that have made me loath other films through the years  I never thought I'd see excessive nudity, excessive violence, overabundance of CG, divided narrative style, and 'silly' comic book characters all in the same film, and I never dreamt I would like that film.But I did.",,Anonymous,Crime
Astonished and Thoroughly Entertained,"This movie is awesome! It's a great action flick and I loved the writing. I'd never heard of Frank Miller before (*hangs head* sorry) and I loved these stories. The actors are all excellent and play their parts perfectly. Elijah Wood is amazing and very surprising, and certainly made me forget he was Frodo - fantastic young actor who I know we'll see much more of in the future. I wish Nick Stahl could get a role as a ""good"" guy though some time in the future. After this movie and Bully I don't know how likable he is :-) The visuals are one of my favorite aspects of this film. There's the typical kinds of eye candy but there's also so much more besides the women and violence. The use of color was something I don't think I've ever seen before except maybe in foreign films. The humor was the most unexpected part of the film but superbly done and definitely kept the movie rolling along at a nice pace. I don't want to give too much away but this is a definite must-see and must buy, for sure. I only wish I would've taken someone to see it with me instead of going alone because I could be discussing it with them right now instead of making comments here. :-) Oh, and I'm a 26 year old straight female in case that helps y'all better gage my comments.

The perfect film.,"This movie is really one of the best of 2005. I'm appalled that it's being totally ignored at the Oscars. Never has there been a comic book movie that sticks so close to the source material that you don't have to read the comic after seeing the movie, even though you should, because you'd appreciate the movie more.The acting is great. The only one I really had a problem with was Alexis Bledel, but even she wasn't that bad. This movie looked good right off the bat with such an ensemble cast. Clive Owen was perfect as Dwight, a man trying to keep people safe from a maniac cop. Mickey Rourke literally brought the character of Marv to life in the best performance of his career.Sin City keeps you on your toes with non stop action, plenty of humour, and cool moments that bring a smile to your face. The dialogue in the comics and therefore in the movie is so snappy that it will probably be a popular movie to quote in years to come. Ever since I saw this movie, I've had the urge to narrate my life. It's just so cool.Definitely see this movie, you won't regret it. A truly classic film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Art come to life.,"If there is one reason only to watch this movie, never mind the exceptional acting chops, the spot-on storyboard, and anything else you can think of, Sin City is, without a doubt, one of the most visually impressive movies of all time. There has been never been a movie like this where the comic art form has been brought so close to life in all its shape or form. Sin City brings true originality in its medium.A few short stories, based on Frank Miller's Sin City comic, are brought to life on the big screen.Being brought to film, for this comic book, is like bringing life to this world. How color is so brilliantly used, from Becky's eyes to Goldie's hair. Or the silhouette shading, cleverly used on Becky's crosses or when Dwight's drowning in the tar pits. Never mind that the scripting and stories themselves hold their own in this visual masterpiece.

The combination of the brilliant characters and the continued suspense and sheer shock of the story has led me to believe that Sin City is the best Movie of 2005. The blood thirsty 'can you believe that happened' is a tribute to both Rodriguez and Terrentino. To further my point about outrageous characters, Frodo Baggins (Friendly Elijah wood) plays a prostitute hungry cannibal. The cast is filled with stars who play each role exceptionally well. Find out for yourself and take a ride into an underworld crawling with scumbag's, ruled by cutthroat women, and saved by noble heroes.

Frank Miller's Masterpiece,"Whoa!

Graphic movie of graphic novel,"I haven't read the source material, and so I can't address whether the film was faithful to its source. In general I liked this film, but not ravingly so.

I thought Mickey Rourke was especially good, and it took me some time to realize it was him. The computer effects in this film were less distracting for me than those of Sky Captain.I enjoyed the film, and I would not discourage anyone from seeing it.

Incredible! Fan of graphic novel & now fan of the film,"I had the misfortune to read several critics reviews of the movie before going in to see it and I was a bit worried. I heard things like bad dialogue, poor special effects, and too much violence. I had feared that perhaps, even though Frank Miller partially directed, that the movie would not stick to the graphic and well-written comics of the Sin City series. Why did I ever doubt!?! This movie was fantastic! First off, it's style is original and bold with a huge lot of characters performed by A-list actors that are well cast. Bruce Willis the best in my opinion although I suspect many moviegoers will choose Mickey Rourke's Marv as their favorite. There are no blurry CGI effects like you see in Star Wars and the most recent Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow. Yes, you can see it's CGI, but it's only noticeable because it's supposed to look like the comic book - not real life. Rodriguez makes sure it's bold and bright and I give him major credit for pulling it off. My fiancé, a graphic designer, raved about the amazing shadow work - something I've never heard him do in the recent CGI films of the past few years.As for those who dislike the dialogue I counter it was simply sticking to the source material. I would also say if you're unfamiliar with film noir you may be left cold. I am a fan of old Bogart films so I thought the wording was perfect. Sin City doesn't take place in modern day Earth - this is a dimension all to itself and it was written to be very detective-novel-esquire.As for the violence, it's all there from the novels. I have to give Rodriguez props again for sticking to the source material and steering away from a cheesy 'Hollywood' ending. I loved every minute of the action.Finally, this movie is a great film for the new anime female generation. The women of Sin City are amazingly strong and when I first read the graphic novels when I was in college I thought it was some of the best female characterizations I'd ever read. I'd say if you're a girl and hesitant to go see it, don't. It's portrayals of women are about a hundred times better than any of the more recent 'sci-fi' genre films.I can't wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

As mindless as it is violent,"Sin City is the definition of style over substance. Yes, Rodriguez's direction does make the film look like a comic book (sorry, graphic novel). Wow, neat.There is nothing else of any interest in this film. The three stories are Schwarzenegger fare. The ""characters"" are two-dimensional thugs. The women are all helpless damsels in distress--even the gun-toting prostitutes of Old Town, who do little to help themselves while Clive Owen pretty much single-handedly saves the day. He does have help from Miho, a Japanese woman who of course wields an arsenal of ninja and samurai weapons instead of guns, as well as possessing seemingly supernatural powers. That's just one example of how the film relies on shorthand to tell us everything we need to know about the characters so that it can fit in more killing.It pains me to see so many comparisons to film noir. This film has more to do with the ultra-violent comic books of the 50s that prompted the Comics Code Authority to censor them, nearly wiping out the medium altogether. My question is, if Rodriguez wanted to make a throwback to those books, why not make a film that shows that violence can serve a purpose in such a story, and should not be censored, rather than something based on how totally sweet it is to see people get shot?",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Encore!  Encore!  Encore!,"Absolutely stunning and extremely hard hitting urban thriller based upon three Frank Miller graphic novels and in return, you get ""Sin City"" (Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino share the directing duties) and the title itself doesn't lie.Three tales take place throughout the film, each one is excellent, very creative, the visuals are the icing on the cake, and considering which yarn stands out in my view, the one involving Marv (Mickey Rourke in his best role in years), a vengeful loner who sets to find out who was responsible for killing Goldie (Jaime King), a woman who Marv was with at night and framing him in the process. However, another tale, this one involving Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a former cop who vows to prevent a pedophile (Nick Stahl) dubbed ""The Yellow B--tard"" due to his appearance is literally frightening (and I mean more frightening than Freddy Krueger) from harming Nancy (Jessica Alba).If the visuals and the music make the movie very creative, then you have to mention the cast for sure.

A good Neo Noir... it's been a while.,"Although those of you in the States have has Sin City floating around since April, Europe just saw this adaptation of Frank Miller's gritty comic book series hit cinema screens last week.

For starters, it's NOT Film Noir, I'm not gonna go through what makes a film, Film Noir, just know that Sin City is not Film Noir, it is in fact more accurate to call it Neo Noir. That being said, it mimics what made old Film Noir classics like Double Indemnity closely, with a bit more violence, cursing and of course naked women.What it presents us with is a unique style of film that really you should go and see just for that, it's unique visuals make it worth while. Unfortunately that's it's weakness. Rodriguez was so caught up in transferring Miller's comic to life he left the characters as flat as they were on the pages. With little to no character development you'll either hate the characters or love them.The script didn't let down, it followed the noir style closely, fast talking and each story narrated by the main character is a typical ""detective"" way. Again this is a thing you're either going to love or hate.

"Overly violent, sexist garbage.","I have not read Frank Miller's comic books that this was based off of (though I was told this was a pretty faithful rendition and he codirected) so these comments are only about the movie (though they may apply to the comics as well).Let me just get the positive comments out of the way. I liked the style of the movie. The black and white with just touches of colors was very nice. The old film noir style feel, with the old cars, the cheesy dialogue, the references to ""broads"" and ""dames"" was all pleasing. Even as I found the constant violence off-putting I was still able to appreciate small touches, like the fact that the blood ran white.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is crap. I was just dying to get out of there, so it seemed endlessly long. I should have known there were going to be problems when I saw Robert Rodriguez (having unfortunately suffered through Dusk to Dawn) and Quentin Tarantino (who I feel is a derivative hack) in the credits. Both seem to like to show excessive violence just for shock value. (Don't get me wrong, I don't have an automatic aversion to violence, I like John Woo films - i just don't like the lingering shots of needless/gory violence.)IMO, the film has three MAJOR flaws, all dealing with the idea of gender. The flaw is that the film is misogynistic - women are nothing but sexual objects and victims. The second (relating to the first) is it's portrayal of men as the rescuers of women. Third, the portrayal of a girl/old man ""love"" story.***Spoilers start here***First problem: Every woman in the film was a whore, a stripper or a woman of loose morals. Even when the men worshiped them as ""angels"" it was always merely for their physical appearances. And yes, the men weren't all that great themselves, but there was still a wider ranger of character than just sexual object. Furthermore, the women were constantly naked or nearly naked. Even the social worker had to be shown naked. Once again, I don't mind nudity, if it fits the story, if it's tastefully done and if it's both sexes. However in this case, it seemed to be there just because the directors liked to show female T&A whenever possible. There was no male nudity (of course).Secondly, most of the men in the film (all the main characters) seemed to operate on the assumption that they were rescuing women. Women were helpless (sexual) objects that had to be rescued from serial killers, serial rapists, abusers, pimps, etc. Needless to say there was a disturbing amount of violence against women shown. Even when the film pretended to make a nod towards ""empowered women""- they still failed and had to be rescued. For example, the stripper girl needed a 68 year old man to help her; an entire town of armed whores still needed one man to save them; and delusional psychopath goes on a killing rampage to avenge his ""love"" after a one night stand with a hooker.Which brings me to the third problem, the incredibly disgusting relationship between the 19 year old and the 68 year old. Now, Harold & Maude is one of my favorite movies, so even though the age difference is disgusting to me, clearly I can overcome that natural revulsion when presented with the right couple/circumstances. Apart from the usual grossness of old men preying on young women, the whole relationship was disturbing. We have a 60 year old cop save an 11 year old girl from rape and gruesome torturous death. The cop is abandoned by everyone, goes to jail and only the girl stays true to him. He clings to her image of innocence and makes her into some sort of ideal image to obsess over. When he is released 8 years later, he goes to find her and make sure she is OK. Where it becomes truly disturbed is when he finds out that she is now a sexy stripper and they decide they are in love. This is a highly inappropriate and sick relationship. She's 19, he's 68. They know nothing of each other (or we can at least presume he thinks he knows her because she wrote him letters - but she knows nothing about him). Shis is clearly suffering from hero worship because he rescued her. He's clearly focused on her as the one last good thing he's done and loves the idea of her as a little girl/and then later as a sexy stripper. It was so revolting I wanted to puke in the theater....and they wonder why women comprise a smaller percentage of comic book readers.... maybe if they stopped putting out this kind of sexist crap, we could get into it more. Until then I will continue to avoid this kind of crap and focus on graphic novels that provide *clothed* characters that are not 1 dimensional with a strong plot that does not rely merely on the shock value of graphic violence.I suggest you avoid this movie and do not pay money to reinforce the notion that these are the kind of comic adaptations we want to see.There are WAY better noir films out there, fairly good comic book adaptation; WAY better violent films and tons of other T&A movies to watch instead!",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Incoherent collage of stories,"I don't know what the film critics are so gaga about this movie. I've looked over almost every single one of the advanced reviews from so many and am at loss at their delusions over this movie. Too many directors can ruin a film. The viewer is left wondering the purpose of the first murder by the assassin. The second murder by the assassin is easy to figure. If this film was edited by a real editor, instead of Rodriguez, it would make a whole lot more sense. Characters who were dead just a moment ago are now alive.Any one over 50 will see this as some sort of 21st Century 1940's film noir done in semi-color format to look like a comic book. Rodriguez, who probably has never even a seen a 1940's black and white film such as the classic ""Laura"", ""The Ghost and Mrs Muir"", or ""The Mark of Zorro"", has created a collage of story plots incoherently pasted together.Any man who prefers women over guys will love many parts of this movie. Gail and many of her hooker friends, as well as Lucille, have the sweetest bods and look great almost naked through out the entire movie.I give this film six out ten stars at best.",,Anonymous,Crime
A modern masterpiece of film noir,"Robert Rodríguez, Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino come together to bring us this spectacular film based on Miller's comics that revives film noir. It is a collection of classic stories that are perfectly adapted to a current era. With a great cast of renowned and talented actors, we see a whole series of characters in this police anthology of crime and suspense. The movie offers action, mystery, sex, violence, blood and death. Everything you would expect from an action thriller aimed at an adult audience. The production manages to recreate the world of Sin City very well, making it partly feel like a 1950s movie. Much of the film shot in black and white is pretty spot on, with some parts or characters in color, including the blood, which stand out very well. Like most of Robert Rodriguez's films, everything is done mostly with digital sets that give the film a similar feel to the original comics. The artists Gregory Nicotero and Howard Berger do a good job with the makeup effects that mixed with the CGI look great. The soundtrack is not far behind, bringing together the composers Graeme Revell, John Debney and Carl Thiel who together with Robert Rodríguez manage to create a good soundtrack with a Neo-noir tone that fits well with the atmosphere of the film. Definitely, Sin City is both an excellent comic book adaptation and a great modern Neo-noir movie. My final rating for this movie is 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome Movie...,"I just saw this movie and it is one of the best I have ever seen! It's true to the material it is based on and makes me want more, more, more!! Why can't more movies be like this? I love some Alexis Bledel and Devon Aoki! Frank Miller, do more movies!!! The pace was quick and the style never ending. The casting was perfect especially with Mickey Rourke eating up every scene he was in. You just couldn't take your eyes off of his performance as Marv. Carla Gugino was also spot on but with limited screen time, which is understood if you have read the graphic novels. Clive and Bruce brought Dwight and Hartigan right off of the pages and I felt a compassion for them. Oh and of course Jessica Alba-- she is probably the most perfect woman on earth. Little Nancy Calahan....she grew up....she filled out...This movie my friends will keep audiences talking and wanting more for quite a while. 5 out of 5!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Seminal film noir and remarkable homage to the comic book genre,"There's a tradition in Edinburgh called 'Secret Cinema'. Each year, on of the art house cinemas hosts a season of seminal cult films after midnight, away from the main auditorium, in a private area that can only be entered via the back door. Cinephiles, appropriately garbed like French New Wave followers, crowd in to share the secrets. Watching selected surprise movies from yesteryear, there are 'oooohs' and 'aaaarhs' as the little known milestones in cinematic history and recognised, together with the palpable influence they have exerted in the years since their release. The audiences are always very discerning and appreciative.I can imagine seeing Sin City in such a setting. Packed rows marvelling at the aesthetic technological achievement, no less than the transmuting of distinctive comic strip characters into the speech, movements and situations of on-screen actors. I can imagine looking back over the intervening years since it had been released and seeing how filmmakers have learnt new approaches from this film, how in crasser hands each one of its tiny gems has been amplified into Oscar-winning blockbusters, how in film schools the methods have been critically observed and handed down.Except Sin City is not a blast from the past - it is out now, and with considerable fanfare.The buzz surrounding it should not persuade you to go out and see the film unless the content and methodology attract you - Sin City might be mainstream, but only just - and it would be better to describe it as adult art-house mainstream / thriller / crime with added big names.Firstly, the themes are as adult as the comic strip it is adapted from. Sin City, whether taken as a metaphor or an actual (if fictitious) place, is hardly a place for the feint-hearted. Basically it's a specialist movie in the heavy, mysterious film-noir mould, with almost constant voice overs and hard-boiled one-liners like some old Bogart films. Only it doesn't shrink from mutilation, castration, cannibalism or a host of other monstrosities. That we are aware of the mythological-like nature of the comic-strip characters doesn't completely detract from the stomach-churning inspired by such things, or from the genuinely moving scenes.Saying it contains heroes is maybe going too far. Some characters are just a bit more sympathetic than others. Like the exceedingly ugly Marv. He's been framed for murder and the cops are in on it. He spends most of the film semi-deranged, searching for the one woman he loves, a whore who showed him a few moments of kindness and for whom he would do anything, including laying down his life. Or Hartigan. He's a cop, one of the ones with a shred of decency left in him. He risks his life to rescue a child from being raped and mutilated. Or Dwight. He dispenses some rough justice to a rather nasty and well connected gangster. Then there's Gail. She heads a women's prostitute cooperative that includes silent martial arts expert Miho and several Amazonian types kitted out in leather and carrying Exceedingly Powerful Guns. That's just the good guys. On the other side there's Yellow Bastard, deformed by treatment to try and restore the manhood, and who uses his victims for sexual titillation before framing their heads in the wall like sophisticated African trophies. A filthy minded Priest (less said about him the better) and Jackie Boy who 'never hits a woman' (or so he claims before he beats the sh*t out of his girlfriend). Or Becky, the dumb trinket-slinging whore that you would be better off not getting out of the car to speak to.Visually, the film is a bit like a comic strip with spot-colour in a half-world somewhere between 'reality' and artifice. In previous comic adaptations, the likes of Marvel heroes, Batman and Superman are fleshed out to be 'real' people and the audience is simply asked to accept the extra level of suspension-of-disbelief: In Sin City, the characters live in a murky underworld (L.A. a few years from now??) but, for all their apparent reality, will spin the wheels of a car or defy the odds in exactly the same way that a comic strip character would - simply because it looks cool. The effect is quite remarkable, and identifies the uniqueness of the comic strip as an art form probably better than any movie before. Sin City is less a comic strip turned into a movie than an homage to the comic strip genre.The finely tuned use of things like spot colour are also brought to magnificent effect. Standing on a balcony at night-time, colours are faded out, only slightly more than they would be naturally at that time, yet the red of the heroine's lipstick is saturated, quite appropriately - as you may have guessed, the morality of Sin City is one where women are women and men are men (or horrible caricatures of one or the other) and there's lots of dodgy chivalry but no-one sitting on the fence. The overall colour sense throughout is one of the things that sticks with you, like the constant rain. Sin City works as a piece of art and as sophisticated entertainment. It is no wonder that it has lost none of what must have been the intensity of the original, due in part no doubt to the presence of author Frank Miller as co-director. Other big names awash - Tarantino as guest director, Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, and Benicio Del Toro leading the action. For director Robert Rodriguez it is surely the most mature and compelling film to date. As Sin City 2 is still only pre-production, the best answer is to see this film at least once and then see it again - on the small screen it just won't be the same.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Saw the Screener - very impressive!,"I'm not much of a comic book fan, but this movie was really well done. Even if you forget about the experimental shooting and digital color, the story (stories)are so well written and acted that they alone hold the movie together.I think this film will achieve incredible critical success but may not do as well on the commercial side. Some of the dialog gets a little cheesy which may not go over well with some movie-goers.It was great seeing actors such as Bruce Willis, Benicio del Toro, Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy and countless others take a chance on being in a movie of such experimentation.

Sin and Circumstance,"Sin City is an interesting, hyper stylized little film that I can recommend, along with the cautionary heads up notice of the existence of a couple of problems. That's the simplest thing I can say about the movie. There are some great performances in terms of the nailing of characters from the source down perfectly but at the same time, there was one thing about the whole package that bugged me and I realized what it was just before the halfway mark of the movie. The movie is very faithful to the original Frank Miller graphic novels, with most of the film draped in shadows and dialogue that sounds like it was written by Chandler's ghost and while it is admittedly cool as all hell to actually see a project like this on the screen (projected digitally no less...), I couldn't shake the feeling that maybe, just maybe, the film was being a little TOO faithful to the novels. I felt that the movie didn't flow quite as well as it should have, mainly because it seemed to me the filmmakers were a little too obsessed with recreating every frame down to the last detail, so much so that it felt too obvious and aware of itself in a lot of the scenes. I felt like many of the performances were hampered by the restrictions on them placed by having to stick so closely to the graphic novels. Some of the dialogue scenes seemed to go on forever also, dragging the film in between moments of breathless violence, which were pretty intense. Don't get me wrong, it was still really fun to watch some of these pros in action, especially Benicio Del Toro, Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Elijah Wood who turns in a fantastically creepy turn as a silent cannibal in possession of some serious fighting skills. His character along with Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl, reminding us that the kid can play a really hateful character as well as the savior of the free world from the machines) gives the film a good amount of energy that good villains can bring to a story. Mickey Rourke gets a special mention from me for his work as Marv and proves as many others have done in the past before him that the world loves a great comeback as much as it loves to watch people get torn down. He's probably the best reason I can give you to watch this film, as he is arguably the heart and soul of it. The best performances come from those you normally expect to deliver, really. Some of the other performances kind of reeked with Michael Madsen coming to mind and Rutger Hauer doing more overacting than usual. Devon Aoki was awesome as Miho and Carla Gugino is going to be remembered fondly after this one, believe me. Jessica Alba didn't impress me too much character wise but damn, she's something to see, moving the way she does. The women are photographed with a lot of love and it's in this way that the movie really works hand and hand with the rest of the visuals. Some of the CGI is a little too obvious for my tastes but the look is perfect for this sort of thing in a way. Technically, the film is awesome but maybe it's just my appreciation for practical effects that makes me wish that there was less computer gimmickery. I can't help but wonder what this film would've been like if it had been shot on location rather than in front of a green screen. It's a cool effect that draws too much attention to itself after a while. In the end though, Robert Rodriguez made up for the all star vomit fest that was Once Upon a Time in Mexico with this. I have to give him credit for attempting something like this and I'd really like to see another Sin City movie done in the same way. Lastly, I also loved the music in the film.Sin City is a well produced gimmick film that regrettably starts to wear a little thin. I started getting a little tired of the whole idea soon after it started but these are dismissible gripes considering that there were still so many things to enjoy about it then there were to dislike. This is definitely one to see in the theaters, especially if you want to see a different kind of comic book movie and something pretty original.RATING: ***1/2 out of *****.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome Comic Book adaptation!,"Sin City (2005) was a complete surprise for me. When I went to go see this movie I thought it would be okay. I was in for a shock! The film-noir style and the sporadic uses of the primary colors was true eye candy. If video and computers are to be used in film making then this is what they're for! Film makers Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller should be given the glad hand for successfully bringing their visions to the silver screen. But the real star of the show is Mickey Rouke, his performance was so powerful that he almost wins back his cool points that he won (and lost) during the 80's.The all star cast really put in some effort into this production. No disappointments here (except the middle story dragged in places). I can't wait until the next film hits the theaters!Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very conservative movie but you feel refreshed,"I didn't know anything about the movie. I just watched it and found it weird, art and excellent. The beginning is really special done. You think this is gone be a borrowing romantic movie; very cliché but not at all. The movie is beautiful lighted with a lot of dramatic effects. The colouring is art like and well chosen. Bruce Willes puts himself in a daring movie. He gets a big 10 for this. His acting is very good and you can see him as an anti-hero. The movie theme's are very up to date. Cannibalism, child rape and a lot of other very psychopathic people. Its statement is very conservative but it works. And you feel refreshed afterwards.

A Dazzling but Uneven Display,"3 April 2005. This amazing looking film attempts to introduce graphic cartoon/novels into live action and does so very successfully along with an unfortunate Pulp Fiction interplay of various independent plots that is less than successful. This raw, intensely, graphic violent film replicates in great detail the actual feel and visceral experience of a adult film noire cartoon (the best to date, setting a new level of qualitative black and white retro film-making). This is a movie with male testosterone and male honor with a big, big heart. It explodes off the screen (not page) with a punch that hits to the core. However, one wonders how much more powerful the movie would have been if it had actually followed a linear comic book line instead of interspliced scenes. The movie successfully exploits the emotional buttons as well as the over-the-top rampage of devastation that is rarely allowed on the screen R-Rated through probably deletion of the most obscene scenes (with most of it directly suggested). This movie also is reminiscent of the physical mayhem in Clock-Work Orange. Seven out of Ten Stars - could have been a complete knockout, but it threw in a few too many punches.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
total *beep*,"Why should I even bother writing anything about that? Because I'm extremely annoyed of having waisted 1 hour of my time !(I could not make it through the entire thing) And also because I'm extremely worried of the direction Cinema is taking...I remember a time when we valued:-actors' craft (I mean, real actors like Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Alec Guinness, Max Von Sydow, Marcello Mastroianni, Bruno Ganz, and more recently people like Jeremy Irons, Geoffrey Rush, Robert De Niro etc...),-directors' artistry (real directors like Ingmar Bergman, Francois Truffaud, David Lean, Cohen brothers, Theo Angelopoulos, Wim Wenders, Volker Schlondorff, Jean-Jacques Annaud, Luc Besson, Robert Benton, Roland Joffe, Terence Malick etc...)-Screenwriters or great authors (from Charles Dickens and Jane Austen to Paul Auster, Virginia Woolf or Philip Roth...)-cinematography (Nestor Almendros, Sven Nykvist...), soundtrack (ennio Morriconne, Rachel Portman, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Nini Rota...)But maybe all of that is not important, and maybe we can make movies without it: with terrible actors instead, terrible cinematography, terrible directors, terrible stories as long as we put sex and violence in it. And it will become a blockbuster (it is SO important to make money that we tend to forget about making art) and thousands of people will come on IMDb and give the ludicrous vote of 8 out of 10!

Sin City.,"I saw an advanced screening of Sin City on March 16 and thought a lot about it. It was a very modern film noir type of movie with predictable events. the predictability didn't ruin the movie though and that's something hard to do. the dialog really matched the characters well. there were a few low points. One that included Brittany Murphy's character. she seemed to have overacted compared to the other actors. Josh Hartnett seemed like he was just hanging there. He came, went, and came back without much of story. They didn't explain what or who he was. One might have to watch it a couple of times to ""maybe"" understand his role in the movie. The beginning was a little slow, but picked up the pace within the first ten minutes. there were many high points and that's what made me like and appreciate the movie for what it was trying to be. the action scenes were impressively good. it was funny seeing Elija Wood anything other than the hobbit, but he pulled it off well. the cinematography, lighting, and editing was very good and kept me hooked on each scene. it's usually hard to stay focused on a B&W movie. I give it an 8 out of 10 or B.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Like many of the characters, I was blown away","I find it very hard to describe this movie in a manner that words will do justice. Similar to comic book medium, most of the story is based upon visual format. With that being said, this movie is an absolute orgy for the eyes.Without repeating what most others have previously indicated so eloquently, I'll just add that about 5 minutes into the first scene, I felt like I was in an F-15 Eagle; full after burner ascents, cork screws and under black-out condition g-forces for the next 2 hours SOLID. The ONLY negative was just that. You never get to come up for air, and I felt mentally exhausted (while still exhilarated) after the credits began to role.Two things about this amazing tour de force that really stood out with me: 1). This was the role Rourke was born to play. If he isn't nominated for an Oscar, then something is terribly twisted in Tinsel Town. Again, I can't even begin to describe his portrayal of Marv, other than to say once we recognized him as this character, the screen was simply alive with blistering energy. Then factor in other exceptional performances put in by Del Toro, Alba, Owen, etc., and he still rises head and shoulders above the others. It's going to be remembered as one of the finest anti-hero performances ever. 2). Not too many movies completely pervade my thoughts long into the night. My wife and I had plans afterwards, but all we could do was talk about what we just experienced. NO MOVIE had ever completely occupied my thoughts the following day. I still find myself wickedly drawn to the impressions I'm left with.10 out of 10  my highest praise possible.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

An Unimaginable Experience!!,"I have experienced this movie in theaters and finally had the courage to show my dad how seriously the movie had an experience on the appealing audience!!! I saw this movie whenever it hit the theaters. I finally got the courage to show this movie to show my father, who evidently believes that this movie is a cartoon-sh style flick that Robert Roddiguez and Quentin Tarintino try to make the audience appeal to whenever they try to create a new movie. But I do not believe that it is true and that is has an affect on this film! I finally dragged him to see this film and few day ago at the dollar cinema because he did not believe in the cinema affects that I had the privilege to appreciate on the big screen! Whenever he judged the movie I knew he was wrong to confuse a hard-earned movie to its fullest potential! Whenever I viewed the movie to him, he was to fulfill the plot holes to himself. You see, he believed the movie to be fake and not appeal to the audience abroad. He believed that the movie was fake because the cinematography was fake and that the script did not appeal to him as an individual who took graphic novels appealing to a person who who can judge an individual, as frank miller, as an director with his perception on his graphic novels, would be portrayed on the big screen. I am glad that I showed my father of the film that Robert Rodiguez portrayed on the big screen. I can only hope that other people can find an change of heart to their family members in this film, because this film does not appeal to the women of my family and I do not think it will ever find a change of heart towards them.

Visually interesting and gritty but uneven and a bit overbearing.,"Stylish and visually inventive, this graphic novel adaptation uses more CGI than it does colour - digitally creating a monochrome world and inserting our hard-boiled heroes into it. 'Sin CIty (2005)' is usually entertaining, if uneven, and unconventionally 'vibrant', as close to page-perfect as possible - for better or worse. Yet, it's often overbearing and even has an undercurrent of sexism to it. Its sickly, ham-fisted dialogue and clumsy, knock-off noir narration overflows like bile, despite the fact that its tongue is allegedly planted firmly in its cheek. It also lacks any real substance, despite being aesthetically arresting; it's the sort of thing that thinks it's 'mature' simply because it's violent and has boobs in it. Also, its anthology style makes for some stories that work better than others, but creates a somewhat disjointed overall feel. The flick is still decent, though; it's probably worth watching for its visuals alone. Just don't expect anything close to a masterpiece. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""SIN""fully good!

(Dirs: Frank Miller & Robert Rodriguez; ""Special Guest Director"" : Quentin Tarantino)""Sin""fully Good  Makes PULP FICTION look like BEACH BLANKET BINGO; the year's best film (thus far)Fanboys and novices alike (myself included on the latter classification) will be hard-pressed to be disenchanted with the mega-violent, pulse-pounding, adrenalized realization/adaptation of Frank Miller's cult-classic neo-noir 'graphic novels' of SIN CITY thanks to the visionary genius of Robert Rodriguez for 'getting it'  actually making a film INTO a comic book; arguably the best of its kind and thus far in this anemic cinematic year the best film of 2005.Miller, who rose to acclaim in the late 80s early 90s with iconoclastic debunking of such cherished comic book superheroes Batman, Daredevil and Spider-Man, has a hardcore fan base who cherish the stark graven images of black and white in his SIN CITY books of depraved justice and injustices alike with anti-heroes newly forged with pitch-black souls beating hearts of gold and soft spots for dames in distress not the likes seen since the hey-day of Chandler and Spillaine with a unique look and no-holds-bar approach to the proceedings at hand.Wisely Rodriguez enlisted Miller to be a co-director (even if it meant quitting membership to the DGA when he was told Miller couldn't since he wasn't a member ; a ballsy solidarity pact if you ask me) in interpreting the amazing art work to the silver screen by employing literally copying panel-by-panel/frame-for-frame re-creations of the artist's trademark visuals that are etched amazingly on the big screen. Shot in dazzling black and white that glistens and glimmers while splotched with shades of color here and there to underscore the emotions that may be lost in translation, and largely improvised with state-of-the art digital/computer generated effects (practically every background, set piece et al is green-screened ala ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" but with a better budget and a more seasoned filmmaker that makes all the world of difference).The film is interlinked with three story lines from Miller's work in the dank dwellings of Basin City (the first two letters scratched out on its borderline welcoming sign giving the title of what it really is) that includes world-weary cop Hartigan (Willis; who else does noble rot so well and with echoes of Bogart to boot?!), who on the eve of his retirement and faced with a recently diagnosed bad ticker, is out to settle the score for a serial pederast in the sickly form of a politico's son (Stahl cannily channeling Peter Lorre) who kidnaps young girls to do unspeakable things to; a shady cat named Dwight (Owen, whose rugged good-looks are on fine display) hell-bent on keeping the peace between his lady, Gail (the deliciously devilish Dawson), the leader of a gang of hookers and the crooked police when bad blood is shed involving a brutal cop Jackie Boy (a barely distinguishable Del Toro having a field day at being a bastard echoing Robert Mitchum in all his squinty-eyed deluge); and sandwiched in between is the best chapter involving a borderline psychotic pugilist with a mug like an anvil meets The Elephant Man, named Marv (Rourke, in a Travolta-comeback plug, arguably the best performance of the film and one of the actor's greatest on screen characters) who wakes up in bed to find the goddess/whore Goldie (the insatiably gorgeous King) dead by the hands of another only being framed by a truly vile menace which leads to an unstoppable pledge on vengeance with one of the most violent on screen vendettas ever committed to celluloid. Rourke, buried under tons of truly incredible make-up, emotes like no tomorrow giving his hulking thug a sliver of humanity even as he's beating the hell out of all who come within his murderous rage-induced journey into hell.Included are scenes of aforementioned bloodshed of impaling, garroting, cannibalism, decapitations, disembowelments, amputations, shootings, stabbings, and two- count'em  two castrations (to one character!) Be that as it may it is all pertinent to its comic book trappings and underscores the themes of personal justices over the odds often with the do-gooders attempts not exactly coming up roses. Perhaps its nihilism is at an all-time low but in the balance of the grim story lines its only par for the course.Also on hand are the sexy Alba as the grown-up would-be victim of Stahl's lethal sex predator that Willis' Hartigan is re-united with, Gugino as the lush lesbian parole officer to the grotesque Marv, a spooky silent turn by Wood as Marv's nemesis, Duncan as a thuggishly crooked police enforcer, Hartnett as a silky-smooth hit-man, the stealth-like assassin Aroki, a crusty Booth as the corrupt politician Rourk, a Rod Stieger look-alike turn by Hauer as an unrepentant cardinal and for my money the funniest cameo by Katt as one of Duncan's hench-man who has the most hilarious commentary about a well-placed archery shot.Rodriguez, who co-wrote & co-directed with Miller (and let buddy QT do one gallows-humor sequence with Owen & Del Toro), also is credited with the superlative cinematography, co-produced, co-scored and edited the film, is a one-man unstoppable maverick of film-making who only seems to be getting better and better with each endeavor and clearly this is his masterpiece in this bloody valentine to noir and graphic novels.""Sin City"" makes ""Pulp Fiction"" look like ""Beach Blanket Bingo""; one of the year's best films and instant classic in the making.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Beautiful visually, but too over the top for me.","I really like the idea of a film noir set in a big city. While the film looks great in its gray and silver with occasional color, I just didn't like the story.The violence is WAY over the top as you would expect from Terentino. If you saw Kill Bill, you know what to expect.But overall, the story or should I say STORIES within this movie are confusing and somewhat boring. The idea that some of the characters have this super human strength is OK, but it is never really explained. I also didn't like the idea of the typical psycho pervert killer with the women. It basically ripped off the story of Silence of the Lambs again, and didn't do it anywhere near as well.But to the movies credit it did have some moments and was well made.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"If you were a fan of the Sin City books and you didn't love this movie, then you should just stop going to movies altogether","To say that Sin City is the most loyal adaptation of a comic ever is a bit of a misnomer, since ""adaptation"" isn't quite the word I'd use to describe what Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller were able to accomplish here. ""Adaptation"" suggests that they changed things from the comic in order to adapt it for the film. Instead, all they did was put clothes on a few of the characters, cut out the odd scene, and squished 3+ books together. Other than those small changes, Rodriguez basically just filmed the comics. He didn't just follow the plots, or the stories, or the characters, but also copied the dialogue word-for-word, and matched the shots panel-for-panel. Even if Miller wasn't present for all of shooting, he would have earned his co-director credit since his comics were the storyboards for the film. Rodriguez didn't decide where to put the camera, Miller did back in the 90's when he wrote and drew the books.This is as loyal a re-telling of any previous format, be it comics, novels, musicals, or an old film, that you are ever going to see. Future films can only match what Sin City did here, not surpass. If you were a fan of the Sin City books and you didn't love this movie, then you should just stop going to movies altogether. Because there is obviously no pleasing you.Visually, this film is a landmark accomplishment, and should contend with summer blockbusters like Episode III, War of the Worlds, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and Fantastic Four for visual effects Oscars. Some may argue that the film sacrifices substance for style, but to do so would miss the point. In Sin City, style IS the substance. Everything, from the use of black and white, to the hard-boiled dialogue, to the scantily-clad (and un-clad) ""dames"", to the violence and grit, is a nod to true film noir. The film is about the mood and feel as much as it is about the three stories it contains.I was completely blown away by the movie, and had it concentrated more on the story than the style, I doubt I would have even been interested in seeing it at all. I'm not usually into ultra-graphic violence, but I was completely enthralled. The movie was harsh, grim, visceral, action-packed, sexy, and shocking. And I loved every second of it.To be fair and balanced, this is a straight-up guy film. The wife HATED it (as I kinda figured she would). She thought it was visually interesting, but other than that, just a sick mess of violence, cheesy dialogue, and gratuitous nudity. Which is actually a fair assessment of the film. But she says it like it's a bad thing. Although, I will admit, that was pretty much my initial reaction when I read the original Sin City series (that makes up a third of the film) back in high school.The only minor quibble I had with the film is that Bruce Willis doesn't quite fit the Hartigan character he was cast as. He does a fine job, but is unconvincing as a 60 year old with a bad heart, even less convincing later on as a 68 year old man. I think Clint Eastwood was always the inspiration for Hartigan in That Yellow Bastard, but there's no way he was going to be in this movie. Sin City actually follows Willis' career pattern of following a string of poorly-received action movies with a part in quirky movies by up-and-coming directors. He spends most of his time making himself culturally irrelevant, until a Quentin Tarantino (who directed a scene in Sin City with Clive Owen and Benicio del Toro from The Big Fat Kill), M. Night Shyamalan, or now Robert Rodriguez comes along and rescues Willis' career.I give the movie 9 stars and want to see it again. And then many more times after that.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Absolutely Stunning,"""Walk down the right back alley in Sin City, and you can find anything"", and isn't that the truth. Sin City has everything a movie goer could want in a film. It has an amazing cast that portray their gritty characters with a distinctful hard edge and compassion, which is helped with a fantastic script. The movie is driven by the actors and their ability to make the audience feel as if though they are in the characters shoes as they describe with vivid details their emotions and conflicts, and the steps they mean to take to make things right.But it's not only a script or a great cast that makes this new tale of love and revenge come full circle, it's the images. Each scene is painted or drawn just like the pages right out of Miller's comic book that the film is based off of. The black and white makes the mood feel more dark and desolate (as it should be) making the city feel more alive. With it's splashes of color, one can only vast in it's brilliance. The visuals to this movie are unlike any I have seen and they should be recognized.The movie follows three stories that are interwoven by the characters passions and ambitions. They live in a city of power and murder and they seek what little honor or dignity they can find in such a dark place. The film open up with a sequence with Josh Hartnett and a beautiful women glowing with a red dress and rich red lips. Hartnett's narration of his thoughts are crucial and set the tone. He explains to this woman who is on the run that he is there for her, and that it's not her figure or face, but her eyes that attract her. Her holds a lighter near her cigarette and the flame fades her eyes to green, so that we may see the beauty. He tells he loves her and there's a whisper of the gun. Sin City in a nutshell.Mickey Rourke play Marv, a large man with a beastly looking face and temper to match. he falls in love with a woman who treats him kindly, but she is murdered and he is framed for it. Marv's quest and story in the film is to find the truth behind the murder and set things straight. Rourke does an excellent job in this movie, which was surprising to me. He brings life to a man that lives to get his answers by violently interrogating men and viciously murdering them. He does this by constantly reminding himself why he does what he does, for the woman that treated him nice.Clive Owen plays Dwight, who gets caught up in a kill that could shake a truce that keeps young women alive. His story is a little more shallow than the others, but the element that keeps it true is his willingness to see that none of the girls are hurt.Then there is Bruce Willis, who play Hartigan, the one honest man in the whole city. He rescues a young girl, Nancy, from the harm an lunatic pedophile (Nick Stahl). But Stahl's character is connected. His father (Powers Boothe) is a Senator and takes his anger of what Hartigan left his son out on him, by making Hartigan look responsible for kidnapping all the children his son did. Hartigan spends eight years in prison, helpless to keep Nancy safe, for it becomes his only will. When he gets out, he knows what he must do and knows that whatever it is, it must keep Nancy (Jessica Alba) safe.Sin City is one of the best movies of the year so far. It goes beyond the expectations of any mere action film and does it well. With a great story, strong cast, and amazing visuals, it will be easy to see why this film is absolutely stunning.Four out of four stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good and gory,"With a cast that rivals a Robert Altman film, Robert Rodriguez's latest film ""Sin City"" is, quite simply, Frank Miller's stories of the same name come to life. There are three main story arcs that intertwine in small ways: Marv (Rourke) a street tough with a rough looking mug goes to bed one night with a prostitute named Goldie (Jaime King) and wakes up with her lying dead next to him. When the police show up at his door a moment later, he knows he's been set up and he sets out to find the killer out of respect for her. In the second story, Dwight (Owen) finds out that Jackie Boy, (del Toro) the ex-boyfriend of his current girlfriend Shellie (Murphy) is not only an abusive jerk, but he is about to go wreak havoc on ""Old Town"", the red-light district of the city where the prostitutes (and his former girlfriend Gail, played by Rosario Dawson) hold court. In an attempt to protect Gail and the others, Dwight finds himself in a really bad situation that could cause a street war to break out, and put the lives of Gail and her girls in great danger. Finally, there is Hartigan (Willis) a retiring cop whose last case is to track down a pedophile, Rourk Jr. (Stahl) who has kidnapped a young girl. Hartigan tracks him down and administers justice, but Rourk's father is a corrupt Senator, and has Hartigan thrown in jail. Ten years later he finds out that Rourk Jr. is up to his old tricks and that his target is the same girl, Nancy (Jessica Alba), now grown up and an exotic dancer with a heart of gold who has been pining after Hartigan since her rescue. Hartigan must now save Nancy again and stop Rourk Jr. from exacting revenge.There are a lot of characters in ""Sin City"", and for the most part, the stories are fulfilling. I thought the first two were the best, but the Hartigan segment was not very compelling, though it was by no means terrible. There were some fantastic characters (I particularly loved Kevin, Elijah Wood's character, but it was such a bizarre and shocking character reveal that I didn't want to go into it in the summary because it's too fantastic experienced first hand.) The real story about ""Sin City"" is obviously its cinematography and appearance. Much has been made about the ""comic book come to life"" look of the film, but it really is true. As a former comic book fanatic, (though I have not yet read the Sin City series) I was delighted with the presentation. Blood spurts white as well as red against the stark black and white film, blue and green eyes glow from black and white faces, and the eyes of one of the most evil people in the film are obscured by the ominous glare on his eyeglasses. ""Sin City"" is a comic book lover/comic book film geek wet dream, put simply.This is actually a really difficult review to write, personally because I had to ascertain my feelings about the film without a prejudice I have toward a certain kind of violence. For no clear reason I have a big problem with decapitations and hangings, and unfortunately ""Sin City"" is rife with them. There were times when there were three or four minute scenes when I couldn't look at the screen. But if you don't have a problem with that specifically, you're in businessas long as you don't mind violence, and a great deal of it. I went to the film with six other people and four of them (all Kill Bill fans, mind you) were turned off by the excessive violence, though one of them didn't let that diminish his view of the film. Other than the head thing I was fine, but there was a great deal of slicing, dicing, some cannibalism, even castrations (yes, in the plural sense). Obviously, it is all done in a very cartoonish manner (particularly the scene between del Toro and Owen having a conversation in a car, the scene that Tarantino directed), and even some very violent moments were silhouetted, but the violence is pervasive enough to give me pause about recommending it to say, my parents.I find myself nearly salivating when I think of how cool the film looked, and if it weren't for certain elements I would certainly want to go see it again; it's kind of like being drawn to shiny things. Though I traditionally am a celluloid purist (I had issues even going to see ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow""), Rodriguez, probably one of the more schizophrenic directors we have working today (this is a far cry from Spy Kids, to say the least) really created something groundbreaking with ""Sin City"", and his vision and success with this medium really make me eagerly anticipate more. Without any prejudice, this film gets 8/10.--Shelly",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Problems with narrative structure mar beautiful surface,"Sin City is truly revolutionary. It is a stylistic masterpiece. The visuals are amazing in their blend of film noir, comic book styling, and use of color. This is the first time a comic has TRULY been brought to the screen.Unfortunately the narrative structure allowed this otherwise flawless movie to falter.The Sin City graphic novels are a collection of separate stories which occasionally loosely relate all in the place of Basin City. Each of the major characters of the film (Marv, Hartigan, and Dwight) have their own Sin City novel to stretch their arms in. Each is a story unto itself with its own beginning, middle, and end.Sin City the movie contains three of these individual novels under one heading ""Sin City."" The film's director, Robert Rodriguez, opted not to do the film in an episodic fashion...or did he? This is where the film falters. He could have chose to do three individual episodes, each beginning with its own individual title: Marv, Dwight, Hartigan. But Rodriguez chose not to, instead he wanted to film a single, cohesive whole. This could have worked. But it was haphazard. Instead of having the stories weave together, he left the Marv and Dwight stories as episodes, split the Hartigan story in half to bookend the episodes, and did something with Josh Hartnet to bookend the bookends. The trouble with this is that the audience starts to search for meanings and connections as soon as Hartigan reappears. And the dots did not connect - just opened more questions.I left the theater blown away by the visuals, but wondering if there was meant to be a greater story. I thought it might be the Roarke family...but the Dwight story had nothing to do with that. I thought it might be the prostitution community...but the Hartigan story did not deal with that.In the end, it felt like a movie that should have been episodic but had delusions of cohesion. Were the visuals not so amazing and the adaptation so reverent, I would give this a 5/10. But all things considered I give it an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Welcome to Sin City(Population: Fading Fast),"I had never read Frank Miller's short stories, nor anything else pertaining to Sin City, so I went into the theater tonight with a clear mind. And I think it helped. I loved it because it was all so new to me and if were familiar with his works, then I would have critiqued and pointed out every meticulous detail that differed from the comics. This really felt like an honest-to-God comic book coming to life what with the narration and black and white(save for a few colors) settings. This film featured a huge ensemble cast and each one brought something different to the table. My favorite performance was Mickey Rourke as Marv and I had no idea that was him underneath the make-up. Jessica Alba,Bruce Willis,Michael Madsen,Elijah Wood,Benicio Del Toro,Rosario Dawson(so damn hot!) all fit in nicely. I will not spoil anything because there is too much to cover but the basic premise is Marv looking for the killer of a prostitute named Goldie that had befriended him. There is a lot of violence in this film, but nothing over the top that would be considered controversial. 3 separate stories intertwine to make up an interesting and fresh movie.

Brilliant!,"In the first scene of this movie, I thought to myself how bad the acting and dialog was. But then I realized it's reading just like a comic book, that's how the dialog reads in a comic. The acting was superb, (besides the Michael Madsen scene in the beginning)and all the way through this movie it was just like reading a comic. I can't stress how unusual this is. Spiderman? The Hulk? Even Batman were all comic books formed into a movie, and any problem those movies had it was that they weren't true enough to the comic, or that it felt too much like a movie and not enough comic. Watching Sin City is exactly like reading a comic book. It's literally a comic book on screen. Anyone who enjoyed reading comic books will absolutely love the experience of watching this movie. For those who don't or haven't read comics, just in keep mind that this is how a comic feels. This is a true comic book movie, spider man, superman, hulk, x-men, and batman might as well of not even been a comic book when you watch the movie, watch Sin City and you swear you wore turning the pages of a comic book.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Incredibly violent but equally stylish; rather disconnected but unified enough.,"As a warning to anyone interested in it, I must immediately point out that ""Sin City"" is an incredibly violent film including two separate scenes of a characters genitalia being removed (once by gunshot, once by hand), a woman biting into the neck of another woman, pulling the veins back out in her teeth, a man stabbing another in the chest just as a warning, and more gunshot wounds than all the James Bond movies combined--and that's just the start. The violent carnage of the film is absolutely and brutally beyond compare. Now to comments about the film.""Sin City"" is both the ultimate expression of and the ultimate satire of film noir--presenting the black and white backdrops, hard-boiled older detective-esqe tough guy heroes, the hysterical, mysterious, barely clothed women, the maniacally powerful villains and evil murderers, and the over-the-top dramatic narration that defines that genre, but doing so to such an extreme that it becomes a self-parody (I prefer to think on purpose). There are several different stories in the film only loosely tied together by the last one (and rather predictably and clumsily so), but they are all tied by the fact that they are truly all explorations of this city where violence is the center of life.Robert Rodriguez's direction is definitely the film's true star. The black-and white look with the comic-book effect slanted rain drops (always, as in noir, present) and splashes of vibrant color is truly fascinating, and Rodriguez does explore the dramatic possibilities of black and white, perhaps reminding some viewers that color has disadvantages (though I'm betting it won't work on my father). The color, however, is seemingly random in when and where it appears, what gets colored, and what color it is. We see a red dress and red lipstick on the first woman we see, but shortly thereafter we see yellow blood, then blonde hair, then blue eyes, and there doesn't seem to be much of a common element to them. (The blue eyes are particularly unusual since they are used on one character who doesn't talk and one who talks too much.) Still, the look is so interesting that it does keep the viewer wanting to watch despite its weaknesses.Meanwhile, the film's cast is a star party. When Rutger Hauer (admittedly past his peak but still a star), Elijah Wood (who just starred in three of the biggest hit films of all time and then had a supporting role in the indy hit ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" another success), and Benicio Del Toro (a deserved Oscar winner who has had success after success for the last decade) are your minor stars; you have a huge, huge cast. Surprisingly effective in the film is Bruce Willis. While it's not too far off of his typical slightly beaten, slightly on edge tough guy, this role allowed Willis to use his natural charisma to its best and to show more emotion than he usually does, and he was more than up to the challenge. Meanwhile, the film's only casting choices truly worth note are Elijah Wood's surprising turn as a silent villain and Rutger Hauer's somehow fascinating single-scene role as ""the most powerful man in the state."" Wood doesn't have to perform at all, but his appearance is rather startling just because it is so out of place for the empathic-eyed former hobbit. Hauer, however, creates the film's most interesting character in only one scene of work--we know that Cardinal better from that scene than we know Marv from his entire chapter, it seems, and he is absolutely fascinating.The film also suffers some defects in its score, which is lackluster and recapitulate at best, and its oversexualized nature. Miller's world is sort of like the one in which Pete Dayton finds himself in David Lynch's brilliant ""Lost Highway,"" a hyper-masculine, unreal world of unabashed sex and violence. However, where Lynch's film explores this world as a part of a man's unconscious, Miller's world truly IS. And that makes the extreme violence and sexuality much more discomfiting than Lynch's. While I'm not one to ask for any kind of censorship or anything, I will say that it's an over-the-top sexually and violently explicit world to the point that it is unnerving.Overall, ""Sin City"" is a very stylish and rather interesting film. It's yet another attempt to bring back noir, like the aforementioned ""Lost Highway's"" noir update or Brian DePalma's attempts at more direct modernizations of noir, but it may do so the most effectively since it is the closest to true noir of these films and yet also takes Lynch at his word in creating a new noir for the 21st century by extending the noir principles and style in new and similar directions. Still, let's not forget noir has faults--predictable story lines, one-dimensional characters, over-the-top dramatics, and extreme violence being the most noticeable--and ""Sin City"" commits those sins (pun fully intended) full-force, sometimes brazenly and triumphantly marching over them and sometimes getting a rake in the face in the process. The characters aren't deep, the story lines aren't terribly original, and the violence is perhaps too much; but it's entertaining and perhaps even asks some good questions in the subtext.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Violence without depth = dull,"So it looks like the comics. Well done. So it's a triumph of digital movie magic. Okay. So it's really, really violent yet by keeping the blood bright white it is kept tolerable for a more or less mass audience. ho-hum. The problem with Sin City is that it's totally uninteresting. The characters aren't clichés, they're caricatures of carbon copies of clichés. The 'stories' (it's really an insult to call them that) are so basic, so utterly devoid of anything resembling intelligence, wit, suspense, structure, relevance, depth, that it's impossible to care about any of these cardboard cut-outs. There's a lot of women empowerment in this film, except all women are whores, basically, who exist to service men or be their victims. All men perform astounding feats of violence and survive insane amounts of damage, which totally kills any suspension of disbelief. Robert Rodriguez still has absolutely no story sense or feel for pacing. The short story-system used for the film makes it fragmented and repetitive. Reading Frank Miller's comics will probably take all of ten minutes per episode. That's 40 minutes versus a two-hour film (which had deleted material to boot). And that's just far too much time to spend on these sadistic, shallow trifles which are terribly overrated as comics, let alone as films.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

A very different kind of movie.,"I have very few complaints about this movie. It was gripping and exciting and completely different from anything else I have ever seen. There was the occasional nod to movies such as Pulp Fiction and even Batman, although fitting Sin City into any kind of genre is difficult (impossible?) to do.To those who could not grasp the subtleties, yes, the women were all sex objects or victims (usually both), and the men were all equally single-faceted. Yes there were huge holes in the plots but once you asked yourself ""WHY would he do that?"" the answer is always ""It doesn't matter because it's not real!""The UK 18 certificate was something of a surprise. The violence was not shocking to me (and I'm a 48-year-old woman), but I felt it was more 'Tom and Jerry' than than anything else - no-one seems to ever be hurting as a result of it and the blood even tended to be white on black or even pink in places. As to the supposed nudity - well, I must have blinked and missed it or else it was cut, because I saw nothing that I hadn't seen on the beach at Brighton last week!To sum up, a superb movie which looks outstanding, is performed beautifully and which I would like to think heralds a brand new way of writing for movies.

Best comic adaption yet,"Sin City is a very stylized adaptation of the cult ""graphic novels"" (comic books) of Frank Miller. It takes 3 of the more interesting substories in the 7 book Sin City collection and weaves them together very much like Pulp Fiction. Being that the director Rodrigez & Miller used the actual comic stories themselves instead of movie storyboards, the movie stays extremely close to the original works.The first thing you've probably noticed about the trailers is the black & white comic book style screen rendering. I was skeptical that they could pull this effect off but it turns out to work incredibly well. The feature is it enables colorization of the key elements of the movie giving them more attention. It also portrays a very surreal world that enabled the movie makers to do very interesting things that would probably make you roll your eyes if you saw it in a traditional style movie.The most important warning that any responsible reviewer will initially give is the unbelievable vulgarity & violence of this movie. Violence not in the sense of people just dying. Violence in the sense of dismemberment and very sick and disturbing scenes of poor girls getting miscellaneous body parts chopped off. Everything is shown as if to purposely disturb the audience. If this movie didn't have the comic book, unrealistic look and feel to it, it definitely would have been NC-17 and maybe even worse. If you don't want your kids or sensitive wife to be traumatized for a while, keep them the hell away from this movie. They'll have nightmares for the foreseeable future.However this shouldn't stop those of you from seeing it who thoroughly enjoyed films such as Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Snatch, Man on Fire, and the Punisher. Actually, aside from the aforementioned, the movie this most reminds me of is Payback, with the very cool voice over effects, atmosphere, and the fact that most of the 3 stories involve some kind of revenge by an initially not so nice person. Many will compare this film to ""Kill Bill"", but Sin City is a lot more serious, darker, and ten times better than that Tarantino hackjob piece of crap.Acting is top notch as you would expect with such a large talent pool. Jessica Alba is incredibly beautiful. Bruce Willis is amazing. My favorite however is Elijah Woods, the one you'll see with the mirrored glasses. Very courageous of him to agree to play this role. His character is unbelievably cool and he plays it well (without even saying a single word).Final Rating: 3 and a half stars. It would have easily been 4 stars if it didn't gross me out so much, but I liked the plot, the look, and the overall ""coolness"" of the movie so much that I'll be seeing it again and pre-ordering it on DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Rourke saves the fate of Sin City,"Forgive me father for I have sinned, I had told people that the film ""Sin City"" was going to be one of the most profound realistic films about a society of corruption, egoism, and shame. Father, after I saw the film I found that to be not true. Father, even though those three elements are incorporated in Robert Rodriguez's avant-garde film ""Sin City"", it was not flashy or sentiment enough for me to evoke on a crusade to minimize the problems in our society. The film is comprised of three separate stories in the fictional town of Basin City. The first one fixates itself on a thug named Marv who seeks revenge on the murder of a prostitute named Goldie. Father, we should bless actor Mickey Rourke for his mesmerizing work here. Father, to quote Toni Basil ""Mickey you are so fine in this film, you blow my mind, Yea Mickey"". The second narrative fixates on a savor-type named Dwight McCarthy who helps a beaten waitress and ends up in a ruckus by unknowingly killing a cop in a part of Basin City controlled by prostitutes. The slick Clive Owen was sturdy as McCarthy and Rosario Dawson leaves you hooked in her work as the mama hooker Gail. The third Basin City fairy tale fixates on an aging cop named John Hartigan who is falsely charged with child molestation even though what he was trying to do was save a little girl from being raped by a monstrous pedophile. Lucy, the young girl, grows up and before you can say ""albacadabra"" transforms into the luscious Jessica Alba. Yes! ""I Love Lucy"". Hartigan eventually follows the ""yellow brick road"" and is a Lucysaver again by skirmishing with the pedophile who now is transformed as a horrifying villain named ""The Yellow Bastard"". Bruce Willis successfully plays Hartigan as a Die Hard John McClane archetype character. The film's stories are adapted from famed comic book writer Frank Miller's bizarre comic tales of Basin City. Miller co-directed the film with Rodriguez and, get this non pulp fiction, included Quentin Tarantion as a Guest Director. Father, Rodriguez is a technical innovator and should be commended for his cinematic revelations but somehow I felt bored in ""Sin City"". Maybe I thought that it wasn't Miller Time when I would hear the ridiculous banter of Miller's scribed words from the characters of ""Sin City"", or maybe it was that there was not a central message within the mildly connecting narratives , or maybe it was just that I wanted to see the ""raw"" version of the infamous Alba dancing on the stage scene. Father, whatever it was forgive me for my marginal critical film review of ""Sin City"" . *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Gritty, gory, and exciting","Parents beware: this two hour and ten minute thrill ride is not for the young ones. Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels leap to life in what is, in my opinion, the most cinemantographially beautiful movie, that I have ever seen. The movie is artwork, frame by frame, only strengthened by the all-star cast you must see to truly behold. Mickey Rourke is acclaimed by all who have seen it, but I believe that Bruce Willis and Clive Owen turned out very, very good performances as well. The acting, even though the lines are extremely cheesy here and there, is superb; it was easy for me to picture Willis as an old cop or Josh Hartnett as a hit-man(he did well, even in his 90 seconds of screen time.)Every molded into Miller's fictitious world perfectly. The three seedy tales the movie portrays are all interwoven in an intricate time frame many don't understand. The atmoshpere is topped off with the constant narration of the main character currently being followed, and it is more than idle commentary. It's truly a sad, sad shame that Rodriguez had to resign from the DGA in order to have the film properly done, for it surely would have won a few Oscars. The only complaint is the soundtrack(or lack thereof.) There are two songs used in the movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

useless gratification of violence,"Okay, the cinematography is very nice. I'll give this film that. That is the only redeeming quality about it, however. Yes, it looks like the comic book. Perhaps it is even very true to the comic book, I haven't read it, so I can't say for sure. If it is true to the comic book, however, then this is one comic that I have no interest whatsoever in reading.There is no real character development in this movie, unless you count a rising death toll as character development. And I found it impossible to care what any character was going through. The movie felt unbelievably long to me because I had no interest in any of the characters and therefore no interest whatsoever in the stories.The overriding point of the film seemed to be death and oftentimes dismemberment. Not specifically for any reason, just for the sake of death and dismemberment. Some might argue that all of the killing was done for vengeance, but when you don't care about the characters you find it hard to accept so much killing for them.I admit I'm not a fan of violence, but I've really liked many violent films, if that film uses violence to make a good point, like in ""Gangs of New York"", or if you care enough about the characters and their situation, like in ""Braveheart"". However, neither is the case in Sin City.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Ultra-Violent, Weird, But Still a Great Experience!","In general, I utterly dislike films containing too much violence. The ""Tarantino school"", as I call it, is for me a cheap way to try to catch the viewer's attention by using unnecessary and disgusting gory scenes. In the same way that other directors try to draw our interest by using nude or sexy scenes (these at least are much more enjoyable to watch!), the ""Tarantino school"" tries to make its point by bombarding us with ever more blood: Unfortunately, as far as I am concerned, the end result is usually to become fed up and stop watching, just like I recently did with ""Kill Bill"".And yet, ""Sin City"" was different: Although ultra-violent (a typical scene for example shows Mickey Rourke chainsawing somebody's hands and feet and then giving the rest of the body to a wolf which rips it off!), it still manages to convince us that this raw violence is a vital part of the nature of this generally eccentric film, and not an addition put in just to catch our attention. ""Sin City"" is the adaptation of a violent comic on screen, and as such, violence comes naturally in the flow of the movie.A movie which is weird, so to say: As I said, it is an adaptation of a comic (which I haven't read, by the way) on-screen, and as such, it is something between a comic and a film, or both. With its black-and-white footage, containing colorful objects in several instances (red blood, green eyes, yellow person, etc.) thus making them much more distinct and powerful, ""Sin City"" is a different experience to watch. Diefferent and great, thanks to Miller's and Rodriguez's great work! Although it features many A-class names, such as Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, and others, acting is of lesser importance here: We are not interested so much in the characters and their performances, but in the overall magic atmosphere. This does not mean that the ""Sin City"" actors are doing their job well: On the contrary, their performances are fine. It is simply that the focus is elsewhere...""Sin City"" is film that should not be watched with a full stomach, as it will take you for a tough ride. And yet, do not miss this ride! 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

I felt as though I was in the story itself. Rodriguez's vision was incredible. He did a superb job in translating Frank Miller's work. I especially loved the way he used red within the black and white photography. The effect was bold and dark simultaneously. It was such a good movie that I didn't even want to take a bathroom break.

Fantastic,"This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. The visuals are stunning, the action is adrenaline pumping, its dark, and it is perfectly formatted from graphic novel to film. I am a huge film noir fan and have always been looking for the film that would suit my preferences, and I think that this movie is the one that does it. The actors play their roles from the comic perfectly(especially Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba). For anyone that hasn't seen it be warned, the film is broken up into four different stories, so when the credits start rolling on one of them do not get up and leave the movie is far from over. I'm not going to spoil any of the stories though. Overall this movie is fantastic, it is unique and perfectly adapted from Frank Millers stories. This is not just a movie based on a graphic novel it is a graphic novel made to look similar to a movie thats how good of an adaption it truly is. I suggest to anyone who has not seen it to go rent it or download it immediately because this movie is amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Now That's One Damn Fine Coat Your Wearing There,"Sin City(2005)Review: Another comic book adaptation. This is Sin City. Frank Miller's graphic novel is alive. Here's my take:Sin City is about three stories taking place around Basin City featuring many strong characters, Pulp Fiction style. The first thing I noticed is the incredible likeness to the Sin City graphic novels is flawless. From the sleek black and white with the occasional color here and there is glorious. The cinematography is breathtaking. We get some excellent Film-Noir as well. The narration is fitting and makes the experience more enjoyable and cool.Sin City does not hold back on the violence. This movie is really violent. You will see blood for blood by the gallons. The action here is well done and satisfying. But, this is more about the storytelling and the characters.All of this goes down to three compelling stories. We get Frank Hartigan, a detective on the verge of retirement who is intent on stopping the bad guys no matter the cost. Marv, an ex-con who is out to get the ones who killed the woman he fell for at any means necessary. And Dwight McCarthy, who is standing up for his new girlfriend against a truly unsavory character.Another plus is the tremendous cast. We have a major talent pool to swim in. From Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Powers Boothe, Elijah Wood, and so many more. All of em are marvelous. My favorite ones are Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood. The voice acting of the narration is truly satisfying. This is excellent Film-Noir.The directing was great with a nice special direction from Quentin Tarantino. Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller do Sin City just right in all the right ways. Miller's vision of the Sin City to the silver screen was done perfectly.The Last Word: Walk down the right back alley in Sin City and you can find anything. This is One of the best movies of 2005. From a terrific cast to quality dialog, an excellent script, and a fantastic look, this is very close to flawless. A work of art.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"dark, beautiful, over-the-top","I'm not going to say much more than what everyone else has said about this film. Most faithful comic book adaptation to date. And yes ... best performance of Rouke's career.I was a bit worried about this film. I've been a huge Miller fan since 1988 and I know what works on paper doesn't work on film. When I saw the pics of Yellow Bastard and Marv, I just didn't know what to think. Really didn't know it was going to completely take the look of the book and use it. And I'm not one of those people who loathed Robocop 2 ... I actually thought it was a pretty fun movie. But the third Robo film was completely terrible, and I fault that on the script written by Mr. Miller. I wasn't sure what people who weren't familiar with the source material would think about the movie. Well, it turns out that it works well whether you've heard of Marv and Goldie or not. Objectively, it's just a great beautiful looking film. Completely unique, violent but fun.The scene with Bruce Willis in the jail cell is really haunting. It just looks like he's suspended in time, the worse kind of limbo and the viusals really help us connect with what he's going through as the years pass.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Best Film of the new Century,"After seeing Sin City the only word that I could use to describe it was brilliant. I was truly amazed about the visual effects and the way the colors in the movie were done, It made the film feel unique and gave it this touch of dramatic visual emotion. The acting was great from most of the actors and actresses with the exception of one or two. Bruce Willis was awesome and Mickey Rourke as Marv was the coolest character I have seen in a long time. The one actor that I didn't care for that much was Michael Madsen, I have come to the conclusion that he is not the best actor in the world. The way the film played out was a monument to the 1920's and 30's Crime movies only Sin City was about 100 times more violent, which in my opinion made the movie all that much better.I have to say that Sin City truly is a city filled with nothing but sin, and while trying to not give away to much information I can tell you that I believe they tried to work into the film all seven of the deadly sins. The pure lack of any truly good characters in the movie may turn off some spectators, but if you don't enjoy a movie that doesn't have some moral code that it follows then you probably shouldn't go watch a movie called Sin City. One of the most memorable characters in the film and most disturbing was Kevin who was played by Elijah Wood, This character was probably the movies greatest representative of the meaning of sin.Sin City is the first masterpiece of the new century. It is beyond anything that has come out in at least five years and is now in my eyes on the top ten list. Sin City is also the best comic book adaptation I have ever seen. I read one of his graphic novels right before I saw the film which should tell you that I was not aware of Frank Miller's work until this movie came out, and I have to say I think the just used the comics as a script. The Film would truly make any one who was a fan of Frank Miller the happiest person in the world, and I am not just talking about the visual effects. To say the least this movie mad me more then happy that is why I am giving it a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

I haven't read the Sin City comics a lot, but I had one book in late 90s so I somewhat remember what it looked like. I think the movie captures the style.It's just that I'm not a big fan of film noir style stories (even though it can have a cool visual look). I wasn't big fan of the comic, and I'm not a big fan of Tarantino or Rodriguez who both were involved in making of the movie. So...I guess I'm not in the target audience.

Sin City: A movie masterpiece,"Sin City is an artistically amazing film, which captures the viewer with amazing visuals, and tells an outstanding story with the help of perfectly chosen and strategically placed little details.As we all know, big time feature films these days have strayed away from being a creation from someone's mind, and are now only made to make money and make film buffs, such as myself, angry. However, Sin City is a modern day masterpiece, which was made to be an instant classic as opposed to being a hit at the box office. Fortunately, it is a hit at the box office.Robert Rodriguez, the mastermind behind the El Mariachi trilogy (El Mariachi, Desperado, and Once Upon a Time in Mexico) was the main guru who created this film by mixing his amazing ability to edit scenes and shots together along with his talent as a comic book illustrator. He also Co-composed the soundtrack.Frank Miller, the creator of the Sin City graphic novels was also a director, who, since he created Sin City, made sure all of the details stuck with the overall story and message of the film.Finally, Quentin Tarantino was a guest director of the film, whose specialty is making characters look like bad asses, and he did an outstanding job with that too.Overall the film was the best film that has come out this year, better than Million Dollar Baby, and is a must watch for anyone who is into movies.",,Anonymous,Crime
This much fun should be illegal.,"Sin City was originally a comic book series by Frank Miller. The movie is based upon three of his graphic novels. It is co-directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller himself, and also features Quentin Tarantino as a ""special guest director."" Anyone familiar with Tarantino will have no problem figuring out which scene he directed, trust me! The script was lifted directly from the graphic novels, which were also used as storyboards (did Rodriguez really want to be as faithful to the source as possible, or was he just too lazy to adapt them? You decide). I have never read any of the Sin City books, but even so I'm happy to know that I'm getting the real deal through the movie, and not some lame parody.Although Sin City is the creation of Frank Miller, Rodriguez and Tarantino are right at home for the tone of the movie is in many ways very similar to that of their own movies: giddily violent, surreal, stylistic, and darkly comedic. A guilty pleasure that's really too creative to be called ""guilty"" in the first place.I'm not joking when I say that seeing Sin City purely for the photography is a perfectly good reason. If you think Sky Captain was a good enough example of what can be done with a green screen and digitally inserted backgrounds, think again! Sin City takes this new style to a whole new level - the photography is so powerful that it might as well be its own character. Not only does it help to recreate a genuine graphic novel feel, it is a perfect physical manifestation of the tone and atmosphere of Sin City itself. Saying the photography in this film is ""gorgeous"" is an obscene understatement. It's absolutely flawless. Every shot is different and exciting, a miniature work of art in itself (hence coming directly from Miller's panels). The film is mainly black-and-white, but there are little bursts of very bright colors throughout. The color, like the digital backgrounds, adds something infinitely important to Sin City that makes it a full package. The best moments during the film for me were when the color caught me totally off-guard; really not kidding when I say breathtaking.The plot of Sin City was the only area where I felt something lacking in the movie. Reading comics is a different experience than watching movies, and I agree with the critics who say that Miller's storytelling style has a hard time being translated for cinema. It is made up of three loosely intertwining stories, which may leave some viewers wishing things would connect and form one unit more than they do. The film is more like a glance into the lives of Sin City's residents, not one coherent story with a beginning, middle and end. Additionally, there is an overabundance of voice-over, and while the cast does okay, it does get rather tedious after awhile.My final complaint with the movie is that there are so, so many characters and not enough movie to do any of them justice. The cast is mind-blowing; I can't think of anyone who was not perfect to a T for their role. The characters themselves are endlessly interesting and fun, even when they come off as one-sided (which, to my amazement, does not hurt them). Some character/cast highlights:Mickey Rourke as Marv: Funny how the ugly sociopath is one of the most sympathetic and superhero-like characters. His physicality gives him a presence like no other.Brittany Murphy as Shellie: Brittany completely knocks this small role out of the park. I'd even say her performance was the most heartfelt of them all - somehow, she connects with her character and really embodies her to a level that I couldn't feel with the rest of the cast. She's vulnerable, sexy, AND hardcore. What more could you want? Endlessly cool.Alexis Bledel as Becky: What a pleasant surprise! If you don't already love her from Gilmore Girls, get ready to gain some respect for this ripe 23-year-old. While her role is not as removed from Rory as you might expect (!), it's great to see her as part of this ensemble and in a project that really flaunts her beauty and screen presence in a way that Gilmore Girls has yet been able to do. And may I say, I am honestly not exaggerating when I say that the shots with her blue eyes are the single most arresting thing I've ever seen in my life. I was literally paralyzed. We're talking mouth hanging open, trying not to drool, heart stopping in chest, unaware of the existence of anything in the Universe except those goddamn eyes.Sin City is (obviously) not a ""realistic"" movie, and thankfully it doesn't try to be. Nor does it try to justify itself morally (or visually), which is just so refreshing in our increasingly P.C. world. Yes, the violence is extravagant, yes, all the men are sadistic bastards, and YES, all the women are gorgeous prostitutes. Sin City dares you to ask yourself, what's wrong with that?!! Their world is not ours (luckily), but why not have some fun and enjoy yourself while you're there? In fact, for an extremely violent and morally questionable movie, there is a surprising amount of heart and humanity in it. I think that's my favorite thing about it. One of my biggest issues with our culture is how we all deny the ""evil"" and ""bad"" parts of ourselves when they clearly do exist. Seriously, just try admitting to yourself that you have had the urge to kill someone. Not saying by any means that you ever would, but don't you feel better now? What I'm trying to say is how amazing it was that Sin City made me feel so human.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Sin city is what film noir could have been had there been no handicaps leveraged on Hollywood due to ethical paranoia.

The Sins Of Miller,"I liked it a lot, the characters were one dimensional and some of the acting wasn't that great, but that wasn't really the movies main objective. The cinematorgraphy and action were great, and the plots aimed at ""cool"", and that's really what it stood on, but did so in a way where I wouldn't mind watching it again and again. The continuous voice overs got a bit annoying at first, but after awhile I slowly warmed the Raymond Chandler voice overs. This film, if nothing else is a great link between the poetry of static visual comics art and film, as well as an homage to all the gritty pulp stories that carried 20th century pop literature like placenta, detective stories, crime stories, film noir, etc. Yes, Frank Miller leans into misogyny and racism like a pirate leans on a peg leg(see 300), but that does not prevent this film from bieng one of the most original and entertaining action films in recent memory.

"When you marry film noir with comic-book action,you get this.","This might be one of the more unique film experiences one will have this year. I say that because the movie,which is rife with all the conventions of the Quentin Tarrantino/Robert Rodriguez genre,has one major distinction about it:It is entirely filmed inside of a green-screened sound-stage in Texas.The title summary is about the best way to describe it: It is a combination of very retro styles,combined with more current sensibilities(i.e.full frontal-nudity,explicit violence,quirky dialogue). There are so many name actors in this film that one almost would be led to believe that the producers and directors of the film were lacking confidence in how it would stand on its own merits.One would be wrong however. The acting in this film,primarily Bruce Willis as Hartigan,the single-minded,hardened cop,Mickey Rourke as MArv,the grizzled violent beast of a man who knows he is being unjustly framed for a murder of someone he loved(albeit briefly),Clive Owen as Dwight,an ex-con who seems to have more conscience than the cops or even the prostitutes he has sworn to protect,Rosario Dawson as Gail,the unofficial leader of the prostitutes who becomes Dwight's lover,and Jessica Alba as NAncy,the ""skinny,bookish girl""whom HArtigan saved before and must save again from a deranged killer. These five give very stirring performances to back up the cash value of the superb art direction,clever storytelling and nifty use of violence to accent this offering from Rodriguez and graphic novel creator and co-director Frank Miller.I must warn people that this film is NOT for everyone.I know that phrase is bandied about with many movies,but this movie is almost a definitive of that phrase,as the themes and images of this movie are most certainly unsettle anyone with no taste or patience for their entertainment being both rugged and cartoonish simultaneously.

Competently directed with high octane thrills,"*** out of (****)Dismemberment. Incest. Grit. ""Sin City"" is a completely unadulterated production that's as slick and mouth watery as you can get, thanks to its hip direction and its mere complexity. It's unapologetic, but that's what makes the ride more fun. The best part of ""Sin City"" is that it's a whole beast of its own. It has all the requirements to being a solid film, acting, story, and direction wise. But it plays tribute to film noir, graphic novel adaptations, and most significantly, it's just ingenious.

""Sin City"" is a ride that must be taken, but it isn't without its self-awareness, and that alone, is the reason why it's imperfect. Still, for a film of this nature, self-awareness is not what you should be looking for.First, and for most, the performances are just top notch. Everyone hear brings a worthy performance to the table. Also, I like the variation in character dispositions. You have characters who can be snarky and snooty, ones with bells and whistles, and others who blur the line between good and evil. Moreover, the plot is a well constructed one. I had to revisit the film to pick up on some information I couldn't quite pick up on the first round. To put the cherry on the top, the cinematography is just sick. The clear showcasing of juxtaposition in color is simply awe-inspiring.While ""Sin City"" is quite the adrenaline rush, one should be aware of its harsh nature. Ears blown off, shoot outs, decapitations, and the good 'ol red fluids streaming down. Let's also not forget the occasional T&A, and the film's heavy pedophilic undertones. Not to mention, if you're not one for psychological challenges, this is a probably an outing you should skip.""Sin City"" is not perfect. But that's part of the fun. With so much blood, sweat, and tears put in this project, I don't mind a few scruff marks. The plot is invigorating, the direction is slick, and the movie is just balls-to-the-wall fun. Competently directed with high octane thrills, ""Sin City"" is a winner. Rodriguez, make ""Sin City 2"" alright. Go on, I'll wait.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Dynamic Visuals, so-so acting/directing/narration","There's no denying the look of this film. It's been done before though in a similar vein with Dick Tracey and Sky-Captain - probably a superior look imo. Sky Captain was more of traditional movie and thus much more appealing. The stories are of course are graphic novelish - and not being a fan of that - the movie is pretty much just gratuitous comic-bookish violence with often average to poor acting - so to evaluate the movie is difficult because I didn't what it was made for. Narration is often flat too. However the visuals especially when motion is involved are competently put together and at times spectacular. Supporting gratuitous violence really doesn't give the movie anything to stand for, and so it's more of a so-so experience, maybe worth watching once unless you like gratuitous violence depicted.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Save your money unless you are a fan.,"While Sin City is pretty eye candy, it is a total waste of time and money unless you are a Frank Miller fan and follow the comic book series. There is nothing to draw the audience in. It has some of the worst acting I've seen to date. Don't make me go off on Britney Murphy's ""acting"". Bruce Willis need to be less wooden. The ladies are just there to be flash in the pants. I can't believe the caliber of actors in this movie would agree to do such dribble nonsense. All you have to do is read the other reviews to know that only fans like the movie and pretty much all others walked out. I wished I had too. So if you value your time and money, rent or buy Spiderman.",,Anonymous,Crime

Thankfully Frank Miller himself was involved and he managed to communicate the true feel of his work. Everybody from cast to crew worked with the utmost respect to the original material.

A breath of fresh air from Hollywood and a proof that there is plenty of talent that can work little miracles. Don't hesitate for a moment to go and watch this.

Sin City,"Sin City""Walk down the right back alley in Sin City and you can find anything,""-including one of the best movies of the year. Few comic book movies have looked as good as Frank Miller's Sin City. This film brings a comic book to life in ways that we haven't yet seen in cinema. From the unbelievable imagery that fills each and every scene of this movie, to the actors who brought each character to life, and the three intertwining story lines that keep us on the edge of our seats, Frank Miller's Sin City is a movie experience you don't want to miss and may never experience again.This film is brought to life on screen with three of the original Sin City comic book stories. The three main story lines concern Marv (Mickey Rourke), an outcast on a mission to avenge the death of the one woman who treated him right; Dwight (Clive Owen), a good guy, who spends his night trying to protect Gail (Rosario Dawson) and her Old Town girls from a crooked cop and the mob; and a battered old cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who vows to protect a sexy stripper. Each story holds its own among the others as we find ourselves switching from one to another, much like in Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. In fact, this film seems to be a lot like Fiction. Tarantino is a special guest director who directed one brief scene for the film and also seems to have influenced much of the films style and violence. The stories of each of these characters are so well done that we begin to believe what we are watching to be possible in this comic book world filled with violence. Each story is told through both the eyes and narrative of its main characters. It's a very interesting way to tell a story, but it's wise. At Sin City's pace, a two-hour, one-story narrative would begin to wear on its audience.Every scene of Sin City looks like it came right out of the pages of a comic book. The more you watch, you begin to wonder if you are still watching a movie or flipping through the pages of one of Frank Miller's comics. The dark city is brought to life not with colors, but incredible CG graphics. Everything is composed of black and white, except for a few details that have been filled with beautiful colors that we can't miss. It's a type of style and imagery that carries the film almost by itself. You could watch this movie for the first time with the volume on mute, and still walk away amazed. The tag team direction of Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller are the brilliant minds that allow us to find ourselves just looking and almost forgetting to truly watch and enjoy the entire aspects of this film.Frank Miller's Sin City is brought to life with a cast of Hollywood stars that never seems to end. Even the smallest of roles are brought to life by big budget actors such as Josh Harnett and Elijah Wood. The acting that caries the movie, however, comes not from these small roles, but from the main characters of each of the three stories. Bruce Willis looks every bit a great film star of old in black-and-white. Clive Owen is intriguing as the one good guy in this city we find ourselves caring about. The one role that steals the show is Mickey Rourke as Marv. He gives one of the best performances of his career and gives us the best narrative voice we have heard since Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"".After seeing Frank Miller's Sin City, I had no words to explain what I had just seen. It wasn't just another movie; it was different from anything I had seen before. It was a ground-breaking experience I didn't expect. I have never seen a movie use its elements so well and let it take us on such a wild and crazy ride. A ride you don't want to miss and have got to experience, but isn't suited for everyone. This is definitely not a movie that you want to bring your kids to, or want to watch if you can't take violence. It's rated R for a reason, but the violence is done with such unique style that it doesn't take away from the film. Go rent this film, or else you won't know what you're missing out on.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Comic Book Brought to Life,"After watching Sin City I had the urge to reach for a cigarette in one hand and a bottle of Jack Daniels in the other.For me, this is a very very good thing.Simply, the action that plays in my mind while reading Frank Miller's Sin City was recorded by Robert Rodriguez and brought onto the silver screen. For moviegoers expecting a movie in the traditional vein, this masterpiece might disappoint. For all others, this might possible prove to be one of the most entertaining movie experiences.Employing the story telling techniques popularized by Quentin Tarantino in his movie Pulp Fiction, Sin City revolves around the lives and stories of three central characters, presented in full comic book glory - style and all. It is this specific artistic approach that Sin City creates, which is its strongest selling point. While other adapted movies might hint mildly to its roots, Sin City is truly the art of Frank Miller, from the splashes of color to the intricate details of shadows and light.Some critics might point to Sin City's more obvious flaws - its senseless violence, its lack of moral anchor, maybe even its seemingly absurd generalizations. These complaints aren't necessarily without merit, just way too serious. Avoid the ego-masturbation and just enjoy this in the making genre defining film.If the lone fact that I registered an account at IMDb and wrote a review after years of lurking doesn't compel you to go give Sin City a try, then I don't know what else will. What I do know, is that for a measly $9, this movie was worth every damn penny and then some.HIGHLY recommend. A must see for any lover of the cinematic arts!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"amazingly brilliant, brutally violent, wicked special effects ,sexy and the atmosphere is astonishing.","Me and my brother were so bored and checking out the paper to see if there were any good movies playing.Then my brother pointed out that Sin City was playing.I got to tell you that even at first sight it's still amazing.I mean there hasn't been a black and white movie ever since the middle of the 20th century.We saw it on the first day it came out and me and my brother absolutely loved it!The visual effects kicked ass!The acting was brilliant!The actors really got in to their characters and the storyline was amazing!Man, there won't be another movie like this in a long time.There were some bits in colour like Dwight's (Clive Owen) car and Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl).Also some of the scenes were the exact same as the comics.The action scenes were really action-packed and violent.Oh yeah,it definitely got its R rating.It is brutally and bloody violent,it has some strong language and it has plenty of nudity and sexual content. The film follows 3 of the Sin City graphic novels done by Frank Miller and 1 story from Booze,Broads,and Bullets.The stories are The Hard Goodbye,The Big Fat Kill,That Yellow Bastsrd and the little story The Customer Is Always right.The directors Frank Miller,Robert Rodriguez and special guest director Quentin Tarantino.It is sort of Quentin Tarantino style of fighting,you can tell when Miho (Devon Aoki) was slaughtering a bunch of drunks wanting to pick up a hooker.Oh yeah I forgot to tell you that I did not read the comics totally regret that I didn't,but I'm reading them now and they're excellent.They are exactly like the movie.This movie is perfect,but it is not recommended for children.This movie is a must see movie and it's definitely worth seeing,so if you didn't see it in theaters then get it on DVD or VHS August 16.Altogether I give this masterpiece a 10 out of 10!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Highly overrated, full of needless violence","Okay, so this is obviously an ultra-violent film. Not all that unexpected coming from Robert Rodriguez, but still, what this film lacks is substance and humor thrown in. After the pitiful 'Once Upon a Time In Mexico', I am sad to say this film is even worse. It does have some redeemable qualities, though very few. The comic book look that has been created specially for this film is very well done, though it leaves exactly the same impression that 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' did, in that, after the visuals, there isn't much left to see. The film is, even with the action, extremely boring towards the middle. This film could have easily been cut down to 90 minutes, and it should have been. What is more disturbing than the violence in this film is the supposed acceptance that surrounds it. Their is little justification behind it, almost no regret about carrying out this kind of violence. Severed limbs, incredible amount of blood and gore...the violence out weights the sex seen in this film. And American's complain when romantic comedies have explicit sex scenes? What is the world coming to? This violent culture has let Sin City get away with this, as well as encouraging more. Sin City is not trash, it's decent. But ranking it up close to masterpieces such as the Lord of the Rings, which has so much more emotion, the violence and killing is questioned, raises so many moral issues...this film clearly needs to be put in its place, next to Titanic. One of the most overrated films in years.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brutal and powerful,"Last night, I saw what could probably be the best comic-to-film adaptation ever made (or anything-to-film adaptation possibly). I say this because it stuck to the source material verbatim. Dialouge was spot-on and the look of the characters along with the compositions of the shots directly followed what was in the original series. I think there were only two scenes cut form the film that probably should have been included for a bit more characterization, but it still remains faithful. True, this movie may still not be for everyone. It is brutal and insane. Those who don't follow film-noir may not understand the claustrophobic atmosphere and the dreariness and people who may not be comic readers may not understand the dark humor and the insane action/seeming lack of physics. Despite this, it is a modern mastic in both storytelling and effects. The story may seem hateful or cynical to some, but I would argue that it is quite the opposite. Each main character willingly walks into situations that he knows will have dire consequences, but chooses to do so anyway due to the kindness of a stranger (Marv), loyalty to friends (Dwight), or simply out of a sense of justice (Hartigan). They make sacrifices when they could simply walk away and are given the chance to do so. As for the effects, the digital green screen provides a fitting backdrop into this world while not taking too much away from the action due to the desire to shove eye-candy down our throats. Some shots seemed a bit awkward, but for the most part, it enhanced the story rather than became a distraction.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Comic book brought to life... complete with a wafer thin story,"I had a feeling I was going to hate this movie, and I was right. I only watched it in the hope that I would be pleasantly surprised, but nope... I disliked it just as much as I thought I would. The only positive point I have to make about this film is how it looks. There's no doubt that this film has style in abundance - it's a visual feast. In fact, the visuals were the only thing that kept me watching.Everything else about 'Sin City' I didn't like, from the wafer thin storyline to the ridiculously over-the-top violence. I normally don't mind violence in films but the violence in 'Sin City' was excessive to the point where it became totally meaningless. So, all in all, not my type of film at all.

"Looks Great, too bad they forgot to tell a story","Awesome technical work. A fun ride, but who wants to be on a thrill ride for over two hours. Fun to see well know actors in a live animation style. Fun trying to guess who certain people are when you first see them. I'd say one actor who should have been in the film is Christopher Walken. It was really fun seeing Mickey Rourke work in such a substantial part. Great visual design. Tedious stories or lack of a story that matters is a major problem. I guess when the only resolution in your narrative toy box is violence, then every narrative looks like murder and mayhem, although the attempt at a couple of ""redemption"" plot s is a good try. I wish Tarentino had spent as much time watching Ida Lipeno noir classics as he did watching Asian martial arts flicks. Hope it makes lots of money so someone with a good story will get to try the digital green screen stuff. Since it was shot in Texas and some name actors only had to work a day or so, I imagine it will turn a big profit in theaters and other releases. On the other hand: Felt way too much like a Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill wanna be.B",,Anonymous,Crime
Not for the weak or easily queasy.,"I'm a fan of comic books and superhero movies, but never had the pleasure of reading any of Frank Miller's graphic novels of Sin City or 300. With this film however, I can rank in with my other favorite comic book movies but for those who enjoy watching Batman Begins or Spider-Man 2, it's not for the very easy queasy.Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez direct this movie with Quentin Tarantino as a special guest director with an all star cast featuring Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, Bruce Willis, Michael Clarke Duncan, Michael Rourke, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson and others where if you've seen the directors films from ""Desperado"", ""Pulp Fiction"", or ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", you're in for a real nice surprise.""Sin City"" uses three stories from the comic book series, each telling three different points of view connecting all the characters in one rotten city.The first story is about Marvin portrayed by Michael Rourke, a grunge man who is framed for murdering a stripper and not knowing about it. The funny thing is he's asleep when it happens. So Marvin goes all over town asking bad-ass hookers left and right where he meets one played by Carla Gugino. They go in search for the murderer where they realize that a cannibal (Elijah Wood) and a priest are involved.The second story tells the story of Dwight (Clive Owen) who finds out that the girl he is seeing (Brittany Murphy) is dating a corrupt cop named Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) who beats the hell out of Brittany Murphy's character and wants revenge. Dwight doesn't exactly kill Jackie Boy, but instead a group of hookers (the same ones Marvin met) led by Gail played by Rosario Dawson, kills Jackie Boy after his posse tries to harass one of the girls. Dwight and Gail are in shocked once they find out that the cop is connected with the rest of the good and bad officers along with the mafia in the city and if they find out that their own was killed, all hell will be broken loose.The third story shows Hardigan's (Bruce Willis) point of view as a washed up cop whose been out of the force after an incident involving a young Nancy Callahan (an older version is played by Jessica Alba) and the senator's son (Nick Stall) where Nancy was kidnapped before Hardigan saved the day by injuring the senator's son in places he can't grow; not until his partner played by Tarantino regular Michael Madsen injures him leaving him almost dead. The story involves Hardigan going in the line of duty to see Nancy one more time before realizing that her life is in danger.The film is shot in black and white where the only colors that show are detailed items from blood, pens, vehicles and anything that isn't human.Nonetheless, this is a one of the coolest comic book movies from Frank Miller to come up on screen while i stand by my decision when i say this is not a typical comic book movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

When you've got so much fun on display, some OTT violence, black humour,sex, nudity, oh did i mention the dames are HOT, and the movie looks so cool .

K-Blamo!,"Imagine if Alfred Hitchcock made a film-noir in the nineteen forties, with access to the same movie making technology that we have today. Then imagine that Quentin Tarantino co-directed. What you have imagined is ""Sin City"", the new movie directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, from Miller's comic books.The movie is, in a way, an astonishment, because Rodriguez has given us no prior evidence that he is capable of directing anything better than standard stylish action shlock. Oh man, is he ever.The film takes place in Basin ""Sin"" City, a Gotham-New York hybrid that probably jumped straight out of Frank Miller's nightmares. When the sky is not grey, it is red, it is always raining, and the population all seems to follow only one convention: they have a considerable amount of dirty laundry. It is as if Rodriguez reached into ""The Maltese Falcon"", grabbed the city, and threw it into a vat of Gatorade - which is a compliment, of course.After a short scene at the beginning - which plays like a teaser, hinting at Sin City's nature - we are launched into three short stories, all intersecting briefly in one place: at a cheap strip joint outside the city.We start with Marv (Mickey Rourke), a massive, rough sadist whose mug looks like a cross between Mr. Incredible's and a brick. We don't know much about his past, but we know it's dirty, and that he'd probably deserve a lethal injection over a good woman. But he gets a good woman, which seems like a miracle to him, and they spend a night together. Possibly the best night of his life. When he wakes up, she's dead. He wants to find out why, who, how, and how to kill those guilty. He says his quest is ""Worth dying for, worth killing for, worth going to hell for."" Then we take a leap into Dwight's world. Dwight (Clive Owen) is running from the law, and has just hooked up with Shellie (Brittany Murphy), the girl who's loved him all her life. But Shellie's ex boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) won't have it, and he barges into their apartment with some heavies. After a brief quibble, Jackie Boy makes his exit, violently drunk. Dwight suspects he's on his way to Old Town to inflict hell on the prostitutes who act as law there, the prostitutes who saved Dwight's life, his friends. He races off to help them.And last but not least is the story of Det. John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), one of the rare hero cops of Sin City. He saves a little girl from Junior, a pedophile (Nick Stahl). But Junior has an important dad, and Hartigan goes to prison for nearly a decade, framed for the crime. When he gets out, he races to find Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), the little girl who's now all grown up and still targeted by Junior. But Junior's gone through some disturbing changes since his last bout with Hartigan...The many characters are wide-ranging archetypes: heroes (Owen, Willis), anti-heroes (Rourke), villains (Rutger Hauer, Michael Clarke Duncan), psychos (Stahl, Del Toro, Elijah Wood), good girls (Alba, Murphy, Carla Gugino), considerably more interesting bad girls (Rosario Dawson, Devoan Aoki), and some mysterious figures (Josh Hartnett).Most of the actors are perfectly cast, some of them deliver performances worth remembering, particularly Rourke, Owen, Willis and Del Toro. They are great at taking these characters and becoming them, while still maintaining their star presence. Bruce Willis reminds us of Bruce Willis, but we remember him as John Hartigan. Del Toro, Wood and Stahl are the only actors who've been cast against type.The style of the film is what connects the three stories, as well as the strip joint, and similar themes about camaraderie, love, hate, torture and redemption. The movie is like a comic book, as we've all said, but you can only understand it if you've seen it. Then you'll agree, it feels like it was inked.Rodriguez will be remembered for this movie, and this movie will be remembered because of Frank Miller's genius and imagination. It's bloody, yeah, and it's got quite a bit of nudity, but you can't imagine the movie without it. I should hope no one would complain, because what do they expect, seeing a movie ""guest-directed"" by Tarantino, the man himself. Tarantino's scene is one of the best and strangest of the movie, it involves Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, a car, some flashing lights and a ""PEZ dispenser"".I don't know if the movie will survive like ""Pulp Fiction"" has, but I hope it does, because it's almost as good at combining pop culture references, homages, action, harsh violence and deep character insights into one, even narrative.The movie is a joy, a dark, neo-noir, violent, sometimes disgusting joy.9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
An Honest Objective Review,"I thought that Sin City was a decent noir film, but nowhere near as good as the hype would indicate. Seems like the same audience that loved Kill Bill is falling over Sin City. Violence for the sake of violence. Is there any kind of commentary either Rodriguez or Tarantino are making about violence through the evisceration-a-second action? In the case of both, I don't think they let their work become too intellectual. It's like they put the violence in a pill for you to swallow and you absorb it and dump it a few hours later, end of story. Films like these don't really stick with me because they are a more concerned with reaching the pinnacle of style and being cool.Mickey Rourke had the most sincere performance stand out from the muddle. Perhaps it is because Rourke starred in one of the greatest noir films of all time, Angel Heart. He didn't have to reach very far, which is not to say he is dialing in his performance, but he excels in the genre. Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Rosario Dawson and Benicio Del Toro were the second tier. Everyone else falls somewhere below for the following qualities: posing like a filmed storyboard, acting like an over-directed stand-in with lines, or simply failing to rise above the material, which is not that great to begin with. Classic film noir with a lot of shock value and a slick new film look.The look is most certainly unique. No doubt that many people will imitate its style in the coming years in a variety of media; print ads, commercial spots, other noir-type films, TV shows, etc.I suppose if there is any positive to come out of Sin City, it's that murdering a religious figure or corrupt Father through a confessional is the proper radical response to some of the unethical religious intervention in the current political landscape.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"The Mainstreaming of Gratuitous, Sadistic Violence","""Sin City"" is a flawless on screen realization of a graphic novel. If you allow yourself to be immersed, you could swear you're watching a comic book come to life on the silver screen. Characters are either monstrously hideous or impossibly gifted. The women in particular, accurately represent the febrile fantasies of adolescent and post-adolescent males. Buxom, statuesque, gun-totin' ass-kickers, they'd just as soon snap some slob's neck as wrap their legs around it.I have to admit, I was immersed in this movie from beginning to end. I can recognize something new when I've seen it, and this movie is definitely not like anything I've seen before. A movie will score points with me just on that basis alone. However, not being a big fan of graphic novels, I doubt I'd be interested in seeing another film like it. As with most graphic novels, the dialogue in the film, recreated faithfully, tends toward tough guy/gal patter, which, with its inherent limitations, can get old fairly quickly. Most of the plots in these novels tend to be based on revenge fantasies (certainly the prime motivator in ""Sin City""), and I tend to think (wish?) that the well-adjusted of us typically grow out of the need for that kind of bloody retribution when we exit our teens.On a side note, there are those who have taken exception to the way in which women are presented in this movie. They probably have every right. However, bear in mind that this movie represents the mainstreaming of a sadistically violent mindset traditionally limited to a coterie of readers of graphic novels. That mindset allows for a graphical realization of all manner of horrific transgressions that probably make the transgression of misogyny seem relatively tame in comparison. Perhaps a more relevant issue raised by this movie would be to ask why we are seeing the mainstreaming of this type of sadistic and retributive mindset at this point in our history.Finally, as a counter to the feminist outcry this movie has engendered, there has been some ameliorative talk as to how the hookers, exotic dancers, and waitresses in ""Sin City"" are all ""empowered"" women, as if this could somehow offset the fact that almost all of the women portrayed in the film are hookers, exotic dancers, and waitresses, with nary a PhD in Marine Biology among them. Feminists should not go to this movie unless their idea of feminism is getting him before he gets you.Somehow, this film feels post-apocalyptic. If you can get into that mindset, enjoy the ride.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Mahs Bahs Review,"Going into this movie, I had never seen, read, and barely heard of the comic ""Sin City"". After seeing this movie, I may just become a fan. ""Sin City"" sticks out among the poor to semi-poor rash of comic book movies over the past couple of years. While movies like ""The Hulk"", ""The Punisher"", and the X-Men series wrestle with each other in mediocrity, (and movies like ""Daredevil"", ""Elektra"", and the end of the Batman franchise wrestle for worst-ever title) this movie has outdone all in every possible fashion - including both Spiderman flicks (both of which were done very well). For starters, the movie looks like it has been drawn. Robert Rodriguez has now firmly established himself as a premier director, WHO GETS IT. Some directors may have taken a gem such as ""Sin City"" and decided to put their own stamp of what has been done (See: roller blading ""genius"" of Joel Shumacher in ""Batman and Robin""). Rodriguez understood what made ""Sin City"" a popular comic and embraced it. This embracement ends up in long shots of the characters; quick dialog ripped directly from the comics themselves; vibrant and distinct blacks and whites; and an overall ultra-cool feel which the movie easily conveys. The cast is great, with each character matching well. Mickey Rourke has finally returned, and as it turns out his character in ""Get Carter"" was horribly misplaced and now has resurfaced in ""Sin City"". The only downfall of this movie, and it is a minor one, is Jessica Alba. Alba's beauty is unquestionable, yet I wonder if her presence is such in real life that she can continually be touted as an up-and-coming star. This roll is clearly a juicy part, same as her roll in the upcoming ""Fantastic Four"", and yet the girl can not act a lick.

I think this is the movie we've been waiting for...,"i love this movie...it's an old feeling when you go out there..see a movie...and come back thinking bout it, asking yourself stuff that you cannot understand...i felt like this when i saw the first Matrix...since then, i dunno, a max total of 3 movies made me give it a 10. anyway, i liked the 3d shooter Max Payne, and if any of you know this game, you can agree that the monologue,is quite similar. Noir movies where out of fashion, since this one came out. Thus, many influences we can discover in this movie, many actors that were once great and now...""not so great"", gave it a good performance. i'm talking bout Ruger Haeur, Mickey Rourke, and Mr.""Frodo"" :)) The director effort to try to give it a comic book look...well..i can say it was pretty good, but if you use white blood in the first place, why didn't he use it all the way. the comics are black and white, and it's really impossible to make a movie...only in 2 colors..no Garey...and a little red once-n-a-while.

The most visually stunning film of all time!,"Sin City. It's a city where criminals rule everything, because the government is made up of criminals. It's a place where violence awaits at every turn. The movie consists of 3 story lines, all set in this dark city. Most people in these stories are brutally, and explicitly killed in various gruesome ways. In other words, this city is not where you go for a family vacation.The first story, ""The Hard Goodbye"" follows Marv (Mickey Roarke). He is a big, ugly, and sadistic brute who just had a one night stand with a hooker named Goldie (Jamie King). He wakes up to find her dead, and is framed for her murder. He goes on a murderous rampage in trying to find the real killer. This chase leads him to a remote farm, where the killer is revealed. But is Marv strong enough to take him down?This is a VERY disturbing story. It has some of the most sadistic killings ever shown on film, particularly what Marv does to Elijah Wood's character, Kevin, and what he does to a cardinal (Rutger Hauer). It is also really cool. The blood in this story flows red. Marv, I guarantee, is not the kind of guy you'll want to meet in a dark alley. He kills without mercy, and is good at it. He is what is called a sympathetic monster, like Frankenstein's monster. He is good, but he does awful things. The acting from Jamie King couldn't be much worse. She delivers her lines in the cheesiest way possible. I didn't let that one lousy performance ruin my good time. This is what I would call an action-packed horror story. Also, you get to see the mom from Spy Kids' breasts.The second story, ""The Big Fat Kill,"" follows the comic book series' main character, Dwight McCarthy (Clive Owen). He is a ladies man, with a criminal record, and a bad attitude. While protecting the old Town hookers, they accidentally kill a cop, Jackie-Boy (Benicio Del Toro). This murder, if the cops find out, will end a truce that has held Sin City together for years. Can Dwight dispose of all the evidence before the authorities get a hold of it?This story is the most action packed of the movie. It features a really disturbing scene between Jackie-Boy and Dwight in a car, which was the scene directed by Quentin Tarantino. It also has the most story. The only problem is that it doesn't make too much sense at times.And the third story, ""That Yellow Bastard,"" follows John Hartigan (Bruce Willis). He is the only good guy in Sin City, whose life goes down the drain after he rescues a little girl, Nancy (Jessica Alba), from a sadistic child rapist. He returns 8 years later, only to find that the same killer is after her. Can Hartigan get to her and save her on time?This is more of a tragic love story than an action. It has a little action, but is mostly a character study between Hartigan, and Nancy. It is definitely the most heartfelt of all of them, and has an ending that could make a strong man cry. Jessica Alba isn't a very good actress, but Bruce Willis, reprising his traditional character as a hero cop, is top notch. The ending to this story is sad, because we probably won't ever see his character in another story again.This movie is not only a perfect comic book adaptation, but it is Robert Rodrieguez's best film. It has an insanely cool visual style, blending black and white with color in a flawless fashion. It almost doesn't feel like you're watching a black and white film. Quentin Tarantino guest directed one scene, and that scene, of all of them, has the best use of color. All the color splashes are beautiful, and could be freeze framed, and hung in the museum. The trailers make this look like a big, fun, loud, exciting, popcorn action movie. It sort of is, but what the movie really is, is a disturbing, and depressing drama with a grim and downbeat atmosphere. It has plenty of action, but not quite enough to fit the genre. It leaves little hope for the characters in the end. All in all, I say watch this film. It is the most fun I've ever had while watching a movie, and I can 55% guarantee that's how it will be for you, if you're okay with extreme violence.Sin City is rated R for Sustained Strong Stylized Violence, Nudity and Sexual Content Including Dialogue.

Sin City tells the stories of three men who are out for revenge.,"Sin City is a comic book movie with a difference. Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, this is a contemporary noir that follows the original stories exactly. Shot in black and white with splashes of colour and a Pulp Fiction-like narrative structure, Sin City is a genre all on its own and looks set to be one of the biggest films of the year. This film is not for those with weak stomachs as most of the women of Basin City meet a rather grisly end. Feminists may also choose to steer clear as the only women in Sin City tend to be either strippers, prostitutes or lesbians. That said, this is not a bloke's film (and especially not one for a first date). Being a fan of Rom-coms, I don't usually go for blood and guts films but Sin City is not like that. It is the best film I have seen at the cinema for a long time. The entire look of the film is just amazing with great cinematography and editing and a good guest director appearance from Quentin Tarantino. Sin City had me hooked from the very start with its in-depth characters and action-packed stories. I can't wait to see what Rodriguez and Miller do next.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Amazing movie,"I watched the movie today, and it is really amazing. It's a fresh air blow in a year without Kill Bill. The screenplay is very good, the cinematography is astonishing, and everything flows in such a breath-taking way, that you have to hang yourself in the chair to profit it all. The cast is also amazing, and everyone is pretty good in the movie. There is a different Bruce Willis, older and full of wisdom, a disfigured Mickey Rourke, a lovely Jessica Alba, a psychopath Eljah Wood, and so on, and so on...I strongly recommend it to those who enjoy cult movies, since the others may find it too violent or alternative. Personally, I loved it!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Unique,"Sin City can be summed up in one word, unique. It really is very unique. The cinematography and nature of it all is very different. It's based on a series of graphic novels. It's a film that's told in parts, it's not all one story, rather it's many different stories all wrapped up into one crazy film.There are many different Hollywood stars that make up the cast here. The cast includes Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Alexis Bledel, Mickey Rourke, Carla Gugino, Elijah Wood... and more. I can say that i really enjoyed the acting in this film, i was impressed by the strong performances given. The characters are all broken in some way, struggling with their own issues. This movies takes place in a city that has so many violent issues, and violent screwed up characters. The police force is mostly corrupt, and there are people that would rather kill you than look at you around every corner. It's definitely another world.The visuals are all well done for sure, the film-noir look is cool and i enjoyed that style. The violence is appropriately graphic given the kinds of people that this film focuses on and the area it's set in. The writing is fine, I personally wasn't terribly impressed by it, it's really the acting and visuals that impressed me most. There are parts I enjoyed more than others. I would say overall that this film is good and it's well made, I just personally didn't love it like most do.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sin City pushes the envelope and sets the standard for any Non-Mainstream comic-book movie,"Fantastic movie. This is the first real ""translation"" of a comic book or graphic novel as opposed to an ""adaptation"". This is a true-testament to the power and beauty of the source material.Sin City, albeit extremely violent and gory, hearkens back to older, more simple days, when the movies had terrible villains you wanted to see killed. The villains in this movie are the true scum of the earth, and the heroes are all tragically flawed. Despite these simplicities, the characterizations of the main players, Marv (mickey Rourke), Hartigan (Bruce Willis), Jackie Boy (benicio del toro), Dwight (clive Owen), was done very well. The stylized black and white, with intense lighting contrasts was amazing and groundbreaking. The use of color is both purposeful and powerful in every scene it is used. I especially thought the performance of Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and benicio Del Toro were fantastic, with Rourke putting in his best performance to date.Miller and Rodriguez have done a great job. I can't quite figure out which scene Quentin Tarantino directed but I believe it's a scene with Devon Aoki's character, which seems very Kill Bill-ish. Anyone who is a fan of the comics will fall in love with this movie. Anyone who likes movies such as kill bill, pulp fiction, dick tracy, will also love it.I would like to disclaim to everyone that while some of the characters have greater than life powers, Hartigan's and Marv's ability to take a beating, Elijah Wood with long, stabbing fingernails, it is NOT a superhero movie. It is a very intense, and graphic crime action/drama with very archetypal yet engaging characters.This movie's uniqueness demands that everyone give it a first chance at least. I searched for something wrong with Sin City yet found it quite flawless. The only problem i had with this movie is that being in Austin, I did not get to work on it. I urge everyone to give it a chance.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Somewhat disappointing.,"Sin City, bottom line, was a good movie. It kept me entertained, and had a lot of things going for (not the least of which was gratuitous violence and a terrific cast). However, the plot dragged at times and jumped recklessly from place to place. It's non-sequential in the same vein as Pulp Fiction, but much less organized and streamlined than that film was.On the whole, though, I liked it. Despite is frenetic and often erratic pacing and occasional sheer weirdness, it was well written, well shot, well directed (though I am convinced that had Tarantino directed the entire film we might be talking about one of the greatest movies ever made as opposed to a merely good one), and well acted. I just wish Madsen had had a bigger part.I give it a seven.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Cult Classic to be?!?,"Style of Quentin Tarantino all over it. I am not a fan of Pulp Fiction and the like, but understand the style. Apparently this is based upon an adult comic novel - which I have not seen.Very artistic in the styling of a comic comes to live. The unbelievable - it can only happen in the comics - type of scenes (like the blood was usually white when someone was shot). Primarily a black and white movie with good usage of colorizing for emphasis (primarily red, but other colors too) It seemed like 4-5 short stories, but they come together and make sense. I personally would not pay to see this movie, but I respect the artistic approach and how many others would find this a very good movie. This may be a new cult classic.Violence was greatly fictionalized (comic style) however sexual overtones (while only containing brief nudity) were adult in nature - with the prostitute outfits.Most laughter was from absurdly implausible events - that can only happen in the comics. Unfortunately at time the movie drifted to be more of a movie than a comic-come-to-live and the style was not completely consistent.Earlier today, March 16, 2005, I was able to view an advanced screener. It was packed. Hearing comments of fellow movie-goers, it was a love-it/hate-it type movie. I personally sided towards the hate-it, but only because of my personal taste - again from a ""film as art"" sense it was a good movie.",,Anonymous,Crime
very slick,"this is an excellent film. do not recall seeing something like this ever before. It is a dark film. There is no colour in the film, except for specific parts, such as girls eyes, red for blood and car headlights, etc. This adds a wonderfully dark feel, almost in a comical way. The film is very much similar to the format of a comic or computer game. The special effects aree reminiscent ofexplosions in action games, even better, and more fluid. The acting is very suitable, andthe main guy, has a very eery tough guy look. Definitely perfect for the part. He is covered with scars on his face, and is large in size. Yet he seems to have a soft nice side. But, not want to mess with.The are some great female performances. Some thin, tough girls that add a beautiful touch to the film. They are not to be messed with. There is great use of leather in the film, which adds to this slick and eery look. The scenes, include warehouses and dark alley ways with minimal light. This almost feels to an area for a street fight, which is exactly what this film is. Although portrayed in a much less brutal, common fashion.i believe there is a computer game called sin city. It is probably like a street fight , type game. Probably very good, given the outcome of this film.This can be highly recommended, for its originality and quality visuals and special effects. The story is also very exciting and full of depth and character. Watching it several times, will likely open up new layers of the film, to the way the light moves in the background, to the sound of gun fire.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sin City not in the top 100?,"There have been mile stones in movie history before; for example, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas and Forrest Gump. Compare Sin City's dialog, visual aspects and advanced visual technology and it will stomp out any competition. Every one knows Bruce Willis is a incredible actor and gives nothing less than a perfect performance in Sin City or in any of his movies. The real actor that steals the show is Mickey Rourke. After this performance Mickey is definitely becoming one of Hollywoods ""A"" listers. After years of being in the acting business Rourke has finally made his name known and will not fade out like it has in the past. Also, who knew he was a total bad ass?",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Absolutely Beautiful,"This is a truly beautiful movie. It is black and white, but with a little bit of color. Mostly red, like blood and various objects. As you watch, everything looks real but you can tell that there is just something ""different"" about the way the cars drive and the way the people go about their lives. Nothing is as it seems.The acting is impressive as well. Mickey Rourke plays his character, Marv, outstandingly. Hopefully, Marv will renew his squandered career and we will get to see him in more good movies. Bruce Willis has now shown that he can play a tough guy with feelings instead of just a tough guy. Nick Stahl was a creep. Jessica Alba was seductive. Brittney Murphy was helpless (in a good way).I thought, for the first time, that this movie that was based on a comic book is actually a moving comic book. Spiderman did not leave that feeling, The Hulk did not leave that feeling, Dare Devil sure as hell didn't leave that feeling. Just Sin City. And it left me wanting more. Sequels Away!

The most incredible comic book movie ever!,I'm sure Frank Miller wept at seeing this- not out of misery of a botched movie- that the mood and poetry of his comics were so perfectly captured and put on screen. If Batman was done in this style I think I'd die of absolute bliss.This has to be one of the most mind bending nervy keep you on the edge of your seat movies that I've ever seen. You really aren't sure what's going to happen next or how one serial is going to tie into the next. The acting is phenomenal! And the directing has to be the best I've ever seen. Every scene sang and stood out beautifully. There were no lags or lapses of boredom. No ho hum bits to go get popcorn or go to the bathroom during. If you left you missed some integral bit that you'd surely kick yourself over.This movie is a dark little diamond. Enjoy it. Laugh. Gasp.

Strikingly Visionary,"Sin City is probably one of the more unforgettable films of the year. In this movie are images of dark cityscapes, haunting countrysides, and brooding characters that will stick with you for long hours after you see the movie. Colors and shadows leap to life from the screen. Some, like the glow of green eyes, are sultry and ethereal, whereas others, such as the jaundiced hue of the Yellow Bastard, are horrifically vivid. At any moment scenes become black and white silhouettes, becoming absolute works of art that burn themselves into your memory. The characters and scenes are more like dreams than anything else.However, although the style is probably the vanguard of the picture, there is substance underneath it.I'll begin by saying that this movie is not for everyone. It is intensely violent and the plots is classic pulp fiction and noir on steroids. If you are a viewer who does not care for such content, then, by all means, avoid this movie.Sin City, both the movie and city itself, is ugly. It is gritty, vicious, sleazy and ruthless. It is a rotting, cancerous hellhole of a place, a city without redemption. Yet there are heroes in this story, and they do have depth to them. But because they are heroes in such a place, they, too, must stoop to brutal violence.All of the characters are men whose empty and hounded lives are validated by the love of a women. Marv is played brilliantly by Mickey Rourke, who perhaps was born for the role. A sad, simple-minded, beast-like thug, Marv is embraced in the arms of a goddess-like woman and given what may be his first night of acceptance and love. The next morning he finds her murdered in bed next to him, and, refusing to let go of the brief reprieve she gave him, wages war on the underground of Sin City to find her killer and uncovers a lot of dirty secrets in the process.Dwight (Clive Owen) is a mysterious stranger about whom the viewer knows almost nothing but his intense devotions to Gail and the Old Town Girls, a mob-like confederation of prostitutes who police their own territories. When the abusive, drunk, and misogynist Jackie-Boy cruises into Old Town looking to lick his ego's wounds by beating up the first girl he finds, Dwight is ready to kill and willing to die as a result of the consequences.Bruce Willis plays what may be the most heart-breaking of all the stories. He plays Hartigan, the one good and noble cop in a city of vipers, and so the entire world is immediately against him. Hartigan is the only cop in Sin City willing to take down Junior, the insane son of a hellishly corrupt Senator who gets his sexual kicks by torturing, raping, and then murdering young girls. Hartigan, unable to bear the thought of skinny little Nacy Callahan, age 11, torn to ribbons at the hands of a perverse monster, hunts down Junior and risks everything he has. In trying to do the right thing, he loses all his friends and allies and is brutalized by Sin City, but never, ever gives up.Many people will deride Sin City because of its stylized direction, graphic violence, and outlandish characters. However, if you have the patience to get enveloped in the world of Sin City and maybe suspend you disbelief for just a moment, you'll find a rare gem of a film. I'll admit it starts out weak, and perhaps a little unexpectedly. But the movie picks up soon and shows you dreams you never even thought could exist.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Sin City's sins are Gluttony and Sloth, but forgivable...","Sin City lives up to its sleazy moniker with high gloss and style. As expected, there's nary a shred of redemption in this hard-boiled film adaptation of Frank Miller's Sin City series, however, it carries with it a feeling of guilty pleasure, no matter how brutal and sadistic.That said, the violence is highly stylized and defined by comic book physics. Characters are exploded, bullet blasted, even emphatically mutilated. No one dies until they're deliberately written out. The flick is literally pieced together by the panels that make up the graphic novels. It's shot in high contrast black and white with vibrant splotches of color to accentuate specific objects. The world this effect intones is completely convincing, unforgiving, and *cool*.The cast can get away with a lot of toss away lines because they're in such a cool movie. Understanding that this was a very faithful adaptation,it would take a really stellar talent to pull off lines like ""Kill him for me. Kill him good...""or ""I've been killin my way to the truth..."". But it is what it is. These words were born in little white bubbles.On the performance side, Mickey Rourke makes this movie likable. He brings a lot of charm to the hulking, ugly brute Marv. His takes gleeful delight in the Hard Goodbye he gives to his Hooker With the Heart of Gold's murderers. Marv won over the theater audience who were pretty wary up till his entrance in the first of four lisle entwined sequences.. After him, it's hard to find characters to get behind, even though they're familiar faces. You kind of have to side with Bruce Willis's Hartigan, but he's trying to save a little girl from the rape murder promised by That Yellow Bastard, so what choice do you have?The rest of the cast is suitable, even if it does feel like cameos. the story is self aware so it doesn't leave them much room for preening in like say, Oceans Tweleve. Bencio Del Toro will freak you out yet again. There's lots of Sin here. Plenty of lust, greed, and wrath. Lots and lots of wrath. Sin City comes close to drowning in it's own blood, though, as it recycles it's themes of Pride and revenge through constant, detached monologue. Fortunately, the visuals and high intensity atmosphere make Sin City the ride a comic book flick should be.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Too literal?,"I loved this movie! My one gripe is , having read all of the source material, I knew exactly what was going to happen next. It's kind of like going to see a band like the Eagles who are so precise in their re-creation of a song (right down to the guitar solos) that there is no surprise left. That being said, the look and feel of the film was nothing short of astonishing and I'm more than happy to be able, finally, to ""complain"" about a film-from-comic being utterly faithful to the source material. Kevin Smith commented several years ago that the reason there weren't any really good adaptations of comic books to film was due to the studio higher-ups tinkering with a proved story to the point that it no longer resembled what had made it so popular in the first place! That is obviously not the case here and I can't wait for the sequel so I can be ""unsurprised"" some more.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
...It's still a novel,"The movie Sin City was entertaining, but had too many missing pieces. True the movie had all the action you would want, but it wasn't even in color... maybe that's brings more excitement, but I want details.There are three different stories that are told, one story lasts for about 3 minutes, the second 20 minutes, and the third about an hour long. Then the second comes back for a good 40 minutes, and the first at the end for 1 minute. I understand how the director is trying to switch from point to point and connect them at the end, but the connection was horrible. The only connection made was when the 2 detectives were seen together in the bar. Their relation of Nancy was too little to make a good connection in story plot.During the entire movie, only about a fourth of it consists of actual talking between actors. The narrator speaks for most of the film, which gets annoying after a short while. The detectives thoughts are too much like a novel, and should be more that of a movie.A good thing about the movie was the action. It never stopped, and the heroes never died! Bruce Willis gets shot about 12 times, does not die until he commits suicide. Mickey Rourke must have been blasted over 60 times, especially with the Uzi guns... he doesn't show pain. This is not reality, too much like an action comic. Every villain except for Jr. gets shot ONCE and dies right then and there, this needs more reality.6/10. Nothing special, but enjoyable.

Never seen something this pointless and unproductive,"I don't personally mind a bit of Hollywood-ketchup dripping and heads or hands hacked off (there they go) here and there in case it is reasonable, or else, appropriate or necessary for the story, really, however very strongly supposing that there IS a story.I suggest you only go for this masterpiece in case you have nothing better to do, better things in this event including several punches in your face, a car accident and an annoyed rattlesnake locked in with you in an unlit elevator that's just got stuck.For instance, there is no plot whatsoever unless you consider the fact that everyone gets either wholly or partially eaten up by others or totally or partially killed by the end of the movie, a story.Characters just wander up and about the place, and if you fear, blood is all over well, as for one thing, you won't see it from the slime sprinkling all around and covering it. As said before, the sprinkling does not lead anywhere. It is a joyful per se sprinkling we have to deal with.All the blood and lousy horror-effects available have been carefully collected to add up to a pointless and unintelligent massacre, in the end of which the only feeling you will have when leaving the cinema is that of a strong disappointment in both the directors (whom we have thought and seen to be capable of doing better) and yourself for having been brainless enough to sign up for such a waste of time and money, in the present case, your time, and your money.Don't be fooled by the brilliant cast!

Sin City is highly overrated => 3/10.,"I found this movie extremely disappointing. If you have any doubts about seeing it, have another movie option, or just plain have something better to do, then I recommend passing on this movie. Perhaps rent the DVD in a few months if you're still curious.One of the factors that influenced my choosing to see this movie was its high rating here on IMDb - anything with over an 8/10 is usually reasonably good (or at least not terrible)... until now. If you're a teenage boy with a short attention span (or one at heart), then you'll *love* this movie, and will likely become a rabid fan attempting to convert (and/or purge) the nonbelievers (look around this message board). Otherwise you will probably leave the theater decidedly unimpressed.And for the record, I loved Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction; Sin City attempts to create a kind of Tarantino-esk film noir artistry, but just ends up coming across like the cut scenes in a bad video game.

I am not a big fan of CGI effects in general, but this movie seems made for them.Some people have dismissed the characters as underdeveloped, but is that not the point of the film? These aren't supposed to be real characters, they are comic book characters, they are almost arch types.The thin line between right and wrong the ""good guys"" in this film walk is never far from the surface, but in Sin City you can torture people and still be a ""good guy"". The men in this film are all violent, the women are mostly one dimensional sex objects. Thats the world they inhabit, and the women in this film are certainly not weak. In fact they kick more butt then any man. Many people can't get by the fact that this film takes place in a stylized world that exists in the fantasy of many young boys.

Ce have comic book action where cars literally bop over the city outskirts and I can not understate the enchantment of the visuals. Robert Rodriguez and Frank Millers together ensure that Sin City is also just a cliché filled teen aged fantasy where the girls have different faces but similar young and gyrating bodies before age starts to settle in. This fantasy is a blend of three leading stories whose stars' voices almost become one run-on monologue that is a blend of understated tough man and sleep inducing mantra. I get it.

"Probably a good movie, but I'm too stupid to understand it.","OK you may call me an idiot or at least non-intellectual for not liking this movie, but I'm sorry, that's how I feel. And since everyone else loved it, I guess it's me who doesn't understand from good movies.First of all it's not a full length movie, it's three non-related stories that were forced to be related to each other so that three of them could make one movie. As I said before, it's just me, who just can't enjoy watching ""amores perros"" type of movie where the writer writes three-four short stories and tries to relate them to make a movie out of them.Secondly, I know it's me again, but I got extremely bored and was surprised how such a violent movie can be boring. There's not much to say about a movie if u keep looking at the time while watching. I really believe this movie was famous and liked just because of its famous director Robert Rodriguez. Like for example, ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" was a hundred times better, giving that dark ""comic book"" atmosphere on every scene.And I don't wanna talk about the non-needed weirdness of the movie, like the devil looking guy who we don't have any idea why he looks like that. I don't wanna talk about it cause it probably has an explanation only the comic-fans know. But what the hell, even the ""Fantastic Four"" movie had come up with explanations with the heroes' ridiculous super powers.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A brilliantly filmed  horrible movie,"Sin City breaks new ground in digital cinema. The aesthetics are riveting, lush, often gorgeous and breathtaking, ever attention getting. The movie is also horrible. It isn't horrible necessarily because of all the casual murders, tortures, beheadings, dismemberments, cannibalism . It isn't horrible because it it composed of three story lines crudely stitched together like Frankenstein's head. It is horrible because it depicts a world--this world?--where there is absolutely no possibility of progress, no possibility of justice, absolutely no hope. A world where suicide--literally suicide--is the only answer. it is breathtaking in its depressingly sick nihilism. In the old Holllywood studio system a studio head would have looked a this script and said, ""Wait a minute..."" and writers would have been brought in. This movie, however, did not have the benefit of that and will be proof to Holllywood and the rest of the literate world that technogeeks are more interested in developing yellow color that doesn't run against a blue background than in producing a script with rising and falling action, catharsis, just depressing muddle.

Film Noir Re-Invented in a Dazzling Fictional World,"""Sin City"" is a sizzling tribute to the impact of 1930's noir fiction on popular culture imagery.So it was amusing that my husband and I were more than twice the age of the other audience members and we were enjoying laughing out loud to the satirical references that none of them seemed to get.I hope all the attention to the violence won't keep away other people who are old enough to remember the roots of graphic novels in the hard-boiled detective in a corrupt city book and movie genre, as the film is actually much less gory than ""Kill Bill"" and such action films as ""Assault on Precinct 13"" and has a lot in common with ""L.A. Confidential."" While the crimes that are described or committed are macabrely heinous, descending from the progenitor noir ""M,"" we actually don't see them directly, as the camera either pulls away or we see them in silhouette or after. So it is the power of your imagination that turns your stomach.Imagination is set free in a highly stylized, mostly black and white universe beget by ""Metropolis"" and much more effectively realized here than any of the ""Batman"" movies, as color, particularly blood red, only appears for emphasis.As the intersecting stories flash back and forward, we also find that some of the characters actually survive their tortures, albeit transformed physically or psychologically.Most of the actors fit into the hyper-reality of this fictional world, particularly Bruce Willis, a sinuous Jessica Alba and virtually unrecognizable Mickey Rourke and Benicio Del Toro. The planes of Clive Owen's and Rosario Dawson's faces look great but they are having so much fun playing atypical roles that they can't keep the requisite straight faces and don't generate the necessary chemistry. Owen's Brit accent slips in occasionally (I was wondering if like Hugh Laurie's qualms in ""House, M.D."" that those sentences had a lot of R's in them) while Dawson does have to wear what must be the most uncomfortable thongs and stiletto heels.The women's position in this society and therefore in the film is of course problematical. While the only opportunities for women are as scantily clad bar maids, entertainers or prostitutes, we're supposed to respect that they have brokered empowerment among the powers that be to run their own businesses that capitalize on men's baser needs, as well as having an overly stereotyped mysterious Asian assassin as one of their own.The women are the fulcrum of the film as their exaggerated knights errant are obsessed to the death with defending them and their hard fought position in exchange for even a little artless affection from them, which raises the view of women here a smidgen above teen boys' comic book fantasies. I haven't yet looked at Frank Miller's source material to know if Alexis Bledel's character originally does call her mom a lot or if that was added for an additional pop culture reference layer to ""Gilmore Girls,"" as the dialog and the images are full of such touchstones.The music is terrifically propulsive in adding to the momentum.But that is just one of the many components that multitasking Robert Rodriguez has taken care of himself to create as enveloping and more exciting a visual environment than the ""The Matrix"" movies.",,Anonymous,Crime

The best movie of 2005.,"Rated R for sustained strong stylized violence,nudity and sexual content including dialogue.I first saw Sin City when I rented it a year ago.Since then I have seen the film three times.Sin City is simply an amazing movie.I consider it to be my all time favorite movie.This movie is almost flawless.Some of the acting is good and some not as good.However aside from the acting this movie is excellent.Excellent plot,lots of violence,great special effects and it feels exactly like a graphic novel.Sin City is based on the graphic novels of the same name.The first film in the Sin City series(there is going to be a Sin City 2 and 3) is based on the first three graphic novels which are The Hard Goodbye,The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow Bastard.All those three amazing graphic novels are put together in one movie.There is a little skit at the beginning as well with Josh Hartnett.The first story The Hard Goodbye is about a very strong,ugly man named Marv.He wants to get revenge on the person who killed his prostitute.With the help of the prostitutes twin sister they both go searching for the killer and kill them.The second story The Big Fat Kill is about a couple of prostitutes who kill someone causing trouble without knowing he's a cop.The man who was with them disposes the bodies of the cop and his friends by going to the tar pits.However there are a lot of people who want the cops head.The third and final story is called That Yellow Bastard.It is the story of a cop who puts a pedophile in a coma.The father of the pedophile is a US senator and he wants the cop to say he was the pedophile.So he does and spends eight years in prison.When he gets out he looks for Nancy the little girl who is his only friend.He must protect her from the pedophile who becomes That Yellow Bastard.Sin City is an excellent film made up of three excellent stories.It is a must buy film!Runtime:124min10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Review - Sin City,"Even though I believe cinema and comic books have different appeals which can't be transposed or copied on each other without a part of its message being lost in translation. Sin City's aesthetic qualities and original ideas were nevertheless unique in their style in the 2000s. Indeed, like the eponymous graphic novel, the motion picture questioned the conventions on the form and impacted its respective medium. We still see the impact of this new ideology, namely in Zack Snyder's Post-300 work.Part of Sin City's greatest innovation consists of the use of black and white, contrast, light, etc, that for a film exaggerating on film-noir, and pulp novels characteristics, is effective. There are also the sparely used dominant colors, not always where we expect them, not only accentuating scenes, but effectively triggering unexpected emotions from the viewer, colors that stick with us after the viewing, we can associate with moments, characters, so on. There is visual research with these colors that, not so surprisingly since Frank Miller co-directed the film, is much more pertinent and original than Schindler's List.If, as I detailed above, I consider Sin City's aesthetic as a meticulous work on the form. The same thing can't be said for the content. It is often forgotten that Frank Miller is very engaged politically. That his graphic novels aren't just entertaining sexy/violent adventures of tortured heroes. We have seen it more recently with Holly Terror. His political views aren't the most nuanced and subtle. Sin City, for instance, criticizes corrupted/amoral authority and nazism. It disappoints me that his visual style merely covers up the flaws of his screenwriting. I notice this also in the depiction of women, always the preys, the victims of men, unless they fit his political ideas (the women of Old Town)All that taken into account, Sin City isn't the masterpiece everyone has been raving about. Regardless, it can be seen by the general public as it was intended by Robert Rodriguez, as entertainment. And, possibly Robert Rodriguez's finest entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent adult viewing,"The actors were superb in this movie, reminding me of gritty film noir flicks without the soap opera like acting of those olden days. Any fan of old detective classics such as PI Marlow himself will be impressed. Any fan of comic book artwork will absolutely adore this movie. Certainly, the language and violence are not meant for kids. However, such things are at least not gratuitous. The use of black and white vs. the rare dramatic use of color throughout the movie was exceptionally well done. Don't listen to anyone trying to compare this movie to 'Pulp Fiction' either, though that was certainly an interesting film as well. 'Sin City' is completely unique and the feel of it is something that really can't be grouped with other movies. Rutger Hauer provided a performance even better than what he delivered in 'Blade Runner'.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Makes Tank Girl look like a bad film.,"Comic books (or graphic novels, or whatever you want to call them) don't particularly interest me. Never have. It's not that I necessarily dislike them, I've just never felt the urge to shell out money for them. I'd much rather watch movies. Strangely though, I seem to really love movies BASED on comic books. Particularly the recent ones. Spider-Man 1 & 2. X-Men 1 & 2. Batman Begins. Hulk. I even like that rubbish Tank Girl movie, mostly because of Ice-T's brilliant turn as an ex-cop-turned-kangaroo-mutant. It is the absolute BEST portrayal of an ex-cop-turned-kangaroo-mutant you will EVER see on film. Lori Petty wasn't bad, either.But none of them come close to matching Sin City for sheer movie badness (meant in a positive way, like the way the hip kids say it. Actually, 'sickness' is probably a more appropriate term). This is a grand day in the history of film-making. It is without a doubt the BEST movie Mickey Rourke has EVER been in. And Brittany Murphy, for that matter. It's really, REALLY good. Just don't let the kids see it, and don't watch it with your Mum. Trust me, I speak from experience. My Mum likes NICE movies. And this one's anything but.As implied above, I had no prior knowledge of Frank Miller's books. I'm sure they're great, and, from what I've heard, the movie's style is very true to them. But, with respect, that means little to me. I'm just looking at Sin City as a movie. And a damn fine one it is.First of all, the visual style of the film is breathtaking. But there's been enough said about that already, and I can't really add anything new, except that I dug Dwight's red shoes. Yay red shoes!The dialogue is brilliantly corny. It's original, but phrased in that old-fashioned, clichéd, b-grade film-noir way. And it sounds great, particularly when coming from the mouths of such talented actors. Even the above-mentioned Mr. Rourke and Ms. Murphy - who I usually wouldn't touch with the narrow end of a broom while wearing a radiation suit - are superb in their roles. In fact, Marv is the best character in the film, and Rourke's portrayal stands out above the stellar ensemble surrounding him. The other two 'leading men' - Clive Owen's Dwight and Bruce Willis's Hartigan - are also very good, but lack Marv's beautiful, brutal simplicity. Plus their chins are nowhere near as big, and their coats nowhere near as fine-lookin'.I was impressed by EVERYONE's performance, even those from actors who no longer impress me, due to the fact that they always impress me (Don't worry, I know what I mean). I'm not going to go into WHY everyone was so good, as there were so many actors who were so good in so many different ways. From A-for-Alba to Z-for- um - Wood, I loved 'em all.Elijah Wood as the CREEPIEST villain in recent movie history? Didn't see THAT coming!And was that REALLY Carla Gugino? I'll never look at Spy Kids the same way again, that's for DAMN sure! Zoinks!Robert Rodriguez, you film-making pioneer, you. You DEADSET LEGEND you! I used to think Once Upon a Time in Mexico was your masterpiece. How incredibly silly I now feel.What more can I say? Nothing really, except......give me sequel! NOW!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Cinematic Genius,"Straight from the pages of the Frank Miller graphic novels comes Robert Rodriguez's best film to date, and possibly one of the greatest film events ever seen! Weaving three tales together (three and a bit if you include the opening segment), this is a throwback to classic film noir, but brought bang up to date with some of the most striking visuals of recent years. I had hopes for this film, but some worries. Being a fan of the comic book, could the film actually live up to the style of Miller's creations? The answer is a resounding ""Yes!"" as all the frames and characters come to buoyant life. The film doesn't just do the comic justice, it actually becomes the comic, and by doing so surpasses it, as we get to see the once 2D characters live on screen for us! A bit of background for those not in the know. Sin City was a series of short stories, and long tales, set in a fictional town called Basin City. Through it we were introduced to a variety of characters, none of them truly good (except, perhaps, Hartigan  played by Willis in the film), and plenty bad. From Marv, the disfigured ex-con who seeks the killer of a woman he loved, to Roark Jr, aka That Yellow Bastard (played by Stahl), their tales were interwoven, but never interfered with each other. The graphic novels were skillfully drawn in black and white, with the occasional hint of color (a red dress here, yellow skin there), paying homage to the old noir style which inspired them. The tales were the stuff of pulp novella, and the imagery striking. The film takes 3 of the tales and weaves them together, recreating the pages from the comic, and giving a film which many have compared to Pulp Fiction due to the disjointed-time story telling. However, that is an unfair comparison, Pulp Fiction was not this good! Robert Rodriguez has always delivered strong films on a low budget, from El Mariachi and Depserado (the latter cost $8million), to Faculty and Spy Kids. With Sin City he has taken $30million and made a film that looks like it cost $200million!! Frank Miller, the creator of the comics, joined him on set to direct  Rodriguez didn't want to adapt the storyhe wanted the film to BE the comic! Miller was reluctant to join  in the past his work has been trashed on screen, with his Robocop 2 script ending up a pale shadow of the original idea by the time it was filmed. Rodriguez managed to convince him that this would be different by bringing him in to witness a 'screentest'. That 'screentest' is the opening segment (featuring Josh Hartnett), and it blew Miller away! It wasn't only the reproduction of a short tale he wrote, it was visually perfect! In order to create the unique look the film has  that being a comic book on screen  Rodriguez turned to the technologies that helped him craft Spy Kids, and used a lot of green-screen. Much like how Sky Captain was made, with the cast being the only real things on display and all else being added later, Sin City was given the look by computers. You wouldn't tell really! The cars are all CGI, the chair, tables, bottles, toiletsall CGI, yet look more real than anything else! Visually the film is a masterpiece, the black and white working well to set the mood. The occasional flash of color ignites the screen, and highlights the focus at the time. The flips to negative are right out of the comic, the silhouetting of characters, and the unique coloration of the blood, all add to the wonderful style.The film could have been all looks and no heart, but the performances on offer from some of the industry's greatest names lend more than character to the players. Bruce Willis, after a few years of stagnant roles, returns to splendid form, much in the way he did in Pulp Fiction. Mickey Roarke, behind the prosthetics, manages to get you caring for Marv, who, at heart, is a bit of a nutjob! Jessica Alba is delightfully delicious as Nancy, Del Toro is strangely understandable as Jackie Boythe list goes on and on! No one actor dominates the film, with everyone lending equal might to their roles. Stahl's evil Yellow Bastard is perfect, and as for Elijah Wood's role as the murderous nut, Kevin, all I can say iswow! No egos come out for the whole film, no one star tries to be the focus of the film. All of the cast seem to know that there is only one star here, Frank Miller! With such strong performances, outstanding cinematic beauty, and well woven story-telling aspects, it only needs a great soundtrack to make this film complete, and here is where Rodriguez shows his genius is complete, by scoring a fantastically atmospheric 'noir' kind of soundtrack! Inspired by the kind of music you hear in old Bogart movies, this is typical gangster/detective tunes, but given that Sin City feel.For fans of the comic book, I cannot recommend this film to you enough. You will laugh, cry, and be in awe at your anti-heroes coming to life. For those without a clue as to the comic's existence, don't feel you will be alienated. No, this film can reach out to you all as it relies on one simple thinggreat stories! Who doesn't like them?",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"This Film has been Rated ""Über-Badass"" by the Hungarian Film Association","""Holy S#%t."" That was the first thing to escape my mouth upon exiting the theater after watching Sin City. This movie was truly amazing in every sense of the word. I believe the castration count of this movie is somewhere near six, with one guy losing his boys twice, so in short it is a very violent movie, but the violence is tastefully done and isn't just thrown in to make the movie cool. I will admit that Elijah Wood's character (Kevin)disturbed me more than I've ever been disturbed before. How, you ask? You'll find out.The three narratives tackled in this movie fit well together and all have enjoyable characters and intriguing plot lines. The story of Marv, was my personal favorite, mainly because Marv is the ultimate badass and because it was the story that creeped me out the most.

It's one of my favorite films.I never know where I would sit, but it's definitely in the top 3.But we're talking about the theatrical version here and I really can't stand that. I think it's really badly edited because the fragmentation of the episodes doesn't do the narrative any good. And the fact that the plot isn't broken up by a title sequence or an episode cover just annoys me.It's definitely a film that will never be shown again today. We have an all-star cast. We have a black and white neo-noir film. It was just shot in front of a green screen. It's clearly for adults, so for older people, with nothing infantile or childish and.

Everything a buff could want.,"""By Jove! I've never seen anything so unreal in my life. And earth struck me as something great and invincible, like evil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion."" Joseph Conrad's Marlow in Heart of DarknessFor the comic book geeks who can't warm up to Spiderman 2 and Hellboy film adaptations because they're dated and lack high art, Frank Miller's Sin City has some of the highest artwork ever with characters straight out of Miller's dark, post-modern noirish magazines. The film is broken up into the morbid adventures of three very tough guys in the fictional Basin City and a bevy of scantily clad femme fatales as deadly as the guys. Against a backdrop of a perfectly CGI'd city, this film has everything a buff could want except sophisticated plot, never a demand when artwork dominates. Sin City abounds, however, in themes of honor, lust and redemption, the stuff of hard-boiled film noir.Of the three heroes in three stories, Mickey Rourke as Marv is the most memorable, made up like Hellboy, just as impervious to pain as that bad boy, and tender to his women, albeit they are super efficient at prostitution or assassination, depending on the need. The impressive Bruce Willis is Frank Hartigan, ex-cop on his last day before retirement, looking after the welfare of an 11-year old girl, who just happens to be an attractive grown up 19 when he is released from jail. Don't ask; it's complicated but comprehensible when you view the film. For the women, Rosario Dawson as Gail the hooker Valkyrie is unbeatably tough and gorgeous, and just as dangerous as the men for those traits.The black and white of film noir, which accentuates the broad conflict between good and evil, is splashed with bits of color, especially red blood, and yellow, for that matter. The heroes are about as flawed as a Bogart detective on a bad day, and the women as voluptuous as an R rating will allow before it turns to NC-17. Although the three minimalist plots seem to revolve around some type of revenge, the important element is the evocation of an underworld unremittingly evil, just short of a true hell on earth. Because this is Frank Miller's comic book world, men are riddled with bullet holes but often recover to find revenge another day.Rourke's confrontation with a powerful bishop and his murderous son is a tribute to Miller's vision of a flawed universe, where evil is unchecked and churches are often at the center of corruption. Sounds like today to me.",,Anonymous,Crime
The best adaptation,"Hello I'm a Spanish guy. This movie release in my country when the movie release in DVD in America. But I watched this movie in a pass of distributors. This movie is the best visual adaptation of the comic material ... and the Frank Miller's world. The adaptation of Batman Begins it's OK ... but the essence of the Frank Miller's world I didn't see in Batman Begins ... but in Sin City it's visible in the entire movie. The story and the screenplay it's exactly the same thing that the comic book. The cinematography and the visual effects are perfect for the structure of the comic book ... the visual effects there aren't in this movie for entertain or amuse there are for built the world of sin city. The co-direction of Robert Rodriguez & Frank Miller are amazing, the editing it's energetic and the musical score from Rodriguez & co. it's wonderful for this movie genre.

incredible,"Despite my score, the film is not flawless, but it is close enough to it to merit such a score. I saw this twice on the big screen, and countless times on the special edition DVD. it is a masterwork of technology and style blending together to create a noir hell of an environment. each episode connects and yet stands alone. repeated viewings are vital, of both versions, in order to understand and appreciate all that it contains. The strongest element in the film would have to be the visuals, and then, surprisingly, the acting. it's truly amazing the depth and life that Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke and others bring to their roles. if I have any complaints about the film, it is that I wanted more, and we the audience will get that in the forthcoming sequels. the film begins with a mans voice-over begins, accompanied briefly by a delirious jazz note, and continues through a scene straight out of a pulp fiction tale, before diving into the Marv sequence. I had trouble deciding which tale was ""the best"" and have settled on the idea that each one is equal to another, and simply different. The Marv sequence is a classic murder-mystery Revenge tale, while The Big Fat Kill is action and the final tale falls somewhere in the realm of bitter love. each is extraordinary, and each is supreme in execution. The lighting, the makeup, and the special effects-which one can argue is the whole film-are amazing. the last comment comes from the fact that the majority of backgrounds and sets in the film exist only in the realm of digital code. Even certain characters are on-screen concurrently only through the same process. simply incredible and an intriguing glimpse into the future of film technology. Aside from Batman Begins and Road to Perdition, I have never seen a graphic novel or comic book brought to the screen as well as Sin City has been. a triumph on every level.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliant,"Quite simply brilliant. From the ultra-stylish cinematography to the remarkable faithfulness to the Frank Miller comics.I was never a fan of green screen. Until Sin City. I was never a fan of Bruce Willis. Until Sin City. I was never a fan of Clive Owen. Until Sin City.Rodriguez pulls out unequalled performances from every actor in a film that sets the standards for quality cinema.Only very momentarily does the script border on pretension but these rare moments are so fleeting they are negated by the many strengths of this film.Obvious highlights were the Mickey Rourke/Elijah Wood interactions. The pure revulsion of Nick Stahls character in the latter stages of the movie is overwhelming.I have to say though, it was Clive Owen and his surrounding story that I found the most appealing, and the brief opening/closing appearances of Josh Harshnett oozes class.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Sin City, Robert Rodriguez's best movie yet!","Robert Rodriguez has nailed it. Finally a director that understands comics, what they are and how stories are told in them. The whole movie feels like a giant comic book where the only things missing in it are the dialog boxes. Benicio del Toro's, Elijah Wood's and Mickey Rourke's performances are excellent, they seem to have jumped out of the comic page and into the screen. Even though almost all of the movie was shot using a blue/green screen and some people think this didn't look well in the final product, in my opinion it doesn't matter. I was to immersed in the story to notice technical glitches or odd graphics. Robert Rodriguez is one of those rare directors that really loves making movies and understands what telling stories is all about. With Sin City he has shown moviegoers what can be done with a camera and a good story line.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A comic book literally brought to life.,"An exploration of the dark and miserable Basin City and three of its residents, all of whom are caught up in violent corruption.Sin City is not a comic book adaptation, but a comic book literally being brought to life. Directing duo, Robert Rodriquez and Frank Miller masterfully bring Miller's iconic comic book to the big screen. From the hyper-stylized cinematography to the witty writing that feels like it is straight from the 1940s, it's a neo-noir like no other. From the beginning, we are immediately swept away into the cesspool that is Basin City. With three unique stories, that highlight a different part of the city's characters and problems. Each of these stories, is, for the most part, perfectly balanced and complements one another. All of them are fantastically told through a different narrator, and given slightly different tones/themes for each one. The substance of the film perfectly matches its hyper-stylization and is truly a comic book film like no other.With the witty writing that feels like it is straight out of detective stories from the 40s and 50s came some great acting from this film's stacked cast. Now I will say that some of the actors really did struggle with some of the dialogue, but thankfully they weren't on the screen for that long. Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Bruce Willis are our three narrators and all of them do a fantastic job. Each of them gives immense depth to their complex characters. Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, and Nick Stahl each bring fantastic side characters to this film. However, the biggest standout came from Elijah Wood as the silent, cannibalistic, serial killer. For having very few minutes of screen time, he leaves his mark on this film as being one of the creepiest and most terrifying villains I've seen in a long time.The film's iconic black and white cinematography, with very few slashes of colors, is absolutely gorgeous. The visual queues when color does appear is a perfect use of visual storytelling. It gives this film such a unique aesthetic that perfectly aligns with the comics and the setting. The VFX in the film has sadly not aged that well. Some of of the shots still hold up pretty well, while others have aged poorly. Overall, Sin City is a breath of fresh air when it not only comes to comic book adaptations but also films in general.I am giving Sin City, an A.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Graphic in many ways,"I'm not given to flights of extravagant praise, being old and cynical, but this is the best film I've seen in years. Stylistically it's an absolute feast for the eyes, incredibly tight and economical. The actors attack their roles with a real enthusiasm, and some of the performances, particularly Micky Rourke and Clive Owen, are superb. It's great to see Rourke back, albeit unrecognisable in the prosthetics. Perhaps not Bruce Willis's best ever performance, but he's good too, though not as old and grizzled looking as he could have been. The women are beautiful and sexy, the men are dark and dangerous, the scenery is brooding and uncomfortable. OK I admit I'm a fan of Miller's graphic novel work, but I don't know the Sin City series at all. From that standpoint I have to say that it really doesn't matter if you are a fan of Frank Miller's work or not. However, the violence in this film is constant, ripe, and graphic. Even with the duotone look of this movie, and the fact that blood is generally shown white, not red, it's gory and not for the faint-hearted. I only remember ONE real laugh in it too. But the fact is that this is an amazing movie. The foyer of the cinema I went to had framed prints from the books alongside the same frames from the film, and if anyone has any doubts about it being true to the original - I've never seen such attention to detail. Awesome. Go and see it. You'll be talking about it for weeks.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"One-dimensional, macho, pseudo-arty trash","This movie is the worst one I have seen in ages. Hailed as some kind of cult movie because done in black and white with the occasional red in some scenes, its content is outrageously and plain stupid. Its target group (hence the cartoon format) is certainly adolescent male adults. The lines are unintentionally comical because they seem like a compilation of all super-heroes' tough lines. Worst is the movie's unashamed sexism. All thinking beings (and unfortunately the protagonists are thinking out loud their brainless trash lines) are male. Females, who are mostly prostitutes (or ""merchandise"" as they are pseudo-critically called)or dancers who are not assumed to think while they are pleasing the oversexualised males. Moreover are they all in need of male help or protection throughout the film, which constitutes again a nice appeal to primal male urges. One woman, a lesbian, who, of course, appears naked in her first scene, is called a 'dike' by one of the protagonists, even though he cannot comprehend her sexual orientation because 'with that body she could get any guy"". In real life you would get punched in your face for such stupid statements. In this movie for some strange reason, and I suspect it is due to its 'arty' form, this gets elevated to a level of cult.This movie is horrible stupefaction and should be watched more critically.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Just plain wrong,"This is not really a review, as I walked out of this dreadful film before the first of the stories had ended.I can't remember ever seeing the kind of appalling violence that this film contained.While it will be excused by many as ""comic book"" violence, it is still violence -- and the kind of indoctrination in violence which has turned our country into one of the most violence prone nations on earth.Is it any wonder that America could invade Iraq, kill tens of thousands of people, then find out that the weapons of mass destruction we used as an excuse for the invasion never existed in the first place. Yet that seems to bother many Americans not in the least.No, this movie didn't cause that, but I am convinced that films like this one contribute to the atmosphere of violence which now hovers over America on a permanent basis.This film is part of a sickness that grips our world --the sickness which makes violence our foremost form of entertainment.",,Anonymous,Crime
Move over Tarantino!!!,"WOW WOW WOW!!! This is by far and away the greatest comic adaptation ever made. if anything this year matches this then it would have to be some film, i mean even Josh Hartnett came across as being cool!! The way Rodriguez has filmed this and added his own flavour to film noir is breathtaking in its originality, to take the age old black and white film put it on green screen and add spats of colour made this a visual feast. The story's were all awesome in there portrayal but the standout was Mickey Rourkes Marv, a likable hard man who is framed for the murder of a girl he has only known for a few hours but feels such a strong connection to her that he swears vengeance, and sets out on a mission to kill who ever is behind her murder. the cast in this film is perfect, Clive Owens Dwight, Bruce Willis' Hartigan, Jessica Alba's Nancy and Rosario Dawsons Gail are all brilliant but the magnificent Marv is still the standout character that everyone will remember, a spin off would be much appreciated Mr Rodriguez.To the people who slate this film i say this, don't come to see films with 18 certificates and then complain about sex and violence, i mean there not called GRAPHIC novels for nothing!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"In a word, Awesome","I was anxiously awaiting Sin City ever since I heard that it was going to be a live-action film. But throughout the months that led up to its opening, I was constantly asking myself, ""Could they pull it off"", ""How can they film this scene"", ""I hope they don't make it politically correct""...All I can say now is, ""Wow"". This movie is excellent... But keep in mind that I'm a fan of the Graphic Novels and I could understand why someone would hate this movie. The movie is very dark and violent (just the way I like it) and I've already seen it twice. The first time, I was in awe and comparing the book and the film in my head. The second time, I just sat down and took it in with awe. Everyone (7 different friends) I went to the movies with also loved it as well and only half of them (3) have read the books.The coolest thing after watching this movie was when a guy on a date behind me said ""Wow, that was the greatest movie ever"" and his date said ""That was disgusting, I want to go home"".",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not only did it keep me on the edge of my seat, it made me feel like I was there with the characters throughout the whole thing. The movie didn't have me guessing about things though and I like to go along with the story rather than try to keep guessing throughout the whole film. I just can't get over it.

21st  Century Film Noir Classic!,"Just incredible! Finally a comic book story which rocks! The Sin City creator Frank Miller teamed up with hot directors Robert Rodrigues and Quentin Tarantino who moved the dark but edgy comic book story to the big screen. Rodrigues even resigned himself from the Assosiciaton of film directors so that ""Sin City"" could have three director mentioned in the credits. ""Sin City"" had to been very important to it's makers.The movie is based on the great graphic novels ""The Big Fat Kill"" and ""The Yellow Bastard"" of the Sin City-series. The movie is a fantastic way to celebrate the film noir traditions. They used a special ""green screen"" technique to create the Basin City. The world is wholly artificial. The movie is basically black and white but it shows hints of red, yellow and blue colors.The movie combines a couple stories; a human-hater Marv (comeback star Mickey Rourke) is accused to have murdered the extraordinarily beautiful hooker Goldie (supermodel Jaime King); ex-photographer Dwight (Clive Owen) takes down a dirty cop and tries to cover it up; a hard boiled copper Hartigan (Bruce Willis is on a mission to save and protect the young Nancy (Jessica Alba) from the maniac child molester Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl). The movie provides some nice supporting characters like the psychotic man-eating man played by Elijah Wood etc..""Sin City"" is brutal but gorgeous film about love, hate and revenge.

Not One Minute Wasted,"Firstly, let me say clearly that I hate violent movies and until recently, with the exception of the 'Kill Bill' films and 'Pulp Fiction' which I saw for the first time just recently, I was a fanatic ""NO GUNS EVER"" in any film I saw. This film, 'Sin City' is against everything I believe in but the film, in all its gore and violence and schmaltz, makes me not care about my rules. The first time I saw it, I was intrigued and it took me about 4 times until I finally saw the whole thing and put it all together. I love the dialogue, the way these characters use the most melodramatic lines from old film noir films and present them in a way that makes it all so normal. You definitely know the prose are in the mode of old films but it fits so well in its black and white (except when they show in color or techno white where someone has been shot or decapitated or had an arm ripped off) setting. It is just so dramatic! It drags you into its story lines happily and perhaps feeling guilty that you are enjoying it so much. You end up liking the hookers in 'Old Town' and the way they got and keep their independence. It is an old time movie, hating the bad guys and loving the good guys and gals and forgiving them their sins as their ultimate ideal makes them forgivable. Everything fits into this film. Every 'method', type of dialogue, scene, actor, cinematography...they all fit together into one great film. The actors, and I point out specifically; Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy and Rosario Dawson are perfect. Murphy is a doe eyed 'bad girl with the heart of gold' that uses her dialogue like a caricature (as this whole film is) of the films of the 40s. Dawson is superwoman and Owen is wonderful in all he does and soon will be huge in this country. He has the 'tude, looks, manner, etc. to be anything from James Bond to Satan (which he does in this film)and back again! One must have a stomach for the most graphic violence, from cannibalism to brain dicing. I could go on but cannot. It is a great film and cannot wait to purchase it! If you are in therapy, give it to your therapist and then have a session discussing your feelings about this film, as psychologically, this film tells you a lot about ones psyche!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Guy Flick But Girls Will Go Too.,"Sin City is a collection of interweaving stories all based in the corrupt, crime infested hell-hole that is Basin City. The three main stories revolve around Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is seeking the murderer of a beautiful woman; Dwight (Clive Owen) an ex-photographer who accidentally kills a cop, and Hartigan (Bruce Willis) a retiring policeman who is convicted of a crime he didn't commit. All the stories are based on the graphic novels ""Sin City"", ""The Big Fat Kill"" and ""That Yellow Bastard"", written and illustrated by Frank Miller.It's difficult to be more precise about the storyline without divulging the secrets to the plot that you have to pay money to learn. The story is multidimensional which is incredible for a concept that began in only two dimensions. It captures much of the graphic novel's (which is just a really long comic book) look and feel. The characters all seem to be drawn and the colors are basically black and white as if sketched with a pencil. The movie has a strong 1940's film-noir presence. Quentin Tarantino was a guest director. As you watch the movie you can almost guess which scenes he shot as they have his signature. It is similar in the bazaar to Pulp Fiction. Fans and Foes may have a similar response.The sex was much more understated than I expected but they more than made up for it with the wanton violence. Too much blood and gore. But like Pulp Fiction, all the violence was plot driven. Whether you like the movie when the credits are rolling and the house lights come up, I can assure you it will both grab and hold your attention from beginning to end. I don't want to be sexist and call this a guy's movie. But it's a fair statement.",,Anonymous,Crime

The inevitable return of Robert?,"I must confess that I wasn't too sure about this movie. I mean Robert Rodriguez used to be great. Heck that guy was on my TOP 5 favorite director list back in 1996 after I'd seen his films and let me tell you they were all great. From El Mariachi and Roadracers to Desperado and From Dusk 'till Dawn. Bu then came the slow demise of Robert Rodriguez...The Faculty was only OK in a teenage horror kind of way...Spy Kids sucked so bad, I didn't even bother with 2 and 3D...and finally he messed up with the Mariachi's in Once upon a Time in Mexico. That guy was scraped off the list, almost as fast as he'd gotten on there. But then there came rumors about a graphic comic book adaption and I got really psyched...I started hoping where I'd lost hope and I must say that when I saw the trailer I was as scared as I was relieved. I mean it certainly looked as if the 'good old' Rodriguez was back, but in a way I was scared. The trailer looked a lot like 'style over matter' to me and I was not sure he'd pull it off. For him to do that he'd really had to get that comic feeling in to it...Well he did. As soon as the film started I got sucked into Sin City and wasn't allowed out until the ending credits rolled. Sin City is really exciting stuff. Although there isn't much of a background to the characters you care for them and feel with them, which actually is kind of an accomplishment since they are mainly bad guys...the thing about it is though, there are worse guys. No matter how depraved and bad the heroes in this picture are, they all have a heart somewhere and despite all of their sins they are still human. This is particularly evident with Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is very mean and brutal and yet you somewhat condone what he is doing. In a way this film makes you an inhabitant of Sin City. Your values fade, your rules are bent and you come to accept that everything that happens on screen happens by the rules. That is what great film-making is all about.Rodriguez couldn't have pulled it off without a great cast though and I must say that everyone fit the picture here. I was especially taken by Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro). As far as the ladies go, I must say that there while they were much more shallow than most of their male counterparts I sort of had a soft spot for Nancy (Jessica Alba). My least favorite character was Shellie (Britanny Murphy), whom I really couldn't connect with at all. I just felt that she was odd. The rest of the characters and actors ranged from adequate to the above mentioned 'greats'.The visuals were another certain plus to the film, as it helped you in getting into the comic surreal feeling of the film and accepting everything that happened there. I'm not talking about the rules of the street here, but about the more unconventional stuff, such as the the Yellow Bastard, the sheer invincibility of some of the main characters and the comic brutality depicted in this film. The film just had that comic book character that made believe everything you see. It was almost as if I was flipping through an old Batman comic. It was just great...and so original. Hats off to Rodriguez and to Miller of course who had his share in the directing (and the writing of course). On account of this I say: ROBERT = BACK. Too bad about The adventures of Shark Boy and Lava girl in 3D though. Well I guess I can live with him doing that, as long as he keeps popping films like these out every now and then (9 years is way too long though).8,5 out of 10 (with an 8 given upon voting)",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliantly awesome and entertaining,"Sin City is the best comic type of action film I have ever seen. The storyline draws you in, and the characters are very interesting, not to mention well-acted and the whole production is almost perfectly directed and written. Based on Miller's graphic novels(adult comic books), the film's style is perfect, Rodriguez and Tarantino's talents are clearly visible although CGI did a great job with the effects as well, and i think Tarantino's skill is more evident in the screenplay. The film tells several stories that are sort of connected and sort of not. Benicio Del Toro, Bruce Willis, Michael Madsen, Elijah Wood and Jaime King were great in their roles. Brittanny Murphy and Powers Boothe were decent although i didn't really like Rosario Dawson or Jessica Alba much in this flick. My two favorite performances came from Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke, both were great. I thought Michael Duncan Clarke and Nick Stahl were a bit wasted and Josh Hartnett was not good in his limited time on screen, but other than that this film is perfect, and a few mediocre performances by inexperiences young stars doesn't lower my perfect rating of it. 10/10 #43 on my list of all-time favorite films",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brutal noir,"I've never actually read the comic book by Frank Miller (although i'm a big fan of his Bat Man comic). I've only studied the wonderful use of black/white aesthetic. That was the first thing that struck me after watching 5 minutes of Sin City: The aesthetic of this movie is absolutely stunning, stunning, stunning! Using the tradition of German expressionism and Film Noir, and combining it with CGI, the team has created an fantastic dark and gloomy world, which is hard to compare with anything seen on the screen. Every second I was watching and enjoying the war between light and shadows, which created a great tension. But what about the narrative and the plot? Sure it looks great, but does the story live up to it? Sin City tells a very alternative story of morality, obsession and most of all murder. It feels very fragmented, and it's hard to keep track of the story. But is it bad? No! This is the kind of movie which rethinks the way in which narrative is told. The dialog and the bits and pieces of story seems more important than the overall plot. It's new. It's weird. It's very un- mainstream. But at the end it works great. The wide mainstream audience are likely to leave the cinema during this movie (if not because of the weird storytelling, then at least because of the extreme violence). However Sin City is a shocking fresh breath. This is the kind of movie which really push the barriers. Some people will love. Others will love to hate it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

The best Comic book movie ever.,"As someone who hasn't read the books, and probably should have, i have to admit i was kind of confused, even though the stories weren't complicated i don't think they were meant to go together in one movie like this and thats the only problem i really felt the movie had, that it was 3 movies in one, and should have been 3 movies with one story each, or they should have wrote a new story that combined them all together. Hopefully this one tiny flaw will be fixed on the DVD when they split all 3 stories and add back all the footage in and have the movie available to watch as intended, as 3 short movies, or really a mini series, which as already been confirmed by the directors, so that'll be worth the 20 bucks to buy the DVD. Overall it was definitely a one of a kind movie, or movies, the stories are easy to follow, but there's 3 of them, and the opening and ending don't really fit with any of them, the acting was good and for the most part great, it does get alittle weird and over the top at times but it just makes it more entertaining, interesting, and intriguing, there's great brutal action, some pretty funny things like the arrow guy, its disturbing, sick, hardcore film making at its best, its definitely a guy movie, but thats no problem at all, in fact we guys prefer it that way, especially when we get a nice look at carla, and pretty much every other chick, except for the stripper? what the hell? alba never looked so good, and i was never so disappointed. It was definitely the coolest, most insane, awesomest comic book movie to date, that'll probably not be surpassed until the sequel, i give it a 9 out of a 10, i would have preferred alittle more realism, maybe thats not how the books were so thats OK to make it over the top, and the stories should have run together better or not at all, but really there was nothing wrong with it, if your looking for good old fashioned, new age, kick ass entertainment then look no further.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Could ""Noir"" be making a comeback?","As we all know Sin City was based off a comic series that was deeply rooted in the style brought out in the early black and white days of film, known now as: ""film noir"" (literaly translated it means ""black film"".)

Sin City - Anything but Sinful,"Firstly let me start by saying I am no massive fan of comic book movies. I like comic books but after seeing X-men and then Spiderman adapted for the big screen, well I actually felt sick to my stomach. So when I settled down to watch Sin City I did so expecting another bout of pathetic acting and cornball lines that did no justice to the graphic novel. 20 minutes in and its safe to say my expectations were shot down like a paper aeroplane in a gun range. What a film, gripping, dark and most importantly superbly cast and so true to the graphic novel. Shot mainly in black and white (although when watching the characters masterful performances it will seem like it is in colour) and using a pulp fiction style story this is not only the best comic book movie I have ever seen it ranks as one of the best movies I have ever seen and will leave you begging for more of Sin City's dark and brilliant stories.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"There are some great moments, and superb performances, perhaps just too much style over substance.","I'd never read any of the graphic novels on which this movie has been based, and I didn't even know anything about the story before hearing about the production, and right from the first trailer it had me. The names, the style, it all looked superb, so I was excited to finally see it at the cinema.As soon as it opened I was impressed. The visuals and style were superb, and Bruce Willis seemed to be acting his socks off for this role, he suited it so well. However with the good bits came the opening poor performance from Michael Madsen, he hit the audience with a handful of cheese and struggled lines.It could have been intentional, and the attempt at that old Film Noir style had either resulted in some cheesy performances from those that couldn't produce it effectively, or perhaps it was unintentional. This is something that ran through a couple of the main characters for me. Clive Owen and Madsen were the main problems, in Owen I felt like I was watching Horatio Nelson in an episode of CSI: Miami, say cheesy line and turn off camera while posing, wait for fade.I was also surprised by Benecio Del Toro, he was passable, but he just didn't hit the mark with his usual performance. Those who without a doubt did steal the show were Willis, Elijah Wood and Mickey Rourke.Rourke, like Willis, provided a wonderful performance and fitted so well into this genre.They both really portrayed the gritty, hard and embittered characters perfectly and very believably. Those sections of the movie were by far the better and more enjoyable than the others. Wood was a different matter, I've heard many people say he was really good, and he is, he's really effective and creepy, yet how much of that is acting and how much is the style giving that impression? Let's not forget that he ran, jumped and stared, oh and climbed down a stairway.Something that distracted me from the movie and pulled me out a few times were the connections made between the stories themselves. Some had connections, and others didn't, and whenever I saw one I found myself trying to resolve them and make some form of conclusion from it. Unfortunately there was none, it was just to give some time and location reference, and to be honest neither was needed. For me though, I did find I was pulled out of the story each time, and struggled to think of them as nothing.The movie is violent, but gets away with a lot because of the style and lack of colour at key moments, and it's this style that makes for a huge portion of what the movie is. It leads me to the question of how successful the follow-up will be, and now that the style is no longer a gimmick, if it will continue to work as a driving factor for the movie. This is something that the Matrix encountered during it's series, and it seriously flagged on the second movie.There are some great moments, and superb performances from Rourke and Willis. The style that has been captured on screen is nothing short of stunning and quite unique, this has definitely been a huge accomplishment in the adaptation of comics to screen - whoever ends up making The Watchmen please take note - as they've been ever so faithful to the original material. However some truly bad acting and a slightly disjointed feel clouded the movie for me, and it really is the style and the two excellent actors that has kept the score so high.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Money wasted!,"Sin City is truly a crappy movie. The best part of this movie is the ending because that's when I knew the credits would start to roll and the theater lights would came back on. There were four of us who sat through this awful flick and four of us who still haven't figure out what took place. I thought some of the blue screen effects were well done especially the car scenes. I found nothing wrong with the acting. Don't remember the music or even if there was any so that just about says what I think of the sound track. What turned this movie into one I wished I hadn't seen was the story line: Not clear, didn't make sense, huge gaps of missing data, none of the characters had any redeeming qualities, graphic mayhem, attempts to gross out instead of attempts to entertain. If you want to see this movie save your bucks and do your watching when it hits the DVD rentals.",,Anonymous,Crime
Great?  Possibly.  Fun?  Not so much...,"SIN CITY gets a good solid 8/10 from me. It's a huge, over-the-top miasma of gore and sex (though mostly gore, really). And no film has so faithfully rendered the feel of a comic book.Visually, the film is utterly brilliant. Mostly black and white, with odd (and frequently disturbing) splotches of color bring a compelling look to a story that relies on film noir conventions mostly without irony.There are some unfortunate weaknesses to this film, though. The unremitting grimness of the various characters gets a little wearisome by the halfway point. The rich, heavy atmosphere that Robert Rodriguez has constructed here gets a little TOO heavy at times. Constructed as a series of loosely-related subplots, some stories are better than others. The middle of this film is taken up with a subplot (featuring Benicio Del Toro and Clive Owen) that was probably intended to provide some comic relief, and really just kind of goes off the rails. And, I'm sorry to say, Jessica Alba turns out to be sorely miscast when the story finally turns its attention to her.But where SIN CITY DOES work, it works remarkably well. The story of man-monster Marv and his attempt to avenge the death of his beloved Goldie is compelling, even moving. Is it over the top? Sure, but so is opera. And Mickey Rourke's Marv is probably the best, most convincing character in the film. And the story of Bruce Willis' Hartigan and his attempt to save an 11 year old girl from a sadistic rapist works, mostly.This is not a fun movie. Women are (badly) mistreated, though I'll say it's in the service of the story. The violence is pervasive, graphic, and at times disgustingly original. Part of what I admire about SIN CITY is Robert Rodriguiz' commitment to bring to the screen such a lurid, politically incorrect story in these times of resurging conservatism.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a Fantastic Film!,"I've have got to go on record to say that this was one under-rated film when it comes to the film industry patting itself on the back.Technologically speaking, this was a marvel. Creatively speaking, this was very creative. This is a rare film of bringing to film a mixture of elements together that makes you WANT to watch, and an ensemble of actors and actresses that make it work.Over a decade ago, Oliver Stone put together his version of ""Natural Born Killers"". Although it was only a fraction of Quentin Tarrintino's original tale, it was the film itself that made me take notice. Every element known at that time was used to bring to the screen a frightening tale. I feel the same about this one.A mixture of film noir, live comics, color, action and story, this was one of the films that was a refreshing change in what has been placed out there. Violent, you betcha. Adult themes? Above and Beyond. A film homage to the comic itself.To put something like this on the screen you need to cast the appropriate actors....and the casting, for the most part, was the best. Bruce Willis was great, the usually annoying to me Jessica Alba did a good job here, Clive Owen is just a buzz to watch on the screen, Benicio Del Toro shows why he is a breakout actor...supporting roles of folks like Rutger Hauer, Josh Harnett (who'll show you he's just not another ""pretty boy for the movies""), Brittney Murphy, Nicki Katt, Carla Gugino (a very underrated actress!), Jamie King (just wonderful!), Powers Boothe (chillng!), Elijah Wood (scary!), Michael Madsen were all the bomb.But the two that will definitely stick with you are Nick Stahl and Mickey Roarke in his best performance in YEARS. These actors and their characters were the best and had me on the edge of my seat.The only actor that wasn't that exciting to me was Rosario Dawson - could be because she didn't have much to do in this one....and I kept thinking of a parrot every time she came on screen and not about the tough character leader she was supposed to be.But even with that, this film was still the best. A must not miss for anyone interested in film, a gem for the fans of the comic series.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
