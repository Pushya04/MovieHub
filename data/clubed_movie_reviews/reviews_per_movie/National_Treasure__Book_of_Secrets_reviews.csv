Decent film,"National Treasure: Book of Secrets is a decent film. Nothing more, nothing less. I came out of the theater content, and yet by the next hour I'd forgotten much of what had taken place. Such is the case for most films now, however.Compared to the first film, the plot is weak (certainly not as tightly drawn as the former) but the energy is the same and the humor is the same, and overall it's still as watchable as the first. Helen Mirren and Ed Harris were also very good, and somewhat surprising, additions to the cast.Essentially, the movie is on the ridiculous/unbelievable side, but it's worth a watch. I don't think I'd pay another 10 dollars to see it again in theaters, but waiting for a rental will do.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good entertainment,"I will keep it short and simple. Just watched it, paid 10$ for it, it is worth it. Not much of details as you would expect out of a great movie, not much of substance in the movie itself however the acting and the pace of the movie is so beautiful you wont think of the flaws in the intricate plans they carry out in the movie. The subtle comedy is really nice and they have kept the first movie in consideration and have not brought many new characters. It is not a movie that you would think a lot about after you come out of the hall, however you will not think anything else either while the movie is going on. I will give it 7 for the sheer value of entertainment and nothing else and of course the one liners that keep popping up which actually make you laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining and Full of Action Adventure,"During a lecture about John Wilkes Booth and Thomas Gates, Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) and his father Patrick Gates (Jon Voight) are surprised by Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) that claims that their ancestor was a conspirator in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln based on the missing page of Booth's diary that he possesses. The outraged Ben decides to prove the honor of his ancestor and together with his wife Abigail (Diane Kruger) and his best friend, the writer Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), they head to France, England and Washington to collect clues to lead them to a lost city of gold Cinola and clean the name of Thomas Gates. But Mitch Wilkinson is following each step of Ben and his friends to take the merit of finding the treasure for himself.""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is an entertaining and full of action adventure that follows the style of Indiana Jones combined with ""Da Vinci Code. The story is developed in high pace, with likable characters and funny situations. Nicolas Cage and the gorgeous German Diane Kruger show a wonderful chemistry and Jon Voight, Justin Bartha and Helen Mirren give a magnificent support. Ed Harris is a very confused and ambiguous villain and his true motives are never clear, Harvey Keitel has a minor role and Bruce Greenwood performs again the role of president of the United States of America that seems to be tailored for this great actor. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Lenda do Tesouro Perdido – Livro dos Segredos"" (""The Legend of the Lost Treasure – Book of Secrets"")",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An entertaining movie,"There are a select few individuals out there that seem to garner everything they know about life from movies, be it political viewpoints, philosophy, etc. and find it objectionable when a movie is produced purely for entertainment purposes. I can't speak for everyone, but as for myself, I don't want to have to pay to have yet another political viewpoint shoved down my throat (CNN/Foxnews broadcasts 24/7 for that), or to be beaten over the head with with the life philosophy of some bazillionaire producer/director that lives in the Ivory Tower that is Hollywood. I can read Zarathustra, the Tao Tse Ching, or even the Bible for that.When I go to see a movie, I just wan to be entertained, and National Treasure BoS delivers there. Not the best movie I have ever seen, but it was an entertaining escape from reality for two hours and that it was I pay my money for. For me, the best part of the movie wasn't Nic Cage. He has done so many movies, it seems like he has gotten to the point where he is just punching the clock. He doesn't stand out on film, but he isn't horrible either and that is what we get from him here - a very pedestrian workmanlike performance. I would like to think he has another touchstone performance in him like the one he gave in ""Leaving Las Vegas"", but if he can still keep getting several million per movie just being average, why put in the effort. Diane Kruger was also pretty average. She shined in the first movie, but not so much here.For me, John Voight, Justin Bartha and Helen Mirren were what made the movie good. John Voight was great. His character was both funny and endearing and the synergy between him and Mirren was palpable. Mirren showed once again why she is arguably the best actress in the business. Justin Bartha was a scene stealer and had some of the funniest lines (along with Voight).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enjoyable and recommendable,"It was a good movie but not as good as the first one. I think that its just the same story as the first one with very little changes. Treasure hunter Ben Gates tries to clean its name by looking for an ancient treasure. The first half of the movie is kinda slow and even tiresome, too much talking and very little action. But it gets better on the second part towards to the end. The cast is excellent, Nicolas Cage in a role he knows very well, Jon Voight as Cage fathers is very convincing, Ed Harris is the bad guy that the only thing he wants is to find the treasure and keep it to himself, Harvey Keitel as an FBI agent wit a brief but convincing performance and Helen Mirren as Nicola's mother with a good and even funny performance. Although this movie isn't the greatest thing, it is very enjoyable and entertaining, perfect to spend some time with the family.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"The secret's out: the formula still works with ""National Treasure"" sequel","The follow up to the 2004 box office surprise ""National Treasure"" is  everything you'd expect. Thank goodness. It should come as no surprise  that the conspiracy-based code-cracking mystery adventure is still just  as hot as it was in the ""year of ""The Da Vinci Code."""" There is nothing  new, nothing special or unexpected about ""Book of Secrets"" only Ed  Harris replacing Sean Bean as the rival treasure seeker. That, and the  addition of Helen Mirren as Nicholas Cage's mother to strengthen the  film's female roles thanks to leading lady Diane Kruger's utter  mediocrity.  The film has all the same history mystery you remember, the national  (and now international) landmarks, the witty inserts from Justin  Bartha's character Riley, and of course the preposterous plans for  Benjamin Franklin Gates to get whatever he's after. In other words, if  you're looking for something different, more clever, or intellectually  stimulating, read the Da Vinci Code again and don't bother with this  film. If you want more quirky, ridiculous, treasure-seeking fun that  picks up right where the last left off, this is your ticket. ~Steven C",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Interesting...I liked It, but something feels missing...","First of all, National Treasure, the first one, is one of my favorite movie ever. I love history, specifically American history, and it had clever references and facts about American history that lead to finding the treasure in a way that is not predictable. That being said, I felt something was missing in National Treasure: Book of Secrets. It almost felt like the writers could not think of any new, clever clues for Nicolas Cage to solve or more suspense without action scenes.First lets look at the positives. This movie was very well-done. The acting was as superb as the first (Nicolas Cage and Justin Bartha are amazing). It was very believable. Also the action scenes are excellent and full of invigorating suspense. The scene near the unexpected end where they had to balanced the steel block thing in the cave was terrific. All the action scenes were awesome: right out of an Indiana Jones movie. Another thing I liked was the ironic humor and sarcasm used by Nicolas Cage's character and other characters throughout the movie that gave it a light, fun feel. With interesting history references and a brilliant score by Trevor Rabin, what could be wrong with it?You may not agree with me. But I felt that the ending, and a few other scenes were rushed. For example, they spent literally about five minutes in Paris both finding and figuring out the clue. After that they moved on to London, they spent about 15 minutes there, 5 of them were spent finding the clue. It all felt rushed which tended to confuse me. And the ending definitely did not satisfy me. It was too sudden and I felt it was incomplete, even though the movie was over two hours long.As I think back to some of the scenes in the beginning and middle of the movie, I forget why I included ""negatives"" because it was so brilliant and I loved it as much as the first one. But then I remember the ending. it just didn't satisfy like the last movie did. I can't explain the nice feeling the first movie gave me: its what the perfect movie gives you I guess. Anyway, I would recommend this to anyone who has scene the first one and anyone who would like a good crime/action/adventure flick with excellent acting with lovable and believable characters. It's a great movie, it just didn't live up to my expectations or the original's",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sugarcoated adventure for family viewing,"I really liked the first movie with these characters but I got frustrated with this sequel. I was expecting much more intelligent puzzles and breathtaking adventure. Instead this movie is a perfect example of a sugarcoated adventure for family viewing in a lazy Saturday night in DVD in pijamas snacking microwave popcorn.The plot is weak and far from plausible. There are the iconic characters (the smart hero and his love/hate girlfriend, the funny hero's assistant, the divorced hero's parents, the bad but not so bad guy, the good cop and so on). It's too much cliché for a single movie for allowing it to be a good one.This definitely isn't a ""Top 10"" adventure movie. It's OK for viewing with the kids and just it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than the first,"National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets is a very interesting film. I was forced on many occasions to watch the first and I thought it was just alright. Then I saw this movie. They go all out. I have never really liked Nicholas Cage, but he does just fine in this movie. Helen Mirren is fun to see, and the story is very fun and enthralling. There is not much I could really say about the movie, for I have not seen it too many times, and it is a hard film to review without giving too much excitement away. It really is a lot faster, slicker and enjoyable than the first, and as a movie itself it is pretty darn good and well made. I also do not typically enjoy action movies, so that is a nice compliment coming from me. See it if you are interested in anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
In Search Of El Dorado,"Finding the lost city of El Dorado, or Quivira, or Cibola (take your pick) would be easier than finding any plausibility in this film. Our hero Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) goes from one narrow escape to another, as he zooms to Paris, then to London, then to the White House in Washington (with a personal chitchat with the President no less), and then on to Mount Rushmore, in search of, well, in search of ... something. I think he's looking for evidence to clear his family name, in the historical conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln. What he actually finds, with superhuman luck, is something else, something he didn't expect to find. But none of it really matters. The plot here is so wildly unbelievable, so far-fetched, and so muddled as to be a cinematic magic carpet ride.Clearly, ""National Treasure: Book Of Secrets"" is aimed at kids. It's a highly visual movie, with lots of eye-popping outdoor color images. The physical action is so fast at times, with lots of high speed editing, that there is no danger that the audience will be required to do any thinking. Acting and dialogue are largely irrelevant. And the film has elaborate and expensive production design.Not all of the conflict is physical. Ben must negotiate with his partner Riley (Justin Bartha), his dad (Jon Voight), his mom (Helen Mirren), and a couple of others, all of whom become involved in Ben's quest. The film has a clever twist, but if you're not paying close attention, it's easy to miss.There is no sex, nor is there any prohibitive violence here; it's a Disney-type adventure all the way. Still, if the film can get kids interested in history, whether it's the legend of El Dorado or Lincoln's assassination, then I suppose ""National Treasure: Book Of Secrets"" can be said to have some redeeming value, it's plot implausibility notwithstanding.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Daft but fun,"I liked this sequel. I do need to re watch the predecessor, but from my memory I remember the first film being a tad better. National Treasure:Book of Secrets does have its problems, primarily the daft and sometimes contrived plot, the sometimes weak script(despite three or four hilarious scenes) and the climax does take a tad too long. Despite all this, the film is still a lot of fun, thanks to some awesome chase scenes, the great special effects and the fun performances of Nicolas Cage, Helen Mirren and Jon Voight. Plus there are some funny jokes and scenes, and the music is brilliant. And the clues are nice and complex. I will say me and my whole family liked this film, we all felt it is daft and silly but for a family film it does have a sense of fun.Overall, don't expect a masterpiece. Expect a fun film, that is daft too. That way, you will enjoy National Treasure:Book of Secrets. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Nutshell Review: National Treasure: Book of Secrets,"If I may be able to conjure up conspiracy theories of my own, then I will attempt to hypothesis how National Treasure came about to debut on the big screen, based on opportunities which presented itself at the right time. First, the popularity of Dan Brown's controversial The Da Vinci Code, which was made into a movie of its own, but took a tad too long in doing so. Topping the bestseller charts around the world, it made Hollywood execs sit up and realize that wild goose chases and solving riddles and clues do make an interesting, workable formula. Coupled by the fact that the Indiana Jones trilogy (at the time) probably will not have another sequel see the light of day, then the onus is on crafting a tale based on controversies, with Indy Jones tendencies, and chances are a new winner will be born.Hence, National Treasure in the year end of 2004, which made a decent dent in the box office, starring Nicolas Cage as an Indy like clone Benjamin Gates, embroiled in a mystery of the Templar's treasure, with sidekick Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) as the tech wizard necessary to assist him, while at the same time romancing Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), who joins his band of treasure seekers against her wishes. The Indy references don't just stop here, they extend to having a Henry Jones resemblance in Jon Voight as dad Patrick Gates. If you were to deck Cage in a fedora, whip and gun, the references will be just too blatant.But let's not get ahead of ourselves. The important question is, is the sequel Book of Secrets as good as, or can be accredited with the rare accolade of being better than the original? Well, in all honesty it's still an entertaining ride, as this time we go around the world (OK, so perhaps just Paris and London), versus the original story being US-centric. However, like the first installment, the material, clues and riddles are still quite US history heavy, so if you're well versed with certain characters (brought to life early in the movie) or events (thanks to paying attention during history lessons), then yes, Book of Secrets will give you an additional boost in being able to identify with it. Otherwise, don't fret, as the casual movie goer with popcorn in hand will definitely not feel lost.The narrative and plot still feel a little staged and rigged for convenience (and run time of course), as one event will inevitably lead to the next and to the inevitable ending (like how CSI solves crime within 45 minutes sans ads), but they're still a lot of fun watching how the characters go through the motion in believing that they're onto something really big. While the first had a lot of puzzles to solve, which kept some of us guessing and playing along as well, this time round the number of riddles have been reduced significantly, and signs of Mission: Impossible creeping in as our band of treasure hunters seek to perform the impossible, pertaining to levels of security guarding their mark.In an excuse to make the sequel, we have Ben Gates and GATESENIOR reuniting to clear the good name of their ancestor, who's recently accused of being a co-conspirator, or even mastermind, behind the assassination of US President Abramham Lincoln. And of course, help comes in the form of Abigail, who's now estranged from Gates, trusty tech sidekick with the complementary witty lines Riley (and his red Ferarri), and now joined by Ben's mom Emily Appleton, played by Helen Mirren, who's in the movie to contrast her relationship with Patrick to that between Ben and Abigail.However, we're not really interested in whimsical attempts to add depth to characters, are we? Sure they have their issues with one another, and with Ed Harris' Mitch Wilkinson being the token and very bland bad guy wanting to make his mark on history, the focus more often than not is to shift to the next big stunt / chase sequence. Like the first movie, one of the highlights touted in the trailer involves the art of balancing, which unfortunately, was already done in the first movie. Don't you just hate repeated stunts? And toward the end, I can't help but to compare it to Jackie Chan's The Myth, which in itself was somewhat of a treasure- hunter movie, involving the elixir of life (We're still stuck with gold here though).And add to that Harvey Keitel's FBI agent Sadusky, the office of the most powerful man in the world, and teases from the Book of Secrets, we've got ourselves a handful being squeezed within 2 hours. Not to forget Nicolas Cage's absolutely horrendous haircut, the final verdict is that it's a fairly decent year end blockbuster which primed itself for yet another sequel, courtesy of page 47 of the titular book, if the box office numbers prove favourable.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining Sequel of National Treasure,"So, here I am, Astonished at how amazing Jerry managed to direct an amazing movie like this one; how Nicholas Cage, Diane Kruger, Bartha, Voight, and Harris, act this one out, into a somehow very terrific movie, funny but tense, and yet, very entertaining, just like the first one.National Treasure: Book of Secrets, talk about how Ben Gates try to prove that his ancestor's (Thomas Gates), is not the mastermind behind Lincoln's assassination.And just like the first one, it's still filled with laughable, serious, and patriotic sense. Very very enjoyable.Despite the fact, whether this book exist or not, it's still a very interesting thing to think about. But, don't overdo the thinking, since that can ruin the fun in this movie, and make you guys (the thinker) to question the purpose and whether it's the truth or not. And the next step would be, ""It's the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. Nothing makes sense"" thought, and that will definitely ruin your excitement bout this movie, and hence, make your rating against this movie, goes down. Why bother about something that we don't know if it really exist or not, and even if it does exist, what business do you have with it? Hope my point is as clear as crystal clear.So, here is my suggestion. Just enjoy the movie. Don't over think about whether it's the truth or not. Just watch how Ben solve the puzzle, and how they mastermind things, and along the way, laugh at Riley's ""pure thought"". You'll find it much more interesting that way than if you try to think too hard.I personally rate this movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Bland, mass-produced rubbish that nobody seems to have put any heart into making","Normally I would write a plot summary before I review a film - it helps introduce the film in case anyone is reading but mostly I do it because it helps me focus my mind on what I have just seen. However to summarise National Treasure 2 it is probably easiest just to take two dice and for one die assign each number the name of a person in history (Queen Victoria, Nixon, Custer), then for the other assign an object (a table, the Empire State Building, a book). Now simply roll the two dice and make notes of the combinations - Custer's rifle, the President's watch, the Queen's bedroom etc etc. After a couple of rolls you will have as much of a story as this film and indeed may have produced a more interesting one.If you haven't got it yet, I thought the plot was utter nonsense that seemed to have had scenarios imagined up and then threaded together with the barest or logic (or none in many cases). Some of the scenes where Cage works out the clues had me laughing and one imagines that the writers made more use of shoe-horns than they did pens and paper. My personal favourite lack of logical is where a major clue is thrown out a car window to stop the bad guys chasing them and all our heroes have to look at is a photo taken of the clue by a speed camera that they drive past. What? Weirdly though, the plot is not the sole problem with the film and indeed it could have been covered for if everything else had worked in regards delivery. As it is though, it seems that there is no heart or energy in the film and that churning out another product to appease the Disney shareholders was top of the reasons for making it. This shows in every regard. It shows in the very bland ""look"" to the film. It is clear that lots of money has been spent on the sets and general design of the film but yet none of it feels like more than a set and certainly none of it really convinces as the real thing. This feel continues into the action sequences which again are bland. If the film had genuinely had excitement or thrills then the plot holes become less important but the rubbish action just leaves everything sitting out there exposed to the cold light of day. A gutless car chase through London only serves to highlight how awesome all those Bourne chases were and, by return, how pathetic this one is.And then we have the incidental music, which tends to be one of two type - both equally misjudged and annoying. The first is the ""earnest swelling sense of importance"" music that accompanies any discussion of the treasure-hunt, family ancestors or patriotism. It invites you to think that what you are watching is important, which made me think that the composer dialled it in because he cannot have watched this and thought this approach would work with this material. The other type is the ""jaunty, quirky, isn't-this-comical"" music that fills the rest of the film. This music invites you to be amused but again it only manages to highlight just how unfunny and clunky all the ""lighter"" moments are.The cast list surprised me because if you simply read out the names of those involved I would not have guessed that they were all have been key people in a film this poor. I suppose in a way it is like the rest of the film - clearly there has been money spent but no actual heart or effort is to be found. Cage demonstrates no range or indication that he cares about the material and he makes for a dull hero; his performance is the same when jumping from a crumbling platform and when giving a lecture - it is sad to see someone care so little about what they are doing. Bartha is a weak comic sidekick but at least he appears to be trying. Kruger is as pretty as she is pointless and generally just seemed to be in the way. Harris has a good presence and at least brings a bit of menace to the film while managing to hide his embarrassment, but this is below him and he knows it. Voight is rubbish and Mirren should genuinely be ashamed by a weak performance in a role she took simply to cash in on Oscar and make some good money. Keitel I assume was a bigger character in the first film because other than that there appears to be no reason for him smirking his way around the edges.Overall then, this is a lot of nonsense but, more telling, it is bland and disinterested in the viewer. The plot holes and total lack of logic do treat the viewer with contempt but this could have been covered if I had even once been engaged or enthralled by the film. As it was though it never feels like a film made for any other reason than making money. The cast don't seem to care, the direction is flat, the action is poor and the pace is poor. The fact that it is two hours long only makes it worse as it does not even have the good grace to be short. It is rare I hate a film but I found this poor to the point of being insulting because it is not like it tries but just misfires but rather than it is poor simply because it could not be bothered to even try.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Fairly Entertaining,"Treasure hunter Benjamin Franklin Gates looks to discover the truth behind the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, by uncovering the mystery within the 18 pages missing from assassin John Wilkes Booth's diary, after learning out that his great-grandfather could've been involved in the assassination. Can Ben clear his family's name? Or will his family be linked to the murder of Abraham Lincoln?One thing I was annoyed about this film, along with several other Disney films, is that the MPAA are afraid to rate Disney movies a PG-13 rating. Yes, National Treasure 2 could've been a very fun popcorn movie, and it is, but the film is filled with too many immature jokes to make kids laugh. The Pirates film can't be Disney's only PG-13 films.Apart from that, I found this film pretty entertaining. When I started to watch this, I was dreading it. The actors TRY to be funny that they aren't. I was thinking, ""What are they doing here? Seriously."" I didn't try to enjoy it like the first movie. I was thinking about the wasted talents from the cast but then it grew on me. I started to ""go along with the ride"" and enjoyed it after about the 30 minute mark.No, I wouldn't say it was as entertaining as the first and in my opinion, the first film is one of the best fun and energetic adventure films I've ever seen. Along with the first, this film did a great job not boring you for about just 2 hours long. This film will keep you entertained.Everyone in here seem to have a pretty good time making this film, along with having a good time acting on screen, including a newbie, Hellen Mirren. However, I really do not like the clichéd use of having divorced couples in a sequel film after the protagonist falls in love with his/her lover in the first.Anyway, this film is bigger but not necessarily better than the first film. The action and visuals are better, I must say. Although it feels like the first movie all over again (you can't help but sense a deja vu that is happening while watching this film), this film does a well job keeping you entertained from beginning to end.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Sir, please dismount the banister""","A couple years ago I saw that little movie we called National Treasure, sorta like the new Indiana Jones wanna-be, I didn't get into the film. But the sequel National Treasure: Book of Secrets came last year and I had again no interest in seeing the movie, but my mom bought the film and wanted to watch it together, so I figured to just sit through it, it actually wasn't as bad as I was expecting. But I actually not only thought it wasn't bad, it was actually a really good movie, I was impressed. I think the reason why I disliked the first National Treasure was due to the fact that it was too deep with history in order for it to be a family film and could be confusing at times. But National Treasure: Book of Secrets explains itself well and has more exciting action sequences and just a great story.Ben Gates is back, this time his life isn't looking so good, his girlfriend, Abigal, threw him out, his friend, Riley isn't the best seller on his new book, then his great great grandfather is accused of helping John Wilkes Booth kill President Lincoln. But Ben is determined to clear the family name, but Mitch Wilkinson wants his family name to remain sacred and plans to drag Ben's family down and claim all the fortune for himself.National Treasure: Book of Secrets is an exciting adventure film, one of the better I've seen in a while. Nicolas Cage is my only little complaint, now I love this actor, he was great throughout the film, but when he had his little ""joke"" putting his arm into the rock where everyone thinks it's a trap and he kids them with it, for some reason this guy cannot do comedy. I know that's a silly complaint, but sometimes he just seems so out of place in a film, especially with his recent movies. But National Treasure: Book of Secrets otherwise is a decent family film that is enjoyable and exciting, I'd recommend it if you're looking for a fun film.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I enjoyed the purported links to factual evidence as in the links to civil war heroes and villains, the twin desks, one at buck house and the other in the oval office.

"Much of the same, but a decent sequel nonetheless!","Even though the first National Treasure wasn't a masterpiece, it had some great visuals, a great cast, and perfect special effects helped by Trevor Rabin's great music score.

The visuals are fantastic, the special effects are great and the music from Trevor Rabin is once again pretty good. I know it sounds crazy, but I found the history to be very interesting despite it's predictable plot and there are some hilarious jokes during the film that got me some laughs and chuckles.Overall, not as great as the original was, but a very decent sequel that is worth watching.

Fun but way too busy,"If you thought the first NT movie left you gasping for aid, wait until you get a load of the followup, which takes our intrepid trio of treasure hunters (Cage, Kruger and Bartha) all over the map, including to England, D.C. and whichever Dakota Mount Rushmore is in. This time, they are seeking clues to restore the tarnished name of a forbear (don't ask). This involves tracking down a lost city of gold, of all things. Hey, it's a kid's movie! The plot rushes from here to there, a little too much so, and there are plot holes as big as the Grand Canyon. Also, Cage seems a bit long in the tooth for such nonsense. But hey, it's a kid's movie! The only question is, will a kid be willing to sit through the whole thing? The director and writers take no chances, by the way, and give us much the same death-defying finale as that in the first movie. Hey! It's a kid's movie! Keep telling yourself that. Helen Mirren plays cage's mom and Bruce Greenwood is the president, and they give this silly but likable film some badly needed dignity.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than the first one,"You can tell that they weren't expecting the first one to be a hit. So then they stepped up their game on the second one when it was.

It serves its purpose well enough.,"I've seen the first movie ""National Treasure"" but I basically remember nothing about at it, so it really didn't made a lasting impression. I'm sure that in a couple of months from now I will have forgotten all about this movie as well, since its entertaining and all but also all pretty forgettable.The movie serves its purpose to entertain and you'll probably won't be bored while watching this movie but the movie also really isn't anything to spectacular. Both 'National Treasure' movies were expense blockbuster, of well over $100.000.000 (this movie actually cost about $130,000,000), which sort of makes me wonder what all that money gets spend on these days. 10 years ago every $100.000.000 would had easily been amongst the top 10 of most expensive movies ever made, now days $100.000.000 will only give you movies such as ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"". It really doesn't look or feel as an over $100.000.000 production.For that amount of money some more fireworks could be expected. Basically ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" doesn't feature anything big or exceptional, which we haven't seen in any other movies before. The first movie was basically more or less a simpler version of ""The Da Vinci Code"", while this movie tends to lean more toward the Indiana Jones movies, with a sniff of James Bond to it. So seriously nothing too original or new here, which is of course mostly due to the movie its script and storytelling.The script is simple, though yet of course not very likely. Sure, it's fun to treasure hunt and look for clues all over the world, on famous landmarks but not when basically every 5 minutes the movie is set at a different location (probaly also partly explains the movie its high budget) and we're looking for a new and different clue. This is just the kind of storytelling that does not ever work out very well. Basically the movie tries to achieve too much and a too short amount of time.But no, I wouldn't call this movie horrible or anything. It's still professionally made, though not with a lot of imagination. Perhaps it's time for Jon Turteltaub to pass on the directing honers to a new and different director for the third movie of the series, which is currently in its early production stages. It also obviously wouldn't hurt to hunt down a better script this time. But oh well, I at least I wasn't bored while watching this movie and therefor I can't really regard this movie as a weak one, since it obviously served its purpose to bring entertainment.Nicolas Cage seems to enjoy his role in these movies, which shows on the screen and he is well cast in his role. His acting is right for the part, though probably not a lot of people will agree with this, or at least they won't admit that they do. Most of the characters and actors from the first movie return again in this one (Justin Bartha, Diane Kruger, Jon Voight), which is probably due to the fun it must be to make these sort of movies or perhaps just because of the fat paychecks. It also explains why actors such as Helen Mirren, Ed Harris and Harvey Keitel appeared in this sequel. They are just not the type of actors to normally appear in a big summer blockbuster. Nevertheless they of course are a welcome addition, though their characters aren't the most interesting ones and some roles even feel a bit redundant for the overall movie.Nothing too remarkable, just some decent entertainment.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A suspension of belief is required, otherwise, this is a fairly enjoyable movie","After really disliking the first National Treasure and not being a huge Nicholas Cage fan I had terribly low expectations for this. It looked like a rehash of the first with a different treasure to hunt. Surprisingly this turned out to be an enjoyable way to spend two hours, that is of course, if you are willing to suspend logic and remember this is a Hollywood movie through and through. With those two bits of knowledge in mind you should be able to enjoy this as I did. The pacing is perfect for a movie like this, it goes nice and fast and never really gets boring. I must admit it some of it seemed believable, which shows that the writers did a good job. And I was able to tolerate Mr. Cage this time, I thought he did a very good job and as usual Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, Helen Mirren and Ed Harris were great (although Harris' villain was pretty bland, luckily he can act).The action was also very well filmed and at times highly excited and well thought out (the balancing rock sequence was exceptionally well done). Having said all this, it certainly isn't anything brilliant and if you like smart, deep movies this is not for you.3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Artful Escapism,"When a film has canned music, it better be good if it wants to overcome it. A surprisingly good find this year, or in any year, is ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets."" Canned style music always implies a better film than the filmmakers delivered, but this time the pic lives up to the almost impossible climaxes in the score.The thing with this one is the actors, and the characters they play. That's always the way it should be, but is, rarely ever, any more. I could see how this simple script was made to sing with the right actors and direction. And the script isn't so simple, after a prologue sucks you in with a missing page from John Wilkes Booth's diary, wittingly produced to start the film on its merry way. And by the end you will laughingly go along, full tilt, with the notion that Mount Rushmore was a cover-up (I won't tell you why).Next comes the camera work, exposed so it compliments the story, not get in the way of it. The operation and the choice of camera angle, simple pans when they are called for (hello, you need a reason to pan folks), and especially lens choice is done without flare, but in a documentary style that makes Spielberg actually look amateur by comparison. The editing then is absolutely superb, but, look what he had to work with.Nicholas Cage I like in this, his sidekicks make a trio of sleuths that charm the pants off you, the girl being achingly beautiful without realizing it. And Helen Mirren and Jon Voight make good dysfunctional parents (these are two of the best actors we have ever had), never breaking character no matter what business they are asked to perform. Ed Harris channels a villain out for redemption. Harvey Keitel does a job as the clichéd FBI agent with style.Like I said, the music is the weak link, but it doesn't ruin the film, just gives it a schmaltzy import that the humor in the story can play against.I don't recommend many films these days. I saw ""The Great Debaters"" and highly recommend that as well, but ""National Treasure"" is artful escapism at its very very best.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nicholas Cage and the Guilty Pleasure of Doom,"Not satisfied with stealing the Declaration of Independence last time around, half way through this movie Nicholas Cage says in that trademark drawl of his the words: ""I'm going to kidnap the President of the United States."" In the preceding hour he's not only broken into Buckingham Palace but the Oval Office as well and in the ensuing hour he discovers a top secret diary in the Library of Congress and a Pre-Columbian temple buried in a cave network beneath Mount Rushmore. You can only wonder where they're going to go when the inevitable third entry comes around in 2011, but I wouldn't put it past them kidnapping the Pope and finding Atlantis underneath the Toronto Skydome. As you can probably tell then, National Treasure: Book of Secrets is preposterous guff, but it nevertheless possesses a sense of charm and a feeling of urgency that was lacking from its predecessor.First off the good news, the franchise has improved. The original National Treasure wasn't particularly strong and smelt too strongly of a cross between Indiana Jones and the Da Vinci Code designed purely to cash in on the recent success of Dan Brown's novel. This second instalment however is a lot more fun, the two hour running time zipping past at a remarkable pace as the cast are hurtled from America to France, to England and then back again in a globe trotting adventure to locate a mythical lost city of gold (sorry Dr. Jones they beat you to it). Its a good thing too, if it slowed down for a second there'd be more opportunities to pick up the numerous plot holes - how this is all going to clear the name of Ben Gates's long dead ancestors for instance is never explained particularly well. Neither is why it's so remarkably easy for a history Professor to keep avoiding the CIA.Carbon copy of an established original it may be then but National Treasure 2 still packs in enough outlandish stupidity, dizzying set pieces and intriguing historical trivia to have it ear marked as a guilty pleasure. Ever wanted to know how to use a London traffic camera to record a vital piece of evidence while in the middle of a car chase? This is the film for you. As an added bonus it's also the most animated that Nicholas Cage has been in years, avoiding his recent tendency to phone things in by playing Ben Gates with just the right mixture of rebellious humour and deadpan seriousness. Granted, it's just a bit too obvious where all the chief inspirations have come from but even so, National Treasure 2 is entertaining enough to warrant a night in front of the television with your brain switched off.And at least the Lost City of Gold in this movie doesn't have a flying saucer buried in it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
..I want my money back!,"What the heck! I have seen better written episodes of Hercules. It was like a 10 year old's homework task. Just so much about this film was appalling: the jokes, the plot, the story, the fact that the car chase scene was up and down the same short road in Cheapside in London, the way it goes on and on and on about 'the American way'. I like the way that it is listed as English/French language despite the only french being that a french policeman said one line in French before the Nicholas Cage reeled off the entire details of the clue they just found and the next part of their secret search to the policeman they had just met right before the policeman ordered a taxi to take him to the airport... oh, i could keep going just to get it all off my chest but I won't - If I was able to give minus points for a film i would have done with National Treasure 2.

Muir's Rushmore,"During the first tedious outing, I was full of wonder about how the form of this developed. I am interested in the puzzle movie, something that nominally started with the mystery. Some intelligent movies devise ever more complex and subtle puzzles, the wonder of which engages the viewer.Then there's the mainstream thread which asks ever less of the viewer, and merely panders to notions of how the mystery conspires to be so complex. Well that was what occupied be in the first embarrassment. Now we have this.Second movies in a franchise fascinated me, especially when the producers are as ambitiously greedy as this one. That's because the first movie gives them an opportunity to test the thing to death and to refine the formula for the second. So if you see any change whatever, you can rest assured that it was because of very expensive testing, marketing considerations and an understanding of narrative tokens.That's why I wonder what Helen Mirren is doing in this. She's 63. Now, recently she has given a serious study of Elizabeth, but this hiring decision was made well before that. Mirren's past is based on her overtly sexual being. She was essentially the first actress to make a living with her breasts and actually grow into a serious talent. But along the way, she has retained in many roles and most importantly in her public life, the sense of open sensuality. She's a sexual being first, and an intelligent observer of emotions behind that.Its quite rare. So why is she in a kiddie movie? A PG-engineered dope-fest? Why is she more openly sexual than the ordinary love interest?This is not accidental. Her wet top, her partially exposed breasts... these are engineered decisions. Why?I think it is insurance. I think that when you build a franchise today, you have to do so thinking of the saleability in 30 years. DVD marketeers look at what older viewers like, and its no surprise that they like two things: the familiar and sex, or at least what implies sex. And they look at who will have all the money in 30 years. It won't be the youngsters because the old always steal from the young.She's there so that when these 27 year old boys (the target) are grown into 63 year old men, they'll still rent this, or whatever amazing extras can be packaged. I'll bet nearly anything that there are salacious deleted scenes with this fearless woman. And probably naughty commentary as well.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Mystery

It was a good popcorn movie wrapped in some real American history, but once the wrapping was removed, it was pure hokum, but isn't that what a movie is supposed to be? An alternative to real life?

It's got the same sort of things happening to the same cast members and it's a whole lot of fun. Isn't that enough? It's suitable for the whole family, no naked people, curse words, blood or guts, and nothing too scary.

"It wasn't a bad film, but it didn't bring anything new to the table","I was pleasantly surprised by the first one, and with the excellent sequels that have recently come out, I was hoping this would at least match National Treasure. But National Treasure: Book of Secrets only did very incremental adjustments that did not even set out to improve its predecessor, lazily riding on the former's equity.It wasn't a bad film, but it didn't bring anything new to the table. Nicolas Cage isn't an amazing actor but since he uncannily gets the right movies at the right time, people go out and see his flicks anyway. But you cannot forgive him this time for reprising his role as treasure-seeker Ben Gates in such poorly-written fashion. Diane Kruger as his girlfriend Abigail Chase is still predictably bland when she could've used this opportunity to redeem herself, especially when her character now seems to have a penchant for stating the obvious instead of being the smartie she's supposed to be. But it's hard to hate Justin Bartha as the reliable comic relief Riley Poole, as well as the rest of the cast who seem to just be in this flick for the cash cow that it is.It all boils down to the shabby writing; seems like the writers were already on strike at this point! Having hinted at a Part 3 (and there haven't been very good Part 3s of the other movie franchises so far), I hope they use it to finally do something more clever and interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great Saturday night movie,"I watched national treasure 2 and must admit I really enjoyed the movie (apart from the fact it was freezing cold in the cinema), the action and plot line were kept moving at really good pace so you never really felt bored (something I did feel in the first movie). There are obvious flaws in the film e.g:1) Just how easy it was to hack the speed camera database 2) How to infiltrate a secure hotel with the president 3) Kidnapping of the presidentHowever if you ignore these things because lets face it this movie is not meant to be realistic then it's a great adventure ride of a movie. The plot is really interesting and how it goes from clearing his fathers name to finding the lost city of gold is quite clever as well and the overall ending of where the city was found was absolutely great. I felt that this movie was how the 4th Indiana Jones movie should have been in some aspects since the city of gold was a city of gold etc.. and there were no aliens. The characters themselves have grown and developed since the last movie you can see the bond between cage and voight as father and son, riley now trying to step out of cages shadows etc Oh and the person criticising kruges acting who cares she is fit and does her job well (i.e she looks good)If you want to see a movie that will not challenge you to much, keep you entertained, and also have a good plot line (which it does no matter how un realistic at times) then I do recommend this film.

It's as if they made it up as they went along.,"National Treasure: Book of Secrets was hypnotic. The acting was so shockingly bad, the premise so totally unreal and the dialog so childlike that I found myself in some sort of trance trying to make sense of the noises coming forth out of the actors mouths.First this movie pretends to be about something, which I find insulting. It is not actually about anything, it is a sequence of plot devices meant to sell apple computers.Second, this movie did not have any characters in it. It was as if great actors had been repeatedly struck in the head and forced at gunpoint to say lines that were being made up on the spot by an 8 year old. The dialog just runs together in one long strip with seemingly no attention paid to who should logically be talking.The actors often repeat the same phrase two or three times in one line. ""It's over there, the secret book, over there where it is."" This is both surreal and confusing.The only reason to see a movie of this caliber is either big explosions, or some form of nudity. This film had neither. It had neither because it was one of the worst movies ever made. It's movies like these that make you wonder where the millions of dollars spent making this sort of painful trash could have gone.

"Let the secret out, this film is fun and exciting, with a terrific ensemble cast","Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) is at it again. When a mysterious man (Ed Harris) shows up at Gates' lecture on Lincoln and the civil war and denigrates a relative of Ben's, Gates is out to prove him wrong. Trouble is, how? Enlisting the help of his father, Patrick (Jon Voight), his estranged girlfriend, Abby (Diane Kruger), his professor mother (Helen Mirren), and the computer-whiz wonderboy, Riley (Justin Bartha), Ben soon learns that the path to clear his ancestor's name will take him down the road of a lost treasure of gold, as well. Traveling to Paris, London and the Black Hills, Ben and company get closer and closer. Ben even ""kidnaps"" the President of the U.S. (Bruce Greenwood) in a grotto near Mount Vernon, but, only to ask him some important questions. But, others may be after the treasure, too, and, now of course, Ben is in trouble with the FBI. Will Ben locate the gold or will he end up in the penitentiary? This is a fun, fun flick with a terrific cast and an exciting story. It's no secret that Cage is one of the top American actors of all time (he's my personal favorite, check out Adaptation, Matchstick Men, and It Could Happen to You, among others) and he commands the attention of all viewers with his charm and energy. Keeping pace, Voight, Mirren, Kruger, and Bartha also give sweet, lovable, humorous performances. Harris is good as the heavy and Greenwood shines as a caring, intelligent President, where do you find one like him? The tale, somewhat implausible, naturally, is brimming with so much history that young fans are certain to head to the library and the Internet to find out what is true and what is imagined.

The first half was boring.  The second half was almost as good as the first film!,"All together it was pretty good.

Benjamin wants to clear his name, but finds the only way to do that is to look for the real answers in a book. The presidents book of secrets, for presidents eyes only. So his plan, kidnap the president.This film has good acting, a good plot, and of course, some pretty good action.Some of the action worthy of being in a Bourne film, etc.And what I love about the national treasure films, is they have good humor, yet still keep it serious.All though, of all that. The pacing was terrible! I thought the pacing of the first could not have been better.

It's OK ... but that's about it ...,"I saw this movie this morning ... opening day here in Tulsa. And on the whole, my own reaction is that it's OK, but that's really about it.The first National Treasure flick (2004) introduced us to Ben Gates, an engaging, adventuresome treasure hunter played by Nicolas Cage. Now we have a second installment in the franchise, and Nicolas Cage returns as Ben Gates. In addition, Justin Bartha returns as comical sidekick Riley Poole, Jon Voigt returns as Patrick Gates, Ben's father; and Diane Kruger returns as Abigail Chase, Ben's romantic interest.The story line is full of archeology, history, humor, and adventure that takes our lead characters to Paris, London, Washington DC, and Mount Rushmore.All in all, this is a pattern with which many are very familiar: the pattern successfully rendered in the Indiana Jones movies.I won't give away anything except to say that I myself think that the National Treasure franchise is far less engaging than the Indiana Jones franchise. And I have to ask myself why.I think, first, that scripts written for the Indiana Jones character always seem to me to be more convincing and more engaging. This has nothing to do with historical credibility: in this National Treasure movie, and its predecessor, we in the audience are fully aware that all the ""history"" in the movie is very, very unhistorical. Same for the Indiana Jones movies. However, in an Indiana Jones movie, the archaeological panoply is to me just so fascinating, and appealing, that I want it to be true even when I know it's not. And, in an Indiana Jones movie, the unfolding story is so much more fun than in a National Treasure movie. For both these reasons, in an Indiana Jones movie, I tend to take a look, roll my eyes, and then promptly suspend my disbelief and follow the storyline wherever it will lead me: it's that much fun and that attractive. Neither this National Treasure movie, nor its predecessor, lead me in this direction.As for the lead characters, Indiana Jones is so much more appealing, to me, compared to Ben Gates. Indiana Jones, in his trademark hat and bull-whip, is such a wonderful figure, played almost tongue in cheek by Harrison Ford. But the character is so much fun, like the storyline, that again, I watch Ford's Indiana Jones, roll my eyes once or twice early on, and then suspend my disbelief and follow Indiana Jones while smiling through all his fascinating adventures. In contrast, Nicolas Cage's Ben Gates is a very different character, and just has no such appeal for me. In National Treasure: Book of Secrets, we see him at one point prancing comically on a staircase in Buckingham Palace. A few moments later, we see him peeping around a bouquet of flowers at his love interest. Watching Ben Gates in these scenes felt to me like I was watching a sort of metro-sexual version of Rowan Atkinson's Mr Bean character. I just can't see such a character as a heroic treasure hunter. In contrast, Indiana Jones is every inch a treasure hunter and hero. He's also a classic masculine hero, though one who is leavened by that occasional tongue in cheek irony.About National Treasure: Book of Secrets: I did think this was better than the first National Treasure. The acting in the second movie, by everyone, was competent but unexceptional in delivering the script. The cinematography was good. Th4e dialog was sometimes entertaining. The the script overall supported a storyline, and a character, that didn't really appeal to me very much.All the same, for light adventure and light entertainment, one could do a lot worse than go to this movie.It's OK ... but that's about it, IMHO.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
National Treasure: Movie of Secrets,"National Treasure: Book of Secrets/2007/**1/2Main Stars: Benjamin Gates: Nicolas Cage Riley Poole: Justin Bartha Abigail Chase: Diane Kruger Patrick Gates: Jon VoightNot bad. Not bad at all. Not good either. I don't care about the farfetchedness. I just care about how the story is laid out. It is confusing, really. There are dozens of clues that lead to even more clues and more and more. I thought the first one was a lot but this is the story of number one times two. You're in for a lot of cramming in those two hours. Time went fast though because regardless of how utterly ridiculous the whole thing is, it is a thrill ride. A cinematic thrill ride.The first one was great. I don't know why I liked it so much but for some reason it hit the spot. It was extremely far-fetched but almost ingenious in a way. It kept my attention throughout the whole thing. This one did too. But with not as much interest in the plot and how it would all resolve. The resolution for number one was good. However, I was not satisfied with how this one ended. Don't ask me why. Maybe it's a psychological thing.Anyway, this film's plot is one that can't be described in words, actions, writing, customs or any other form of communication because it is the most convoluted plot since the third 'Pirates' installment. Remember how much difficulty I had with describing that plot? It'll be the same for this. That's why I'm not going to tell you anything but what the previews implied and a few other summaries, etc. etc. Nevertheless, it's the opinion that counts.What is a good way to summarize the entire convoluted two hour film? Benjamin Gates (Nicolas Cage) is on yet another mission. He's a history nut so he's perfect for the job. The mission is to find out secrets about the assassination of President Lincoln. Things like: Who was involved in the assassination? What lead to it? Why did they choose to cooperate in the plan? But how is that going to happen? About fifteen convoluted clues later, we end up with an unsatisfactory ending that doesn't really prove much except for the main thing in Ben Gates' mind. Was Ben Gates' great-great grandfather Thomas Gates involved in President Lincoln's assassination? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Even after seeing the film I might still have both thoughts. That's what I didn't like. None of the clues really led to anything except more clues and no final result. All that happened just to be lead with another question. Perhaps they did that on purpose. However, the first one ended with not another clue but actually ended well. It was summed up pretty clearly, I think. Plus, it was much more entertaining and not too many plot points were put in to make it more and more confusing.The movie is still entertaining though. I'll give it that. It takes a LOT of effort to make a feature length film and one that still keeps your attention is worth a positive rating. And I think the way I rated this film was fair. It's right in the middle of average to good. The characters in the film can assist to that. Cage, Voight (playing Patrick Gates, Ben's father), Bartha (the clueless friend Riley), and Kruger (playing the brains of the pack and the woman) are all well-written and entertaining characters. That's another positive note. Helen Mirren (playing Ben's mother) was OK. So was Ed Harris (playing the villain that wants the treasure just as much as Gates). I have a feeling all the writers involved in this film know how ridiculous the premise is. We all do. But they write for fun. They want it to be fun. They want it to be mindless entertainment. But, when you think about it the entertainment is not mindless. You do have to know at least some of what's going on. Otherwise, there's no point in watching the movie.But I still won't call the film good. It's ridiculous; it's exhausting; it's entertaining; it's convoluted. And they most likely used some formula.All that comes out to about what my rating is. It's hard to rate a film like this. Because, again, you're not looking for any plausibility at all in a film like this. And if you are you must have been born yesterday or even today.But the fact that even at the end of the film you don't really feel satisfied but instead feel confused and none of your questions really seemed to be answered.I felt that way. It's almost like I didn't really see a film. I saw what was more like an idea or tons of ideas plopped into one package. The film is a book of secrets and a book of confusion.Did you find my review disorganized and convoluted? If you did I'm perfectly fine with that because I know I'm not alone.Movie directed by Jon Turteltaub.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Better than the first, and that's saying a lot","I really like the first National Treasure, it was fun, exiting, and entertaining. But most sequels don't live up to the hype, but this is one that did. This sequel is entertaining, action, funny, and even a little educational.Nick Cage plays Ben Gates, a treasure hunter who's ancestor has been accused of killing President Lincoln. Not being able to believe it, he enlist the help of his friend Riley Poole, played by Justin Bartha. By the end his ex-girlfriend Abigal chase, and even his parents. It leads to all sorts of locations, like Bunckingham palace, the oval office, and Mount Rushmore.All the acting is top-notch, Justin Bartha is hilarious. Nick Cage is funny and a good action star. So why do a lot of people not like this. It has a very low rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and the basic consensus is ""A talented cast goes to waste in the improbable National Treasure: Book of Secrets, which is eerily similar to the first film."" Oh sure, its improbable, yeah because critically acclaimed films like Avatar, Harry Potter, District 9, The Dark Knight, and Jaws are all incredibly realistic. So, it's a treasure hunting movie, just throw reality out the window and enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
If the first movie worked for you so will this as it's more of the same with an expanded scope and budget.,"Some time after the events of the last film, Benjamin ""Ben"" Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) continues to enjoy his newfound respect in the historical community despite him and his girlfriend Dr. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) having gone through a messy breakup and Riley Poole (Justin bartha) has lost most of his fortune due to shenanigans with an unscrupulous accountant and a book that has failed to sell all that well. As Ben attends a conference on civilian heroes honoring his ancestor Thomas Gates, the event is interrupted by the interjection of private military contractor Mitchell ""Mitch"" Wilkinson (Ed Harris) who produces a lost page of John Wilkes Booth's diary that features Thomas Gates' name on a list with several other conspirators of the Lincoln assassination. With the Gates tarnished by this revelation, Ben re-assembles his old group and also involves his feuding parents Patrick Gates (Jon Voight) and Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren) on an adventure to clear Thomas Gates' name which is tied to the location of a lost city of Gold while Mitch is hot on their trail having tarnished Thomas Gates' name as a way to get Ben to find the treasure for him.Surviving 5 years of development hell and releasing to mixed reviews, 2004's National Treasure became a sizable hit making a little over three times its budget. While the first film was envisioned as a standalone project with no sights set on a sequel, the film's box office impressed Disney executives enough that one was commissioned with the original film's writers Cormac and Marianne Wibberley returning to pen the film. Made for $130 million, the movie proved an even bigger hit than its predecessor making $459 million worldwide and becoming the ninth highest grossing film of 2007 and Disney then registered domains for two further National Treasure movies (which have yet to happen due to issues too long and convoluted to cover here). As with the first film, critical reception was mixed and slightly lower from the first film as many felt the film didn't do all that much to distinguish itself from the first one. Despite settling into formula, National Treasure: Book of Secrets is once again A level work with C level material.Being a sequel that wasn't planned, National Treasure 2 falls into the pitfall that many films of this type fall into wherein the filmmakers decide to ""reset the counter to zero"" because they have no idea where to take our characters from where they left them in the first film so instead we have them go back to where they started. The opening act where we learn that Ben and Abigail have split up, Riley has lost all his money, and the Gates name has now been tarnished once again is a sign that if there was a ""reset button"" to be pressed, it was done in earnest. Note to filmmakers: People don't like ""reset back to zero"" plotlines in their sequels, so please stop doing them.Once we get past the very clumsy setup and reintroduction, we do get the fun treasure hunt aspects of the first film with an expanded scope as the movie now features set pieces in London, England and Paris, France for some welcome locational variety. Once again the cast are very entertaining with Nicolas Cage the major elevating factor in this movie and we get an entertaining ""Cage freakout"" in Buckingham Palace that's probably the most entertaining scene in the movie because it's just Cage unleashing all he can at one point. Helen Mirren makes a welcome addition as Ben's mother and Ed Harris is a solid antagonist even if the movie feels a little confused on where it stands with him as a character (they try to give him some redemptive qualities that feel very clumsily integrated. The action sequences remain competent if not particularly memorable and once again the best action sequence is a scene at the climax where it's kind of a redo of the rotting staircase from the first film, but they do have a neat twist on it with the characters having to shift their balances to avoid plummeting to their doom.National Treasure 2 has all the same faults and virtues as its predecessor and also comes with the added baggage of sequel ""reset"", but much like the first film if you're willing to go along with the silliness and not all that sound internal logic you'll get a diverting if not particularly substantial viewing experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Oh boy, what a stinker","What is this cast doing in this film? There must be some absolutely stonking smaller budget films coming out nursed by the cast, because that's the only way I can see the great actors in this film agreeing to this piece of crap.Now, in my time, I've read quite a lot of pseudo-revisionist history. And while the first National Treasure was plausible to the fringes of freaky history, riding a Da Vinci Code wave, this stretched my ability to suspend my disbelief to breaking point. Gone are the ""you're going to do what?!"" chortling surprises of the first film, which wasn't a fab film in itself. Now even a wide-eyed rube like myself sat there saying ""this is ludicrous"" and I'm glad I got to see it on my cinema pass, because if I'd paid full whack I would be disappointed.I know, I know, you're asking why did you go and see it in the first place?

Enjoyable and similar to the first movie,"A historian follows attempts to clear his ancestor's name from involvement in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.This is an entertaining movie if you can suspend disbelief for the entire running time.The plot is another mcguffin adventure inspired by the likes of Indiana Jones and the Da Vinci code that recycles the formula of the original. It is entertaining with fun character moments.The highlight of both National Treasure movies for me is that the lead characters resolve most problems using their intelligence rather than violence. This makes it a good movie to watch as a family with younger children.I struggle with the amount of similarities to the first movie as it is pretty much a copy of the basic plot with different content. Also the level of patriotism of the original is eye rolling and this one is even more so.Nicholas Cage does a good job once again in the lead roll, but his character Gates is certainly no Indy.

Fun and Charm Returns,"This is the second time that I've reviewed this film. IMDb, you lost my first one, so I am having to write this from memory. Fortunately, my opinion of the film hasn't changed.As a non-American, I am constantly amazed at that country's ability to mythologize and almost deify its history and iconic figures. American nationalism has a streak of idolatry about it that enables films like NTBOS to be created. Americans know that they live in a Great Power, and are able to create stories to celebrate it, even something as lighthearted as this.NTBOS is essentially a video game with a narrative follow-though. It is Indiana Jones set in the modern day, but reducing the world to that contained within American boarders, something that many Americans find deeply comforting.A central theme in this film (and the authors have the decency to give some depth to the proceedings) is the place in history of ones actions, and the connection to the past through one's relatives, and the bequeathing of moral responsibility from one generation to the next.This film is a quest myth, and like all good quests, what is sought is potentially ennobling to the questors. And all the characters, even the putative villain portrayed by Ed Harris, seek merely to make a positive contribution, and to be remembered well, achieving immortality in the process.The acting isn't great in this film, and it doesn't have to be: the actors merely have to look like they are having fun whilst Jon Turtletaub puts them through their paces and pays them a lot of money whilst doing it. I don't think they are acting though. Since Nick Cage can't act, what we are left with is genuine enthusiasm and enjoyment that is readily transferred to the paying audience.

This time, its about clearing his family name as some guy comes up and claims his family was part of the group that conspired to kill Abe Lincoln.The cool thing about this film is that it makes you believe that all t his stuff could be possible. That if you look at a dollar bill closely, look at the constitution closely, you would find stuff their that was hidden for anybody to decipher. The film takes you around the world and back again in it's Indiana-Jones like action adventure. It's like Goonies for Grownups. And if you like Goonies, you will like National Treasure.

Nice enough,"After seeing the first film I was more or less looking forward to a sequel. There was enough ground to make one on after all. And it must be said, this film is slightly worse than its predecessor, but only slightly and that means it is still a very enjoyable film.Storywise one can expect the same kind of thing that made the first film: a trail of clues leading to some great lost treasure. In this film the clues are even more far-fetched than the ones in the first film, but not to the point of being irritating. The rest of things in the film is very much in line with the other as well. Just about all the characters return and play their part well.The few characters that get added to the mix work out well enough and that makes the grand total for this adventure a well deserved 7 out of 10.

"Joyous boys own yarn full of the serial silliness of movies past, present and the first movie!","As with the enormously successful first film, this sequel irritated as many people as it entertained. It's just the nature of the family friendly blockbuster, that some film fans refuse to accept them as viable fun family fare, whilst others can easily run with it and have a great time. The highbrow versus the lowbrow? Well maybe if you want to really be speaky arty about it...National Treasure: Book of Secrets made over $450 million at the worldwide box offices. Now we are told that financial success is no marker for quality of product, that's fair enough, but what is undeniably true is that it means there were considerably ""a lot"" of happy paying punters! From way back in the day when we had the likes of Gunga Din, Beau Geste and The Adventures of Robin Hood, there has been a considerable market for the action adventure movie. Some are better than others, some are even more brainy, but mostly they deliver a set pattern of what many people want.The makers of this sequel just go bigger than the first film whilst following exactly the same formula. Nicolas Cage's treasure hunting Benjamin Franklin Gates has to follow clues to treasure again, only this time it's to clear his family name since his granddaddy has been implicated in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Justin Bartha and Diane Kruger are again along for the ride, while Jon Voight gets more screen time as Daddy Gates. Helen Mirren joins the fray as the estranged Mommy Gates, Ed Harris slots in for villain duties and Bruce Greenwood adds class as the president of the USA.The stunts and set-pieces are humongous, the traps and clues more elaborate than before and the photography (Amir Mokri and John Schwartzman) once again is gorgeous. It hurtles along at a nifty pace, stopping only to explain the various plot machinations to younger viewers, and the comic by-play between all the principal players is set in stone. Is it full of implausibilities, insulting history and credulity stretching beyond belief? Yes! Of course, that's why many of us action adventure fans escape into such high energy nonsense. Those expecting cerebral tickles or those offended by basic family blockbusters should quite simply stay away. 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The sequel is better. It doesn't need the character development of the first since we know the characters.. although it does add some fresh faces with two new roles played by powerhouses Ed Harris and Helen MIrren.

The tech support guy is nearly cartoon as is the disappointing villain until some inconsistent changes at the end.The other support cast is where the better writing and acting happens especially Mom and Dad -- sort of like how Sean Connery stole the last Indiana Jones.Big plot holes: all the clues point to specific things that didn't exist and mostly weren't planned at the point the clue was created.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Wait until it is on late night cable...and absolutely nothing else is on,"This is my first ever comment on a movie. Most movies I leave alone after viewing, so others can make an honest opinion for themselves. I would have to say that I have a very high tolerance for movies, but this one had me writhing in my seat in agony.This movie goes astray from the very beginning when they try to make the main plot for the film in that the Gates family name is tarnished by the new accusal of his great grandfather's participation in the assassination of President Lincoln some 142 years ago. Well even if great grandpops was involved, WHO CARES. The reality is that this plot was so weak that not even 1/2 way into the flick it switches gears and goes a totally different direction. That was a good idea, but not good for viewers. The story then takes them to improbable locations to get clues that there is no way in hell they would ever be able to get to in the capacity that the did. Whatever...it's Hollywood, i let slide. THe thing i couldn't let slide is the way they find the keys to problems they run into. This is where the writers spent the least amount of time. They realized that in order for the movie to flow, they couldn't waste lots of time explaining how the problems were solved. The problem with this is that for the audience, there is absolutely no buildup or suspense moments from the sluething (just ask McGuyver). In my eyes, it is these non-action moments of revelation that can glue entire films together, and when the glue is of poor quality it ALL FALLS APART.There are so many things wrong with this film, that I would just bore you (and myself) with all the details. This is one of the few films that I wanted to walk out of (x4), but I stuck it out to the very very very bitter end. My recommendation is to save your hard earned money for a real movie, maybe a movie with an original script.Thank you for listening.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Premise With Promise...But...,"We attended the first show, opening day in our small home town theater (Movies on the Parkway in Sevierville, TN), to a nearly sold out show.This adventure is not as fun this time around. The clues are less entrenched in symbology , lending less story, and more room for comical relief. That was a mistake, in my opinion; one which may prove to hurt it in the long run. Considering, however, how dismally the Golden Compass has fared, xmas movie goers are hungry for a good fantasy/actioner to sink their collective teeth into.Hopefully, some of those disappointed fans who brave the rains and windy wet cold to see NT2 will also give the Golden Compass a try, while they're at it. NT2 contains the same base formula as NT1, but this time it is far m ore watered down, with much less clues and less real action, but more development of the interpersonal relationships between Ben Gates (Nic Cage) and his parents (Helen Mirren and Jon Voight) and his lady. We also get a deeper look into the personal life (or lack thereof) of Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), Gates' Partner.Undoubtedly, due to a lessening of action and effects accompanying the deepening of character development and an almost total lack of substance, many will not think highly of this work. I, however, found it entertaining. Not as entertaining as the first, but it was still an enjoyable venture.Cage seems more comfortable in this incarnation of the character, without contributing a dialed-in performance. His comfort conveys an on-screen presence; a great charisma above and beyond the usual, and that's saying something.The premise has promise, but is not explored to its potential enough to flesh out the screenplay to actually give it a story. Unfortunately, this attempt fell far short in comparison to the rich story detail of the first. It left us wondering if there will be a third, for we are hoping for a return to a real adventure with a well-developed story as the first installment led us to expect.All in all? It's fun, but lacks the quality of the previous chapter. Here's hoping the 47th Page leads us back to a GOOD adventure.It rates a 5.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is the cinematic equivalent of cotton candy.,"National Treasure: Book Of Secrets really entertains. I wasn't expecting much from this film, but it turns out to be better than the first National Treasure. The treasure hunt, though not believable, is gripping. There's also some effective humour added in. Nicolas Cage, who's just one of Hollywood's best actors, is as reliable as ever in the main role of Ben Gates. I don't know what it is about him, but he always manages to be interesting when on screen.On the downside the film is a Hollywood product. This just isn't great film-making. John Voight and newcomer Helen Mirren are just there for the money. Diane Kruger is nothing but a pretty face, and Ed Harris (who's the villain for most of the film) doesn't have much to do. Still, like I mentioned earlier Book Of Secrets is very entertaining (especially in the second half). I just couldn't stop watching it. It's better than that odd bore Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull. Book Of Secrets is a good family film, and I recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Secret Elitist Elements in ""Treasure""","Although they exhibit insightful interpretation of code language, the writers made many decisively elitist choices that fail Disney's promise to serve the public interest. The heroes of this movie are jet-setter multimillionaires or billionaires. They could have been persons of ordinary income, with minor adjustments to the plot. So many American movies focus on the experiences of the topmost income earners as if to say that theirs are the most interesting lives. The affluent heroes claim their desire to solve the mystery is to clear up their family name, a name that is followed in the news media, that originates centuries ago. That is pure poppycock because here, in America, we don't have a nobility, we don't have persons strutting superiority over the peasants on the basis of family plumage, crest, shield. The writers must be anticipating the imminent demise of the inheritance tax, which many Republicans sought to entirely extricate from federal law in our recent past. Then, these valiant heroes cause horrible damage and injury to ordinary populations where they engage in car chases. No punishment is even feared. But when one of them detains the President for a few minutes, even though the President was pleased that it happened, there are these overlong deliberations about the harm to that V.I.P. and the punishment that might be meted out. If the film was intended to be realistic, how do heroes engage in highly destructive car chases without fear of lawsuits for negligence and reckless driving? Or if it is a fantasy, why do the audiences have to be treated to scenes of large fleets of police cars chasing down these heroes as if they were criminals just for having spoken of interesting things privately to the President? It's consistent with the return of a nobility to depict damage to peasants as trivial. Setting aside this objection, this movie is fun to watch, in good taste, and thought-provoking. But nobility is the family value Disney is promoting with ""National Treasure"".",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The film could have benefited from more suspense.All in all this film was OK, I wouldn't watch it again but I suggest if you are after something light hearted, entertaining and not to difficult to understand then this one is for you!

"Underrated gem solid, unfair criticized, a decent well made the last good Nicolas Cage movie sequel!","National Treasure: Book of Secrets (2007) it is unfairly criticized and trashed by critics and fans of the first film. My honest opinion is: this is the last good Nicolas Cage movie he has done, before he start making direct to video trash movies. Nicolas Cage returns with his famous character Ben Franklin Gates. I forgot to mentioned in the first film review Nicolas reunited with producer Jerry Bruckheimer for the fifth time in the row producing this film. The first film with Nicolas Cage was The Rock (1996) on which the actor and producer worked together. I disagree with people saying this was unnecessary sequel, it is a good sequel and I love this film, but I don't love it that much as I love the first movie! The first movie is the best one of the two, Nicolas Cage also reunites with Ed Harris from The Rock (1996). Ed Harris plays again another villain and I must say for my honest opinion Ed Harris is way better villain than Sean Bean is in the first film. I was really surprised how much fun I had with this film, you also do have a lot's of action and car chases. We have returning cast from the first movie: Nicolas Cage, Justin Bartha, Diane Kruger, Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel and Armando Riesco.Plot: Benjamin Gates must follow a clue left in John Wilkes Booth's diary to prove his ancestor's innocence in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.I don't know what is the problem with this film I think it is a good film and I really like the character development, but still is not better than the first film. The first film is still way better than this one. This film is about clearing Ben Gates ancestor's name and innocence that he wasn't co conspirator in assassination of US president Abraham Lincoln and that he was set up, before he died and was killed. It references on Abraham Lincoln US president that was assassinated and it is again a history film. This film doesn't evolves around museums like was in the first movie but it evolves about a book that leads to a clues.I love National Treasure 2. It's funny, gripping and informative. This film is the American history in the plot story, which is surprisingly accurate. Its nice to see a film that shows respect to it's story and doesn't reinvent it and destroy it completely. Its also nice to see a sequel that hasn't been rushed. I absolutely enjoyed this film on Blu-ray. I bought this film together on Blu-ray with the first film and I have absolutely enjoy it and I had fun with it. Con Air, The Rock and National Treasure 1 and 2 are my favorite Nicolas Cage movies and are favorite of mine that I can watch them over and over again and they aren't that violent like are Face/Off, Left Behind, Windtalkers films I seriously hate that movies that Nicolas Cage was involved!Things I do like in the film: the end when Ed Harris sacrifice him self to save all the people trapped in a cave. Nicolas Cage clearing his ancestor's name and for the discovery of a secret also gives a credit to Ed Harris. In the caves you have a lot of booby traps. Nicolas Cage and Diane Kruger's character development was excellent specially their fight in the museum. Helen Mirren is also cast as Ben Gates mom a professor on the university that Jon Voight's character don't get along with it, but on the end of the film, they both show their feelings and that they are still in love. Showing our beloved heroes in a caves was fantastic, Ben Gates kidnapping American President in a secret passage so that president tells him the secret clue hiding in library's book was brilliant. This film is brilliant and excellent so I don't get the hate for this film! Helen Mirren as Ben Gates mom was excellent in her role, she also played in Red 1 and 2 and Teaching Mrs. Tingle (1999) I mostly know her from those movies. Everything in this movie is excellent, special effects and mostly the characters are wonderful that I love.The director Jon Turteltaub did an amazing job on this movie! It is just as exciting as the first one, but is a whole new story, and a whole new adventure to go on. Trevor Rabin reprise the score theme from the first movie which is solid.Overall: I love Natural Treasure 2 it is Nicolas Cage last good movie he done and my favorite of the actor, the rating is A+ 9/10 a good sequel but not that great as the first one, but still a fun watchable flick.National Treasure: Book of Secrets (released on home video as National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets) is a 2007 mystery adventure film directed by Jon Turteltaub and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.

Just awful,"Silly movie for kids - if you're into feeding your kid with a lot of nationalist bullshit. The plot is childish, with a lot of childish solutions for every tension. If keyboards came with a bank of sounds called ""Cinema"" - with a button for ""Comedy release melody"", or ""Action time"" and ""Moment for love"", they could actually just use the music from this movie. Horrible acting. Nicolas Cage, I guess, tries to be a cartoon character with his face at some point. At least he is trying... Ed Harris just stays there with a serious face and makes his money. A lot of silly unreasonable puzzles involving US History trivia. I watched the movie and gave it two stars. Then I realized there was one of those useless outoftheplot final scenes.

More adventuring with Ben Gates.,"""This is ridiculous.""If Helen Mirren says it, it must be true. National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets is indeed ridiculous. Even more so than its predecessor.Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage, once again in a role that requires him to basically act like Nicholas Cage) is hot on the trail of another historical treasure, this time to clear the name of his great-grandfather, who's been implicated in the infamous assassination of President Lincoln. Don't try to figure out how those two things are connected, as the plot is just an excuse to keep the action speeding from one location to the next.Book of Secrets follows the formula of the original movie extremely closely. There are once again hidden messages to be found on historical documents, centuries-old riddles that Ben puzzles out the answers to incredibly easily, high-security historical landmarks to waltz in and out of, and a villain that accompanies the protagonists underground for a finale based around a large action set-piece.Riley and Abigail (Justin Bartha and Diane Kruger, both essentially just collecting a paycheck) are given nominal reasons to go treasure hunting with Ben again, and this time around he's also joined by his mother (Helen Mirren), as well as his father (Jon Voight). Mirren, Ed Harris as the antagonist, and the locations are the only real differences between the second movie and the first. Ben even finds himself once again being pursued by FBI Agent Sadusky (Harvey Keitel).If the idea of a near-exact copy of the first movie turns you off, then I'd advise you to stay away. If you're up for more and can overlook the barely there plot and mammoth liberties taken with historical fact, then I say go for it. As for me, I don't mind switching my brain off again and watching Cage ponder ridiculous historical ""facts"" and Diane Kruger be hot for another two hours. National Treasure 2 is as entertaining as the first movie, for better or for worse.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great movie,"This movie is great. The story is very refined, so I felt down to it. This film has many factor- suspense, action, a bad guy, and so on. It is like Indiana Jones. Indiana Jones is full of action scene, but there are many demystification scene in National Treasure. The hero and his company goes to find treasure for his ancestral clearing of name. They solves a code one by one, and I was excited in the moment when those points and points are in one line.Anyway the hero is well-informed. He leads his friends to the answer and get over the dangerous with his knowledge.Everything in this movie is well thought off.Actually this film make you think and maybe even come to the conclusion that history is not bored. This movie is one that you can never get disappointed. If you have not seen it, you should so by all means. This is my recommendation",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fun and Entertaining,"27 December 2007. Safe fun entertainment where people don't get killed, just cars and so forth. The thrills and chills are little less potent, the jokes a bit too cute, and Ed Harris' character is a little ambiguous by the end as if Harris is getting a little tired of the stereotype he has played in movie after movie. There is some drama, though perhaps not enough and the funny comedy doesn't always seem to balance the adventure aspect. Overall, though the movie was enjoyable, fun, a thrill ride if not completely transporting into the Indiana Jones realm. Boring it was not, but a bit manipulative, not as edgy, not as dramatic as it could have been. A nice way to keep the Christmas winter blues away in the end. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Creative Follow Up,"Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) has a new treasure to find and a new antagonist chasing him. If he can find the lost city of gold and patch things up with his ex-girlfriend, then he will have proven his great-great-grandfather's innocence in the the plot to assassinate President Lincoln while rekindling the love with lost flame Abigail (Diane Kruger). He has to do all of this with Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) trying to play spoiler.""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" was creative and exciting even if the romance part of it was an oft-told story. Ben and Abigail were on the outs, but Ben needed her help for his latest soiree. You know that ala ""Twister"" and other movies, this adventure will make them realize that they love and miss each other. So, I give the movie kudos for the well thought out treasure hunt and demerits for the poorly thought out romance.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Different but as good as the first!,"Just saw it and while there were some details that could've been in it, it was true to the first and left open another movie. All the actors were excellent, great interaction and good lines for all.I thought both Ed Harris and Helen Mirren were wonderful additions. Not quite as thought provoking as the original, but just as good in a different way.Excellent scenery, with Mt. Rushmore, Paris and London as well as different parts of DC this time. The pace was very good and never felt like the movie dragged, just like the first one.Definitely a must see this season.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good Characters but Poor Writing,"National Treasure 2 the Book of Secrets is for the most part a great action adventure film and keeps you enthralled with its twisting corridors, deadly traps, strange conspiracies, and compelling characters. For the most part I actually sat at the edge of my seat wondering where the next clue would take us. However, the movie had one glaring mistake, the writing. First off were lead to believe that Ben's parents had been divorced for 32 years yet in several hours after being reunited they begin acting like they were friends for centuries. The other complaints (Spoilers) are that the city of gold the characters are after is claimed to be built by the Olmecs yet Olmecs were a South American Civilization yet the city was found in North Dakota. Third, why build an underground city of gold in the first place. The idea is basically that the Olmecs carried hundreds of tons of golds across thousands of miles and built an underground city filled with unrealistically intricate traps. Just thinking about that is ludicrous. Fourth, the villain of the movie wants to cause so much danger just because he wants to be remembered. Odd motives to say the least. So in the end the movie despite some major writing mistakes was actually quiet enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a good action adventure flick, who doesn't care about character motives or historical accuracy.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Strengths appealing to popular culture,"There are several main points that I believe bring strength to this movie and give cause to its recognition in popular culture. The first would be that this film reaches out to a very broad audience demographically. Next is the idea that its themes, sub themes, and thematic elements are identifiable with the audience on one level or another. The last significant point that I can distinguish is the intrigue of mystery and relation to the very secrets that still prod history today.Appealing to a vast audience is imperative to a film's success, by measurement of box-office performance and subsequent earnings. National Treasure 2 was rated PG for some aggression and violent action, which draws in a larger crowd than what a rated PG-13 or rated R movie would allow. Although it is not given for a completely general audience, it is viewable for anyone who can accept the fairly mild doses of action. The household name of Walt Disney greatly attracts audiences due to the trusted company and reputation that Disney has earned throughout the decades. By focusing in on a younger audience (with Disney distribution) alone, it lures parents and whole families to see the film. The movie was however marketed as a family affair, during holiday season which calls on the tradition of families getting together to go to the theaters (particularly on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day), which surely secured it rising to the top during the week it debuted (Wikipedia). By tending to families, an incredibly large range is covered that sweeps across gender, race, and certainly age. The statistics stating the millions of dollars grossed and status at number one for 17 days before dropping to the number two spot demonstrates this. The thematic elements in the plot also implore its success in popular culture. There are many sub themes that are identifiable for the different aspects of the audience. One of the general themes that it expresses is honor and dignity of the family name, which is an important American premise in our culture. Ben goes to great lengths to fully discover his family history and then in the sequel unwaveringly defends it, that he might beseech the truth he knows lies within. This is the type of message that resonates within culture and history and has great potential to register with viewers. For those in the audience too young or simplistic to capture this concept, there of course were the basic underlying messages which still echo as universal morality and goodness such as friendship and love. The relationships between Ben and Riley, Ben and Abigail, Patrick and his ex-wife Emily, and even in the end, between one of the protagonists and Ben, clearly remind us of that loyalty and reliability that we so value. The last point that I found which supports the movie's embrace from popular culture was the mystery. While this may sound like a simple marketing ploy to appease viewers with such suspense or only a genre, I believe that the way in which mystery is evoked from the movie is what really intrigues a great part of the audience. The reason this can be concluded is by the associations and parallelisms between the mystery and adventure in the storyline and that which still challenges historians, possible treasure hunters, anthropologists, archaeologists, societies, etc in this day and age. So often are people appealed by conspiracy, secrecy, and the significance of history. There was an abundance of these concepts being reflected. Among the list of famous historical sites were Mount Rushmore, The White House, The Library of Congress and Buckingham Palace. These are the types of places that most Americans can identify with as part of history or that history buffs are fascinated with, just as the main character was. Being relatable is an asset to popular culture.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cheese-fest,"I cannot believe I actually spent money on this movie. I think I rolled my eyes about a thousand times. They even made Helen Mirren come across as an average actress. I remember one of her lines was meant to be comedic but no one in the entire theater laughed. I did enjoy the prequel but they decided to multiply the dose of cheese to an unspeakable amount. I did go in with an open mind, ready for an entertaining mindless popcorn flick... but I immediately found out that was way too high of an expectation. The only bright spot about it was Justin Bartha (Riley), who was quite funny. I hate to say that this was one of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time. I highly recommend NOT seeing it.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining for what it was,"I watched this movie expecting exactly what I got. I wanted to escape reality for roughly two hours and was given that opportunity with this film.

I love the mixture of actual history with fiction. This movie offers the opportunity for children to research actual events on their own as opposed to being told what's real and what isn't.If your intent is to watch a film and receive a history lesson, I suggest checking out the History Channel or better yet pick up a book. If you just want to be entertained and learn a few things along the way, definitely check this film out.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
May as well buy the first one on DVD,"Back in 2004 National Treasure was released; it wasn't bad, as it was something that hadn't been done that well for a while, since Indiana Jones. The sequel is more or so the same with a few tweaks but not many and this time it is even more absurd. Other than that they have kept the same plot line, mainly the same stars and the same outcome, so if want to save money you may as well rent the first one on DVD.The basic story is about this treasure hunter called Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage  Ghost Rider, Leaving Las Vegas and Gone in Sixty Seconds) who is searching for a city of gold  I won't bore you with the details  which is connected to the assassination of President Lincoln in some way. This leads him to break into the Queen's private study in Buckingham Palace, sneak into the Oval Office, and later kidnap the President in search of clues. While being pursued by a rival treasure hunter (Ed Harris). I told you it was absurd.There are good cast members, bad cast members and some that could of done better. Here are the rest of the cast, Diane Kruger, Jon Voight, Helen Mirren (who must have needed the money), Harvey Keitel and the in my opinion the very under used Justin Bartha who gives the film most of it laughs.Overall the good points about the film is that it's fun, watchable, clever and quite witty at points, provided you don't think about it too much, or haven't seen the first film.. The bad points are that it's almost too absurd, to American for my liking (not that I don't like Americans I just prefer Britain), almost exactly the same as the first one and a few of cast could be better. Somehow this film topped the box office Stateside for three weeks, that's something that Gates himself wouldn't be able to solve.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Seems like we've been here before,"Time for the inevitable National Treasure sequel and your feelings about this movie should pretty much reflect your feelings about the first one. If you liked the original you'll like this. If the first movie didn't do it for you well then there's nothing for you here because it's basically the same movie all over again. It's a pretty simple formula really. Take a movie which made hundreds of millions of dollars, add a couple of European locations, toss in a dash of Ed Harris and a dollop of Helen Mirren and then sit back and collect further hundreds of millions of dollars.The sequel does on the surface seem slightly more plausible than the original but that's really not saying much. Our heroes won't have to steal the Declaration of Independence this time. But they will have to take apart the Queen of England's desk, sneak into the Oval Office and kidnap someone who quite simply cannot be kidnapped. And of course they'll also need to get their hands on the Book of Secrets because that is after all the name of the movie. What's in that Book of Secrets? Well, it's a secret. But it's safe to say there will be more treasure to be found because apparently we didn't discover enough treasure in the first movie. I anxiously await National Treasure 50 by which point I'm sure we will have learned that you can find billions of dollars worth of gold buried somewhere in each of the fifty states if only you have Nicolas Cage to help you look for it.Cage of course plays the central role of treasure hunter Ben Gates and he's surrounded by much of the same cast as last time around. Jon Voight again plays Ben's father, Diane Kruger his love interest and Justin Bartha his treasure-hunting sidekick. Cage, Voight and Kruger are really no better or worse than the first time around. Bartha's character is much less annoying this time. After trying so desperately hard to be funny, and failing miserably at it, in the first film the character fits much better in this movie. All of those groan-inducing one-liners Bartha was forced to spout in the first movie have been removed. Well, most of them anyway. The two new roles of any significance are taken up by Harris as the villain and Mirren as Ben's mother. Harris is somewhat surprisingly bland in his bad guy role. Adding Mirren was a nice touch however and she plays off of Cage and Voight very well. The fact Ben's mother happens to be one of the few people on the planet capable of interpreting one of the clues is either convenient or contrived, I'm not quite sure which.Anyhow Ben Gates and friends proceed pretty much exactly as they did in the first movie. Decipher some clues, avoid the bad guy, decipher some more clues, avoid the bad guy again, try not to get killed by ancient treasure-protecting booby traps. It really is the same exact thing we saw the first time. But that's not all bad. The plot is reasonably engrossing and entertaining. There are some nice action moments, some decent touches of humor here and there. It's a movie that was never meant to be taken particularly seriously. For what it is it works. More or less.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best Movie In Years!,"Many action movies these days have over used plots and boring effects.

It's a thrilling story line that allows the viewer to feel like they are part of the adventure.The first movie was great but generally sequels are never as good. This movie is not the case. The adventure takes you to Washington D.C, Mount Rushmore, Buckingham Palace and many other exciting places.It's filled with adventure, edge-of-your-seat moments, romance and just the right mix of comedy and seriousness.

The poor man's Indiana Jones.,"The National Treasure movies are the poor man's Indiana Jones. Who's scared of Ed Harris. Indiana has to deal with Nazis and Soviets. Cage's character only faces a few semi scary moments in the movie. If the movie producers decided they need to pump another bore fest; they should pump up the action and at least gets some crazy terrorists Nicholas. Shooting RPG's at Cage and his crew should be sufficient with maybe a couple road side bombs going off would be much better than ""scary"" Ed Harris chasing Cage around the Globe. Even Marty McFly had to deal with some terrorist after Doc sold some terrorist a fake bomb made of pinball parts for Delorean.

What do you expect?,"National Treasure: Book of Secrets is a decent film. It is exactly what you would expect for this film, this budget, and Disney.

I will say the ending was a little ridiculous and over-the-top and made the rest of the movie dwindle in substance, but the other hour of movie was fun and entertaining for the ride.Compared to the first it is definitely weaker and the characters seem more paper-thin but the humor is still the same and the adventure and puzzles are more or less the same as well.

Utter claptrap,"What a boatload of pure, unadulterated hogwash. Shame on Helen Mirren, Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, and Ed Harris for being in this piece of absolutely Bush-Patriot-I'm An Amurrican Hero riddled crap. From Nicholas Cage I would never expect more, he is one of the world's lousiest actors anyway... I mean, have you ever wondered how come a piece of firewood seems to have more emotional range and depth? No spoilers here, none needed. This movie should be avoided at all costs, except if you are trapped on an airplane or possibly in prison or some other confined space with no other choice available to you... In my case, I was held hostage by a German woman I know and forced to see the dubbed version of this piece of utter detritus. I can tell you, dear reader, that having only shortly before-hand been subjected to the sheer agony that is Alvin and the Chipmunks by my nieces, 12 and 8, on a visit to the U.S. over Christmas, that piece of sheer crap was a million times better and ultimately more deserving of every prize that could be thrown at it than National Treasure: The Book of Secrets, especially if you see it dubbed in German. There is no greater ""treat"" (other than possibly being forced to eat dog excrement for dinner?) than hearing lines which must have been unbearably bad in English come out of the single-emotion, no-talent lips of Nick Cage as Ben Gates. And I pity poor Riley Poole for having accepted a terrible role as sidekick to an idiot in this ultimately boring, totally predictable piece of rotgut which plays to all that patriotic crap which has been rammed down the throats of Americans (and thus the world) since the 9/11 attacks on New York in the name of ""patriotism"" by the fascist Bush regime.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,"Following on from the original 2004 adventure, we discover that ""Mitch"" (Ed Harris) is now alleging that Nicolas Cage's ""Gates"" family were embroiled in the assassination of US President Abraham Lincoln - and he claims to have proof from a diary by none other than John Wilkes Booth himself! It seems that in order to disprove these scurrilous rumours, he must galvanise his now estranged wife ""Abigail"" (Diane Kruger) and partner ""Riley"" (Justin Bartha) to track down a legendary city of gold. Surely it doesn't exist? Well there might just be a clue in the President's ""Book of Secrets"" - but he doesn't even know if that exists - and to find out, well he's going to have to get face to face with the President before embarking on a trip that will take him to Paris and then to the Queen's private study in Buckingham Palace before asking his dad (Jon Voight) and academic mum (Dame Helen Mirren) to chip in to help them rescue the family's reputation. Oh, and yes - menacing ""Mitch"" is hot on his trail, determined to use ""Ben"" to do all of the heavy lifting whilst he hopes to sneak in and claim the treasure for himself! It's very similar to the first film in style and pace, but the story is not so good and the quirkiness of the adventure struggles to stay as entertaining. There's a little too much familial dysfunction from both couples and the hapless ""Riley"" is much less engaging here, too.

"Fun sequel, but the first movie is better.","I do enjoyed this sequel throughout. The opening does a pretty good job on setting up the mystery over what are they looking for and is clearing one of their ancestor claims by someone. I do like the clues they find throughout the movie over the mystery they are looking for and is interesting to learn about it. But the movie feels like a rehash of the characters going to random places and finding clues while the villains is following them around. It gets pretty predictable throughout and goes through the same stuff like the first movie. But there are some new character development towards the main character father which is interesting and give some depth towards him. I found most of the returning character to lack any new development towards them. Even the new characters aren't that memorable in the sequel.

I'm glad that I went to see ""Book of Secrets"" at the $2. theater 'cause if I had paid $8. full price, or even $4.50 for a DVD rental, I'd have been VERY unhappy. The plot is terrible and poorly executed. The performances seems stilted and strained, with the actors pretty much walking through their roles. This is particularly frustrating since the film has some of my favorite actors in it. Ed Harris' formidable talents, in particular, sadly, are wasted. There are quite a few extremely implausible scenes, and I KNOW it's just a MOVIE but they made me shake my head in disheartened disbelief. I'm not sure that I can even recommend this as a decent rental it's just that disappointing.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A pathetic attempt at an action-adventure movie,"I actually registered on IMDb specifically to comment on this pathetic attempt at movie-making. What's the best thing about this film? That it's over! I NEVER walked out on movies, but this was one of the few cases I was about to. Is 2 out of 10 a drastic grade? Nope. This film features: a) Very poor acting, unbelievable and pathetic b) A sorry excuse of a conspiracy theory -- you have templars and everything else that goes along. But this film is so very much not the Da Vinci Code... c) '80's adventure film banal clichés -- it's meant to be Indiana Jones-like and fails utterly, the film overuses clichés that were trite even back in the 1980's d) The dramatic US patriotism moments are simply as retro and so... blah :) e) Plot is chaotic and predictable like sunset. Given that this is a Disney film I suppose they should specifically have mentioned that it's 18-Do yourself a favor and DON'T waste your time and money. If you decide to watch it anyway, please wait for the DVD release (dunno if it's out yet) and rent it -- do yourself this favor at least. That's probably the last film featuring Cage I had seen -- apparently he's now signing up for mediocre productions only.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Entertaining But Essentially the Same as the Original -- Lots of Artifacts, Clues and Car Chases","The treasure hunters are at it again, except this time the reason for accessing an ancient lost treasure of gold is not for it's monetary value, which seems downright Un-American. It is to exonerate a recent injustice in which an ancestor of Nicholas Cage is wrongfully determined to have been involved with the assassination of President Lincoln in 1865. So now Cage has to get a treasure to clear his family! Even though this treasure is probably worth 100 Billion dollars, that's not the point!Overall, it is almost exactly the same idea as the first movie, except it's a different treasure with different clues and different artifacts, but rings a little bit like deja-vu all over again. Despite some of the absolutely preposterous tasks, such as breaking into Buckingham Palace in London and later the Oval Office in Washington DC, not to mention kidnapping the President of the United States(!), it still has its entertainment value, sort of a cross between Indiana Jones, the Da Vinci Code and the Hardy Boys.This movie has all the elements of the original. The discovery of secret documents and artifacts. Deciphering codes from monuments and arcane objects, some from various parts of the world. Sneaking into the highest-security areas of the Western World. And between all these episodes are the usual car chases and other catastrophes that continually threaten our merry band of heroes from obtaining their treasure. And of course there is the adversarial band of baddies after the same treasure, this time headed by Ed Harris. It's all here.Because the car chases and catastrophes are repeated so similarly to the first movie, I wonder if they were really needed. I would have liked to hear more about the artifacts themselves, their origins, and their significance. I think I would have found the story more compelling if this modern-day Indiana Jones shtick could have done more with the history and mystery and less with the car chases. Still acceptably entertaining and at least you won't feel like you want your two hours back, let alone your ten bucks. But don't expect any twists or turns that didn't already occur in the first movie. And the intellectual aspects are kept to a minimum so as not to offend any of the adolescent movie-going public.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The good news and the bad...,"Always starting with the bad news... It is well within the shadow of its predecessor, and it doesn't have the thrill and magic the first movie displayed. Ben Gates's father seems to be played like a bumbling old man, which is confusing when he was previously played as a strong, proud character in the first movie. And what was it with the British accents, why were they sounding like they were just off the set of Oliver Twist! Very few of us Brits talk like that.The good news is... A sufficient amount of interesting conspiracy theories, puzzles and treasure make the mouth water, but it does get a little dry during the over played car chasing and action scenes. A nice amount of humour stops your mind from straying and the hints of a third movie really makes you want to know more.On a separate note, doesn't Nick Cage look old?...",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Guilty Pleasure,"http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/I wanted to hate this movie, I truly did. I put it on hoping to be subject to a big budget piece of crap that I could tear to shreds. Nick Cage is a guy that makes himself easy to hate: loud, obnoxious, hammy, bad hair plugs and a career thanks to nepotism. But on the flip side, he's been in some great films and was hard not to love in those roles: Vampire's Kiss, Rumblefish, Birdy, Wild at Heart and guilty pleasures Face Off and The Rock. Even recently he's done some respectable work: The Weatherman and Lord of War. But before I get completely off track, I just finished watching National Treasure: Book of Secrets ...and, reluctantly, I liked it.Don't get me wrong, this isn't a great movie, but when you've got three academy award winners (Cage, Jon Voight, Helen Mirren) along with Harvey Keitel, Ed Harris and Bruce Greenberg, you can't help but at least consider it a great popcorn movie. OK, name recognition aside, Ed Harris is not worth mentioning here since he mails in a lazy performance where it seems the director (notorious hack John Turteltaub) kept forgetting to remind Harris he started the movie speaking with a faux southern drawl.Overall, NT is a hybrid of Indiana Jones and The DaVinci Code, so much so you can imagine exactly how the pitch went down in some studio execs office. What makes this movie work are many of the same things that made Indy and DaVinci work: pseudo-historical facts, conspiracy theories, puzzles, riddles, suspenseful life or death consequences in secret chambers and a mother lode at the end of the exhaustive trail.No this isn't high art. No this film is barely worth the effort I'm putting forth to write about it. This movie was fun: it invited me to participate in the puzzle solving, it revisited some interesting historical periods and it whet my appetite for some fascinating, clandestine conspiratorial details. At worst, this movie is a lazy parents excuse to educate kids with what would otherwise be found in boring history textbooks. What else would you expect from Disney?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Formulaic but Fun,"How this film has not gotten a sequel is absurd to me. Though it is a bit formulaic and does not stray far from the structure of the first film, I still enjoyed National Treasure: Book of Secrets.The driving force was interesting, the climax was arguably better than the first film and I am dying to see what is on page 47. I left the film pleasantly surprised, though I wish there were some more creative risks taken.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very entertaining,"OK, to be frank, a lot of the plot may not really make sense, and for the most part, the treasure hunt seems like a bit too smooth a ride for Ben Gates.Yet, for the whole two hours I found myself extremely well entertained. The story is constantly driven forward, and there are no dead moments in the movie. Certainly not a cinematic masterpiece, but I think it's on the same level as an Indie Jones movie. Its purpose is to entertain with action, wit and ""historial facts"" that one might wish were true (but of course aren't). And that's what it does. It entertains, and as such, it's definitely fulfilling its promise.I enjoyed it, and Nicolas Cage is well cast as the treasure hunter, while John Voight's and Helen Mirren's appearance is refreshing and makes the movie all the more fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good,"Right from the opening scene I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed. The action, special effects, acting, comedy and romance were all better than the original, in my opinion. The plot was a little confusing, but all in all it was an extremely fun and enjoyable movie. I actually found myself watching it four times in a row. I probably could have watched it 24 hours straight, but I didn't want to ruin it right away, you know? This cast interacts with absolute precision, whether walking around a room or interrupting each others' wisecracks. The script and direction meld into a strong movie. What's best is that not one character ever withdraws tongue from cheek. I give it a final rating of 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A decent movie.......when you don't have to pay $11 to see it.,"I didn't see the first one, but I have a great idea of went down. The profits made from the first movie went towards keeping Harvey Keitel in the movie, getting Helen Mirren to appear, and whatever was left over was used to pay for the villain, and they only had enough to afford Ed Harris. As part of her deal, Helen Mirren probably managed to get the producers the Buckingham Palace set from ""The Queen"" while the actor who played the President probably brought with him the Oval Office set from ""13 Days"", in which he also played a President, though not a fictional one (he was Kennedy in 13 days). The characterization is well done and Cage, Voight, and the rest do great jobs portraying their nuanced characters, and the plot is a lengthy and intricate ordeal but it's simply a bit too ridiculous. The movie isn't terrible, but is often contrived, clichéd, and painful to watch. The light-hearted attempts at humour were terrifyingly weak. In one scene Nicholas Cage and his sidekick are trying to find a hidden code on the Paris Statue of Liberty when suddenly two Parisian Gendarmarie(police) accost them. Cage then proceeds to distract them by putting on a cliché French accent and talking about how he knows who Montesquieu was. Suddenly, the police are so overtaken by Cage's knowledge of the French philosopher's existence that they decide to let him carry on and even help translate the clue they eventually discover. I learned about Montesquieu in 8th grade history, so based on the logic of this movie I know more than enough about philosophers (especially after taking that stupid Baruch Intro to Philosophy class) to get out of DWI or even murder in any country in Europe. The movie is good if you have nothing, and quite literally nothing, to do. If you enjoy watching Ed Harris shift in and out of his cliché Southern accent and utter stilted lines like ""please excuse me for the lateness of the hour,"" (is that supposed to be a gentlemanly, Southern way of apologizing for showing up after 11:30?) then by all means go for it. Otherwise wait for a rainy day when it comes on cable.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The first was better,My expectations were met. It starts slow with some long unnecessary dialogs but then the uncomplicated story began to turn mysterious with puzzles to solve. Sometimes I felt being back in the time of the last 19th century of the American history. The spy part was definitely predictable until the end but the special effects and action scenes were therefore realistic and well executed. The actors delivered a solid performance and especially Helene Mirror was interesting to see after her outstanding role in CALENDAR GIRL. I can recommend this adventure movie to all fans of this genre but also for families. Don't miss the first NATIONAL TREASURE that was better than the second. Final vote: 6/10.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It Had A Lot To Live Up To...,"So, not such a great sequel. It did have a lot to live up to. And though it's not too dead it definitely doesn't have as much life or action as the original.This could be down to the change in the writers, with only the Wibberleys staying on from the original. However, even the direction doesn't quite hit the right spots.Even though the story has Ben Gates, Cage, in more personal dilemmas than the first story, I just couldn't get behind the tale or the character this time. Time has ticked by and the future has seen some changes in Gates' life. His sidekick Riley, Bartha, is living the good life on his one per cent. He has broken up with Abigail, Kruger, and she is now seeing new people. Then evidence comes to light asserting that one of his ancestors killed Abraham Lincoln. So he resolves to get the gang back together and solve this new mystery.Unfortunately, the story isn't as well thought through and comes across a tad humdrum. Another undoing was the characters. These are not as distinct and complete as they were. The interactions between them appear forced, at times, and a little insipid. They feel as though they're there to move the story forward and not to add substance to the film. Even though the story calls for Ben and Abigail to rekindle their affections, their obvious chemistry from the first film is gone. Most of the time, there is an awkwardness between the two. In truth, all the wonderful transactions between the characters have taken a critical hit. Only Ben and his dad Patrick, Jon Voight, still have a semblance of the relationship they shared in the first story.This leaves it up to Jon Turtletaub to save the film. This he does, though he doesn't reach the heights of the original. His main impediment is the end action sequence. Up to this point, there's been very little action. Then when we get to the great finale it's not that great. It's too crowded and frantic making it difficult to completely follow what's happening. This makes it less exciting to watch. Then when they get to the tipping balance you begin to think, WTF! It smacks of the writers and the director trying too hard to be cool.The cast, as in the original, do a pretty decent job with the story and direction they are given. That is, except for Ed Harris. I have never been a big Ed Harris fan and this film shows why perfectly. A bad guy needs a persona, something the audience can boo or at least feel some satisfaction when they lose. Mitch Wilkinson has no persona whatsoever. In fact, the guy is so dull and tedious that when he makes his first appearance at Gates' presentation I'm amazed anybody notices him. He has the ""Wha... wha... wha..."" of Charlie Brown's teacher. This character needed an actor with screen presence.Because the original film is so good I would not recommend you watch this film. It will be a letdown. Instead, do yourself a favour and watch the original again. If you've not watched the original yet then forget this one and get a copy of the first film, sit back, and enjoy that one.Feel free to traverse over to my The Game Is Afoot and Holding Out For A Hero lists to see where I've charted this less than enthralling sequel.

Ed Harris did an amazing job, and so did the rest of the original cast.

It implicates treasure hunter Ben Gates' ancestor of being the mastermind Abe Lincoln's assassination.

National Treasure: Book of Secrets: Nicolas Cage's unclassified disappointment,"It's a Gates' Family party, world-wide trip, and if you are very wise, you will skip this junket. Sequels are supposed to be a bridge between films, not worthless, empty, waste of time, and money, effortless grinders. This second film has more in common with a salt-water game fish, caught on a hook on the end of a line, before it jumps into vision because it flounders, just below the surface. The opening 20 minutes of this film, holds a great deal of excitement and promise but that falls flat, for a movie played for laughs, rather than intrigue and true detective work. This film lead the countries top box office take for two weeks running, only on the fame of National Treasure 1. There is nothing to get excited about, nor is there any anticipation of ""the chase!"" as there was in the first film. Director Jon Turteltaub may take the blame for this really terrible film, only because he accepted the position as Director. The actors played their parts well enough but to make a great film, one has to have a great script. National Treasure 2 died from a lack of a good screenplay! If there is a National Treasure 3 sequel, hopefully those in Hollywood will put their combined heads together and write a great screenplay before anyone says, ""Action!""",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Anyone for another round of Clue - American History edition?,"My Take: Goofy and implausible, but entertaining nonetheless.Imagine finding out that your great grandfather was a part of an infamous assassination of a famous American President, because some guy claims to have found long lost evidence to prove. Now imagine anyone would still give a damn about this and you got the whole plot of NATIONAL TREASURE: BOOK OF SECRETS. It's not very different from the original NATIONAL TREASURE, also silly, which wasn't really different from so many other quest/treasure hunt movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE and Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE and maybe, say, a puzzle book for kids. It's all pretty goofy, with a plot that doesn't just border on ludicrous, but just plain ridiculous. It uses centuries of American history as plot devices and twists. Goofy fun, but fun nonetheless.Like the original NATIONAL TREASURE, you should take it for what it is and it's actually a pretty good ride, but a bumpy one to be sure. Nicolas Cage, who still sports that goof hairdo from NEXT that makes Tom Hanks' mullet in THE DA VINCI CODE look ""in"", is back as archeology know-all Ben Gates who is forced to search for more hidden treasure buried beneath American history just to clear out hi family name, dented by the possible fact that his great grandfather could be an accomplice in the Lincoln assassination. Once again, Gates and the gang, his girlfriend Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) and buddy Riley (Justin Bartha), must decipher a series of hidden clues, use his history know-all to crack open the history-old secret. And I thought the ending for THE DA VINCI CODE was silly!So with all this case-cracking, riddle-solving or what not have to do with the titular Book of Secrets? Well, it's the book where all the government's secrets are written in and could possibly lead them closer to where ""X"" marks the spot. It's really a McGuffin of course, which is just an excuse for Cage and co. to fool around in Buckingham Palace, The White House and eventually in Mt. Rushmore. Ridiculous really, but in this case I can forgive the overall ridiculousness of the piece and just went along for the ride. In the film is aided by a strong supporting cast, which includes Ed Harris as the mysterious baddie who uncovers the missing page of John Wilkes Booth's diary and John Voight and (what do ya' know!) Helen Mirren as Ben's parents. Cage is still in his goofy, over-the-top form, but the case of NATIONAL TREASURE movies, his performance just feels right at home with all the nonsense in display. So, yeah, NATIONAL TREASURE: BOOK OF SECRETS is a pretty silly movie, an empty-headed affair that requires you to suspend your disbelief as far as you can.Rating: *** out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"If You've Made It Through Fifth Grade, This Movie May Insult Your Intelligence","I don't know if any big budget hit movie will be ever be as dumb as ""Independence Day,"" but this movie gives it a run for the money. This is so stupid, such an insult to anyone who has passed fifth grade or more, I gave up on it after an hour.When a guy and his ex-wife are able to go into the Oval Office of the President of the United States without any problem, rifle through the President's desk without the bimbo-White House aide in the room hearing him, and then later kidnap the President with the just the aid of his elderly father.....that was enough for me. I actually didn't make it through the kidnapping. The desk scene was enough to convince me that being annoyed for another 50 minutes with the ludicrously-stupid story wasn't worth the aggravation.I thought the original ""National Treasure"" was kind of dumb, too, but this sequel is beyond that. It isn't just the White House baloney; it's the dumb dialog throughout with the typical Disney humor which means bickering spouses and enough political correctness you make you barf in your box of popcorn.Yes, it's not boring and if you're a moron who believes anything, especially outrageous conspiracy theories which make no sense and are not factual in the least, you might find this entertaining enough to watch all two hours.

"Despite lunacy of plot, entertaining movie...","1st watched 1/20/2008 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Jon Turtletaub): Despite lunacy of plot, entertaining movie. In the follow-up to the 1st 'National Treasure"" where Nicholas Cage and the gang try to uncover hidden secrets in U.S. landmarks looking for a treasure hidden from the British soldiers during the civil war --- a twist is thrown in right from the beginning where the Gates family of treasure-hunters names could be darkened forever by a rumor that an ancestor was part in the assassination of Lincoln. This put Cage and company back on the trail of the treasure to prove that it's real and there is no truth to the rumor. Of course, there is an antagonist other treasure hunter, played by Ed Harris, portraying an ancestor of John Wilkes Boothe who wants his rumor kept in place to free up his family's evil past. This begins the ever increasingly complicated series of clues leading eventually to a literal goldmine(hint, hint). Of course, Mr. Gates has the same companions as the first movie with added ones, like his Mom, played by the Queen portrayer, Helen Mirren, who can read ancient lost Indian symbols and is sought after once an artifact is found leading to more answers. The bottom line is this movie is overblown, idiotic, non-sensical Hollywood-fare but has a sense of humor and a pace that gets increasingly harder to turn from and makes it a watchable and entertaining movie. One of the highest forms of escapist entertainment because of it's absurdity but if that's what you're looking for it's perfect. There are also some wonderful sets and puzzles that have to be solved as the movie goes on that reveals a very well-thought out and executed thriller to enchant and entertain the masses.

A Spirited And Precise film,"For Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage), history isn't just a dry record of what's occurred in a distant and half-forgotten past... for him, history is alive, vital, and occasionally it offers the possibility of finding extraordinary treasures. After his astonishing discovery of the riches of the Templar Knights, Ben has become the world's most famous treasure hunter... although he prefers the term ""treasure protector."" Ben and his father, university professor Patrick Gates (Jon Voight), are shaken by the discovery of one of the long-lost pages from the diary of Lincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth. The diary was found on Booth's body when he was killed; however, several pages had been torn from the diary and have never been found... until now. Surprisingly, the information on this page seems to implicate their ancestor Thomas Gates as a co-conspirator in the assassination of President Lincoln.Ben must work with his now ex-girlfriend, American history archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), and his tech-wiz partner, Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), in a globe-trotting adventure which dangerously criss-crosses the inner sanctums of Washington, D.C., Paris, London and the American heartland.As Ben, Patrick, Abigail and Riley meticulously unravel clues which threaten to turn history, and their lives, completely upside down, their search for historical truth widens into a hunt for perhaps the most mysterious and highly guarded book on earth and, from that, to a famed mythological treasure. Much to Patrick's consternation, Ben calls upon a secret weapon -- his formidable mother and Patrick's ex-wife, linguistics professor Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren), who hasn't spoken to Patrick in 32 years. She is soon caught up in the intrigue, but the team is not alone in its pursuit. The man who brought the lost page to Ben's attention, Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris), has his own family history to uncover. But his ambitions are less noble than merely discovering treasure, putting him on a deadly collision course with the others in a desperate effort to uncover the secrets that lie beneath the half-burnt diary page from America's past.

"Naff as hell, but its so entertaining!","The National Treasure are summed up in two words, guilty pleasure. On first look the two movies are nothing more than cheesy, over the top nonsense, The Da Vinci Code for morons if you will. However, when you actually sit and watch these films I can almost guarantee you'll smile, you'll be entertained, and most importantly you won't regret spending two hours watching the film. I really enjoyed the first movie, and so when a second movie was announced was looking forward to it. I left the first film smiling like a buffoon, today I did exactly the same thing. Sure I had lots of criticisms in my head, the plot for example does not entirely make sense, but the action and puzzle solving are just so ridiculously infectious you get caught up in the film. The performances are also quite lively and engrossing, Nicolas Cage is clearly enjoying himself once again and Dame Helen Mirren makes a welcome addition to the cast. Sure if you look deep enough you'll get irritated by the nonsensical plot, the ease that Gates manages to break into Buckingham Palace and the puzzles they have to solve. But if you are one of those people, a regular cinema goer in other words, who can just sit back, relax and prepare yourself to be entertained, then you will find much to enjoy in National Treasure: Book of Secrets.Okay let me return to the performances then. Nicolas Cage is fast re-earning my respect. At one point I would quite happily see him give up acting, The Wicker Man remake just left me mortified. But thanks to Next, which like this is naff but fun, and now National Treasure 2, Cage seems to be on top form. Sure he's not going to win Oscars, and he is starting to look a bit past his best, but he has an infectious enthusiasm about him. Just watch the scene in Buckingham Palace where he gives the English accent a bad name, its a cheesy scene, but its fun because of Cage. He also has great chemistry with the majority of the cast as well. Diane Kruger unfortunately lets the side down a bit, she's a lot better than she was in the original movie, but she is still a very bland actress and I don't think the movie really suits her anyway. Justin Bartha as Riley doesn't feel as fun this time around, but he does have some amusing lines, and thankfully that awful ""death and despair"" line from the trailer was cut. Jon Voight makes a return appearance and he has more to do this time around, sure he looks old nowadays, but he does a decent job. Helen Mirren is a nice addition to the cast, her accent is a bit bizarre, but she has some fun scenes with Voight and its nice to see her get stuck into the action near the end. Unfortunately Ed Harris is a bit wasted as the main villain, he has little to do apart from sneer and seem nasty, he has a good bit near the end, but apart from that there might as well not be a villain.National Treasure, like Pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones before, is a nice blend of humour and action. The movie succeeds greatly in gently entertaining the viewer. Of course National Treasure isn't the new Indiana Jones, but it is a very entertaining film. The action sequences are executed in typical Bruckheimer manner, the chase through London is particularly thrilling, and the final half hour is superb, you'll sit on the edge of your seat throughout it. The humour also works quite well, although some of Riley's lines are extremely hit and miss. alas where National Treasure falls apart is the storyline. The Book of Secrets mentioned in the title is seemingly irrelevant, it shows up once and doesn't really have a major impact on the storyline. Instead the majority of the film is a series of small puzzles leading to the next one, how this actually proves that the great grandfather of Gates didn't plan the murder of Lincoln is beyond me. The movie just seems incredible stupid, if you can ignore this fact then it doesn't really matter, I ignored it for the majority of the film, but there were the occasional times I thought the movie had gone a bit too far.Overall National Treasure: Book of Secrets is a great sequel to the original movie, whether or not it is better than the original is still debatable, I'll have to watch it again to make my mind up. If you go looking for the next Indiana Jones then prepare to be disappointed, wait for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull instead, if you want a dumb film where you can switch off and still be entertained then go see National Treasure 2, there are much worse films around.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dora the Explorer called and she has some suggestions for #3,"It's been a very long time since I saw the below average original, and I have been craving a good and fun adventure. Obviously, I was thinking they stepped up the game to the surprise hit, first movie, but, alas, 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' was a lot worse. Every time I wanted to like this silly, SILLY movie, my mouth kept dropping and it simply got more preposterous. And I'm not just referring to the plot. They made a dumbed-down kid version of 'Indiana Jones' and yes, even younger than 'Young Indiana Jones,' so you really have to be prepared for the simplest versions of espionage, dialogue okay for a preschool play and a storyline even Dora the Explorer would turn her nose at. Sadly, it's not a standalone movie; they expected you to remember every character and relationship from the first one as they give almost zero background. This was a problem for me since it's been years since I saw #1. That said, apparently Benny (played by Cage – who now ranks as one of the worst actors of all time, his one shinning grace was 'Leaving Las Vegas' and I think he should have left Hollywood as well) is upset because his great-great-whatever relative might have been involved in the assassination of President Lincoln and Benny will stop at nothing to clear his name! Including kidnapping the President! A very forgiving President, of course. ""Oh, well, if you're trying to clear a dead man's name, I can see why it's justified in committing a felony."" I'm really looking in too deep into this globetrotting and predictable ""adventure,"" but I was disappointed in that you don't have to G-rate down all the gags, acting, dialogue and sooo-secret twists to have a great movie (see: Indy 1 & 3.)",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Fun for What It's Worth,"Just as the first ""National Treasure"", if you are able to escape reality and simply enjoy the adventure for what its worth, then ""National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets"" should provide a family's worth of entertainment. There are a couple of parts of the film that fell like you are playing a pretty awesome action-packed video game in a world where the cops never catch you and the treasure holders of the past were able to rig traps of preposterous proportions. Having said that, however, the film does carry a strong plot surrounding both the search for the lost city of Cebola, ancient City of Gold, and in the process, attempt to clear the legacy of Bejamin Gates' (Nicolas Cage) great-grandfather and Patrick Gates' (Jon Voight) grandfather.As a sub-plot, tensions are high between both Benjamin and Abigail (Diane Kruger) whose marriage has apparently come apart between the first film and this, and Patrick and Professor Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren), Benjamin's mother and Patrick's work-a-holic ex-wife. Justin Bartha delivers the best performance as Riley Poole, just as he did in the first. While the dialogue and development of all of the characters in the film is somewhat on par with the first, it was the character of Mitch Wilkenson (Ed Harris) that may keep you sour. It was as if the writers of this movie felt that there needed to be a quintessential 'bad guy' who was after Benjamin. Wilkenson is portrayed as an evil mastermind out to use Ben for his unique puzzle-breaking skills to eventually capture the same treasure sought after by Ben, sound familiar? Overall, the film does leave the viewer entertained, however, and that can be the only true determination as to the quality of an action-adventure film produced by Disney.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Though often implausible, 'Book of Secrets' is a gloriously exciting show","Though often implausible, Turteltaub's sequel to his 2004 box office smash is a gloriously amusing show, lush wish creativity and heaps of excitement. It rings many of the same bells that National Treasure did, which it seems to be okay with, yet the hunt it proceeds to take its viewer's on is a much grander one, which, essentially, makes it feel more important.Ben Gates' great-great grandfather is implicated as a conspirator in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln following the turn-up of Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris), a descendant of an under-appreciated historical figure, who makes the claim and supports it with a missing page to John Wilkes Booth's diary. Ben and his National Treasure companions (Diane Kruger, Justin Bartha and Jon Voight) collaborate with Ben's mother, a University professor (played by 2006 Oscar-winner Helen Mirren), to prove the innocence of Thomas Gates, and, in the meantime, unearth Cibola, the legendary City of Gold.Book of Secrets surpasses its predecessor with more thrills and even more high-caliber Hollywood names, and is, at times, blissfully reminiscent of Spielberg's classic (and far superior) Indiana Jones series. It's perhaps the most thrilling Disney release since The Curse of the Black Pearl, and it's certainly a wonderful experience that can be shared with people of all ages, and family, too.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"The words that come to mind is ""Cash Cow""","Alright so I'm not a big fan of the first NT movie but I still rated it 6 out of 10 back then. I did this because the ""hunt"" in that movie was entertaining with a few glimpse or originality here and there which made parts of it interesting.The problem is, NT was already built on a borrowed concept, standing on the shoulders of The DaVinci Code it knew it had an audience and admirably tried to include more action and free it from religion. Voila, you got National Treasure.Now you got a hit on your hands and you know you have to milk it and it better be fast because it wasn't THAT big of a hit, people might not remember it in say, 4 years. I then imagine you split up the workload for the script of the movie like this: 1 guy thinks of funny clues, 1 guy thinks of some extra background story for the characters and the dialogue they have George Lucas write, because let's face it, he's cheap.Finally you put all 3 into the same Word document and you send it straight to production because damn it, it's milking time. The director probably asks for a few re-writes before the studio says ""that's it, go with it"". I'm not sure if he tries to salvage the script in any way because as it's apparent to us, the acting in this movie is non-existing. Finally the thing get's edited and every scene gets as much dialogue and story cut out because of how awful it is.Seriously, those of you saying Jon Voigt or Helen Mirren do a good job in this movie, come on. They are both known as serious good actors and that's why people try to justify parts of this movie by accentuating them but the truth is they showed up, slept through it and got paid. Yes, it's that kind of movie! This movie relies on people liking half-asses put together ""puzzles"" and even more so on hard cut in editing. I am not surprised another one is in the making at all but with this on being based on such a thin story I can't see how the 3rd one can avoid complete disaster. Ow don't worry it will still make money.4 out 10 because it wasn't a total waste of time but really close to it, mind you.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I liked it as much as its prequel,"Most movie sequels aren't as good as its prequel. My original expectations for a sequel to National Treasure were not very high. To my surprise, National Treasure: Book of Secrets was every as good as the first one.The all-star cast returns as the lovable and heroic characters. Nicholas Cage is back as the determined treasure hunter Benjamin Gates. Justin Bartha is Cage's sidekick as the amusing and comical computer geek Riley and Diane Kruger is the attractive, but estranged Abigail Chase. The rest of the supporting cast was also a nice addition to the film, including: Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, Ed Harris, Bruce Greenwood, and Helen Mirren.Like the original one, there are great car chases and suspenseful journeys into the location of the new treasure. It was a great popcorn loving film; however, like the first one, the story was unbelievable and unrealistic. It was interesting, but I couldn't help but find it all silly. Nonetheless, I liked the two hour diversion. I can now see these movies as the modern-day generation of the next Indiana Jones'. 8/10 There's evidence at the end of this movie that there could very well be a third National Treasure.

"Let's just stop with the kiddie orientated Disney franchises, shall we?","They tagline for this film could've been 'National Treasure 2  This time it's personal' considering it revolves around the Gates family named being accused of a dark history. But then again, they must've realised 'National Treasure 2  This time it's personal' just sounds silly. Wait a minute, something to do with a National Treasure film deemed 'too silly'? Well, I never. Truth is, National Treasure: Book of Secrets is so bad that with about twenty minutes to go you just have to accept the garbage being churned out to you and hope it will all soon be over. The film isn't painful in the sense there is nothing to read into nor is it a disaster in the sense the film fails from scene one and doesn't let up alá Batman & Robin or Thunderbirds but it still grates and grates in its own way.In fact with the National Treasure films, I am quickly developing another natural hatred of a Disney franchise; a hatred that began in the Summer of 2006 when I saw the first Pirates of the Caribbean film and quickly cottoned onto the masses of followers who just seem too brainwashed by the actors, pacing and 'fun' the films offer to even notice how crap it was. Then there was this, National Treasure: Book of Secrets. Nicolas Cage is back as Ben Gates but as I said, this time it's personal because his family name has been shamed and accused as a conspirer to President Lincoln's death. His adventure to clear the name and to find the truth will see him travel to the Oval Office in the White House; the Queen's desk in Buckingham Palace and it will see him meet and greet the current American President in search for what separates fact from fiction. I can only guess that these scenes are supposed to act as some sort of dramatic series of events in location's we very rarely see in films. I can say that not only are they unspectacular but they are also contrived and anticlimactic  you mean to tell me that in the Queen of England's desk there was a secret code hidden all this time? What about the President's desk? There was something in there the entire time and nobody found it? Suspending disbelief has never been so necessary.But along this time to help him is his old buddy Riley (Bartha) and his girlfriend Abigail (Kruger); both characters serve their silly purpose as they did in the first film. Riley is un-funny comic relief (people keep mistaking him for Gates and he cannot sell his book. Also, his car is towed  how hilarious) and Abigail is the pretty to look at, innocent, 'Eurotrash' girl who does what she's supposed to do and says what she's supposed to say while kissing and 'exposing' herself at timed intervals when she has to. But it's not just these two that are along for the ride because this time, Ben has brought the folks. John Voight is back as the father in an attempt to try and resurrect a career that had flagged since Mission: Impossible and Helen Mirren is the Brit typically cast as the intellectual of the bunch, playing Ben's mother. A big problem with these characters is that they do not exist to be developed; they exist for mere comic relief that is never funny. Emily (Mirren) and Patrick's (Voight) bickering runs parallel with Ben and Abigail's falling out and it is the common-denominator in treasure hunting that threatens to bring them all back together again as a happy family.So the adventure sees them propelled through Paris complete with funny looking French policemen who show up on bicycles (yes, proper push bikes) and act in an oblivious manner; it sees them propelled to London during which I actually took offence to Cage's impression of an Englishman as he rolls out the accent and the clichés before outsmarting the British police who are equally inept. The journey will see them visit a White House ball during which Gates will succeed in a ludicrous plan to get the President in a location one-on-one before the film finally has the gang getting very wet in an underground cavern accessible only by randomly pouring water on the rocks outside.The film is a failure with its narrative that is loose and uneven and its characters that exist to meekly attempt to make us laugh. An example of the loose plotting is evident in the element of the book. It is a book that only the president knows of and yet the idea to look for this book is spawned from Riley's novel. How does Riley know of the book in the first place if it's only passed on from President to President? The domestic situation between Ben's parents is silly and unneeded and the payoff to their relationship is equally anti-climatic. Ed Harris lacks any sort of charisma or menace to play a good villain in this film and his scenes just while away into acts of nothingness. The films wants to think that Abigail kissing the white house official in the Oval Office just as Ben finds what he needs is 'funny' and the characters in general rely too much on technology to see them home; scenes like the button that 'pops the trunk' and the overuse of computers and phones are examples. The product placement of Fullers London Pride, Mercedes Benz and especially Apple Computers is shameful as is the feeling you'll get at the end of the film when you realise you just sat through it.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An entertaining and decent sequel,"National Treasure 2 was not on my must-watch list but I watched it after I enjoyed 1st part.

The Fun Of The Original Turns To Silliness In The Sequel,"The original ""National Treasure"" was fast-paced and fun all the way through. Like many sequels, ""Book of Secrets"" lost some of the magic that deemed it worthy to spawn a sequel in the first place. This film wasn't as well paced as the original (actually, by the time the lost city was finally found my attention had wandered so many times that I had trouble piecing together the steps that had brought them there!) The basic plot, revolving around the search for this lost city of gold that led from Washington to France to England to South Dakota, wasn't as compelling as the original, either, and to be honest fell on what I considered to be the extremely silly side, the chief silliness being perhaps the account of Gates kidnapping the president to have him help in the treasure hunt.As for the performances, Nicolas Cage was once again fine as the head treasure hunter Ben Gates, but some of the spark between him and Diane Kruger (again playing Abigail) seemed missing.Justin Bartha added comic relief as Ben's sidekick Riley, as did Jon Voigt as his dad. Helen Mirren and Ed Harris rounded out the cast, as Ben's mom and chief nemesis respectively, and handled their parts well enough.Basically, I'd characterize this as an average movie with some good action scenes saddled with a plot of limited substance. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Pointless, boring sequel that's pretty much a waste of everybody's time","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningBen Gates (Nicolas Cage) and his father Patrick (Jon Voight) continue to teach the history of American forefathers. But one day a general by the name of Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) calls the good name of Ben's grand-father into question, claiming he was in on Lincoln's assassination. Unable to accept such a slant on his grandad's name, Ben sets out to find the three pieces of a piece of paper that will prove his innocence. His quest takes him to three corners of the globe, including his native America, France and London. Along the way, Patrick is forced to reconcile with Ben's mother Emily (Helen Mirren) and Ben must reconcile with his love interest from the previous film Abigail (Diane Kruger) as well as his friend Riley (Justin Bertha) all whilst being pursued by FBI Agent Sadusky (Harvey Keitel.) It all builds up to an 'explosive' finale where Ben must kidnap the president (Bruce Greenwood.)Critics have been pretty unanimous with their condemnation of this unnecessary sequel to the only marginally enjoyable 2004 film National Treasure. But this big, sloppy mess only serves to make that film look like a masterpiece.An overlong, overblown, totally boring piece, despite a slick car chase action sequence filmed in London, the weak, apathetic plot and lame script cause you to lose interest very quickly indeed, meaning before any other hot action can creep up towards the end, you've either fallen asleep or are clinging on by a thread. It says a lot that such a nifty cast list, from Cage to Keitel, all seem as bored as the audience, with no real passion for the film emerging from any of them, definitely one they all seem to have just done for the paycheque. In charge of such a sinking ship of a script, director Jon Turtletaub can only do his best to guide the awful mess in the best direction he can, which isn't very well at all.Hopefully, this will mark the end of Cage's sub par Indiana Jones impression once and for all. *",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Really Good popcorn flick,"I'm not going to give away any secrets here. I'll just talk in generalities. I thought it was pretty faithful to the original movie both in plot and charm. The first 5 minutes or so, I was thinking to myself, gosh this is starting out like Ghost busters II!. Then, it started to roll and roll it did. If you are a fan of the Indiana Jones series, it was similar to the 2nd of that franchise. It's really hard for a sequel to make the same impact as the first one, and this movie fell a little short in that all of the things that were likable in the first one were present in the second, but it wasn't new anymore. Ed Harris gives his usual solid performance, and all of the principal characters of the first movie are there in the 2nd with one or two pleasant additions. I dare to hope for National Treasure 3!!.

Not a worthy sequel -- don't bother with this one,"First of all, I really liked the first NT film. At first, I thought it was because I just had such low expectations, but I watched it again recently and it holds up very well. But, this is about the sequel. Unfortunately, I DID have high expectations for NT2, but it has none of the panache that the first movie possessed. Even in the first film, the plot stretches credulity, but in this pile of dreck, there's almost no coherent plot in the first place. They make an attempt to weave a complex plot out of some weak connections, but only succeed in producing a confusing jumble of ""puzzles"" that anyone could figure out in a few minutes. With this lack of plot line, it's no wonder that the motivations of the characters are similarly murky. Subplots are set up and toppled for no apparent reason, and the Ed Harris character is particularly schizoid, which is a shame because he's such a good supporting actor. Unfortunately, his talents were almost entirely wasted in this film. In fact, wasting excellent actors' efforts seems to be the primary purpose of NT2. Justin Bartha (Riley) is consistently witty and funny, just as he was in the first film, but he seems a little strained or forced at times in the sequel. Nicholas Cage actually improves on his performance in the first film. He's much less wooden and seems more relaxed and natural in the role of of Ben Gates. Jon Voight and Hellen Mirren are simply dynamite together and could easily pull off a sequel by themselves. Diane Kruger is as hot as ever, but even she's not enough to save this dog of a film. In fact, ALL the acting in NT2 is very good, but the result is much less than the sum of the parts. Even great acting can't save a bad script.

"National Treasure: Book of Secrets (The Good, The Not So Good, and The Really Bad)","***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***When National Treasure: Book of Secrets was near release, my two best friends were going crazy with anticipation. They loved the 1st movie, though they never really said why, just ""it was awesome"".... not very descriptive on there part. So we went to the midnight showing, and I will say my expectations weren't that high. Turns out I was right not to expect much.Lets start with the good. The best part of the whole movie was the Goofy short before the movie. Not only was everyone laughing, it really set a good mood for the rest of the film. If you didn't like the film, at least you could think about the short to make you happy. I myself want to get into animation for a career. I'm not a fan of Disney cartoons (I actually hate a lot of them), but the fact that shorts in movies are coming back really warms my heart. The last time I remember shorts in movies were the Roger Rabbit shorts, and those were great. I REALLY hope to see more stuff like this in the future from other studios.Next is the not so good. Though the treasure itself was interesting (city of gold, cool) you kinda feel like there holding information back from you. They find the city, have teams explore it, and there obviously gonna get some major historical information.... to bad you never actually get to know what that information is. They did the same thing in the last movie.We got a treasure. ""Ok, what is the treasure?"" We're not gonna tell you. ""Um... well... what do we get to know about the treasure?"" Just that it's hidden and Nic Cage has to find it. ""When they do find it, will we learn anything about it, like what it is and how it will affect our knowledge of history?"" Nope. ""Oh... what the heck?""Another thing that I didn't feel good about in this movie was the character Abigail Chase. So in the first movie, Ben spends his whole life looking for the treasure, and then finally does at the end with his 2 friends. He gets rich for finding it and buys house to live in with girlfriend. Then she dumps him and she kicks him out of HIS house? Is she a w****?Finally, the really bad.... Riley. I'm sorry, but I couldn't not find him funny. I'm actually getting sick of one liners. People have seem to forgotten that there's more then one way to tell a joke. Everything nowadays is one liners. What ever happened to really funny facial expressions, Or someone getting hurt in a really funny way? Why does every sidekick need to be a goofy smart mouth who says dumb stuff that only a small amount of people find funny but then turns out to be a genius?I'm also getting sick of people saying to just have fun with it. Well what if someone didn't think it was fun, would he have to put on a fake smile throughout the remainder of the film? Just because YOU think it was fun, doesn't mean so did everyone else.All in all, it was OK, but nothing too special. If you have nothing better to do, this is an OK rental movie.

It's still a great movie to watch, one the whole family can enjoy, but as with most hits, the sequels don't usually nail it quite the same. The ""gee whiz, I didn't know that"" about history is still there (3 Liberty Ladies?), along with the likable characters (Riley is the best sidekick, and the main reason I went), and the intelligent plot, as well the stellar performances. Yet, it came off a little flat overall. I still didn't understand Ed Harris's role as a villain. Sean Bean was a great villain, one with ingenuity and cunning. Harris seemed only functionary.

"We have another treasure hunt. But, is this movie as good as the first one? Check out my review below!","""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" (2007), the first movie was phenomenal. So, I had high hopes for this sequel. All I have to say is, wow! My expectations were met, and then some. This sequel is a rare example of one that's equally as good as the first movie. Just like ""National Treasure"" (2004), this movie has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect special effects, perfect sets/locations, and also a perfect soundtrack. The story is very creative, and I was excited, invested and there were a few laughs along the way. A good sequel is a movie that continues after the first one, with no looking back. But, it doesn't hurt to have at least some references to the first film. Sequels should be similar in layout to the first one, but still be it's own distinct story. ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" definitely hits the mark! The cast is fantastic! Nicolas Cage, Justin Bartha, Harvey Keitel, Jon Voight, Diane Kruger, and more. They all perform their roles flawlessly. There are also a couple of new characters in this film: Helen Mirren as Emily Gates, Bruce Greenwood as the President, and Ed Harris as the villain, Mitch Wilkinson. All of the brand new characters add a new layer of depth to this film. Helen Mirren is serious, yet funny, as Ben's mother, Emily. Ed Harris as Mitch Wilkinson is a great villain, and Bruce Greenwood is fantastic as the President. But, just like the first movie, Nicolas Cage steals the show! His role in the ""National Treasure"" franchise as Benjamin Gates is perfect for him. Had some other actor played the role, it would not have worked at all. This, in my opinion, along with the first movie, is Nicolas Cage's best role and performance! As for the rest of the actors and actresses, they all perform their roles perfectly and all of the actors have great chemistry. The special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. All of the sets/locations are perfect and really set the tone. Finally, the film soundtrack, composed by Trevor Rabin, is excellent! It also really helps set the tone, and brings the movie to life. ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is a fun and exciting movie watching experience. Director Jon Turteltaub, you made lightning strike twice with this sequelI can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I obviously give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you have not seen ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"", what are you waiting for? Go watch it today! I really hope that they make ""National Treasure 3"", because of the big cliffhanger at the end. We all want to know what's on page 47!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best Disney Movie???,"I remember stepping into the theater as a young lad to first watch this film and I was blown away. As always, Nicholas Cage's stellar performance steals the show. This movie made my childhood, and can only be considered a flawless gem amidst a sea of modern mediocrity.

Kill Riley Poole!,"I kind of liked the first installment of National Treasure. It was nothing more but enjoyable escapism; sort of an Indiana Jones for kids.But in this sequel it feels like we've seen it all before. For the life of me, I can't understand why they kept Riley Poole as the comic relief side kick. That character is just plain Jar-Jar-Binks-terrible. I suppose that his plethora of lines are supposed to be witty, but they just made me want to stab him in the neck with a No. 2 pencil. In all fairness, the overall dialogue sucks and blows at the same time, which I thought was a physical impossibility.But my issues with Poole aside, the main problem with this film I had with this film is that I felt it didn't have a strong enough ""hook"". Honestly, I couldn't care less if Nicolas Cage's great-grandfather (or whatever the hell it was) is accused of being complicit in a murder committed about 150 years ago, and they have to find a secret something in order to clear his name. Now I sort of understand why George Lucas said that the long gap between Indy 3 & 4 was due to the fact that they couldn't find a strong enough McGuffin around which the story revolves.I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Brilliant movie,"I've been waiting for this second part from a long time, but it was worth it. It's one of the few movies who have a very good second part. Very good script, very good acting (I like Nicholas Cage). At the end of the movie, i was really speechless. This is happening when you have a big budget, a great director, a great acting crew. Thanks to all of them and thanks to producers also. Of course, i want to see once again this movie when it will appears on DVD. And all i have to do is wait for a third part (if there it will be one). I recommend this movie to all of you. It's kinda of a new year's present from the producers.

I love Nicholas Cage but this was by far his worst performance ever,"I liked the first one, but this movie, like so many of it's contemporaries, was so lacking in artistic sensitivity that to sit through the entire thing would have been pure torture. The script was very mechanical and utilitarian. You get the sense the the movie and it's plot is just being thrown at you. There is no excitement from the actors and hardly any sort of convincing rhythm to the scenes either. What happened to the talented film makers who use to inhabit Hollywood? I think films need to start coming with a money back guarantee. How many different ways are there for me to tell you that if you have an IQ anywhere over 120, you will be bored to tears by this film? I seriously think that Cage was on vacation during the filming of this movie. And who can blame him? He's Nicholas Cage and he pretty much doesn't have to show up to work unless his heart really wants to.

Book of secrets strikes gold,"The sequel to National Treasure,this movie National Treasure:Book of Secrets was just as good if not better than the original.Nicolas Cage returns as Benjamin Gates as well as returnees in the franchise which include Jon Voight as Patrick Gates,Justin Bartha as Riley Poole,Diane Kruger as Abigail Chase but also features new cast members such as Helen Mirren,Harvey Keitel and Ed Harris.It's genre is Action/Adventure but features it's fair share of funny moments and well as being suspenseful as the original was.The plot of the film was better than the first National Treasure and it was so good,that in my view, a sequel should be made to continue the storyline.Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Tepid, Formulaic , Nonsense","I condemn this film, not because it is bad, but because it is lazy. Producers Turteltaub and Bruckheimer both have experience of big(pirates) and low budget(cool runnings) success.But here they switch to remote control, and the overwhelming feeling is of a film that was created to generate a paycheck, and no more.The film is rotten at the core, who cares whether Ben and Patrick Gates (played by Nic Cage and Jon Voight)ancestor was implicated in the murder of Abraham Lincoln? And without that the film loses all dramatic impetus. London? Black cabs, double decker red buses,Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, red post boxes...........yawn, it really is as predictable as that.The plot is preposterous, and helen Mirren looks as though she would have been better employed looking for a decent script rather than trotting out the banal dross she has to speak.The two hour running time is desperately short of both decent action and witty script, instead we have to trudge through a formula so clunky that you find yourself screaming for an on screen mechanic to give it some oil.Of course the set pieces are fine, and the stars do their bit - but no more.Avoid unless you are pretty desperate for something to do.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Though much like the first, ""Treasure"" still shines.","When I first saw National Treasure, I was blown away. With the complex puzzle solving and action violence, it was an unexpectedly refreshing movie from Disney. Such is the case of NT's sequel.Many critics complain that the storyline is almost exactly like the first film, but this is not entirely true. The film centers around finding a national treasure, but the motives, minor characters, and plot development are different. All the cast is back (except for villain Sean Bean, who's character is in prison), with the lovely additions of Ed Harris as the main villain and Oscar-winning Helen Mirren as Ben Gates' mother.Traveling from Paris to London to South Dakota, the three heroes look for clues to help clear the Gates' name of assisting in the Lincoln assassination.Overall, I thought the movie was very decent.

Well to me thats what National Treasure: Book of Secrets does. In keeping with the same actors as the 1st movie made it even better, with the addition of some new faces. What I love about both this movie and the 1st one is the blend of comedy along with the excitement, mystery and some danger, how it is put together in just the right places. It not only keeps you guessing, but also makes you laugh too. Thats important in a movie for those of us that not only like intrigue, but also like to have a reason to laugh and smile.

"Who uses books in the digital age, anyways?","Disney seems adept at creating blockbusters, but the trend continues with lack-luster sequels.After the first NT movie, I was hungry for a second... it was original, indulgent (and I suppose liberal) with history to the point that it created primordial stew for mythology. With movies like Sahara and DaVinci Code in between, things could only go up, right? The sequel? Well, they were just plain making stuff up, and reaching to make things more exotic than they needed to be.

Rather Disappointing,"Having seen the first movie, I couldn't wait to see this follow-up. What followed was sadly nowhere near as good as the first...it's certainly easy to watch without too much effort but the storyline is not only obvious but feels rushed and at points, so ridiculous it spoils the feel of the movie. The similarities between certain scenes in the first movie and this one was also a bit too much, leaving this feeling like a bad copy with very little effort having gone into it. Helen Mirren was a good addition - shame we couldn't have seen more of her in the movie, she may have rescued some of the typically over dramatic, American scenes and brought a well needed sense of British dry humour into it!

His name on a film guarantees it is going to be awful...,1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
So many things wrong here!,"Where to start? Nicolas Cage is not an action hero. He is ugly, he is a bad actor and he doesn't have the physique for the part - he never had. I don't t even think he has proper personal hygiene. He is especially unbelievable as a brainiac and he simply comes off as a wimp. However, he is extremely convincing as an insensitive ""ugly American"" who abuses the hospitality of every country he visits. The storyline could have been more interesting than even ""The Da Vinci Code"" ... if it made the slightest bit of sense and if the director had not simplified it to its barest, more unsatisfying elements. All it boils down to in the end is a very uninvolving video game, which is the rule of most action pics these days. The hero wants to prove his ancestor is innocent of having conspired against Lincoln's life. That is his primary motivation. Yet, it is never shown how he actually achieves this. The business about the twin desks is full of holes and Helen Mirren's false decoding - under duress - of the second wooden plank just doesn't make sense and is never satisfactorily resolved. The most interested viewers are left dangling left and right and in more dire danger of losing their mind than any of the protagonists tumbling down an underground river. The City of Gold is disappointing and simply unattractive. It actually feels like recycled footage from the first film. And the music score represents the umpteenth rehash of the theme from ""The Madwoman of Chaillot"" (penned by Michael J. Lewis, 1968). Oh! And the main character pronounces the word ""repartee"" as if it was written ""repartay"", which is an infallible proof of ignorance and lack of culture, even in an American. Poor Helen Mirren must have cringed at that one...",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Book of Mediocrity,"I have not seen the first film in this series so I am unable to comment on how well this film holds up against it, but I have to assume it was mildly successful to warrant a sequel, however for the life of me I can not see why. It is not that this is a bad movie it is just that it is completely mediocre in every aspect and completely devoid of inspiration, this truly is just a poor man's Indiana Jones. Nicholas Cage plays the lead character Ben Gates a treasure hunter like his father before him who becomes involves in a fight to clear his families name names from being involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Unsurprisingly this ends up in Ben and his ensemble (ex wife Abigal Chase and erstwhile colleague Riley Poole) on a globe trotting mission to reveal the secrets in all sorts of historical artefacts and locations that will lead to the truth and clear the family. The problems for me where that I just did not care about any of the cast. Nic Cage was really just acting by numbers and the film managed to waste the joint talents of John Voight, Ed Harris and Helen Mirren which in it's self in my opinion is the film's greatest achievement. The direction is run of the mill and a little research on the director Jon Turtletuab led me to unsurprisingly find that his previous television and film work had also been mediocre. Not one for me and not worth a second viewing.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A smart, fun adventure movie for Indiana Jones and history buffs alike","This film and its predecessor conveyed the intangible sense of adventure and exploration which has so long been lost in a sea of mindless CGI-special effects extravaganzas. While certainly the movie has its share of special effects, it also has both a fun plot, a brain, and even a message about human nature near the end. The story-telling could be more complex, as could the villain-turned-martyr, but for an action movie, I found that it left me feeling good about the two hours I'd used to experience it. While certain liberties had to be taken with regards to historical accuracy, the movie did well to subtly separate fact from fabrication, and the viewer is left knowing some incredibly interesting things that will leave you curious to learn more. As for what those things are, and what they are not, don't let a review ruin it for you. See it for yourself. If you let yourself enjoy the film, rather than getting too hung up in whatever flaws it may have, you will find this a good experience.If you are looking for another ""Ghost Rider"", thankfully, this is not what you are looking for.

National Treasure: Book of Boredom,"This movie pales horribly in comparison to the original. There were plenty of F/X throughout, but those couldn't hold the movie together alone. Dialog was forced, attempts at humor failed miserably (I recall a majority of the theater laughing twice), and I found myself looking forward to the end with more than an hour to go. A day's worth of reflection after going to the theater and there is nothing that compels me to change my review.2 points worth mentioning. 1). For those who do enjoy the franchise, a vague arc is presented for a potential third installment. 2). The audience was treated to a 10-12 minute Goofy cartoon before the movie began.

All the characters from last year are involved with the addition of Gates' mother. They look for clues in Europe, Washington DC, and Mount Rushmore. Ed Harris plays the bad guy who wants the treasure for himself. As to how they get from London to Mount Rushmore, they follow clues, exactly like the first film. And the comedy was very lackluster. A few of the comedic scenes worked, but many didn't.FINAL VERDICT: Just not as enjoyable as the first one. The same plot points are used and little creativity is seen.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Time! Lots of Laughs!,"If you like movies about treasure, action, and adventure, and you liked the first installment, you'll LOVE this one. I had some great laughs, some moments of fear, and butterflies throughout the entire movie. The cast was wonderful, Nick Cage did a great job along with all the others.It's great for the entire family, except for the little ones that are maybe younger than 4 because of the action. There aren't any love scenes that you'd have to worry about too much. There's maybe 2 or 3 kissing scenes that wouldn't hurt anyone.Now, if you're a person that goes to a movie and says, ""This could NEVER happen,"" then I suggest you DON'T watch this movie. If you do, you'll spend most of the time saying it can never happen and miss the whole story. So just go with the movie and you'll have a great time.***CAUTION***SPOILER AHEAD*******Now, if you don't like movies that end in the middle (like the Golden Compass) and just shouts out there'll be a third one, then Don't WORRY.

Here's the scene, the President asks Ben Gates what is in the 47th page of the Secret Book and just leaves you to wonder. But that's not where the movie ends, there's still about 3 mins. after that to close the movie. But not something you should worry about, it doesn't ruin the movie.

Too far out there.,"For everyone that saw the first National Treasure most of them might remember a feeling of ""Well, i guess that could actually happen"" (American History specialists aside). It's sort of what kept the movie from being over the top and making it an actually decent modern day treasure hunt movie.National Treasure: Book of Secrets has completely lost that appeal. As the clues develop you realize there's a few where you're think ""Oh, that's kinda clever"" and other's where you just think they can't really be trying that hard. Aside from the fact that they're searching for the Greatest Treasure History Has Ever Known (again), the explanations behind it are kind of weak. Nothing like the decently developed Free Mason's treasure from the Original. Also in parts of this one seem to leave the main story behind to show Ben Gates and Abigal's relationship, where as in the first one they let it clearly but quietly develop in the background of the main plot.Either way, if you're seeing this for free than go for it.

Best Kept Secret,"Can someone please explain to me how Nicolas Cage convinces filmmakers that he's credible as an action hero? While the first instalment was kinda fun, this plot-hole-ridden golf cart ride is as forgettable as who you sat next to in the second grade.Some light-hearted moments pepper the duration, and Diane Krueger certainly is easy to watch. But all in all, this looks like a hormone-fed franchise just waiting to milked.The swiss-cheese plot is about a race against bad guys to clear the name of one of Ben Gates' (Cage) forefathers (although ""one of his four fathers"" might have made for a more interesting premise). This after the revelation that they may have been complicit in the killing of...wait for it...Abraham Lincoln.I'm convinced the writers realised that no-one would care about this, but being too lazy to start again (either that or too pre-occupied making writers strike picket placards), shifted the plot implausibly to a treasure hunt for a lost city of gold. And then threw in something about a conspiracy involving presidents just for good measure.A hop to Paris, a skip to London and a jump back to the US later, one wonders if the plot devices aren't completely lost on US Americans who have no concept of maps (Geography)..and historical facts... and such as like.PS: Will somebody please tell Miss Teen USA South Carolina that this is movie is not based on fact, and that there won't be a history pop quiz based on the movie after the screening - I heard she's stressing out about that.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Will There Be A 3rd Film,"First off, I seriously cannot believe how long it's been since the National Treasures movies came out. First came out in 2004, second in 2007. More than a decade. Where has all the time gone? I still find these National Treasure movies looking fresh today, but you will notice older cellphones in them. These National Treasure films will make for a fun movie night. I've been wondering if there'd be a 3rd National Treasure Film for awhile? There have been internet rumors about it, but I don't know for sure? It would be cool to see the adventurous cast we recognize from National Treasure in action more than a decade later.So, as this movie is a sequel to the first National Treasure, we will recognize the cast from the original film. However, there will be differences. One, even mentioned on Bonus Features, is they take us to different locations more spread out than the first. It's cool to see scenes in Europe.Like the first one, this movie is a fun, action, adventure treasure hunting movie. Characters trying to do what it takes to find the secrets leading to treasure along with other things, this movie includes trying to uncover family history. Doing what you can to succeed in the mission, even if it resorts to doing something illegal, or dangerous.A good fun movie, not entirely realistic though. Or, we wonder how much of the history is accurate, how much is made up? The first one seemed to give more history, this one the history seems a little more made up, and it's more about uncovering the secrets. The first one, also had more of a treasure hunting feel than this one. To me, this has less of a treasure hunting feel and more an adventure feel. I like the first one better, but this is a good follow up sequel. If you're up for an entertaining movie night, you can watch either National Treasure, follow mostly the characters we recognize from it Ben, Abigail, Riley, along with anybody else that joins them whether they're good or bad.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly good - judge for yourself,"OK, so I have to admit, after the reviews it was with a certain amount of trepidation that I entered my local monopolised flea-pit.

The plot hangs together surprisingly well, and there is enough in the way of action scenes (particularly with the car chases) to keep you engaged. I also enjoyed how Voigt and Mirren played off each other as the couple who have wasted decades hating each other. As good as the first one? No - BETTER!

Better than the first film,"National Treasure: Book of Secrets is a better movie then the original national treasure movie. The cast stays the same except trade in Sean Bean for Ed Harris and add on Helen Mirren. The acting is good here, I enjoyed cage and Kruger, very good chemistry, even better here than in the first. And I loved seeing Helen Mirren in this film, she is a fine actress and I loved her performance as Ben's mom and Patrick's ex-wife. The dynamic between Mirren and Voight is interesting and they work very well together. On to the action and treasure hunting. The action are done well, not overstuffed with over the top special effects and not cheesy looking. The movie has a nice pace to it and I enjoyed every destination they went to, they were all important to the movie as a whole. This is pretty enjoyable film that is sure to entertain all audiences. I definitely suggest it for family viewing, it's not too rough or intense or too weak and child like, perfect medium. The kids will have good fun with the treasure hunt and the clues they discover along the way and with the action sequences.

Personally, I liked this movie. I thought it was entertaining, it was worth my 10 bucks and it was well-made. It was pretty similar to the 1st one but you got to give the producers a hand. Not anybody can make up ideas like the ""President's Book of Secrets"" and the clues were interestingly - especially in the first one. I got to say that I did like the 1st one a lot better but NT2 was enjoyable. This movie does teach you a lot about history. And not in the boring way, either. They just state a historical fact and you sort of remember it after, from there on. Plus, I simply love Nic Cage! I think he's a great actor and he made this movie work, as well as the other characters. Jon Voight was a good choice for the father and I'm glad they kept most of the characters from NT1. So, if your planning on watching this movie, I assure you, it'll be worth it. There might be a few flaws here and there but you watch a movie to get entertained, don't you? Nd this certainly was an entertaining movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
History spliced with Fiction...a nice bit of entertainment,"Great fun film.It's a great story which blends history with myth and legend and there is some great action scenes. As with the first one, there is a ""bad guy"" (the ever excellent Ed Harris) hot on the heels of Cage and Co. as they race to find a hidden treasure.There is a heavy amount of improbability, but one must push this to the side and believe the legend. Those of a skeptical disposition might not enjoy it.The whole cast is strong and entertaining and I would say that it is definitely worth watching. It's like a lighter DaVinci Code.....I actually watched this immediately after the first National Treasure (having enjoyed it so much) and found this sequel just as good.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another great movie,"National Treasure 2 is another terrific movie. It has a thrilling adventure and a great story line. The music was great once again along with the acting.

Hair-Raising!,"I loved the first movie and the second. The whole plot and premise have gotten young students interested in American history again. Well-done, interesting family movies are getting harder and harder to come by. I hope that if they make a third movie (as is rumored), that they will take it easy on the hair dye for Nick Cage. In the first movie, his hair color was noticeable, but not as distracting, more highlight than full on dye job. The REALLY BAD dark hair dye job in ""Book of Secrets"" was VERY distracting during the entire movie. Much like a piece of spinach in your date's teeth, once it attracts your attention you just can't get past it. I love Nick Cage, let's just have him like he is - mostly ;)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A theme park ride is not a movie,"I have nothing against undemanding entertainment. I didn't see the first film in this series, and I sure as hell won't be going to see any subsequent ones. For anyone familiar with the oeuvre of Daffy Duck, there is a clear analogy here. Remember 'The Scarlet Pumpernickel'? Well there Daffy is in the process of selling the idea of a movie to an obtuse and artless film producer. But when all is done, the producer just wants more spectacle and more violence and more plot twists and... (you get the idea).So it is with NT-BOS. Quite probably, in the first place, there was a reasonable film about a guy's attempts to unravel a mystery regarding Abraham Lincoln's assassination. Might have been entertaining. Might have even encouraged a modicum of cerebral activity. However, some crass producer/studio exec stepped in and wanted more more more of the stuff of multi-million dollar production values and less, less, less character development and narrative logic.The result is a complete mess in which we care not one jot for the future and safety of the characters because they have not been properly presented to us. We are only hazily aware what is going on because the filmmakers mistake speed for pace. And at the end of the film we have not experienced the ride that we were hoping for because someone didn't understand the truth that in the cinema, not enough is highly preferable to too much.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
National Treasure still holds itself together despite some minor flaws,"How good is National Treasure: Book of Secrets? Well I'm hailing it with exact same score I gave the original one three years ago and I have A LOT of good things to say about it. The biggest problem with the film is the complexity of the puzzles and story leave some major plot holes including the biggest one of all that holds the entire story together...how does finding a lost city of gold vindicate Ben Gates' ancestor? It just doesn't make sense. But even that is easily overlooked for a romping adventure with a terrific cast, some additions to the cast, and the second half is truly an adventure to behold. The best part is that National Treasure: Book of Secrets holds to the original formula by creating a whole new genre of action, treasure hunting by keeping things in North America with witty and smart puzzles and a treasure and history...all based on real events and places. This installments takes you from France, to the Queen's office in Buckingham to the Oval Office to Mount Rushmore without even taking a breath. With the original film (see my review) I really harped on the name of the film but I must have grown accustomed to it because I don't think National Treasure is such a bad name for the series...it's even fitting.I have said so many times before that I do not care for Nicholas Cage but how do I keep saying that and then love most of his films (Ghost Rider aside--see my review.) Plus I love Ben Gates. Cage plays the swashbuckling hero treasure hunter flawlessly and I think captures even more personality in this second installment. He is even more likable, more wild and unhinged, and more fun than even the first one. Cage has a very bankable character with Gates. Justin Bartha returns as hilarious sidekick Riley Poole, and they definitely use him more in this one for comic relief which can be a risk throwing that much comedy into the role but he does alright. I think they should give him more of an action based role next time around, put him in the thick of things but he has some more neat gadgets and pulls the role off well and him and Cage have good hero/sidekick chemistry. Diane Kruger also returns as Cage's love interest (now broken up) Abigail Chase. She is lovely and sexy and the perfect addition to the cast again. She's smart and strong and looks confident as the female lead and a great match for Cage who has been paired up with some odd females in the past. The terrific Jon Voight also returns as Cage's father Patrick Gates. He plays a bigger role this time around which is terrific because he was so good in the original. His character is soft spoken, a little clumsy and shy and he does a terrific job bringing that character back. Newcomers to the cast are welcome!! Helen Mirren (who I admit I have not always been a fan of and I think she's over rated) does a really terrific job as Cage's mother and Voight's long time divorced wife. Voight and Mirren have great chemistry together and make great treasure hunters and their volatile and feisty relationship mirrors that of Cage and Kruger's relationship. Now a stumbling block...in the original film Sean Bean was a terrific villain, no holds barred, clearly evil and a terrific nemesis. A great predecessor would be Ed Harris, who is amazing all the time. He plays fame hunter Mitch Wilkinson who wants nothing more than Gates to lead him to a treasure so he can be famous. The problem is Harris plays both sides...sometimes he's evil and other times he's not such a bad guy and even comes across as a hero in the end. So the film is lacking something a clear good vs evil line. There is no real main villain. Harris's character is kind of wishy washy and not really strong in either aspect and that's a shame and a waste of his great talent. Harvey Keitel also returns in a very small cameo as the FBI agent who hunted Gates down originally and he's doing the same in a smaller capacity. Bruce Greenwood also makes for a terrific President of The United States which he has done before in other films.The concept of treasure hunting in our own back yard is terrific and exciting and there is no shortage of underground caverns and terrific puzzles and right off the bat you're treated to a re-creation of the Lincoln assassination which is really something to get your blood pumping for the rest of the film. No matter what...either National Treasure film and more so with this one now there must be a suspension of belief. You have to let go of the fact that there is NO way a single person could sneak in and out of Buckingham Palace, The Oval Office, The Library of Congress and kidnapping the President...yes all the happens. But somehow the cast makes you believe it possible and this wonderful fantasy, slapstick, adventure comes alive. Don't hold back...this one is great for kids and adults and watch the first one and then go see the second, just don't take it too seriously and you'll have a great time!! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Cibola,"Conspiracy theorists will love National Treasure: The Book Of Secrets because it will give one plausible reason to affirm all the paranoid things one already believes in and add a few more. Imagine the fabled Cibola, City of Gold, which several conquistadors spent lots of time and money searching for, being positively real and the clues being in Buckingham Palace and the White House? Does it get more conspiratorial than that?Nicholas Cage, Diane Kruger, Justin Bartha, Jon Voight, and Harvey Keitel all repeat their roles from the first National Treasure. Because part of the riddle is in some Indian language symbols, the intrepid treasure hunters have to call in Voight's estranged wife and Cage's mother Helen Mirren. That raises all kinds of issues not related to treasure hunting.Ed Harris is the villain here, he starts the ball rolling by claiming to have an authentic missing page of John Wilkes Booth's diary which implicates Voight and Cage's ancestor in the Lincoln assassination. Of course Harris has an ulterior motive in doing that, to get the treasure hunters working because their historical knowledge is greater than his. In the end however he proves not to be as big a villain as the group from the first National Treasure and that's quite a let down.As for Cibola, let's just say that the government has put quite the marker on the site.If you're a history lover or a conspiracy theorist this film will grab your attention.

"Repeating the recipe of the first movie: entertainment, crazy conspiracy theories and historical untruths.","This movie is the sequel of ""National Treasure"" and is just another movie about insane conspiracy theories based on false historical premises. This time, everything revolves around Cibola, a variation of the South American myth of El Dorado. Out of curiosity, there is no pre-Columbian ruin in North America with some minimal similarity to the one showed in the film, at least as far as I know. What it portrays is clearly influenced by ruins lefted by the Mayans, Aztecs or Incas, who lived in more southern latitudes. That, and the crazy theory around the Resolute desks, is enough to make the plot absolutely indigestible for anyone with a minimum of historical knowledge. The cast includes many actors from the first film, with Nicholas Cage and Diane Kruger leading the way and keeping the flaws and virtues shown earlier, like the lack of depth and personality of their characters and some very enjoyable comical vein. Ed Harris was effective in the role of villain and managed to counteract the lack of depth of the other characters. The film still has good visual and special effects, although scenarios are sometimes a bit disappointing or unrealistic.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Somewhat of a mess of a storyline...,"Following in the wake of the 2004 movie ""National Treasure"", Benjamin Franklin Gates (played by Nicolas Cage) is back searching for one of the most significant treasures in American history. Gates is following clues left in John Wilkes Booth's diary in order to prove his ancestor's innocence in the Lincoln assassination. And that leads him on the track of a great treasure, a city of gold.The story in ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is much similar to the story in the 2004 movie. A group of people chasing after important clues hidden in the most unlikely of places in order to get to an ancient city of gold. So if you liked the first movie, then you will also get some enjoyment out of this sequel.However, I found the clues and the locations in part two to be a bit too far fetched, and it was getting hard to buy into it after a while. That being said, I will claim that the movie is still entertaining enough, it just never managed to get over the mediocrity level.Nicolas Cage, Justin Bartha, Diane Kruger, Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel all return for the sequel, reprising their roles from the 2004 movie. In addition to these talents, then ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" also offers the talents of Helen Mirren and Ed Harris, both of whom did bring something good to the movie.It just wasn't fully as entertaining nor compelling as the first movie, and as such then I am rating ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" a mediocre five out of ten stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Few friends, couple of road blocks, for which they overcome","National treasure 2 went exactly how I though it would. I walked in, sat down, witnessed a very similar plot to the first movie. To summarize it was a few friends, they came across a couple of road blocks, a couple of bad guys, but they got the treasure. The end. simple, elegant, genius. 9/10, I would give it ten, but it could have had a few more road blocks. Nicholas cage never had a torch like in the movie poster, only a flare, disappointing, 7/10. The best part of the movie was when Nick cage had a flare, and when there was a lot of water coming out of the things in the pyramid, and Nick's nemesis nearly died, but then they didn't die because they were enemies, to me this seems unrealistic, as if I were in the pyramid I would make them go down with me. 5/10. I really enjoyed Nick Cage. My favorite character was the comical guy who had the book and he had the book and no one came to his book signing because they never came because he is pathetic in real life. But he had a book. 1/10.Regards,Class 3C, St. Snell Prep. School.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not nearly as good as NATIONAL TREASURE, and also a bit annoying.","The original cast of 'National Treasure' is back for another treasure hunt adventure. Only, everything I so loved from 'National Treasure' is absent in 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets'.'National Treasure' ended on a happy note. This sequel starts on a not so happy note with our happy couple experiencing marital problems. The film cleverly combines factual events - like Lincoln's assassination - with fiction. Sadly though this film suffers from so much improbabilities that it was hard to swallow. It was completely unbelievable and not nearly as exciting as 'National Treasure'.'Book of Secrets' is also off to a bit of a slow start with way too much silly humour. Why do Hollywood always insist on adding more humour in sequels? So much time is spent on these silly moments that the film is slow moving as a result. As if Riley isn't enough comic relief, they now added even more comic relief in the form of Patrick and Emily (Jon Voight and Helen Mirren), who constantly engage in stupid, childish arguments. And Abigail's new boyfriend, Connor (Ty Burrell) also served as comic relief. This was more annoying than funny. Was this intended to be a comedy?Ed Harris stars as the film's antagonist, Mitch, and was the most interesting and more serious character. Unfortunately, almost every time the other characters came into contact with him, they resorted to more humour. Oh, why oh why?The film throws a lot of information at us to digest. It is also a bit too incredible (unbelievable) how easily they manage to decode riddles and figure out puzzle boxes. The film only really gains momentum during the final act, which was rather exciting - but still not nearly as good as 'National Treasure'.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Book of Secrets""","Treasure hunter Benjamin Franklin Gates looks to discover the truth behind the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, by uncovering the mystery within the 18 pages missing from assassin John Wilkes Booth's diary.Yes, I loved the first. I hear all these people complaining about all these little things that actually define movies in general. Sure, there was some tedious little thing put here and there, but I grew up and learned that things aren't perfect. And people may not realize this, but this a Disney film: made for KIDS. Doesn't necessarily mean we can't enjoy them either, but they aren't exactly trying to make you like it. The second installment of the series had some great expectations. Same cast from the original, an interesting plot, and seemed to have a lot more heist scenes (which I am a huge fan of!) So after sitting down and watching, I once again loved the film... Think of a bigger and badder National Treasure. That is what sequels are trying to be, right? The thing is, this movie blows the first out of the water. It has some spectacular set pieces, some amazing action scenes, and the heist scenes were really awesome (although some were over-the-top pointless.) The acting shouldn't even be commented on, this is a Disney movie by the way, and Nicholas Cage is in it. Thing is, if I imagined myself acting, I would do a much worse job then they have, so I give them kudos for at least trying. The plot is just like the first, they go from clue to clue to solving a puzzle. This is where the complainers come in, stating that the movie is ""over-the-top"" ""stupid"" ""unrealistic"". Well, yeah, and? I didn't know movies were supposed to be realistic. The Dark Knight surely wasn't realistic, but it has rave reviews? Movies are escapism that started that way, so stating something that you have no idea what your saying is just pointless. ANYWAYS... some of the ideas were stupid, yes, but I wasn't expecting an intellectual look at these things. It was a movie and I enjoyed it for what it is. All in all, I definitely recommend. People who complained, take this to heart and watch your 'over-the-top' realistic movies while the others can enjoy a great entertaining movie. Book of Secrets surpasses the first, and includes some of the most entertainment you can get out of something. I rate 1 star higher than the first... 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Starts out well but just turns stupid/boring,"Gates family history is Patrick Gates (Jon Voight)'s grandfather Charles' recollection of the night of Lincoln's assassination. Charles's father Thomas was given a book to decipher. It turned out to be Booth's diary and the man was actually a member of Knights of the Golden Circle. KGC were confederate saboteurs working in the north. The diary had a clue to a treasure that the confederates want. Thomas threw the pages into the fire and was killed for it. The confederate spy was able to retrieve a part of a page. Thomas Gates was always a hero in the story until now when Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) shows up with the missing page. Mitch is a antiquities soldier of fortune and wants the treasure. His ancestor was a confederate general. The missing page has Thomas Gates' name along with the other conspirators. Everybody now believes that Thomas was a Booth co-conspirator and Ben (Nicolas Cage) has to clear his family name with the help of Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), ex-girlfriend Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), and even his mother Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren) who can't stand his father.The gang is reunited. The bickering couple chemistry is funny and good. The group has a lot of fun. The movie seems to be trying very hard to be cutesy fun. The addition of Helen Mirren added surprisingly little. Ed Harris is a little too scary and mean. He seems capable of killing anyone. They travel around the world in a wild chase for treasure. It's one big monument after another. It just turns very repetitive as they find clues in a series of over-the-top capers. About halfway into the movie, it gets way too ridiculous even for a National Treasure movie.

"Weaker and too similar to the original, but still a lot of fun...","The first National Treasure was a truly great movie. Blending Indiana Jones with elements of James Bond and The Da Vinci Code, boasting talented and charismatic actors, and filled with over-the-top American patriotism, it was a perfect entertainment.The good news is, the sequel is more of the same. The bad news is, it's more of the same. National Treasure 2 is basically the first movie tweaked a little differently and unfortunately a little less interesting. Seriously, it's as if the producers told the screenwriters ""all right, we want exactly the same thing, except not exactly, see what I mean?"". One of the main problems here is the villain. Ed Harris is a great actor, but his character here is extremely lame and absolute rubbish in comparison to Sean Bean in the first movie. Nicolas Cage seems slightly less enthusiastic about historical stuff and Diane Kruger, while still lovely, doesn't make you fall madly in love with her as in the first film. Harvey Keitel's return is welcome but he ultimately serves little purpose. And finally the treasure hunt and action scenes are considerably less thrilling this time around.However, the movie still has plenty left for people who enjoyed the first movie. What happens is fun and entertaining, the cast is talented and Helen Mirren's character is a great addition. A lot of what was great in National Treasure returns, which is why this sequel is still very enjoyable and highly recommended by me.

Sequelitis,"This tries to stay in the flavor of the first installment of the National Treasure series, but doesn't really succeed. It doesn't fail either (apart from ridiculous threads in the plot, but then again this isn't meant to be taken too seriously so why bother caring about plot and stuff?), especially if you think about the (new) cast (members). Particular one female addition puts some acting weight into the mix, that wasn't available in the first part.While that is a very good thing, it does stir away from of the better things from part 1! Our comedy relief guy. Not only does he get fewer jokes, but some of them aren't as good as his previous (part 1 again) ones, which leaves you kind of bedazzled and yearning for a bit of better entertainment/fun.So successful though, that a part 3 is planned ... Well let's hope it will be an improvement this time around (three's a lucky charm ain't it?)",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"When The Cast Is Having Fun, So Am I","The first ""National Treasure"" was a fun, little movie. Nothing spectacular, but a well-casted, well-paced, clever movie with a great sense of humor. ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" completely blows its predecessor out of the water. The biggest reason for that? Everyone involved is just having the time of their lives.Nicholas Cage has long been my favorite actor of all time, and while this is CERTAINLY not one of his best performances, he does a really good job as Ben Gates. He gets a chance in this installment to show off more of the comedic, over-the-top kookiness that we've come to expect of Cage over the years in fare like ""Face/Off"" or ""Con Air."" Cage is just having so much more fun this time around, and his performance gets a lotta laughs. Diane Kruger gives a fine performance as Abigail Chase, Ben's ex-girlfriend and right hand- woman in his quest for the truth. Their chemistry is kind of ""on and off"" in this movie, but when it works, (i.e, the fake argument scene and the scene following it) it REALLY works.Justin Bartha does an excellent job as Riley Poole, Cage's charming sidekick. His acting reminds me a lot of Seth Green in a lot of ways, and given how much a fan I am of Green, that's a major compliment. Bartha's hilarious in this movie, while still proving to be more than competent and intelligent in Gate's search to clear his great-grandfather's name.As for Jon Voight, as always, the man is fantastic. He puts a lot of passion in his performance of a man with strong familial ties desperate to find the truth, and his character has really grown and developed a lot more from the first movie. And, like most of the cast, he's pretty damn funny when the script requires him to be. He steals the show here.The action is extremely well done for a Disney movie. Required to maintain a ""PG"" rating, ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" has to rely on the speed, tension and suspense of their action sequences rather than violence in order to capture the attention of the audience, and I absolutely feel like the film does that. The film does a great job putting characters we like and care about in suspenseful, dangerous situations we desperately want them to escape.""Suspenseful"" is the key word for ""Book of Secrets."" Even in non- action related sequences, the film did a great job always keeping me on my toes in numerous scenes; from breaking into Buckingham Palace to Gates himself kidnapping the President of the United States! The whole film is an exciting, fun, tense ride.I only have 2 big problems with the film; 1) The villains. Ed Harris gives a good performance here as Mitch Wilkinson, but his character is just never that interesting. I suppose he's better than Ian from the first movie, but that's not saying much. I wish these films would give us villains with more interesting personalities and backstories and better motivation than just ""Give me the treasure!"" 2) The ""PG"" rating. Much like the first film, I can't help watching this wishing that it was PG-13, which could have allowed the action sequences to be more intense and entertaining and possibly allowed for a darker story. I mean, the ""Pirates"" movies were all PG-13, ""John Carter"" was PG-13, the new Star Wars is going to be PG-13, so not sure why Disney couldn't make either National Treasure installments PG-13 movies.Despite those problems, ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is still a well casted, funny, insanely entertaining action movie that really managed to compel me and hold my attention, and a vast improvement over its predecessor. This is a production where everybody aboard is just happy to be here. And that happiness is contagious.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Matter of fact, National Treasure 2 is full of cliché, weak humor, a lot of holes and absurd points in the plot and dialog. The movie dragged long at times with unnecessary details (very bad editing), the camera job was nothing spectacular, and the chases (action scenes) weren't exactly thrilling. The movie didn't really introduce us to new kinda codes (except for the table thing, which found kinda interesting).

Exciting car chase sequence through the streets of London. Helen Mirren and Ed Harris were especially good (as always).

National Treasure: Book of Secrets furthers its improbable mystery to conceal repetition.,"A sequel was destined after the predecessor's bountiful success. Never mind the discovery of an entire hall worth of jewelled artefacts founded by the Knights Templar and obscured by Freemasons. National Treasure was box office gold, the real valuable riches in this instance. Disney and Bruckheimer understood that more treasured possessions needed to be found. Audiences craved the treasure hunting adventures of old. ""How to fulfil that desire?"", you may ask. Well, just repeat the exact same narrative structure, only this time make it ""International Treasure"". Gates must follow a set of clues to find the legendary Cibola (lost city of gold) and prove that his great-great-grandfather was not a conspirator and architect of Lincoln's assassination.This leads the gang to explore various locales, including Paris where apparently the most pleasant French police officers reside, London which sees Cage exercise his exaggerated British accent by shouting ""haggis"" (of all words...) in Buckingham Palace, ultimately leading to his arrest, and back to America to kidnap the President and sprinkle bottled water over Mount Rushmore. Phew! Treasure hunting sure is criminally exhausting. What Book of Secrets does improve from the first instalment, is the brisk flow of the mystery. Sure, National Treasure was incredibly fast paced for a family-friendly feature exceeding a two hour runtime, yet somehow this sequel is twice as fast whilst maintaining the urgency of the central plot. The unreasonably, and unlikely, escalated scenarios that Gates found himself enthralled in, resulted in a momentum that never dissipated. Turteltaub's flashy direction manages to entertain throughout, swiftly moving from set piece to set piece.The fundamental issue with Book of Secrets is the ornate familiarity within its story. The screenplay, written by the Wibberley's, refused to explore other avenues. It's simple, effective, yet incredibly monotonous. The minimal amount of cryptic puzzles embedded throughout prevented any investigative strands from intertwining with the adventurous aesthetic. The writers instead forced more humour into each scenario, such as pretending to search for a lost earring in the Oval Office, rather than executing any methodology. Humour that didn't necessarily work. Cage performing one of his infamous ""cage rages"" in Buckingham Palace was legendary though. Hilarious! Would watch that scene on repeat every day.The returning cast members were functional with some additional character development thrown in, particularly between Gates and his father. Mirren's addition as Gates' mother felt contrived, with a hammy performance to follow. The weakest character however was the antagonistic Wilkinson, equipped with an arc that was schizophrenic in nature. One scene you sympathise with him, the other want to throw him into a spiked booby trap. There was no common ground between him and Gates, making that final bittersweet confrontation emotionless. Although Harris always plays a tasty villain, and does so again here. Just not fully developed.Book of Secrets is a sequel worth taking a peek at. Flicking through the pages at the same speed to which the feature plays. Rigid and efficient. Yet the familiar secrets that it conceals aren't worth uncovering.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bobby Witt: We miss you,"What worked pretty good for the first National Treasure film did not work so well for the 2nd one. Out to prove again the U.S. has collected treasures the world will never know, Cage comes out again to find it.Built around the same formula with the same results, Cage goes out to find a hidden treasure contained within the writings of John Wilkes Booth. Instead of being hidden by the Masons in a secret underground area, we find it is under a certain national park/memorial in South Dakota.Why did everything unfold in the same manner? Why did it seem like everybody was just going through the motions? I mean, the legendary City of Gold, Cibolo? It was kind of stupid in my opinion.I am hoping they do not make another one. It should have been left alone after the first one. Instead, its all about cheapening the brand. ""C""",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pink-knuckle adventure,"At one point in the movie, near the end, Ed Harris' character Mitch says to his rival, our hero Nicolas Cage's Ben Gates ""No more puzzles"" after which I breathed a sigh of relief - how many more elaborate mysteries linked to historical buildings or monuments could the writers concoct.This is big-time, big-budget Hollywood holiday adventure aimed at your average thirteen year old and what it hopes and indeed probably believes is the thirteen year old in all of us. Thus we get high-tech thrills you can easily imagine playing on your PC, with very little sex and violence to upset the censor.More seasoned viewers will probably see it for what it is - an amalgam of proved and tested blockbusters from recent years - taking in Indiana Jones type exoticism, adding in a touch of The Da Vinci Code's Alex 's ability to decipher the most arcane clues plus the ""Pirates of The Caribbean"" trick of adapting a Disneyland theme park to the big screen. Plus of course there's a nerdy computer geek who can hack into the London Police computer system quicker than you can say ""Evenin' All"", but it's okay, computer anoraks everywhere, even he gets a Ferrari (outrageous piece of product placement, right there) and a girl by the end.The acting is perfunctory - ridiculous to see Helen Mirren in particular wasted on fluff like this and to be honest, nobody ever really seems to be in any danger at all. That said, there are some nice location shots at Buckingham Palace and Mount Rushmore and the recreation of the City of Gold is certainly impressive.I don't want to be too hard on this film, it didn't displease me, but it wasn't smart enough to insert telling humour to leaven the journey and at no point did I feel my hands gripping the arms of my chair as a good adventure really should.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
National indoctrination and the book of propaganda (dad),"This franchise is a rip-off clone of ""Indiana Jones"" and Dan Brown's mysteries but void of any soul or spiritual philosophy and plagued by materialist American civilization: babe, Ferrari, money and even Potus now.Uncle Disney isn't the cousin artist of Spielberg and Lucas but the good son of America: A good faith is a gold chase and its priest is Potus. This aren't the kind of values i would like to give my children. The only good thing here is the cast: Cage is always a sincere actor (in spite of his bad choices of scripts) and Kruger is an attractive and dynamic woman. However, Voight is always boring and inept at playing and I conclude that Angelina draws rather from her mother! I don't even talk about Potus unless to say it's a fiction and Potus place is out there!Unlike Indy, Gates seeks his treasure in iconic (and not exotic) places like Congress, White house or Buckingham, which is totally unbelievable but has the merit to get us a tour in those places.In conclusion, it's a faithful sequel of the first nationalist movie with all the crap becoming worse!",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
fast-paced but hollow puzzle-drama,"In ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets,"" the 2007 sequel to the original ""National Treasure"" from 2004, historian Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) finds himself in the distinctly unenviable position of having to clear his great-great-grandfather's name from the charge - being leveled by a black market antiquities dealer (Ed Harris) - that his forefather played a major role in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. In order to prove the accusation wrong, thereby restoring not only his ancestor's reputation but his own in the process, Gates must uncover the whereabouts of a treasure map leading to the fabled City of Gold built by a tribe of pre-Columbian Native Americans. (And don't bother asking how those two things are related because, even after watching the movie, I'm still not sure I would be able to tell you).""Book of Secrets,"" produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Jon Turteltaub and directed by Turteltaub, is a giant Rube Goldberg contraption about a series of Rube Goldberg contraptions. In terms of the story, there are more twists and turns, leaps in logic, conspiracy theories and contrived red herrings than even the most astute puzzle-solver should be required to keep up with. Luckily, the action moves along at a quick enough pace - including an impressive car chase through the streets and alleyways of London - that one doesn't have much time to question the sense of it all.The actors certainly do throw themselves into the spirit of the enterprise, running around like mad through an assortment of colorful, touristy settings - from the Eiffel Tower to Buckingham Palace to the White House to Mount Vernon to the Library of Congress to Mount Rushmore - but the film, taken as a whole, is a pretty soulless exercise overall. Most grating is the stereotypical love/hate relationship between Ben and his ex-girlfriend, Abigail (Diane Kruger), an archivist at the National Archives, who are obviously still hopelessly, madly in love with one another and only need one more epic, life-threatening adventure to bring that truth home to them - which puts the audience one step ahead of the sleuthers to begin with. And as if that weren't enough, we're treated to a second bickering couple - Ben's divorced mother (Helen Mirren) and father (Jon Voight) - to parallel the first and double our displeasure.The problem with a movie like this one is that, no matter how well it's put together on a technical level, finally, after what feels like the thousandth uncovered clue and the millionth hairbreadth escape from a fate-worse-than-death, the viewer simply exhausts himself trying to keep up with it all and stops paying attention.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fair sequel, weaker than the first","Having just seen this on its opening night, I think I can fairly predict it will be huge. That being said, though, this is a much weaker film than the first one.There's no need for a spoiler warning here: if you've seen the previews, you've already seen pretty much the whole movie; what few surprises there might have been were ruined.Secondly, the characters are a good bit blander this time out. Nicolas Cage's Ben Gates (in the worst haircut since Pete Rose) seems to come up with the answers to the puzzles just a little too easily to draw any drama from the revelations. Diane Kruger is back as Abigail Chase, but romantic troubles between her and Gates, introduced for no real reason, are as easily forgotten later. Ed Harris, although a fine actor, has a plain-vanilla role here as the bad guy whose motivations seem as unclear to himself as to the audience. Jon Voight reprises and enlarges his role as the father, and is joined (for no particular reason) by Helen Mirren as the mother, but neither really seems necessary to the movie. Harvey Keitel's role as FBI agent Sadusky might have been nicely enlarged into a second threat to Gates, but is instead reduced to almost nothing. And Justin Bartha is back (and great) as sidekick Riley, but the subplot of his IRS problems (and a running joke of his being mistaken for Gates) just don't work.As for the suspension of disbelief, a little too much is asked, as brilliant insights come too quickly, gigantic stones are way too light, and the Secret Service (not to mention the Queen's palace guards) just a bit too easy to fool. If a movie is going to ask you to overlook a lot, there has to be a bigger payoff.Several reviews have pointed out the similarity of this series to the Indiana Jones films; let's hope that like those, the third National Treasure movie (strongly hinted at the end) will make a strong comeback after this so-so sequel.-----------------------P.S. - Kudos to the nameless Disney executive who decided to bring back the idea of the pre-movie cartoon (and Goofy is always a great choice), but with 40 years to think about it, this short was the best you could come up with?",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Nicholas Cage is Ben Gates, a rich guy who likes to give talks about his historical interests.

To prove his great great grandfather's innocence, Gates sets out on an adventure which follows a set of clues which ultimately lead to a search for the fabled ""City of Gold"". Fortunately Gates' best friend is an electronics wizard which enables them to bypass security measures and have convenient access to highly guarded areas such as Buckingham Palace and the Oval Office of the White House. Even more convenient, other family members know extinct languages and can read ancient runes. A Love interest tags along and Mitch Wilkinson reveals himself as a bad guy who is trailing Gates, hoping to grab any loot they may uncover. Geared toward an audience with a low attention span, the pace is fast and they don't get stuck on difficult clues for long. Ludicrous plot probably wouldn't prevent this film from succeeding as a Saturday morning TV adventure for preteens. Trevor Rabin soundtrack seems apt.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Treasure Hunter Ben Is Back In Search Of Something Bigger,"'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' has all the ingredients of a successful action adventure but something was lacking. The execution (that is, camera-work, editing, music, element of suspense etc) is brilliant. The action and comedy scenes were fun to watch. However, I felt that much of it was rushed. There isn't enough time for the historical jargon to sink into the viewer's mind because the movie quickly shifts to the next scene as the events move at a rapid pace. It just felt too rushed. The shift in location to Paris and London is nice but the scenes are too limited. Yet, there is a cool action sequence that takes place in the London scene. Another thing is that the way Ben and his team manage to solve their problem, such as, by getting into Buckingham Palace or kidnapping the president, just seems a little too easy. Then again, it's meant to be an entertaining action movie and I guess this can be excused. Nicholas Cage is in form and he's back with his old team that include the dependable Jon Voight, the ravishing Diane Kruger and the scene-stealer Justin Bartha. This time there is the additional benefit of seeing Ed Harris and the lovely Helen Mirren.
