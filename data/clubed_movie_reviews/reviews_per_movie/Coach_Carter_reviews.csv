A good story of a coach who believes his players can excel in life,"'Coach Carter' is based on a true story of Coach Ken Carter, a controversial high school basketball coach played by Samuel L. Jackson. Coach Carter took the coaching job under his rules. He believed that the players must maintain good grades and become a united team or they would not play. All the team players signed his contract to do just that. The team was undefeated and on it's way to the 1999 State Championship, when Coach Carter received the low grades of his players. Coach Carter received national attention when he locked the gym and benched the whole team for poor grades. Coach Carter received some praise and much more criticism for his decision. This is a good inspirational movie of what one must do to excel in sports and in life. Coach Carter taught his players that they must be committed and work hard to excel. This is good movie for people who like sports. (Paramount, Run time 2:16, Rated PG-13)(8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Coach is a cut above.,"Realistic drama based on the true story of Coach Ken Carter(Samuel L. Jackson), a daring and inspiring coach that returns to Richmond High School in Richmond, California where he still held records from his basketball exploits. Carter accepts a little over $1,000 to work four months as basketball coach for a team of uncooperative, but heady young men. Carter has the players sign a contract to keep their grades up or be suspended from the team. When it is known that his players are not making the grade average and/or just not showing up for class; community outrage erupts when Carter benches his undefeated team and locks them out of the gym. In storybook fashion, the players left on the team bring their grades up and continue their Cinderella season to the state playoffs.Typical slam dunks, ally-oops and no-look passes. PG-13 violence, language and sexual content. COACH CARTER stands and delivers. Worth watching more than once. Cast members include: Rob Brown, Channing Tatum, Robert Ri'chard, Antwon Tanner, Rick Gonzalez and a sterling performance from singer Ashanti. Jackson should be very proud of his outstanding portrayal as the inspiring coach.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good Movie,"""Coach Carter"" is a well-made movie, and from what I have heard it stays true to the actual story. If you're sick of inspirational-type movies, then don't go see it, but otherwise I highly recommend it. All of the performances are at least tolerable, and most are really good. Samuel L. Jackson is great. Most sports movies have terrible action scenes, but the basketball footage in the movie is actually quite believable (for example, no short white kids dunking and things like that). The movie is very realistic, and the director has gone to great lengths to make it seem as true-to-life as possible. I think it works very well.",,Anonymous,Biography
Coach Carter Review.,"Coach Carter is the story of a basketball coach who was persistent and had his priorities straight. The positive message the movie conveyed was that lives can be changed for the better through self discipline, hard work and the building of character. I was thinking to myself that the whole story was pretty believable, but then I looked into it and found it to be a true to life story so I guess it really is believable.Samuel L. Jackson put in a convincing performance as the strict Coach Carter, as did the rest of the cast members. The movie, itself, was reminiscent of Lean On Me. It was the same basic story with the disciplinary figure helping the distraught kids through life.I found it disappointing that the parent of the basketball team emphasized a mere game over something vastly more important, education. I rated this movie 7 of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's about time there's a movie about morals.,"Honestly, I don't care about dates. I don't care about names, or stats, or if the writers got a bunch of stats confused. I mean did you actually watch the movie, or were you just looking at the screen for misprints on jerseys? To believe that some people can actually watch a movie and then complain that the time line is off with reality is beyond my comprehension. Who cares about the time line! It's not reality that you're watching, it's a movie. Movies, no matter how real the stories they are based on, are not real. They are altered. They are changed to make a better storyline.If people can be dense enough to complain about names and numbers and dates, then they missed the big picture. They missed a great movie that actually conveys a real message. It's not about the sports, it's about the students. And it's not always about what you put in, it's about what you take out. It's about what you take away from the situation that you've walked into.That's what this movie is about, not about basketball. It's about life, and how easily people give in and give up. It's about learning, and having faith that people will do the right thing. Yes, it's about public education, and a community on the edge of stupid, but there's more to it than that. You just have to stop looking, and watch.This movie truly was excellent, right up there on the shelf next to ""With Honors."" But make sure you are really paying attention, otherwise, what's the point?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Lean on Me"" meets ""Miracle""","I give this movie 7 stars.All in all this is a good movie. As the title suggests, it is basically ""Lean on Me"" (Morgan Freeman) merged together with ""Miracle"" (Kurt Russell).Of course the sport here is basketball instead of ice hockey, but the story is very good.Jackson's performance was solid as expected and the supporting cast made the story believable. While it certainly was not the best sports movie ever made, it is based on a true story and is worth a rental if you like Samuel Jackson and/or if are into sports movies.Happy Viewing!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""I Came To Teach Boys... And You Became Men.""","This movie was fantastic! I first saw it during the last day of Summer School (yes, I went to Summer School. Shut up) and I have to admit that I did NOT want to watch it at first because it was a sports movie. But upon viewing this movie, I found that I liked it and enjoyed it. I then swiped the movie from my father's house and watched it every night for 3 nights straight. Here are the things that caught my attention.1) Samuel L. Jackson. One of the greatest actors ever was in this movie so I was instantly drawn in and thought that I'd give it a chance.2) The Music. Loved the music even though the majority is rap. It fit the movie perfectly.3) The storyline. I really loved the story and the plot devices. The drama sequences were REALLY good.4) The truth. This movie was pretty much dead-on to Ken Carter's real life experience. I watched the bonus feature ""Coach Carter: The Man Behind The Movie"" and it compared the movie to real life. It was like a perfect match.My favorite lines were at the end spoken by Samuel L. Jackson after the final game. I always watch that every night. It's become kind of like a tradition for me. I showed this to my mom and she instantly fell in love with it, too.So, all in all, really good movie. If I could rate this higher than 10 stars, I would've.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Points awarded for drama NOT for depth,"From the same school of plot development that Dangerous Minds attended, Coach Carter tells the story of the Richmond basketball team who learn that 'student' comes first in 'student athlete'. Clich√© philosophy and lines such as ""I met you as boys and now you're men"" are given pride of place is this film, but for entertainment value and moral fortitude, you can't go far wrong with this effort from the director of Save the Last Dance.The problem with the film as a media text is that it does not stand up to deconstruction. Behind the camera is a director who has no distinctive style. The action packed basketball scenes spice up this drama but never excel beyond music video quality, which is not an insult. The editing is snappy and mixed with the basketball beat of hip hop, the energy of the matches being truly communicated, but no effort is made to do something new with the camera angles. The way to enjoy this film is not to look beneath the surface, instead just allowing yourself to be carried away by the innocent excitement of simplicity.Coach Carter was always going to need a strong lead to gain the substance that is has done. The no nonsense and iron willed demeanour that Samuel L. Jackson brings to the role makes him ideal for putting across the image of a man who can hold court in front of these hard life ghetto teens. What Jackson also brings is an amusing aggressive streak that make the audience glad they are not in the gym with this psycho who, despite pounding his players with endless 'submissions', still locks the gym when their grades don't come through.Carter is a difficult character to understand. He seems ready to refuse entry to hard nut bad boy Timo Cruz (Rick Gonzalez), but caves in when Junior Battle (Nana Gbewonyo) turns up at his shop with his mother and begs forgiveness. As the film progresses however, we learn that Carter is doing everything he can to get his players into college and gain a life worth living, presumably to become what Carter himself has.The players Carter strives to impact upon succumb easily to Carter's will. Occasional outbursts punctuate what is mostly a submissive relationship between coach and team and director Thomas Carter seems focused on delivering a realistic ensemble rather than the typical teen comedy entourage of weird and outrageous characters. It is a little unnerving being thrown into a gym with an unbreakable coach and a group of muscular teenagers who need to work to get average grades and can't roll off witty one-liners like the teenagers in other films in the genre. This decision to communicate realism is brave, but gives the film an enhanced depth that makes the lesson learned at the end more heart warming and honest. The ending is one of the film's three pointers, going against not only the conventions of the genre, but of Hollywood.What lacks is subplot development. Timo Cruz's drug running is given screen time between matches but ends abruptly. Cruz shoots from being a hard case to being a shivering wreck on Carter's doorstep, in need of a strong father figure which I suppose we are to assume Cruz does not have. A little background here would not have been amiss. Cruz's doorstep tears also bring to attention the relationship between Carter and his son Damien (Robert Ri'chard), which appears very son-and-sir in nature. There is a hint of tension beneath the surface that we glimpse at when Damien arrives late at practise, and there may also have been an undertone of jealousy when Carter hugs Cruz, but this is not elaborated upon and there is a slight emptiness in their bond.However, Coach Carter remains entertaining throughout. Realism and drama team-up to hit home hard the lessons that the team learn. Their struggle to overcome the stigma of their stereotypes is captured patiently, yet there is never a dull moment. Samuel L. Jackson brings a mountainous presence to his role that allows the audience to feel the film's extremes of pride and disappointment to a great extent. Involving emotionally and arresting dramatically, but superficial textually (although points awarded for fearlessness in parts of the subject matter).Rating: 3/5 By Joshua Morrall",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
inspiring story,"I was expecting nothing more than a basketball movie and at first was only going to watch this because there was nothing to do. At the end of the movie I was almost going to cry. I loved the movie so much. It wasn't just about basketball, about the story of the greatest basketball coach that ever lived. I loved the move, it was inspiring sad movie with some violence. I think there were about 80 people in the theatre and about 75 ended up crying at the end of the movie. It was detailed and shows how far a coach would go in order to put his team on the path of discipline, honour and commitment. My rating for this movie is an absolute 10/10. Watch this movie-I loved it",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Terrific,"Ken Carter (Jackson) takes over a losing California high school basketball team and employs extreme measures to turn things around.Yes, we have seen this before: a hard-assed coach molds his players into the image he desires for them. Yes, Samuel L. Jackson pontificates a lot in here. But all coaches pontificate to a large degree and it is justified. And, yes, it is a little too long, but so what? The basketball scenes are truly something to behold. The acting all around is excellent. And, yes, this is a terrific movie.Okay, now for the down side. Why does Carter wait until the team is 9-0 to find out his players are not living up the contract they signed with him? The players are falling behind academically and Carter locks them out of the gym until they turn things around. But, waiting until 9-0 doesn't seem to have bothered anyone. Something doesn't seem right here, but no one has questioned this aspect. Even Carter doesn't say he should have looked harder sooner. Why not?Now, in real life Carter owned a sports store. That is probably the reason I kept seeing different uniforms for just about every different game. When some basketball game scenes opened I had to wait until Carter calls the team over to the bench to see what players were his team, and then I knew what color jerseys his team had on. Before that, the action was so fast and furious I couldn't really tell. It's not like the players' faces were widely recognizable to viewers.This is must see movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Sports Film,"Coach Carter was an excellent sports film that will keep you interested the entire movie. Other than basketball, there are many sub-issues that are entertaining such as the players relationships with their girlfriends, the coach's life outside the court as well as many other things.I think this is one of the best basketball films since Hoosiers and any film-goer or sports fan would think the same. Samuel L. Jackson of course did excellent as usual. There were many new actors in the film as well that made there presence known. With the drama on the court, there was also some hysterical scenes which made people laugh and was a good mix into the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"uninspired, and in the same neighborhood as unnecessary","This film is just another entirely ponderous exercise in star power fizzling and prestige film-making gone pretentious. I didn't care for this movie in the least. If this crud makes $1 over its budget, The studio would be wise to declare victory, round up all available copies, store them deep within the nuclear waste repository under Yucca Mountain, and then never make another movie like it again. Coach Carter is a prime example of what happens when there's too little source material for a movie screenplay. The production as a whole is several notches below uninspired, and in the same neighborhood as unnecessary. Don't waste your time with this one.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Coach Carter was a good portrayal of a true story,"I really enjoyed the movie and was actually inspired by the end of the film. The film was a little corny and syrupy from time to time but it was an overall good, positive film. I have read and heard so many comments about the morals and unacceptable behavior portrayed by some of the characters and in turn viewers bad-mouth the film simply because they do not agree with some of the behavior of the some of the characters in the film. But these people obviously missed the point of the film. Coach Carter was trying to instill values that he thought would help an entire community. The reality is that kids do have foul mouths, have unprotected sex, are faced with hard decisions (to have or not have a baby and selling drugs) everyday.We should all be so fortunate to have the opportunity to see a movie that features a person that actually tries to deal with these issues without making judgment calls and instead offer resolutions to problems. He offered resolutions to his team's behavior and left it to them to make the right decisions. This was good because they were able to see the consequences of their actions. When they made the right decision, they were able to see the positive consequences. When they made the wrong decision the players were faced with negative consequences and had no one to blame but themselves.The impact of a person of this magnitude is profound and if some viewers found fault with this movie simply because their reality is a little different at this moment then it was for the characters in this film is very unfortunate for the viewer. Because you never know when you might be faced with a person similar to that in the movie. You just might have to deal with this situation more personally than expected and if this happens what will you do? Because the consequences of your actions in a situation like this will be either positive or negative as well.",,Anonymous,Biography
Rims Out!,"It's a sports movie that presses all the normal sports movie buttons, right through to the emotive climax. Down and out underperforming school basketball team from a poor socio-economic area, is led to salvation (in more ways than one) through the concerted efforts of a charismatic coach, who once attended the same school.Oddly what we don't get in a two and a quarter hour ""biographical"" movie called Coach Carter, is to learn much about the man himself ... Ken Carter. We find out he is a passionate advocate for educational achievement and the chances and choices it can offer those with a will to succeed. We discover a few of the strategies he uses to develop the Richmond Oilers from a position as a lowly rung team to one that can challenge for a schools state championship. In achieving his own goals, unsurprisingly we uncover the fact that he doesn't mind treading on administrative, player and parental toes to attain his ambitions.But that's about it. Yes he has a son called Damien who was also a very skilful player and played for the Oilers. He has some sort of retail business in Richmond and he has a loving wife whose name I'm not sure we even learn by the end of the film, she gets such little screen time. He is wonderfully played by the always distinguished Samuel L Jackson, but we find out little of his background, what makes him tick and why he seemingly, so suddenly wants to make a difference with the team and the team's school. His story is sketched so lightly that he just appears to come from nowhere.Instead much of the running time of this long film explores the lives of some of the team's players and (ironically enough) their families. Apparently (based on the end credits) most are real people, but their stories are similar to what we've seen in any number of similar school/sports/urban teenage films where characters strive to overcome a variety of disadvantages and adversities.The film has solid production values and the basketball choreography is first rate. But I was personally disappointed that by film's conclusion, the title character standing on the sidelines, calling all the shots and making all the big moves, was himself not fleshed out much past the cipher stage.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Earnest After School Special,"Successful sporting goods store owner Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) accepts the basketball coach job from his mentor at his old high school. It's a poor underachieving school. He forces his kids to sign a contract to maintain academics. He calls the kids 'sir' as a sign of respect. It's a struggle with the kids, but it's even more of a struggle with the adults. It climaxes to a point where coach Carter locks out the players when they don't maintain their academics.This is all a very earnest after school special. Coach Carter is a saint beyond reproach. The thing that I wish for is an early ally for Carter. It seems that everybody especially the adults are piling on. Even if true, it doesn't make for a compelling story. It's overkill. An ally could create more complex relationships in the adults of the movie.The other thing I noticed is that the movie reaches its climax around the lockout. The games after the lockout don't have much drama. The movie is about the lockout, not about any championships or game winners.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best movies around,"This movie isn't just about sport but has an underlying moral message which is been shown throughout the film. Sport won't get you far unless your a great but study and hard work in school will get you everywhere. Enter, a town that is quite poor and a basketball team who just want to win. Once Ken Carter accepts the job, the whole team changes and it is for the better. Another message this film teaches is respect, at the beginning just after meeting the boys, Ken expresses a need for the boys to show respect not only for themselves but for their friends and elders. He does this by explaining how the word 'nigger' can be used as a degrading term and how by dressing themselves with respect, behaving respectfully isn't bad at all.As soon as I saw this film, I knew that I wanted to see it. It has everything that makes a great movie, action, great dialog and most importantly, a good moral message and in a time where morally corrupt movies are on the rise, a great movie like this is a rare find.Intiallly, my friends didn't want to see this movie with me as they thought it was boring, and too intense but after months and months of waiting, I finally hired it out on DVD and watched it.You can actually take things away from this movie and it has a very good morals which can be applicable to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Violence, Poverty, and Basketball","I grew up 3 blocks from the Richmond border, and am all too familiar with the poverty, violence, and desperation that plagues its residents. In Richmond, like in many parts of this country, young men cope with the rough environment in which they grew up by playing basketball (jerseys are sported by just about any boy under 22).Having gone to high school with these kids (or rather with the Richmond kids who were bussed to my local high school), I became familiar with their subculture. What struck me most about the movie was just how well it captured the boys that I knew from Richmond. Maybe urban culture is the same around the country, but having grown up near Richmond and San Pablo (another neighboring city), they were the only urban youth with whom I was familiar.By the way, in case anyone was wondering about the party in the wealthy neighborhood to which the Richmond basketball team was invited, here in the San Francisco Bay Area, the communities are so close together that it is not uncommon for kids from poorer areas to hang out in areas that are more affluent, or to go to parties in those areas. However, I have heard that in other parts of the country, the ""borders"" between urban areas and the suburbs are not as fluid.I do not remember reading about the dramatic victories of the Richmond High basketball team in the local paper, but I did take a community college class taught by an instructor who my mother told me once had Coach Carter in his class, and many of my clients have kids who were or are students at Richmond High.After seeing so many films about events that took place years ago and far away, it was refreshing to see an interesting film about a community with which I am somewhat familiar. This film is worth at least a rental, particularly if you are from the East Bay.On another note: Go, CAL Bears.....",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not your average basketball movie,"While basketball is used as the backdrop for the movie, Coach Carter really isn't about basketball. The real heart of the movie is in the way Coach Carter begins to turn the lives around of the players on his basketball team by showing them that someone actually cares about what happens to them after high school.At one point in the movie Carter (played perfectly by Samuel L. Jackson) asks a player why he plays basketball and he responds with ""to win the state title"" - which of course gets him high fives from the rest of the team. Carter then asks the team who won the state title last year and nobody knows the answer. Carter tries to show his players that high school basketball is not about winning but about discipline, respect and the confidence to accomplish any goal.If you are thinking about going to see Coach Carter as a basketball movie, I suggest seeing another movie, but if you want to see a truly inspiring story go see Coach Carter.",,Anonymous,Biography

"Good movie, but...","Samuel L. Jackson is one of my favorite actors and I absolutely respect him and he was excellent. However, the storyline drifted several times.

I came to watch a movie about basketball and see Mr. Jackson kick some ass, not see some 25yo men play 18yo's in another version of Dawson's Creek, also known as, Adults who pretend to play Teens.Overall, the movie was good. I loved Mr. Jackson, he was excellent. At one point I almost expected to hear, ""I don't remember asking you a god damn thing... sirs.""It's another one of those, because your black you deserve better type movies.Sameul L.

Terrific,"I have a few reasons for loving this movie:1. It's a sports movie and there's hardly a sports movie that I don't like.2. It's a true story which makes it doubly good.3. It's based in Richmond which is close to where I grew up.""Coach Carter"" was a different kind of sports movie. Sure, it involved a worst-to-first element and a hard nosed coach ala ""Remember the Titans"" and ""Miracle,"" but it was monumentally different in that Coach Ken Carter (played by Samuel L. Jackson) wasn't all about basketball. He was willing to halt basketball altogether if that's what it took for his players to focus on school and pick up their grades.What makes this movie, and Coach Carter's move, so compelling is that he had a winning basketball team. When Carter took over the Richmond High School hoops team they had just come off of a 4-22 season. That's atrocious by any estimation. Coach Carter promised to make them winners if they followed his plan, but before any of that, every player would have to sign a contract. The main precepts of the contract were that they'd be on time for practice, maintain a 2.3 GPA, sit at the front of their classes, and wear a tie on game day. These are not unreasonable demands, but you'd have thought he asked for them to give blood the way some of the players reacted.Those that signed the contract and adhered to Carter's rules were allowed to play. What was the result? They were winners. They became very good. In fact, they were undefeated until Coach Carter received some progress reports and saw failing grades. It was then that he cancelled practices and games due to the players' failure to meet the terms of the contracts they signed. It was a ballsy move, but it truly illustrated how serious Carter was about these kids' education.How many of us have the strength and fortitude to do the same? How many of us would bar our winning team from playing because they were failing? It's easy to lockout a losing team, but then that wouldn't be a story anyway--but locking out an undefeated team?!?! That's what men of principle do.As a production and as a story I loved this movie, although I think Ashanti was seriously miscast. Someone forgot to inform her that she was playing someone from Richmond, California not Brooklyn, New York. As a California native it drove me crazy every time she spoke, like ""You are not in New York!""I had to get that off of my chest.In spite of Ashanti, ""Coach Carter"" was a terrific movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unoriginal but serviceable and fairly uplifting sports drama,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsEx military man Ken Carter (Samuel L Jackson) now owns a sports store but wants to dedicate his spare time to doing something else- being coach to the basketball team of Richmond High School, whose poor discipline and lack of direction has seen them lose nearly every game in the season. The tough-little-gangsta wannabe boys initially show their usual disrespect and un-cooperativeness to the coach, but they soon learn he will not take the cr*p they're used to giving other coaches before him and step into line a little. Despite their initial dislike, Carter comes to do something no other teacher in the system has done before him- respect the boys and actually push them to achieve in a system that ""is designed for them to fail"", but also to show them that that respect has to be earned and that if they abuse it, they will suffer. So when their academic performance fails to improve, he cancels the basketball games for a while. This incurs the wrath of the boys, their parents, other teachers and the community as a whole, but in time, Carter's decision will come to reward the boys and change their lives in ways they never imagined.Coach Carter can hardly be described as original- the story has been done quite a few times before (Dangerous Minds, Mr Holland's Opus- right down to the true story part.) But this doesn't stop it from being any less effective as a film for what it is. It succeeds in being engaging, inspirational and uplifting. Perhaps not the greatest film of it's kind ever, but a pleasing effort certainly.As Carter, the heavily working Jackson assumes a natural command and presence. He is pretty much the driving force of the film, but he couldn't have done it without a solid supporting cast, providing some emotive sub-plots and great depth to the story.It's certainly been produced by MTV alright, as the soundtrack boasts a heap of current popular tracks that anyone over here familiar with the top 40 tracks will know. And it's a great vehicle to appeal to hip younger cinema-goers. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
What studio exec bribed the critics into praising any aspect of this crap?,"This film appeals to the unintelligent and maybe to teenagers. It's a true shame because most movies are made for that demographic. I had much higher hopes for this film. To begin with, This is lazy storytelling. Anyone who thinks this is a classic needs to get out more. What studio exec bribed the critics into praising any aspect of this crap? I wanted this movie to be better than it was, but when you start desperately trying to fool yourself into believing a movie is good, eventually it falls apart and you can see it for what it is. In a case like this, the blame should not rest entirely on the director's shoulders. The screenwriter has to share equal responsibility; the characters are spouting his banal dialogue, and this drama sputters at an alarming rate.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Samuel L. Jackson Makes The Intense Coach Carter Come To Life.,"There are many movies similar in plot and theme to Coach Carter but this movie stands well on it's own. Most of the credit for that has to go to the star, Samuel L. Jackson. They could not have found a better man to play this role. I do not know much about the coach this movie is based on, but I can not imagine anything better or stronger than what Jackson has given us here.The story is pretty much like any other. A former basketball star from the early 70's is asked to coach this year's team due to the fact that the old coach is not able to keep the kids focused on their grades, coming to class, etc. Where this movie differs, and what makes this better than most movies of this type, is the depth it goes into in most of the players on the team. The bigger stars have their own back stories and reasons for why they are the way they are.Obviously, judging the acting, Samuel L. Jackson is head and shoulders above the rest but others who stand out here are Rick Gonzalez, Antwon Tanner and Robert Ri'chard. Each of these guys played their characters to a tee. Overall, if you want to see an inspiring movie and feel like it accomplished it's purpose at the end, I can recommend Coach Carter to you. 8/10",,Anonymous,Biography
Just like any other sport movie and very predictable but well played role by Samuel L. Jackson,"I saw Coach Carter about a week ago and I knew from beginning to end that the movie was not going to be very good. I wasted about 6 dollars to see a movie that I was invited too which I shouldn't of gone and should've seen The Aviator. In my opinion, Coach Carter is just like any other sport movie. In almost every sport movie it's always a person who cheers the team up that was bad into a good team who cares for each other. I mean that's fine, it's just way to predictable. Besides from the negatives, I thought that Samuel L. Jackson who played Coach Carter was fantastic. I mean he really played a good role just like all the other good films he has done such as Pulp Fiction. Overall, a fair film with some good scenes and good acting but to predictable and sometimes less interesting.Hedeen's outlook: 5.5/10 *+ D+",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A testament to the power of sport,"There were lots of striking similarities between Coach Carter and Remember the Titans which I also watched recently. Both based on real events, they tell the story of a sports team who are anything but a team, too used to losing and with no hope of redemption. Enter the stern coach who shakes things up, gets them winning, teaching them respect and discipline along the way.I must say I love these types of stories. Sports movies can often be overlooked as a genre, but there is so much heart, passion, emotion and character in the majority that I have seen. Despite the subject matter, don't think that this film is purely for basketball fans. I've never watched a second of basketball in my life but was engrossed nonetheless in the trials and tribulations of the players and the team. This is a human story as much as it is a sports one, with an emphasis off the court for lots of the film.The biggest triumph of this film for me is Samuel L. Jackson's performance. The character of Ken Carter was a deeply interesting one, but interesting because of his simplicity. He was a man with a firm set of principles from which he never wavered, making him a central and unmovable force in the movie. The rest of the cast were equally great, particularly Rick Gonzalez as Timo Cruz, one of the more volatile members of the team.I also thought that the script was very solid. There's nothing I love more than a good motivational sports related speech, which Coach Carter has aplenty, all excellently delivered by Sam Jackson.For any sports film you want the actual sports element to be realistic. As mentioned I've never watched basketball, but it seemed pretty real to me. Good camera work during the games, nice flowing montages, creation of suspense. Not much more I could ask for from the basketball action.Last but not least the soundtrack for Coach Carter was spot on, matching the tone and vibe of the film exactly.Coach Carter, much like Remember the Titans, is a testament to the power of sports, expertly demonstrating that its not just a game. Sport is so much more and informs and develops every facet of an individuals life, which Coach Carter displays in bucket loads. A great film which will lift you up and provide 2 hours of solid entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
'Carter' Coached By Formula,"Coach Carter ***/*****There have been a slew of sports stories to hit the multiplex in the last few years. They all have enough in common that we get tired of them yet they each have their own ""thing"" that makes them unique enough that we go to see them just to see what this story has that the others didn't. The inspirational, uplifting, based on a true story sports tales are a dime a dozen because, essentially, every athlete is one of these stories. What makes the boys of Friday Nigh Lights any different that your local high school football team? What makes coach Carter's players any different than any other teenage boys?In the latest version of 'talented players with bad coach get good coach and start winning', Samuel L. Jackson plays coach Cater who comes to coach at his old high school where more kids end up in prison that end up with college diplomas. He is on a mission not only to improve the game record for the basketball team but to also improve the academic standing of his players. The boys live in a predominantly poor black neighborhood and all the stereotypes of this lifestyle show up to bat. Boy who's girlfriend is pregnant, the tough guy who hangs with his older cousin and gets into trouble although the camera makes it painfully obvious that he will be ""saved"" in the end and the one who tries to be that ""savior"".Perhaps the movie shouldn't be ridiculed for following formula. After all, that is what sells and if movies didn't make back their costs, we'd have to find new ways to spend Friday nights. But the problem with formula is that we get tired of it when it's over used and man oh man is this formula getting old. It's almost akin to watching the day in life of anybody played before your eyes over and over and over again. You know who is going to say what, when and why and after a while you stop caring. The inspirational speeches coaches give at halftime of the pivotal game don't actually exist, you know.But, like romantic comedies, horror and thriller films, when formula is twisted in some way or another, the movies are better than those that never had a pattern to work with in. The Sixth Sense is the classic horror film with a twist. It just happened to be such a good twist that it essentially became its own sub-genre of thriller films. A film like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is just a romantic comedy. It's just¬Öbackwards¬Öand sideways. Whatever. The point is that it's a distorted version of what we're used to and, as a result, it has become a film with a growing fan base that is loyal to the extent that they might as well be called a cult.Coach Carter, although not exactly revolutionary in the ways these two films are, had a chance to be. There is an entire sub-plot devoted to the academic progress of the basketball players. ""They're student athletes. Student comes first."" The point where this story is wrapped up also coincides with an ending of sorts to the athlete story. If, at this point, the filmmakers had chosen to end the film, they would have created a story more about the student than the athlete, making them not just another based on a true story sports film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

the movie is inspirational without being preachy and Samuel L.Jackson puts on an acting clinic,"there are many 'based on true events,underdog stories' made into movies.but this one is different.yes,it is inspirational,but it isn't preachy and schmaltzy like so many have been.maybe the studios are finally seeing the light.after all,this is the second recent movie of the genre(that i have seen) to get it right,the other being ""Glory Road"".as for ""Coach Carter"",it's a pretty subdued affair.it focuses on a High School basketball coach(Samuel.L.Jackson)who has a vision for the students at his school.not only will they become winners on the basketball court,but they will also be inners off.this means as human beings,they will lose he loser,mediocrity mentality which has been ingrained intro them,by the school system and even their parents.of course,he meets fierce opposition.does he succeed in this vision?well,lets just say things don't go quite the way you might expect them to.this movie is very character and story driven,so don't expect a lot of action.there aren't that many basketball sequences.much of the movie takes place off the court.but the movie works for 3 reasons.first,its ability to tell an inspirational story without bringing out the sledgehammer.second,the the supporting performances are all credible.but more important is the masterful acting of Samuel L.Jackson.the man is simply mesmerizing.you believe every second of his performance.the man has great screen presence and charisma and the emotion he conveys is real.the movie is long,but it's all about getting there,not being there,and the journey is worth it,in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
i love this movie...,"I can honestly relate to this movie. I am a female athlete and all through my high school years i've seen athletes get passed because they play sports. It's mostly the guys though. We have a coach that made every boy failing a subject get a tutor. This movie reminded me a lot of him. Not many coaches put their jobs on the line for the benefit of the kids. I agree with what he did 100% and i know lots of others do too. The movie shows perfect detail of how students act in schools and out of school. I went and saw it two nights in a row and each time, i saw different things about the movie. It's a great movie and I think all coaches and teachers should see it. It shows that most athletes are passed because they are athletes, not because they have the grades.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Adequate and sufficient, it's a real film!","During a flight to Korea, I saw some quick ADD-like editing and knew immediately that I was in for an MTV film. And I was right. This film, apparently based on the true story of a real Coach Carter was one of the last films that I paid attention to on the flight.I've seen good sports movies and I've seen bad sports movies. One thing that I can say about sports movies is that they're very similar to melodramas, living heavily on sentiment and total utter cheesiness. Coach Carter is very much a real sports movie. Combining after-school special drama with basketball, it weaves together the story of a coach that turned his team around and their lives in the process.The problem with the film is that its portrayal of the characters is shallow. I think it's because it tries to follow too many dramatic arcs, too many characters that it tries to develop, but ultimately finds itself not developing any of the characters enough. Even though it possesses a Rocky-type ending, it still can't seem to avoid the shackle that's plagued most MTV films and after-school specials. It's too preachy. It's too sentimental. And it's too shallow.However, the acting is adequate and the directing is sufficient. Generally, the film does end up coming together as a real film. Another sports film, like many other sports films, but a watchable one nonetheless. It helped the international flight go by easier, but I don't think that I'd want to watch it again. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Unexpected Hit,"I'm not usually one who will watch a movie about sports, much less about sports that I don't actively follow or care for. Since Samuel Jackson was in it, I knew that the movie was going to be 'good' but how good still remained a mystery. I decided to give it a go, and check it out, without even watching any previews or trailers. It was a complete shot in the dark. This movie was great! It was a real thrill to watch, even for someone who knows nothing about the rules of the game. Knowledge about the game had no impact on the enjoy-ability of the movie. So, for all of you with hesitations, just check it out. It was like a mix between Remember the Titans and Lean On Me. All the actors who played the kids, parents, and even the background characters, did a great job and deserve credit and applause for their hard work. This movie as a whole was great, but I don't think the movie would have been anywhere near as good as it was if it didn't have Samuel Jackson in it.

My Favourite Samuel L. Jackson Movie,"I'm not saying that this is the best film Samuel L. Jackson ever made, or that it's his finest performance. He's been a busy actor with a huge body of work, after all. But I will say that ""Coach Carter"" is probably my favourite Samuel L. Jackson movie. And his performance as Coach Ken Carter is very good, and the overall story is quite inspiring. It's a hopeful movie to watch; one that promises that things and people can turn around, and that those who could be expected to fall by the wayside can rise to the top - not just in basketball (which is the setting of this movie) but also in life. As Carter, Jackson is playing the coach of the Richmond High School basketball team. It's an inner city school that graduates only 50% of its students, few of whom actually go on to college. The basketball team is made up of a bunch of boys who couldn't care less about school, who get into trouble outside school and who lose over and over on the court. Carter comes in and lays down the law, expecting student athletes to be students first and athletes second - trying to teach them how to be winners, not only on the court but off. Along the way he faces opposition from the players themselves, their parents, their teachers, the principal and the school board - but he stands up straight, stares his detractors down and shuts down the basketball program (after having led the team to 16 straight wins) because not enough of the players are keeping up their academic end of the bargain. Ultimately he takes this group of boys - who could have just been written off as losers - to the state championship tournament, and sees many of them go to college and progress into successful lives.That's the story. It's inspiring. It's also (to be honest) entirely formulaic. It's a formula that works - which is why it's been used repeatedly for decades - but it's still a formula: Principal/Teacher/Coach takes over troubled School/Classroom/Team, gets tough and turns everything around. Usually (as here) the story is based on true events - making it even more inspiring. But it is still a formula - there's a predictability to this. You've seen it before, even if you haven't seen the movie before. But the performances from Jackson and the young actors who played the members of the team (and from Ashanti, who played Kyra, the girlfriend of one of the players) does manage to keep it seeming fresh and alive at the same time.Sure you can quibble about the timeline being off (for example, Carter took over the team in 1997 and the year of the lockout was 1999, not just a few weeks after he became coach) but chalk those things up to dramatic license. The basics are accurate enough, and the movie's an inspiring, feel-good story about a man who made a difference in a lot of young lives. Who can really argue with that?

When the highlight of your life may not be the light at the end of the tunnel...,"There are many ""key moment"" in Thomas Carter's ""Coach Carter"" (fitting coincidence but no relation) but one left a stronger impact. By the way, I think it is the mark of great storytelling to be able to summarize the spirit and philosophy of the film thorough one simple piece of dialogue, one little ""Touch√©"" line. Here it is:Richmond High School principal Garrison (Denise Dowse) berates the new coach Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson in one of his best performances) for having locked the basketball court, suspended the then-undefeated team just because the players had poor grades at school. Her point was: why would you prevent kids from impoverished and crime-stricken neighborhood from what is certainly the highlight of their lives.Having finished then, she allows Carter to retort: ""well I think that's the problem"". Touch√©.It is the credit of the film's intelligence to have two valid points made by disagreeing characters, this is not a black-and-white issue but the point of Carter is superior because it is vital, not existential but vital, for a few players, it is literally a matter of life and death. The second key moment echoes that situation: Timo Cruz (Rick Gonzalez) a talented (but tormented) player with one foot in each world: sport and crime, ends up thanking the coach for having saved his life, he's half-right, it's true Carter saved him but not through sport but through that third option called education.Getting a scholarship isn't the key to happiness or a guarantee for success but if anything, it generates more life options, and open more doors, and it's precisely because these Richmond kids have a likeliness to end up in jail or unemployed if not killed by crime or those who fight it, that the option is vital. The whole irony of Carter's ordeal is that his ""politics"" earns him the ire of parents who share the same view than school counselors: these young men need basketball, it keeps them away from drugs, from the streets and one or two might catch the eye of a talent scout. They too make valid points, but as parents who care for their offspring, they're likely to miss the ""big picture"". Not the team, not the Oilers, the bigger picture and it's a rhyming word: the future.When Carter suspends it in 1999, drawing media attention on the school, he explains that the system shouldn't encourage any of its student to pursue a sport activity at the expenses of their education. Coddling them like that is demeaning and dangerous, and he won't be part of that game.Which leads me to the third key scene, preceding those I mentioned. Timo had left the team and decided to join it again. He's given a series of pushups and 'suicides' moves that consist of back-and-forth running across the court for for Friday and just when it seems that he won't make it, his teammates finish the job. The scene works better with the context.It's interesting that the Oilers' flaw isn't their lack of talent, they got it but they lack focus, discipline and heart, and they're ready to blame each other. Carter (a former Richmond student and basketball player) observes them during the game and one glimpse at the team arguing in the locker prompts him to accept the deal. He could diagnose the problem and I have a suspicion his son inspired him to take the challenge.Damian (Robert Ri'chard) had the benefit of a better education (private school) and perhaps Daddy wanted to prove himself that they could do as well if they set their minds to it. Ironically, Damien would drop his school for Richmond to play under his father's coaching. Refusing would be like contradicting himself, if it's a matter of discipline, commitment and education. Well, so be it.That's what I tell my student in middle high school, you've got to believe in your potential and not play the victim card, learning to take criticism is the first step to adulthood.Speaking of which, at first, it seems that the film is a retread of Hoosiers with the Jackson coming to sergeant-drill the team. They don't respect him first but he manages to calm them down, not without resorting to badass moves. But when he give them contracts asking them to keep their grades at C+ level, I knew this was going to be good because as I always said a good sport movie is always about something that goes beyond sport, it's life, self-respect. Name it.""Coach Carter"" is mainly about responsibility and choice. There's a fourth key scenes when the team make a collective decision, one that echoes the film's interrogative leitmotif: ""what is your deepest fear?"" The beauty of that moment forbids me to spoil it.The film's not just about Carter, there's an interesting subplot with the captain Kenyon Stone (Rob Brown) struggling to deal with the pregnancy of his girlfriend (Ashanti), she seems happy but he knows it won't be a free ride any lesser movies would have ended that with a sort of halfway solution. I must say that the way the problem was solved spoke highly of the girl's maturity and echoed the message delivered by Carter. Make your move.Another conflict with a player Junior Battle (Nana Gbewonyo) suspended because he skipped the team, it allows Octavia Spencer who plays her mom to come plea her son's case and remind us that there are parents who are in perpetual coaching and sometimes behind every angry kid, there's a painful trauma. And even the most hardened coach should learn to 'let it go'.Behind its fa√ßade of underdog / hood movie, the film manages to surprise you from a scene to another, when celebrating a victory can be problematic or dealing with a defeat can ennoble you. It's a matter of priorities, and even the so-called highlight doesn't mean the light at the end of the tunnel.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Coach Carter allows its powerful true story to shine through Samuel Jackson's performance and the focus on the lives of the young men Coach Carter coached.,"Coach Carter is the inspiring true story of a coach that cared much more about the lives and future of his players than winning a game. Samuel Jackson was the perfect choice to play no-nonsense but compassionate Coach Ken Carter that believed in his players while holding them to standards that changed their lives. While the movie is about basketball, the focus is much more on the relationships and development of its characters.

This is a feel good sports story based on a real life story.,"This is a very feel good sports story around a real life high school basketball coach named Ken Carter, who is played by Samuel L. Jackson. Coach Carter was a controversial California coach as he not only made his players sign a contract agreeing to an academic standard higher than required, suits and tie on game day, class attendance and sitting in the front row of class. When some of his players don't meet the academic standards, Coach Carter puts a chain and lock on the gym...forfeiting games until the team got their grades up. The team had an undefeated record when this occurred, causing huge public outcry and a controversy that was taken to the school board. The team eventually gets their collective grades up and goes on to the state championship tournament.Samuel L. Jackson makes this film that has strong performances by most of the cast including Channing Tatum. If you are a basketball fan or a fan of sports films...I highly recommend it. It really appeals to anyone who likes to root for the underdog. It also was really nice to see emphasis put on academics in a sports arena...and the real coach had all of his players graduate high school and a handful get into college! This is an impressive feat for an impoverished inner-city school.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not Very Original,"I saw this movie, and I think that Coach Carter is by far one of the worst films to come out so far this year. The reason being is that this film explores an all to much explored genre of basketball and failing athletes and the one person that can reach them. As far as this one goes, I felt throughout the whole thing that I had seen something like this before; which is probably true. The acting was mediocre, S.L Jackson acts the same as he does in all his now typecast roles. The predictability in the movie is astounding, which spoiled it for me for the most part. I think it succeeds as far as trying to entertain people, it does that on the level that most who went to see it can relate to, but as far as an original piece of art, this movie leaves little to the imagination.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Coach Carter,"When the eponymous coach (Samuel L. Jackson) arrives at Richmond High School, he inherits a disparate group of guys who play basketball as they take life - casually with little responsibility. Their grades are low and so their futures unlikely to break the cycle of poverty and lack off opportunity. He decides to try and break that by insisting that they sign contracts before they can play. These require perfect attendance, no late-coming and grade averages that will ensure they graduate. There's resistance from the team and from their parents, but thanks to a bit of help from the principal (Denise Dowse) he sticks to his guns and they have to accept his ultimatum. The remainder of the film follows his attempts to mould something cohesive from these young men as they, themselves, deal with issues that impact on their own lives. Carter's dream is not a forgone conclusion here. Though there is an element of predictability to the development of the story, his charges do not routinely conform to his grand design and as he gradually builds a functioning (and winning) team, he also realises that their academic focus is what's lacking. That's his biggest challenge. They can't make a living playing ball, but it can be a conduit to an education that can stand them in good stead in the future - and that's the real message here. As with so many people growing up in an environment devoid of opportunity, sport can prove to galvanise people. It can offer hope, introduce the benefits of team building and inter-reliance and ultimately help to prioritise for what's to come. Jackson puts in a strong effort here, and the writing also helps succinctly tell a story that Rick Gonzalez, Rob Brown and Anton Tanner also contribute well to as they represent the men who just initially want to play with little appreciation of the profound chance being offered them. It is too long, and towards the end the story does rather run out of steam, but as a real-life coming of age story it still works well.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
'Hoosiers' meets 'Stand and Deliver',"Sports films always at least have the advantage that artificial drama can always be conjured up from the uncertainty of the outcome of a particular sporting event. Films set in under-privileged neighbourhoods have the advantage that they are able to show us that there is good in all of us and we can overcome adversity, if only we try hard enough.Films that are both set in the ghetto and about sporting endeavour have, thus, two advantages. 'Coach Carter' milks its two advantages and turns out to be a highly entertaining, if unoriginal, pot-boiler. Jackson is fine as the tough-nut 'made good' former street kid given the job of beating a bunch of apparent no-hoper school basketball players into shape. We get all of the social stuff... drugs, unwanted pregnancies, academic under-achievement. That's par for the course.We also get some excellent sidebar characters, like a realist head-mistress who turns idealist, and a massively over-weight mother who dominates her tough-nut son.The film is, finally, just an amalgam of 'Hoosiers' (1986) and 'Stand and Deliver' (1988) - both substantially superior films. It is, however, worth the price of admission for the ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
good! excellent!,"This movie is not just your average movie. It sends out a very powerful message to everyone out there. It particularly applies to the growing minorities. The message was to look at the quality of life and standard of living that our parents have and to ask ourselves if that is the kind of life that we want for ourselves or do we want to do better in life. This movie goes way beyond the scenes of high school life and it has to do with not being inferior and having desire to persevere in life. The question is do we want to be average or do we want better for ourselves. Going to college will not only enhance our chances of being better educated, but it will also enable us to have the ability of having a higher standard of living. Without an education, there is very little that we can accomplish in life and we are nothing without it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Even if you don't like basketball...,"you'll love this movie! It is a classic old school battle between students (players) and teacher (in this case coach), but it really hits home on some of the major obstacles facing our youth today. It is a wonderful film that offers an array of solutions, extreme as they may be.Early on the film begins with coach Carter slamming one of his belligerent new players into the gym wall only to hear the player whine ""teachers aren't supposed to touch students."" The rest of the film proves how teachers and coaches can touch students in other than physical ways to effect positive growth and change.Ever wanted to know what goes on at the high school dance? This movie holds no punches in showing what is hot and what is not when it comes to todays dances and parties. This might jar some memories!In the end, this film is a lot more than the typical ""you can succeed when things are really tough"" film. In fact, the ending is not exactly what I anticipated. Although the film is built around some very good basketball action, the center focus is on the growing up process, accountability, parent involvement, and the idea that ones actions really do have consequences that effect not only themselves, but those they hold dear. And yes, in the end success that goes beyond the scoreboard.I loved it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Inspirational story about a coach that actually teaches.,"Samuel L. Jackson is amazing as always as Coach Ken Carter, a good coach who takes a job at a down and out school as the basketball coach. He's not afraid to tell the students what he thinks of them, and he believes in discipline. Upon seeing that all of the kids on the team are failing their classes, he tells them they can't play basketball until they've brought up their grades.The acting in the film is really good, and the story is great. This movie is just like every other high school or elementary school sport movie (Remember the Titans, Hardball, Glory Road), with a group of poor kids who get a coach who pushes himself to the limit for his players, but this one has a particularly good message.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Parts Hoosiers, Dead Poets Society and Lean on Me","Parts Hoosiers, part Dead Poet's Society and part Lean on Me, Samuel L. Jackson stars as high school basketball coach Ken Carter in the new MTV/Paramount release, Coach Carter.Inspired by a true story, Ken Carter was responsible for turning around the basketball athletic program at Richmond High School by less than conventional methods. Carters' philosophy was that education was far more important than any athletic achievement and he had each of the team members sign a contract that agrees to some significant terms. Included in the personal agreements were to maintain a 2.3 grade point average, to attend every class and sit in the front row and to wear a jacket and tie on game days. In return, the players get the benefit of his coaching tutelage and the use of a gym facility for their training regiment.Getting the lowly Richmond team to work as a team would be a tougher job than expected. With a 4-20 something record the year previous, there was much room for improvement and the teenage kids were acting like, well, teenagers when given their first dose of authority. But things do get off to a rousing start until coach gets their progress reports from the teaching faculty and shuts down the gym forfeiting two matches 16 games into the successful season.This caused quite an uproar in the community and gave Carter some media attention back in 1999. Perceived as taking away the highlight of an adolescent's school memory while striking a blow to an incredible turnaround in achievement, parents convened in a town-hall type meeting to vote on the future of the imposed lockout and ultimately the future of coach Carter. The result can all be determined if you have seen any of the three movies I listed in the opening paragraph, and the team does get to play at least one more memorable game towards their legacy.Coach Carter comes from a very short line of good basketball films. In fact, this side of professional hockey, there is not much other than 1986's Hoosiers and Spike Lee's He Got Game there is not much to cheer about (sorry Blue Chips). However, Coach Carter does prove to be inspirational and the basketball game footage and camera angles are maybe the best ever filmed to represent the fast paced sport.Samuel L. Jackson does his best Samuel L. Jackson impression and is believable as a coach that would put in the time and energy into a thankless ($1,500/year thankless) coaching position. The kids too also pull off just enough to make the strong glide down court without feeling as if we are traveling towards an expected conclusion.There were some liberties taken that are truly evident. The fact that two high school teams can score 14 points between them with less than two minutes left in the game yet only get 70-odds for the entire contest was a bit hard to believe (but not impossible so I am told).But the major problem with Coach Carter was the running time. Clocking in at an unnecessary 136 minutes, there are far too many musical montages of Carter thinking alone in the gym or the team walking through the school halls. It was as if MTV films was trying to squeeze a double disc CD complication out of the experience, and I quite frankly could have cared less for these non-story moving moments.So too could the team members quitting the team ended up on the cutting room floor. They walk away only to come back only to walk away again. Surely, some amalgamation of the events could have been conjured to keep things on a forwards progress.But these are small nitpicks for what is overall a very enjoyable and moving experience. Coach Carter does deliver the goods and even though your bum might take time to forgive you for shuffling in your seat for two plus hours, at least the final result is a film that kids and parents alike can enjoy and hopefully draw inspiration from. And that my friends is a slam dunk.www.gregsrants.com",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Inspiring Story of an inner city coach who values education & basketball.,"Although too long this inspiring story shows what one man can do when he believes in kids that the school system gives up on. This is a must-see movie not only for inner city kids and their parents but for everyone. It shows that when athletes are challenged intellectually as well as athletically they can surprise beyond expectations. Samuel L Jackson is excellent as Coach Carter. The principal athletes are very believable. The basketball scenes are good just not great. Carter's speeches to the players are believable and inspirational. The only disappointing thing about the movie is the one dimensional roles given to the girls, especially the over concentration on the cheerleaders. Well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
True Story Hollywood Style,"I suppose it is to this picture's credit that, for a story so familiar to us all, it manages to be reasonably entertaining despite an overblown running time and some seriously broad strokes when it comes to the characterisation of the boys in the basketball team. Jackson gives a typically dynamic performance, and is really what keeps the film so watchable. Everybody else just sort of blends into the background when he's around, which is quite appropriate really when you consider the generic nature of their characters. Based on a true story, you can't help feeling, due to the sometimes overly neat plot developments, that the writers, in true Hollywood fashion, have played hard and fast with those true moments they claim to bring to the screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Jackson is great as Coach Carter, probably one of his best roles ( see also ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Coming To America"", ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"") and the cast of unknowns also does a solid job. The basketball action is good, the practice sessions are brilliant and the school stuff is also done well.

Teaching Discipline and Values really Works,"Coach Carter is an admirable giant of a man and I enjoyed this film tremendously! I love the way that he knew what his team of young men needed and then he stuck to his plan. In spite of phenomenal pressure to back down, he had them sign a contract that forced them to change their attitudes to the game and ultimately to life itself. The team were mainly ""lost"" young men whose lives were being dictated by their peers and circumstances, but CC had the solution. He helped them to learn respect for themselves and their community.In the end, I felt that this film was about understanding and teaching life values to a group who had lost their way. Once the team realised that the reason he was doing these things was because he cared about them, they began to bond and then acted like a proper team.In society today, we sadly see a breakdown in discipline and respect in the home and at school, it inevitably leads to unhappiness and misery for everyone concerned (read 2 Timothy 3:1-5).Today, many parents want their kids to be their friend first and so rarely say no to them, what the youngster really needs is a loving parent and firm guidance! Firm, loving discipline and relevant encouragement always works out for the best; our youngsters feel safer and they thrive knowing that we care about them don't they? They then grow into much more rounded and productive members of society. Most people who have seen this film have felt the warmth that Ken Carter had for his team and the way that he helped them realise their potential as men. What a great example for any of us who are teachers or parents.Thank youTony Jw.org",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good Film. Not A Basketball Film.,"Now I enjoyed this film on it's merits and as a teenager as it was a teen film mainly. The attempts at an ""inspirational"" angle were good and all respect to the young actors in the film, Jackson was excellent as ever.

"Waste of Money, Film & Time","This is the best review that I've read about this movie: >This film appeals to the unintelligent and maybe to teenagers. It's a true shame because most movies are made for that demographic. I had much higher hopes for this film. To begin with, This is lazy storytelling. Anyone who thinks this is a classic needs to get out more. What studio exec bribed the critics into praising any aspect of this crap? I wanted this movie to be better than it was, but when you start desperately trying to fool yourself into believing a movie is good, eventually it falls apart and you can see it for what it is. In a case like this, the blame should not rest entirely on the director's shoulders. The screenwriter has to share equal responsibility; the characters are spouting his banal dialogue, and this drama sputters at an alarming rate.<",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

There are so many thought provoking lines from Carter, such as saying ""That's exactly the problem"" when responding to the principal's accusation of him taking the highlight of the students life away.

Basketball is a privilege which he feels that have to earn, by dressing right, behaving right and by getting good grades. To him basketball is more than the only thing in life. This of course causes a good many problems.This was much better than I expected and I made it all the way through it although walking in I thought I might walk out.

"You said we're a team. One person struggles, we all struggle. One person triumphs, we all triumph.","Coach Carter is based on a true story, in which Richmond High School head basketball coach Ken Carter made the headlines in 1999 for locking out his undefeated team due to their poor academic results. This, at a time when the team was excelling out on the court, caused a furious reaction from the parents, the town and principals alike.You have seen one uplifting sport movie then you have seen them all it would seem. From the likes of comedy fluff such as Major League, to the more serious approach in productions like Remember the Titans et al, the formula is prescribed to leave a warming glow come the inevitable finale. What helps these types of movies succeed of course, is if the film is based around a true story, such as this one is, and more crucially, if the main actor is able to fully grab the viewers attention and hold it as formulae and ennui threaten to take control. Enter Samuel L. Jackson as Ken Carter.Jackson, the work-horse that he is, has a CV that is as up and down as an automated Big-Dipper. What isn't in question is that he is always value for money, even in garbage like The Man. Here, he elevates Coach Carter above the yarn status that it looks on the page. Ken Carter was a rich character, a man who wanted to keep his charges out of prison and the morgue. To get them to be all they can be as they move from being boys to becoming men, both on the court and in the classroom. Basketball is merely one slice of the pie, Ken Carter wants them to be fully formed young men. And Jackson plays it absolutely perfect. Blending sophisticated hard-assery with steely determination, Jackson excels and makes the overlong running time well worth sitting thru.Yes it's a bit paint by numbers, how could it not be really? But any film that has the gumption to put academia on the same playing court as hoop shooting deserves an extra plaudit. Aided by the exciting, and authentic looking on-court action {well done director Thomas Carter} Coach Carter, and especially Sammy Jackson, manages to deliver more than enough interest to make this one of the better sports movies of the last decade. 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Coach Carter,"* John Wooden wanted his players to be both 'morally and mentally conditioned' on and off the court, and this film had this as a prominent theme - especially with the Cruz rendition of Nelson Mandelas 1994 inaugural speech (""...our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure..."") I believe many teachers/coaches would experience, and have to adapt to the same emotions, especially if they work in the sort of context depicted. * The use of running and push-ups as a disciplinary measure is something that many coaches disagree with - whether the film endorses their use will provide some indication of the combined influence of sport and the media. * The abortion of Kyra's baby was treated too lightly. * The film produced several thoughts & feelings, mainly good, and the 2+ hours didn't seem to drag (ie., it was quite engaging).",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Dedicated to more than just SPORTS - A real to life portrayal of inner city.,"Samuel L. Jackson does a masterful job in portraying Coach Carter as do the other actors in their roles. This film should go a long way in helping correct our inner city problems especially if the real players watch the film. It should shock some reality into them. I was disappointed that Hollywood felt it had to add some tawdry sex scenes and use vulgarity and profanity to get their message across. I understand that these things are part of the real world but they don't need to go to the degree they do in making their point. For example I think Coach Carter's profaning the name of Diety took away from his character and the moral value the film was trying to teach. It should be just as important to show respect for Diety as it is to respect one's self, leaders, and own race. If Hollywood wanted us to see real-life portrayals of profanity it should have come from elsewhere in the movie not from Coach Carter. Otherwise, I would have rated this a 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Better than you may expect; A noble film.,"Impressed by a clip of this film showing Carter's hardened approach to training his players on Film4's daily preview, I decided to sit down and watch this film.As the opening credits took place, two features stood out: (1) the MTV Films logo; and (2) 'Based on the life of Ken Carter'. As the film started, I admittedly began to dread attempting to watch this film, but I hoped that by viewing all the events portrayed in the film as being true, the film would surpass my initial prejudice.All I can say is that this is a good film, and a cut above everything else of its nature. Its message of determination and success is clear and welcomed, and its actors (young and old) prove to be convincingly genuine. As far as the plot goes, although it does slow down a bit after the end of the tournament, it eventually picks up and proves to be a great story overall. This film certainly showed me.Okay, the film isn't exactly a masterpiece. It's not the most thought-provoking of films, nor is it an emotional roller-coaster like the best films are. However, the film succeeds at achieving what it set out to do - to tell the true story of a man determined to never deny his beliefs, and by doing so, give hopeless kids a better future.

Jackson did an excellent job in relaying his funny and strict retorts to his disrespectful players, and overall the script allowed him to stay in character the whole entire movie. The side plots throughout were very intriguing considering it was based off of a true story. The script did a decent job of portraying these stories without straying too far off of what actually happened in real life.The acting in this movie was sub-par at best. Samuel L. Jackson did a fantastic job as the lead role of Ken Carter, however he definitely stole the show and beyond that the acting was a bit too theatrical for my taste. It was noticeable that the supporting actors seemed disinterested when it was not their turn to act, and many conversations did not seem realistic or fluent.While the acting was not particularly impressive, the production value in this film was excellent. In most sports films today, it seems that the action scenes are unrealistic and the viewer can typically realize that it is not what true basketball actually feels like. Besides some exaggerated, animated calls from the referees, and childish reactions from the fans and bench players, they did an outstanding job of portraying what an actual high school basketball game atmosphere would be like. Most of the scenes in the entire movie had great production value and always had a very realistic feel to it. Director Thomas Carter did an excellent job with the story he was given. There was no scene in the entire movie that I felt was unnecessary and there were no noticeable blunders within the film. He kept it very professional and the mood of the film transitioned phenomenally as the players began to mature under their new coach.Lastly, although there are hundreds of inspirational movies on the market, this movie excels in originality. This film is not the typical underdog movie, however it teaches morals and life lessons to all the viewers. Ken Carter's players never lacked talent, but lacked the discipline and academic strength in order to succeed in not only basketball, but also life itself. By way of harsh punishments and requirements, he gets his players on the right track to being successful. It is definitely a unique film and overall, it is an outstanding film to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hoop dreams for the Oilers,"Coach Carter is based on a true story of Richmond High School basketball coach Ken Carter (Samuel L Jackson) who made headlines in 1999 for benching his high school basketball team due to poor academic results.The film is not really about basketball that is just a backdrop. It is more about Ken Carter who becomes head coach of his old high school, where the players are rude, disrespectful and ill disciplined.Carter makes them each sign a personal contract regarding training, discipline, attendance and school grades. Although a disciplinarian the team has an unbeaten run and turns around the lives of their players even though some in the school and many of the parents are unhappy with his methods.I guess I would loath to have Ken Carter as my coach but in this movie with its assortment of High school misfits that are straight out of ghetto casting, it works.Samuel L Jackson has enough charisma and likability for you to invest in his character. The film is enjoyable enough, the music blends well with the urban drama and there are a few future stars in early roles in this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"education,education, education !","I decided to take a break from my normal action viewing of movies and decided to check out Coach Carter. Although Coach Carter might be a typical MTV Hollywood teen movie , the message it sends is clear! Education is the key to freedom which gives you the edge over others , although it seems typical in places it goes along at a nice pace and you actually route and feel for the characters in this movie. There are some funny moments in this film and a few turns which make it different from other movies. Samual L Jackson as usual is in fine form for his commanding roles although I felt he did not require too much practise for this one. All members of the basket ball team done well with their performances. On the whole Coach Carter I felt is a good change for those who want to watch some solid drama .COACH CARTER - 8.1 OUT OF 10IT BEGINS ON THE STREETS..AND IT ENDS HERE ...",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Worthy of my approval, can't wait till it's on DVD","I thought that this movie was really good. I was grounded the week it came out and so I had to ask my dad if he wanted to go see it as a bonding thing. (Which was asking a lot considering the fact that he is kind of racist.) But anyways HE actually liked it and said he wants to add it to his DVD collection when it comes out. I was pretty surprised considering the fact of how much flack I get for being into the so called ""black culture"". The movie is both funny and sad at the same time. Many things happen that you wouldn't think would happen or really aren't expected. This is a very dramatic movie and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. SO GO SEE IT!!

Satisfied,"I went into this expecting a typical sports drama. A group of troubled kids are driven crazy by the new high school coach, initially they resist but grow to the occasion and turn from underdogs into winners. With my expectations in mind, I have to say I'm totally satisfied. The movie delivers the drama, the storyline pretty well, we all feel for the characters. Most importantly it delivers a message, a few actually: education is a number one priority in every society, lead by example, rise above the odds, never give up and so on. It is predictable though and full of clich√© situations. But that didn't ruin the feel you get after watching this movie for me.

Please do not support this embarrassment to Sam Jackson.,"I went into this movie with low expectations, and unfortunately the movie did not even meet these standards.

You get into it,"Ken Carter(Jackson, applying his voice to delivering more motivational, inspirational speeches than you'd think they could fit into one movie... even at an excessive 127 minute running time not counting credits; at least it does tend to keep to a good pace) talks with his wife about the position as coach(and how inconvenient it is for him), and even without him saying, she knows he'll take it - I guess there's some positives to marrying The Seer. He asks the students to sign an academic contract with him, and promises if they maintain a certain average, he'll take them to victory in the State championship. Sprinkle your stock conflicts, clich√©s and subplots(a few of which seem to only be there because it actually happened... points for accuracy, sure, however, you need to properly set up and resolve them as well, that, or cut them, call poetic license if you must) of sports flicks(and as someone who isn't actually a fan of them, let me say that I enjoyed this, without it being redefining or fresh), sanitize it to After School Special levels(well, what do you expect from MTV?) and you have this predictable mix. Dialog is very Hollywood, and gets exposition-happy a little too often. The vernacular and characterizations are somewhere between what's realistic and what the most whitebread adults on Earth think African-American and Latino teenagers behave and talk like. And this is very big on discipline, no problem that it can't solve... an attitude that one should at least keep in check. On the plus side, this does have plenty of exciting basketball action, and they usually really are shooting when we see them do so, it doesn't cut to cover for them. This is well-cast and the acting is at times as impressive as the material allows. There is a lot of moderate language(as much as they could do on a PG-13) and brief bloody violence in this. The DVD comes with the two well-done featurettes Coach Carter: The man behind the movie(20 minutes long, with interviews with many of the real people), the 11 and a half minute Fast break at Richmond High(about the actors training), 12 minute of decent deleted scenes and the 4 and a half minute music video ""Hope"". I recommend this to any fan of the sub-genre. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is the basketball version of Friday Night Lights with the same cinematography and atmosphere from Save the Last Dance.

Feel-Good movie that never quite gives you that warm and fuzzy feeling...,"This is a story that deserves to be told and a movie that tries hard to be above average and probably could have been in the hands of a better director. Ultimately, however, it gets dragged down by a sub-par and clich√©' ridden script, boring pacing, average-at-best character development, below average acting (except Sam Jackson who turns in a pretty good performance and makes it at least watchable), extremely poor basketball choreography, and choppy editing.This is, on the one hand, a movie about life. But the story as portrayed isn't as gripping as it should be and comes off like a melodramatic after-school special (stay in school kids, don't get your girlfriend pregnant, don't deal drugs, etc...). It has the right message, to be sure, but we've seen it done before a hundred and one times...and far better. Perhaps most telling was the fact that during scenes when Sam Jackson wasn't on screen I (and all 3 of the people I went to see the movie with) became extremely bored, extremely fast. To say Sam Jackson carried this movie is a huge understatement. The film tries to show us how the coach reaches these kids, but in the end it just doesn't have much of an impact. Why would we feel sorry for a drug-dealer who has been given so little screen time and is otherwise shown to be little more than a petty thug? Why would I care if Worm makes it? Short of his ridiculous and ultimately unbelievable Shakesperean soliloquy towards the end of the film, we're not really given any hint there is a single brain-cell in his head. A big part of the problem is that other than Sam Jackson the acting is extremely weak, and you absolutely need a strong ensemble cast to get a powerful emotional message across to an audience. Unfortunately, this film fails on almost all counts to help us relate to and care for these characters. In the end, the story just doesn't ""grab"" you like it should and that can only be chalked up to a whole host of things that went wrong to make this movie into another coulda, woulda, shoulda exercise in frustration.This is also a film about basketball, and had this portion of the film been exciting then perhaps it could have made up for the glaring weaknesses in the story-telling department. Ironically, I have a feeling the film-makers felt this way too so they decided to edit the basketball scenes into what they thought would be ""exciting"" in order to hold the audience's interest. Unfortunately, the result is that Coach Carter is an even bigger failure on the court than it is in the classroom: the on-court scenes themselves are choreographed amateurishly and obviously edited for today's PS2 crowd with the attention spans of gnats. Real basketball? You won't find much here. What you will find are plenty of dunks. Every basketball scene in this movie goes something like this: DUNK, DUNK, DUNK...3-pointer...DUNK, DUNK, DUNK...{show a couple seconds of Sam Jackson yelling something unintelligible on the sidelines}...DUNK, DUNK, DUNK. Rinse, repeat. YAWN.It doesn't help that virtually none of the actors on the team actually move like real basketball players on the court (especially ""Worm"" who is absolutely NOT an athlete). Perhaps this is why they edited it so much with quick cutaway shots...to cover for the athletic weaknesses of their actors. Is it that hard to find actors in Hollywood who have actually played a sport before and can look reasonably athletic doing it on film?I played 4 years of college basketball and have coached at various levels over the past 5 years since. While I am no John Wooden, I know a thing or two about the game and trust me...you won't find one nugget of actual basketball knowledge or wisdom, one ounce of reality with regards to how high school basketball is truly played. You won't find that magic moment when a coach is able to drag out perfect performances from a flawed team. What you will find is a steady dose of rim-rattling rams interspersed with shots of rump shaking cheerleaders banging out their dance-grooves to the latest hip-hop that altogether makes high-school basketball look like a Sportscenter dunk-a-th on-slash-music-video. The cheerleader shots were for some reason especially cheesy and bordered on camp, almost as if the film-makers knew they weren't producing a film that accurately portrayed basketball so they collectively figured, ""hey, screw it...let's just go whole-hog and turn high-school basketball into the XFL."" If the cheerleaders all had huge implants and rolled in mud during the games it wouldn't have been much more ridiculous.During the shoe-ad commercial gone insane basketball scenes, Coach Carter himself was given short shrift and constantly plays second-fiddle to the goings-on around him. In short, he never has a chance to really COACH. This is probably the film's biggest weakness on the court considering it IS supposed to be about COACH CARTER, after all.From what I have heard through the grape-vine Ken Carter is a wonderful man and the story of his exploits at Richmond high-school are indeed something special, so it's all-the-more sad that his impact on the lives of these children wasn't given a better realization on the big screen.Ultimately, Coach Carter has a below-average script that poorly realizes the real-life story combined with sub-par direction, a poor ensemble cast, and extremely unrealistic basketball choreography. In short, if you want to watch a movie about how basketball is really played then watch Hoosiers (or even Blue Chips...*shudder*). If you want to watch a movie about inner city kids succeeding against all odds watch Stand and Deliver. Despite the fact that I went into this movie with high hopes, it is really average at best and certainly not worth full admission price. Thank God I only paid to see a matin√©e. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nice job,"Overall Coach Carter is a very impressive movie. I've read reviews that talk about how the real coach carter story is much better, but i think Hollywood did well on this movie. For one thing, they didn't alter anything important. i was impressed that they lost the final game, because that's what happened in real life. Hollywood has problems with that sometimes. I like how finally there's a movie that upholds education over all else. Hollywood has problems with that too, sometimes. They say that the real Ken Carter was a much deeper, fun guy, but Hollywood has to make the character more dramatic. That was fine with me. Plus, the soundtrack is great. Hope by Twista ft.

Coach Carter: 8/10,"Samuel L. Jackson can do no wrong (unless it involves a movie with the number 51 in it). Whether it's Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, or even XXX, Jackson always gives off an aura of ""cool""-anyone would want to know him or be him in any of those characters, no matter how wrong the character was. The same holds true for his titular role in Coach Carter. Although it's not one of his ""bad-ass"" roles, he comes off as a cool person with a moral core. Ken Carter is the only character audiences can identify with, and therefore we go along with his actions, and understand his motives. Not only that, but it's a refreshing break from these Disney-produced ""These people can do it, so so can you!"" sports movies. Instead, it's a hard-hitting, tiring adventure through the true story (what else) of a Northern California town and their trials and tribulations.Ken Carter (Jackson) is hired as the coach of an inner-city basketball team. They're a great team, but lack discipline and academic skills. Carter instigates a vigorous lateness policy (thousands upon thousands of warm-up exercises), and then locks down the gym when the team fails to maintain a 2.3 GPA. Carter handles all controversy handed to him in the typical Samuel L. Jackson manner.Although unfairly compared to Remember the Titans, the two movies couldn't be any more different. Titans had Denzel Washington (who's nowhere near as cool as Jackson) in a sugar-coated movie about racism. Coach Carter IS racist (about a dozen or so n-words...where's Spike Lee on this one?), and there's no real message, except that knowledge is power (somewhat). Being that Carter's PG-13, unlike Titans's PG, it can get away with much more, with a more developed story. There's a lot of subplots, including drug deals and teen pregnancy. It's great to see such adult topics dealt with in a teen movie (well, it's somewhat like a teen movie). And it's not slammed down our throats, either. It's presented, and we take what we want out of it.Not only that, but we're able to identify with Carter and his actions. Although they seem (and are) extreme, we can understand where he's coming from. It's like Kurt Russell's insistence in that one (the only good) scene of Miracle. Plus, there's Samuel L. Jackson, who can make everything except Formula 51 a gem. Plus, there's the fact that I saw the movie over a month ago, and don't really remember much from it. But it's surprisingly great for a January release, and one you should at least pick up on DVD.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for violence, sexual content, language, teen partying and some drug material.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I am not against any high players in the NBA and i love them especially KG but i think this movie showed that one person can really affect a community it is just up now for the community to accept the changes he or she gonna make...

Revolutionizes the way kids see the game,"I know I'm very late in leaving a review, but I first saw this movie about 6 years ago (I was in 8th grade). My dad handed it to me and told me to watch it because I love sports movies, and oh man did this movie captivate what I love about sports. Sports aren't just a collision of sweaty bodies for the entertainment of others, it's about teamwork and being successful in and off the court. This is what ""coach carter"" does so well, it's a basketball movie but it's not about basketball. ""Coach carter"" instead focuses on the integrity of a basketball coach and how he refuses to let his players be just another statistic in a failing educational system. This story spoke to me from the first viewing and shows everyone who watches it that sports does not make you who you are, and that we as people are above the game. Overall this is a beautiful movie about the hardships of those who only have the game of basketball left in their lives. Every performance is amazing (specifically Jackson as coach carter and Rick Gonzalez as Timo Cruz).

I hope that nobody who watches this movie copies Coach Carter's tactics at all. You can't solve problems with push-ups and suicides.There are many other issues with this movie.

And they didn't need to show everything they did. I read something that the real coach carter called this a ""family film"".... I know i wouldn't want my kid watching this! They could of created a decent film, but it was predictable and boring. Pretty much like any other recent film... about 30 mins too long. Want a good recent sport video? Check out Miracle!

It teaches a fantastic lesson about life and why not to have premarital sex. Samuel L. Jackson is at his best in acting with this movie.

2000 Suicides,"I ask you to watch ""Birth of a Nation,"" folks. By many measures it is the most successful movie of all time, seen by the greatest percentage of the population. Bigger, yes than ""Star Wars"" or ""Gone With the Wind.""If you don't know it, it is reprehensibly racist. We can see this today, but essentially no one did when it was new. Now I ask you, what will our grandchildren consider racist that we blindly accept today?My guess is stories like this.Jackson plays a well meaning man, with the affect of nobility you find in intense, well- meaning, stupid people have. Sure, he talks about ""getting ahead"" and the value of an education. But when the movie needs tension and movement, the thing revolves around the ordinary sports movie core: determination leads to winning.Two things will seem offensive in the future. The first is obvious: black boys as incapable of even thinking, only playing and having to be forced into ""studying"" by the reward of just being on the court in a place of honor. It is new generation racism. Obvious, and we won't have to wait for my grandchildren for that one to be reviled.But the other. The other is that apart from race that sports has something to do with the life of the mind. That discipline and focus and determination, even sacrifice in the one gives you ""life lessons"" that apply in the other. This will take longer because each movie that uses it encourages you to not think, and not thinking means you don't think about the thing that just instructed you to not think.And it will take some time because sports is theater (and little less) and these kinds of movies are theater and they will support each other against our better interests.The curious things about movies. Genres adapt to survive. We've already abandoned the simple version of this genre. This is a slight modification.Stay away from this; it is harmful, in addition to being a clich√©d hack of the formula.

He takes over as head basketball coach, makes his presence known, and makes them sign a contract with certain expectations.

Gymnasium Jungle.,"A Los Angeles sporting goods store owner (Samuel L. Jackson) becomes the head coach of a local high school basketball team in the inner-city. Jackson creates chaos as he holds his players to stricter academic standards than the normal student. The reason---to help his kids get into colleges and out of the rough neighborhood. Flashes of ""Hoosiers"" here, but actually much more like Richard Brooks' ""Blackboard Jungle"" as Jackson proves to be a tough cookie that can handle his team when few others would even try. Somewhat uneven and definitely too long, but still a strong production. Jackson's part is the greatest element found within. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Biography

remarkable,"This was one of the most remarkable biopics I have seen in recent years. Samuel L. Jackson gives a marvelous performance as Richmond (CA) basketball coach Ken Carter, who has just been hired for the job. He makes it clear to his players that he means serious business. He makes them sign a contract requiring them to maintain a 2.3 GPA, show up for all their classes, and wear a coat and tie on game days, among other things. He wants them to earn the title ""student athletes,"" with student coming first. When they break the terms of the contract, he locks them out of practice and games until they get their priorities straight, which I thought was the right thing to do. This was one of Jackson's best roles and performances. I think the movie was very well done and made me think about my priorities as well. A winner.*** out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Samuel L. Jackson's depiction of the true story of Coach Ken Carter ensues.,"Immediately after being introduced as the new head coach, Coach Carter informs the players that respect and discipline will be required. Naturally, this doesn't sit well with some of the guys. After all, they were used to getting away with everything. But that's the attitude that resulted in only four wins the previous season. So instead of accepting disrespect, Carter forces a player to leave the gym. Two of his slacker friends follow him.When one of the remaining players speaks up and complains that they just lost their two highest scorers from last season, Carter replies, ""Well then will have two new highest scorers this season."" That's Coach Carter. He took the reigns of a team of underachievers and pushed them to be better than average. But to be more than average, you have to accept the responsibility of a certain amount of work and effort. Don't want to accept your responsibilities? That's nothing that 1000 push-ups and 500 suicides won't cure.There's no doubt that some people just don't have it in them to play for a coach like that. I've been there, and a lot of the time you absolutely hate the coach. ""Come on, coach, what do you mean we have to run stairs for 10 minutes?? We just had a 2 1/2 hour wrestling practice!"" We ended up running stairs for 20 minutes, and that was the last time any of us complained. We hated the coach at that moment, but he got our attention, and more importantly, he got his point across.Achieving excellence is never easy, whether it be in the sports arena or in the classroom. Coach Carter's team was doing great on the basketball court, starting off the season on a huge win streak. But problems in the classroom brought everything to a halt. Bye bye sunshine.Once Carter received progress reports from the teachers (he had to twist arms to do it), the bad news was several of his players were failing classes. They all signed contracts to maintain a 2.3 GPA. They didn't maintain the GPA. So what happened? Carter locked the gym, closed practice, and said all games would be forfeited until the conditions of the contracts were met.Great! It's about time a coach took a stand like that! I guess parents, school board members, and the community all rallied around the coach and his brave stand, right? Nope. Parents and the rest of the community were only concerned with trying to win a state championship. In fact, the parents were in such an uproar that they demanded that Coach Carter be fired.The school board cowardly voted to end the lockout, and Coach Carter said that he would quit. But the team rallied around him, and said they wouldn't play until everybody met his requirements.Samuel L. Jackson is, no surprise, perfect as Coach Carter. You wanna scare a couple of players straight? Just have Samuel L. stare 'em straight in the eyes for about 5 minutes. Jackson is so convincing as a disciplinarian that I stood up at one point during the movie and started running suicides. The taunts of, ""Look at that idiot running in the theater"" and ""Sit down! Your stupid pants are ruffling and making too much noise"" didn't bother me. I knew Coach Carter would be proud.By no means is this movie a masterpiece. The main drawback is that I wasn't enthralled with all the little subplots. The one side story with the player being involved with dealing drugs worked well because it made sense within the context of the movie. But I could've done without Ashanti and her basketball-playing boyfriend talking and whining and talking about her unplanned pregnancy. OK, fine, yeah, that stuff happens all the time in the ghetto, but that doesn't mean it makes for compelling viewing. I'd rather see 10 more minutes of Jackson threatening to break somebody's face than 10 minutes of a school dance.As a result of the subplots, some people might get a little restless with the 136 minute running time. I'll probably watch this again one day on DVD, but when I do I'll fast forward through all the scenes dealing with Ashanti and her pregnancy. Yeah, yeah, human interest, blah blah blah. Unfortunately, it was of no interest to THIS human, so there you go.Also, the ""I came to teach boys, and you became men"" inspirational clich√©s start to hit hyper drive as the movie winds down. You'll probably roll your eyes at least twice, and you might want to keep a plastic yellow bucket handy in case your gag reflex kicks in. But hey, it's forgivable.This is a true story (with some poetic license exercised) that needs to be heard. Basketball is a privilege. Many amateur athletes think they can play professional sports, but Coach Carter knew differently. That's why he still believed in the STUDENT-athlete. In his own words, ""On the streets and public basketball courts in Richmond and any other city in America, you see the broken dreams of former high school legends who got left behind by life. And I was just not going to let that happen to these boys."" Now if you'll excuse me, I've got 50 more push-ups and 10 suicides to do.Rating: 4 (out of 5)",,Anonymous,Biography

More Coach Carter content,"Coach Carter is a good sports movie. The fact that it is based upon a true story makes it more compelling. It revolves around tough love and the idea that if you do thousands of push-ups and thousands of suicides (wind sprints) then you will develop the necessary respect for yourself and your fellow man. Ahh if everyone would just go to boot camp then wouldn't the world be a better place?I liked that this movie asked the question, ""what really is a student athlete?"" The answer is that in today's schools ""student athlete"" is an oxymoron unless a contract is signed and enforced. And it is the enforcing of this contract that made this an unique sports movie.Samuel L. Jackson is well cast and gives an excellent performance although in some scenes I was wondering if he was still training Jedi Knights.During the filming of the ""big"" basketball games it appeared several of the cameramen were having seizures¬óthe equivalent of my wife operating our camcorder¬óor maybe it was just the editor who was seizing?Although Ashanti is really nice to look at I wasn't sure why her character was necessary to tell the story. Either her influence on the team (not just an individual) and the plot needed to be integrated better or her character should have been scaled down or cut.I would have liked to have seen more about what made Coach Carter take the job (he was only paid $1,500 a season) and more on why he didn't have his son enroll in Richmond in the first place instead of sending him to a private school. I already know about drugs on the street and teenage pregnancy through many other films. What I don't know enough about is what motivates a Coach Carter type personality and in turn why there are so few like him.The objective of life is not to try to reach one's peak during high school sports but rather to be prepared for the long haul. This movie conveys this message well but I still would have liked to see more of Coach Carter off the court and less of the basketball players off the court.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

This movie is really for all ages. It's rated PG-13 for the language, and maybe very brief drug dealing. No sexual content, certainly no nudity.

Coach Carter is unique,"Coach Carter is one of most notable sports films to ever be released. When Coach Ken Carter of the Richmond High School basketball team accepts his new job to coach and mentor a group of reckless and bashful individuals, he has no idea what the future holds. The emotional aspect of this movie leaves student athletes on the edge of their seats. Even if one is not a student athlete, it leaves a message that can have a true impact on their life and future. The true story of Coach Carter is easily a must-see movie because of its eventful plot, exciting climax, and the connection it makes to its targeted audience.Coach Ken Carter decides to return to his high school in Richmond, California to take up a head coaching position for the Richmond Oilers. He knows that this isn't the easiest task for anyone as the dysfunctional and rough bunch of players only went on to win four games total in the previous season. Even with these setbacks, Carter believes that with his discipline he can enforce on his new team both on the court and in the classroom, they can be one of the best teams in the area. In many ways, Coach Carter is portrayed as an overall inspirational and at times heart-felt movie. The first thing that comes to mind when discussing this film, is the work done by main actors like Samuel L. Jackson, Rick Gonzalez, Rob Brown, Channing Tatum, and others apart of the Richmond High School basketball team. There are many excellent things to note when regarding this. As the head coaching role, Ken Carter (Jackson), encounters many situations where his role needs to be very strict with a serious attitude towards his players. Jackson does a fantastic job doing this and making it very believable and life-like to the audience. Another actor who does a great work in the acting aspect is Rick Gonzalez. Gonzalez plays the role as Timo Cruz, one of the stubborn players of the ball team. Cruz's character has an important role played throughout the film that causes him to go from the ignorant and bashful basketball player, to one of the key players the team needs both on and off of the basketball court. He goes through challenges that requires heavy emotion which is exactly what Rick Gonzalez brings to the table when he portrays his role. The impact that these actors have on the outcome of the movie helps the main message and purpose be given to the audience.The main message is meant to be inspirational and emotional to any audience watching this movie. The director, Thomas Carter, purposefully tries to get the audience involved by leaving them in question and guessing what exactly will happen next. This emotional aspect is what leads the movie to build a personal connection to its viewers. A prime example of this comes when Coach Carter takes action when the players' grades start to slip. He tries time and time again to get the understanding in their heads that students become before athletes when considering ""student athletes."" At first, this doesn't go over well with the players, but in time it goes to show how powerful a person can be with school work, basketball, and other areas or difficulties in life.The work done by the actors, the director, and the writers have led to this movie being one of the biggest successes in sports films of this era. If you haven't ever experienced this movie, I suggest that you get on it and watch it. I guarantee you will not be disappointed with the work done by director Thomas Carter and by the actors. Coach Carter has had an impact on my personal life that sometimes cannot be put into words. If, however, it had to be put in words, it would be what Rick Gonzalez's character says near the peak of the movie; ""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate, but that we are powerful beyond measure.""",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

8.3/10,"Coach Carter thrives on raw inspiration, balancing motivational depth with a well-executed sports drama formula. While clich√©s are inevitable in such films, this one wields them with purpose, making familiar tropes feel earned rather than predictable. The film's greatest strength lies in its biographical grounding, Ken Carter's real-life discipline and vision translate into a compelling character study, elevated by Samuel L. Jackson's incredible performance. The basketball sequences are gripping, but the true stakes lie in the classroom, where Carter's tough-love approach challenges systemic failure and personal complacency. The film doesn't shy away from the realities of inner-city struggles, making its message of accountability and self-respect hit harder. Emotional, engaging, and structured with a clear moral compass: this is sports drama done right.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great men, the Carters...","There's a lot to say about ""Coach Carter"" leaving aside the simple fact that it is a very good film. Its director, Thomas Carter, is surely a very determined man and a dedicate worker. His camera moves like it knows the territory by heart; it moves with a lot of freedom and confidence. Sometimes, it seems to be in someone's hand, because it moves a lot; because there's a lot to see in this movie.The same happened in ""Save the last dance"" a very well crafted piece directed by Carter, that dealt, among other things, with racial problems, as does ""Coach Carter"" in some ways. But Carter is no writer, he's a director that could seem like a writer because he really wants to direct. Anyway, here the writers are a mix of experts about what the movie needed to deal with.Mark Schawn created ""One Tree Hill"", a TV show where the main characters play basketball, as the characters of this film do. He also wrote ""The Perfect Score"", a picture I haven't seen but I imagine covers a lot of young students personal issues, as ""Coach Carter"". The other writer was responsible for two sports movies; one about love (""Summer Catch"") and another one about dreams and inspiration (""Hardball""). It is a perfect team.And a perfect result, too; because their screenplay is flawless, at least in the issues it presents. ""We're going to treat ourselves with respect"", Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) says during his first training at Richmond School. He must be a good coach, because his son (solid Robert Ri'chard) moved from an esteemed high school, to one that graduates the 50% of its students just to train with his dad.Ken Carter is a good coach, but in his own ways. The year before he arrived, the school's team the Oilers won only four games; now they're undefeated. The man is accomplishing his job, but not the totality of it. The other part relies in a contract every student signed before being in the team. It includes attending all of the classes in front row, maintaining a 2.3 average and wearing tie on the game's day. Technically, by not following the rules, the students are failing.But for Coach Carter they are all failing, because they are team, and this among other things is what he intends to teach them, indirectly. ""What is your deepest fear?"", he asks Timo Cruz (impressive Rick Gonzalez), when he has to complete an impossible task to be back on the team¬ÖWhat does that mean? ""What does your father do?"", he asks Jason Lyle (debutant Channing Tatum). ""My father's in prison"", the boy answers. ""Ask yourself if you wanna end like him"", Carter finishes.His methods will generate controversy, he will be questioned by everyone, but what really matters isn't what the parents think, or what the school principals think; what really matters is what the kids think is best for them, and what they want for their future.The whole young cast is adequate. Nana Gbewonyo, Antwon Tanner. They're all talented, especially Rob Brown (that boy from Finding Forrester) as Kenyon Stone, an intelligent young man with a pregnant girlfriend (young pregnancy is dealt with, as in the director's previous film) played naturally by Ashanti. I would like to see a lot more of Brown, because he's got a lot to give.However, the generator of the environment and the head of the project is Mister Samuel L. Jackson, with a bald head and an ambiguous look. Used to play ""the man"" (ironically that's the name of his last film), as he did in ""S.W.A.T"", ""Shaft"" or going back in ""One Eight Seven"", puts the soberness away and creates a humanly defined character, in what's his best performance in three years; since his dedicate father in ""Changing Lanes"".I will make no commentaries about the cheesy music I despise so much and forgot to mention in ""The Longest Yard""; but I'll say it works, no matter how hard we try to reject it¬ÖFinally, the fact that ""Coach Carter"" is based on a true story, leaves me even more amazed than how I already am of this film-making achievement.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I think I have watched it about 11 times or so and it has helped me every time that I watch. I also find something new about. I also watched the behind the real Ken Carter and I know it is based on a true story but in real life they really did say those mean things to him. I also heard what the real athletes had to say and what they thought of him. In real life Coach Carter really did have 3 kids walk out on him and they said when he wanted to win to call him and he said he will but he never did call them. The real life athletes said that everything in that movie they really did feel until they got to know him. And now he is their idol and the man they look up to.

Every year we see more attempts by Hollywood to cash in on the same 'inspiring' story, again and again. But from this defunct genre comes Coach Carter, a wonderful little film and probably one of my favorite sports movies.Samuel L. Jackson superbly plays Coach ken Carter, a controversial high school basketball coach who locks his players out of the gym when they don't uphold contracts concerning their academics. Jackson is a revelation here, playing a really good guy and turning in one of the best performances of his career. Met with opposition even from the staff, he fights for the idea of a student-athlete for the first time. Calm, cool, and dominating the screen, the film is worth seeing for Jackson's performance alone.Yet Coach Carter is something more. It's one of those rare sports movies that really hits home, avoiding most of the clich√©s that have messed up the genre. It's true, there's still the troubled athletes, the obligatory girlfriend-of-the-star; somehow Coach Carter isn't weighed down by it. In fact, quite the opposite, it's a movie that truly soars. 8/10 stars!Jay Addison",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A fairly mediocre film. Can't really say much besides that.,"The film centers around Richmond High school which is underfunded and has only a 50% graduation rate. Coach Carter played by Samuel L Jackson is a former alumni to the school comes in to take over the coaching position in his first season. The film doesn't have a central character but goes with an ensemble cast. The characters include the coach's son, a student drug dealer, a illiterate student, a teen pregnancy and etc etc.I guess what separates this film from a normal basketball film is that Coach is very stringent on the grades his students must keep. Coach Carter sends the message that basketball is not the only trophy worthy of chasing for these at risk teenagers.The acting is alright, no breakthrough performances. Some people have said that Samuel Jackson is great and.... he's okay, but we've seen better in other films.Unless you're in a basketball mood, it's not really worth watching. I has good messages and good lessons to be learned but the drama is just not there. It's not gut wrenching and your not going to be at the edge of your seat to see what happens next. The film plays out very stereotypically with very few surprises.But..... at least it's not terrible :P",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good certainly not great,"I have coached HS basketball in the Seattle for 25 years. I took my team to see this movie knowing a little about it. There were no surprises nor mystery to it, the coach being the story and his toughness. The basketball scenes were very realistic, however, the the practices, technique, and coaching aspects were unimpressive.I was hoping for more: more intrigue, more than one dimensional characters, and more inspiring relationships between coach and players. Basically, Coach Carter made his players do astronomical amounts of push-ups and suicides.It is extremely difficult to make a GREAT sports movie. Hoosiers and Field of Dreams are the best examples IMO. My players reviews were mixed. Overall they felt it was slightly above average. My biggest problem was that I had seen it all before and not a single actor other than Jackson jumped off the screen.",,Anonymous,Biography

Excellent!!,"My excellent wife joined a DVD rental club and had used up all the rental slots so I had to tack on Coach Carter right at the end. Eventually it arrived and it was well worth the wait. Some will say that it is a familiar story. New teacher bad kids and the new teacher turns them into good kids. However this is not fiction it actually happened. I found this film totally absorbing and while it is a long film it was even longer for me as such was the emotional impact of some of the scenes I found myself watching them again and again. It is extremely satisfying to know that there are people like Coach Carter out there and even more uplifting that in this day and age, there are kids that are willing to listen and learn. The academic achievements of kids throughout the world would be changed for the better if there were more Coach Carters out there and without sounding too sugary, the world would be a better place. A very good film for adults (to take note, we can all be coach carters in our own way) and one all parents should encourage their children to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

a damn good people movie,Im not american or care about basketball or black american youths but this movie really grabs the heart strings and a great performance by Samuel out of his stereotype roles and into reality. It really sucks some segments of the population are treated so unfairly.. great supporting performances from the whole cast.

A Sports Movie that is both Inspirational and Unpredictable...,"COACH CARTER is an inspiring and richly entertaining film, based on a true story. This is the story of Ken Carter, a man who returns to his high school alma mater to become the new basketball coach. Carter creates priorities for the guys on the team by presenting them with a contract that they must sign and honor if they are to play on the team. The contract states that they are to maintain a 2.3 GPA, go to their classes every day, sit in the front row of their classes,and wear a tie on game day. As much as Carter loves the game of basketball, he still feels their education should be the guys' number one priority. The team, which had a 4-22 record the preceding season, racks up 15 victories in a row until Carter learns that a couple of the team members are not keeping up their GPA. He then puts a lock on the gym door and cancels all games until the guys get their grades up. The furor this causes in the small town is understandable, since basketball scholarships are probably the only way these inner city kids are going to be able to go to college, but Carter is determined to send the message that there is life after basketball. Samuel L. Jackson turns in a commanding performance, as always, in the title role, as the man who cares what happens to the guys after they hang up their sneakers. Jackson's performance and a screenplay that's a bit preachy but does offer surprises make this film more than worth your time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Coach Carter is the best movie I've seen in a long time!!!!,Coach Carter is a really good movie and I don't understand how some people don't like it. It deals with real problems the African-Americans have (their grades are one of them.) This movie shows younger people that they should go to school and get an education. I was really moved by the movie. I don't understand why people call it unoriginal. Not all movies have to be original. The fact that it may not be original is alright because it deals with some problems the African-Americans that need to be told in more than just one movie. It was a good movie that made you want to cheer the team on to get their grades up and win the championship. I really recommend all of you to watch it!!!,10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Must See Movie,I enjoyed this movie so much I rented it 3 times and decided to go ahead and buy it. I am glad Coach Carter did not let those do-nothings discourage him from molding those young men's lives to have futures and care not only about themselves but about others as well. I wish the school systems in America had more teachers and coaches like Coach Carter that not only demanded respect but gave it as well. My kids say I like the movie so much because I was a lot like him while I was schooling them. As I have said to them many times...life is full of a lot of adversity and very little coddling so you better know how to handle life from all aspects.

Great movie!,""" Coach Carter "" is a classic underdog sports-themed story. It is a truly inspiring movie based on a true story about Ken Carter that hit national news in 1999. It makes us, the audience, think about some of life's challenges that apply to our own lives and it allows us to find ways to overcome them. The film also impresses upon us that the first step to empowerment is education and that it is possible for students to escape from violence and poverty if raised in a poor neighborhood. Which in turn sets up for a great storyline.The movie originated from a real incident in 1999 when a high school basketball coach, Ken Carter, benched his whole undefeated team for performing poorly academic wise. He pad locked the gym doors and sent his players to the library. He received both high praise and criticism nationally.Being the story was very real the costumes were not. The setting of the movie is in Long Beach, California in a poor neighborhood. At the beginning of the movie the players were asked to sign a contract that stated: they must receive a minimum 2.3 grade point average, attend all classes, sit in front of those classes and wear a suit and tie on game day. In a meeting the parents were complaining that the student athletes simply don't own suits and ties and cannot afford them. Throughout the movie though, every character was wearing expensive name brand clothing. It totally contradicted the message they were trying to prove about being poor. Then there were the cheerleaders. They were dressed like hip-hop dancers that you would normally see in MTV music videos. No school would allow their students to wear shorts revealing half of their butt.As hip-hop movie and mainly attracting the youth, the slang and language was not quite appropriate but very up to date. There was some profanity but it only made the movie that much more real. Whether we like it or not kids will curse.It was also interesting to see how they brought up real life issues that many young teens can relate to. One of them being pregnancies. In the movie one girl got pregnant from her boyfriend that played on the basketball team. It showed the option of abortion. Sending out the message that it my not be morally right but it is up to the parents and what they believe is best for both them and the child.In conclusion, the costumes were a little contradicting but the movie wasn't totally ruined from it. It had a get story line and sub stories that made us feel as if we were one of the characters. If you love heart touching inspirational movies then this one is highly recommended. It's a reality check.",,Anonymous,Biography

"'Coach Carter' is an interesting, moving sports drama","'Coach Carter' is based on a true story of Coach Ken Carter, a controversial high school basketball coach portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson. Coach Carter took the coaching job under his rules. He believed thatthe players must maintain good grades, attend all classes and sit in the front row and become a united team or they would not play. All the team players signed his contract to do just that. The team was undefeated and on it's way to the 1999 State Championship, when Coach Carter received the progress reports for his players, and discovered they have been ditching class and failing. Coach Carter received national attention when he locked the gym and benched the whole team for poor grades. Coach Carter received some praise and much more criticism for his decision. Supporting cast includes Rob Browne and Ashanti.'Coach Carter' is an interesting, moving sports drama with a strong lead actor and a ""supportive"" supporting cast, to keep it simple. Samuel L. Jakcson holds the lead role smoothly until the final clip and portrays Coach Ken Carter with ease. Rising hit Rob Browne is a decent enough actor, and could become famous if he makes smart choices. Ashanti is an interesting character. She is introduced like a hip-hop sassy girl, then turns into something much deeper and more unexpected. Also, the subplot of her baby carries the movie when the basketball plot isn't focused on.All in all, this film is very similar to, say ""Remember the Titans"". I know they are different sports, but they both have that 'moving' sense to them then engages the audience and gets you interested in this sports team, and their coach. The main thing I enjoied in this film was that he locked up the gym, which gave the common sports drama a little pizazz.Coach Carter; 8 out of 10 PG13- language, thematic material, drug content and some sexual material.Runtime- 2 hrs. 16 minutes",,Anonymous,Biography
Rich what? Richmond!,What is the use of becoming a teacher if you don't care about your pupils' education and future careers? I agree with Coach Carter's method. He taught the men the importance of getting an education as a backup plan because you never know what the future holds; they could get injured or never play professionally. I was surprised that the majority of parents did not comprehend Coach Carter's justification for closing the gym. The fact that some of their sons weren't even showing up to class or that their sons had poor grades didn't worry them. I admired how Coach Carter instilled discipline and success-oriented attire among the boys. Your appearance matters because it represents who you are everywhere you go. Timo lacked a mentor to set him on the correct course and teach him that it's acceptable to be afraid I was glad Coach Carter was able to be that for him. Every child needs a supportive adult who will challenge them to do better and who cares about them.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining movie about the virtue of diligence,"I'm not much of a sport movie fan(I dont dislike them either, just never my first choice) but its a very fun film.

A surprisingly emotional and inspiring story!,"I had never heard of this movie before, and I did watch it only because my sister had to watch to do an essay from school, so my expectations were somewhat low. But man, it is really good!It tells a truly emotional story, that touches on extremely sensitive issues, and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more powerful. Everything that surrounds the kids that lived in that neighborhood, their families, their social influences, their money problems, and so many other factors would have led to... unfortunate outcomes. And that is something even people who aren't necessarily on situations similar to the characters in the movie can learn from, and try to be more grateful for what they have, and also try to help others as much as they can.Talking about the movie itself, I found it really well written, the acting was great, and it doesn't necessarily feel almost 2 hours and 20 minutes long, which is a plus. Half way through the movie, I checked the time, and saw that we still had more than an hour to go, and... I was glad! I didn't wanna leave those characters yet, and I wanted to see them succeeding.I think tho, that after the first big win (their championship) the pace, that was going so smoothly, kind of struggled a bit, and only after a good 20, 25 minutes it started to pick up again, which is still, fine, I was invested in the characters and entertained. But it can be said as one problem.To sum up, Coach Carter is a great movie, with a touching story, that may make you re-think some important aspects of your own life. You may start think more about inequality, and privileges you didn't realized you had before, which is fine, what counts, is what you do moving forward, the way you approach life, and, if you happen to have any number of privileges, just always be grateful for it, and try to make the best of it, and luckily, in any kind of way, shape or form, you might actually do something that will give another person new opportunities, and so on. In times like this, that's something truly important to keep in mind, and think about on a day to day basis. Let's be grateful for what we have, and help others as much as we can.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I thought it was going to be your classic happy ending movie, it's got an awesome ending but its not what you would expect. The fact that it is based on a real story makes it even deeper. If you love your game, you will love this movie. The acting is great and the story even greater. Definitely worth my 10 bucks. I would go see it again in a second. One person can make a difference. It's a movie that really gets you thinking and makes me wanna go be the best I can be.",,Anonymous,Biography
Rises Above the Clich√©s!,"Coach Carter is a very formulaic sports film that follows every rule in the rulebook for sports film. However, thanks to a very centralized, high-powered performance by Samuel L. Jackson, this film is able to stand on its own two feet. There are some emotional moments when you are rooting for the underdog, in this case the Richmond Oilers, to win it all. This film also showcases the tough time people have growing up in poor areas and the broken-down American education system.Thomas Carter's film is about a legendary basketball player named Ken Carter who goes back to his old high school to coach a number of violent, uneducated people the true game of basketball and how the game will change their attitudes, and more importantly their lives.Samuel L. Jackson does one heck of a job in his role. Thanks to his inspiring performance, this movie is worth watching. He is passionate about this role and despite acting as a bully to his players, you feel for him since you know that he cares for his players and will do anything to give them a better life and go to college.Overall, this is an above-average sports film thanks to Jackson. Even without him, this film would have been good despite having almost every clich√© in the book. But hey, this is quality filmmaking. I was able to enjoy the drama and all the games. I liked how they went from the bad news bears of basketball to playing like champions. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful and moving,"I remember Coach Carter being quite good, but the fact that I forgot that it was Samuel L Jackson leading probably meant it had been too long and was worth a rewatch. And wow this movie is great. It has some of the best sport actions shots I've seen in any movie. It spends a lot of time actually showing the play of the game as opposed to just showing cut shots of the basketball hoop or players getting ready to shoot. Instead it has many different games where the camera has a wide angle shot taking in many players and showing quite complicated scenes requiring a high level of skill. Noticeably Channing Tatum is absent in many of these scenes with his skills not being as good. This movie felt very real and therefore very moving.It was easy to connect with the characters and want to see them be successful. They did a great job of helping you to care about many players. So much so you got used to seeing the group of about 8 or so guys that when an extra pops in for team talks, you're left thinking whose that guy?Samuel L Jackson obviously smashes it. But in a way that isnt shouty or abusive like many of his other roles. Hes cool, decisive and carries such clear conviction. Although it is obviously a bit unrelatable with the Coach violently defending himself and smashing the kids head up against a wall. Being a teacher myself I sometimes wish I could put the fear of Samuel L Jackson into the naughty little tyrants that deserve it. But then you remember that youd get fired.Great all round performance from everyone. Especially for many of these actors who hadn't had much experience. Awesome movie",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Coach Carter is so good!!!!,"Samuel Jackson pulls off another incredible performance as the basketball coach of the Richmond HS team. Wonderful story of a man who stands for principles unlike many of the coaches of this day. Who choose to either win at all cost, and promote themselves as the one and only guru of basketball. The ladies game shows that pure basketball is pass, catch, shoot, defend. Not dunks all the time. And its great. Coach Carter shows that there is even more, educating and teaching his players as they pursue W's on the court. It can be done and this movie shows gives blueprint. Cruz's quotes in the gym scene near the end speak profound words of wisdom. ""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate, our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us; yet playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking, so that other people want feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. Its not just in some of us, its in everyone, and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automaticlly liberates others."" That blew me away. So much so that I had to see the movie twice to get all that. Go see this one.

The kids did not hold up their end of the bargain, so Coach Carter locked up the gym and canceled practices and games until their grades were the required grade of a c+. at the end, when Richmond and St. Francis played at the last 9 seconds, i thought Richmond was going to win.

A look into a great story,"I thought this movie was amazing. This movie represents a lot more than just another typical basketball movie and reveals a majority of the true story of Coach Ken Carter. His story is so uplifting in its content and how it came to be a formality that I could guarantee anyone would at least smile after seeing this movie. It makes you think about where our priorities lie, both as individuals and as a society.Having met Ken Carter after seeing this movie, it only solidifies that this man is the real deal. His love, compassion, and respect for everyone is refreshing in today's world. In meeting this man, I realize that we should all be so fortunate as to have a mentor like him. And I'd be wrong if I didn't add he's a lot funnier in real life than Mr. Jackson portrays in the movie (and rightfully so, with consideration to the story). I also have to assure you that Samuel L. Jackson is the PERFECT FIT for Ken Carter's role. Not only is there a resemblance in looks, but the voice similarity was downright eerie at times during his speech.Anyways... good movie, great story, amazing man. Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Forget Open Water, Terminal, or any other movie of that sort. This movie is the real deal. For all you who think its a movie just for black folk your dead wrong. It brings every walk of life together and really unites things. Makes you appreciate what you have and where you live a little more.

Coach Carter is a great movie!,"Although I don't usually care for sports oriented movies, my daughter rented the DVD of Coach Carter and I watched it after she told me it was a good movie. I was fascinated by the movie from start to finish and greatly inspired by it. I admired the fantastic job Coach Carter did with the basketball team, not only on the courts but in the classroom, and how he kept the kids off the streets and gave them a positive direction in their lives. Also, his discipline seemed a bit harsh at times, but his heart was in the right place and his methods worked. His dedication, responsibility, and optimistic attitude were a tremendous example for his student players. Coach Carter's job must have been hard and often frustrating but he didn't give up until he had given his students tools to have better lives than their parents, other relatives, and friends had had. I think its great that he now does motivational speaking and is still causing improvements to happen in the school district of Richmond. My hat is off to you sir! JLH in MI",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
This isn't a sports movie as much as it's a life changing story,"What can I say about samuel L Jackson. He doesn't read scripts anymore when he picks roles it seems like. Until this movie he finally redeemed himself from movies like The Man and In My country. This was a great film.Jackson plays a coach that is more interested in having kids do well in school and stay off the streets than playing some basketball. He doesn't care if he has to bench the best player for failing a subject and goes to extreme lengths to represent that. The basketball is the sub-plot while trying to get kids to college and not killed is the main plot.Jackson did a great job while still showing off his attitude such as when he tied his shoes and says ""I tied that $hit!"" This to tell the team to stop mouthing off to the other team. Great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent performance by Samuel L. Jackson,"It's my first time watching this in 2025 and it's a very good movie. The soundtrack, cast and the acting is excellent! This is Channing Tatum's debut role. So basically the movie depicts the real life events of basketball coach Ken Carter and his efforts to teach his Richmond students education and discipline. Carter also teaches them how to speak to one another and behave. I can understand how Carter's decision to suspend his students is controversial, because people have a right to chase their dreams and be what they want to be. Playing basketball requires excellent skill in order to become a pro, but it has nothing to do with classwork. Being good at sports doesn't really require any classroom education, just physical education. I will be honest and say that I couldn't care less about sports because I never showed interest in it during my school years, so with that being said, the basketball scenes in this movie don't really strike my interest. Some people had mixed feelings about the movie because it portrays sports like in other movies, but this isn't just any sports movie. This movie has some memorable moments and it has a message behind it. The message is teamwork and dedication, if one person fails, everyone fails. Great movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
You could be better than you think,"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.Coach Carter is not only a tough coach, he is simply a powerful driving force. Some people may lack an external force throughout their lives to prompt them to complete a transformation.These basketball players are lucky. Many people in this world have not figured out their own affairs. Only some people can not only solve their own problems, but also sincerely help others. When you meet such a person, please be sure to say thank you.There are not many people like Coach Carter. There are some people in this world who are very smart, but are unwilling to share their wisdom. Of course, the more common ones are mediocre people. These mediocre people may be your principal, they may be powerful board members, they may be your teachers, they may be your family members. They are not wrong in terms of rules, but in terms of students' growth, they have deviated from the right track.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just brilliant.,"Timeless, brilliant basketball and hard hitting morals. Great message, great movie. Well done! ! As a basketball coach myself I'd like to watch this with my team. I'm also a teacher and believe this movie has some great messages behind it. I know from my own time playing basketball, that this movie has inspired the game and training sessions across the world, probably. Nice work from the actors involved, top class performance. Some legends featured in there, Samuel L Jackson, Channing Tatum, among others. It's a roller coaster, it's real, emotional, celebratory and definitely one for the DVD collection. You won't be disappointed. One 8f the best basketball films around. Great stuff!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A brilliant movie all round,"In fact ""brilliant"" is too small a word to conclude this movie, it was way beyond my expectations. Based on true story, this inspirational picture is about a basketball coach Ken Carter (played by Samuel L. Jackson), who coached a bunch of ""society forgotten"" teenagers and how his unorthodox methods inspired them not only to become good ball players, but also to learn to be disciplined, to get a good education, and most important of all: To get a decent living.And Samuel L. Jackson? How much cooler can this guy be? And are there any roles that he cannot be perfected in? He is undoubtedly the most underrated actor of our era. I have been his fan for God knows how long, and his performance in this picture really makes me hold him in a higher regard. Only he could success this role and I just wish that he will get some major awards for this act cos he totally deserves it.I think this movie totally reflected the leak hole of America's educational sports system. Sports become so big in America that when an opportunity to play sports and earn big money arises, people would become narrow-minded and grab the opportunity without second thought. They forget that sports don't make a boy a man, education does. It's all good and well that a man has a sporting talent, he can work on that and become rich and famous. However people can take away your sporting career, but they can't do so with what you have learnt, in this case education can work as a contingency, something you can fall back on. It's good to know that there's someone who put education ahead of everything and Ken Carter's work is really an inspiration and a benefit to all of us.I give this movie a 9/10, a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

the message,"Although this move's premise and message are not original, it should be required viewing for any teenage boy (and girl) who thinks the path to success is through pro sports. This movie and ""Hoop Dreams"" would be enough.In short, this is a spot on movie, that has some language and teen situations which may make it too grown up for youngsters. Other than that, Samual Jackson continues a long tradition of commanding performances, which give the movie its backbone and structure.The struggle to find one's way is punctuated by the life choices that we all make and it is here that Coach Carter sounds a clear bell, that the better path is to engage your mind and give yourself MORE choices as you reach adulthood.Finding that your good on the basketball court and can win is a wonderful experience, but it does make for an easy or automatic path to success.A movie like this needs to be made every generation because the message is always worth spreading.My favorite line is when one of the boys answers Coach Carters question, ""what's you greatest fear?"" Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own lights shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Inspirational,"Coach Carter was a brilliant film to me. The actors, the soundtrack, and the plot were all amazing in my eyes. First off, when you are making a film i take it that you need a leader and there are not much great leaders like Samuel L. Jackson. He was assigned the job of being a basketball coach and he used this privilege to not only teach them the right way to play basketball, but also the way to live life by reaching for your goals. He put his foot down in an area no one would attempt to and I commend him for it. Next, we have the soundtrack. This movie takes place in a town filled with gangs, drugs, and poverty. ""DMX"" is a rapper and he was on this soundtrack. His song ""Untouchable"" featured in Coach Carter and it fit in perfectly considering these players were trying to live about the influence and do something good with their lives. Finally, to say the plot was good would be an understatement. I say this due to the fact that the plot was difficult to guess. You never knew what was going to happen next and that kept it interesting. Overall this movie made me realize how hard some people have it and not to take anything for granted. It also taught me that its not always what you put into something, but what you learn from it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Movies that offer more than just victory.,"After watching this movie a long time ago, I want to recommend it. And honestly, it hit me harder than I expected. Yeah, it's a sports movie, but it's way more than that. It's about discipline, responsibility, and how life isn't just about talent, it's about hard work. The movie is based on a true story, which makes it even more impactful.Samuel L. Jackson plays Ken Carter, a tough but passionate high school basketball coach. When he takes over the Richmond High team, he's not just trying to make them better players, he's trying to make them better people. He makes them sign contracts agreeing to maintain a certain GPA and attend all their classes. At first, they hate it. They just want to play basketball, thinking it's their only shot at escaping their rough lives. But Carter isn't here for shortcuts. He pushes them to think beyond basketball and realize that their education is just as important as the game.One of the most intense moments in the movie is when Carter locks the gym and cancels games because his players aren't meeting academic expectations. The whole town freaks out, parents, school officials, and even the players turn against him. They think he's ruining their futures, but Carter stands his ground. He knows that most of these kids won't make it to the NBA, and without education, they have nothing to fall back on. He risks his reputation to teach them a lesson that most people ignore. Basketball is temporary, but knowledge lasts forever.What I liked most about the movie is how real it feels. It doesn't sugarcoat anything. The struggles these players face, poverty, gang violence, and a lack of hope, are real problems that many young athletes deal with. It's easy to see why they think sports is their only way out. But Carter forces them to see a bigger picture. The movie doesn't pretend that everyone gets a happy ending either. Some players turn their lives around and go to college, while others stay stuck in their environment. That's just reality. Not everyone gets saved, and the movie isn't afraid to show that.One of the most powerful scenes is when Timo Cruz, a troubled player, recites the famous quote, ""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure."" That moment really stuck with me. A lot of people don't fail because they're not capable, they fail because they're too scared to believe in themselves. This movie makes you think about how often we limit our own potential out of fear.Coach Carter isn't just an inspiring movie, it's emotional and frustrating at times. There are moments that make you want to cheer, and others that just punch you in the gut. It's not a feel-good, fairy tale sports story. It's about hard truths. Not everyone wins, and even when you do everything right, life can still be unfair.If you're expecting a movie where the underdogs magically win everything, this isn't it. But if you want a movie that actually makes you think about life, success, and what really matters, then Coach Carter is worth watching. Even if you're not into basketball, the message is something everyone can relate to. It's about fighting for your future, making sacrifices, and never settling for less than you deserve.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good Example of how important education is,Coach Carter in my opinion is more of a Documentary on how school important having an education is then a sports movie Ken Carter returns to his home town of Richmond CA to be the basketball coach of his old team but times have changed since he last played the boys are undisciplined and don't know how to play well so he makes them sign a contract to meet certain academic standards and in return he'll turn them into winners for a little while it seems to work and the team goes undefeated but he finds out that his players are not keeping up their end of the Begin in the contract he cancels basketball then the town goes into a riot and convinces the school board to let them play and as coach Carter steps down as basketball coach he sees that he has changed the boys lives and it convinces him to stay and help the boys meet their end of the contract and get on the court,10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Realistic, I Live Down The Street From The Actual High School!","So obviously, i'm a bit offended by the user who commented on the front page (at the time i read it) that goes by the user name of ""tfrizzell"" who gave an inaccurate description of the movie's story, claiming that it took place in L.A.. Actually it took play in the Bay Area, Richmond California (which was even mentioned in the movie). But anyway, this is a very touching story of a coach who won't give up on not just a team, but a generation of confused teens growing up in the streets of the inner-city.. a man who felt that school was more important than holding on to dreams one may not achieve due to improbability. he took these this value to a Richmond high school, where he and the team had life changing experiences..

Carter (Jackson) Overcame Low Expectations in Well Delivered US Urban Story,"This wonderfully told story and the characters in it literally reflect America--its diverse mosaic of ethnic/racial/socioeconomic groups and their corresponding and sometimes disappointing expressed and implied expectations.Coach Carter came from Richmond, California, a once predominantly white town now overwhelmingly populated by blacks and Latinos. All hope or expectation at Richmond High of graduating citizens one by one that could contribute to their communities seemed to have left with the white flight, but Coach Carter was willing to challenge that implied assumption.Carter was a solid civic pillar of the community long before taking over as head coach of Richmond High. He quietly ran his successful business and chose to raise his family in the community. When he took those young men to victory on the basketball court it eventually became apparent to him other problems would derail their success at life. He realized he had no control over a lot of what went on, but he took a stand on the things he could and greatness was the result. If you haven't seen the movie, go. The way Samuel Jackson and the movie full of future stars delivered, will leave you barreling over with laughter one moment and your vision blurred with tears the next.Bravo Coach Carter.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Hero,"Have you ever considered watching a dramatic film and thought it would be similar to any other dramatic movie, so why bother watching it? That was my first thought. Coach Carter, directed by Thomas Carter, seemed as if it simply was about a boys' high school basketball team and boys dealing with difficult lives. However, with the help of Mr. Carter, the new basketball coach, the boys' lives are about to change. In the poor town of Richmond, California, the high school boys' basketball team is in need of a new basketball coach. Knowing the displeasing reputation of these young men, Mr. Carter knows he can handle the job as the new coach. Mr. Carter sets strict rules for the team, teaching the boys the definition of respect. With a previous season of losses, Mr. Carter improves the team's performance on the court and begins an undefeatable season. However, the team's performance in class is unsatisfactory. With many failing grades, Mr. Carter takes action by taking basketball away. Mr. Carter deals with much criticism, but explains that education is more important and that basketball is only a privilege. Not only was it exciting to witness action on the basketball court, but also exciting to witness the action Mr. Carter took to help better the boys' lives. Living in ""ghetto"" neighborhoods, these boys were not prepared for the lives ahead of them. However, Mr. Carter knew he could make a difference and help push them to achieve their goals. Overall, this film sends the message that anyone, given the background or socioeconomic status, can be successful if they have determination and a willingness to succeed. Several years ago, I watched Coach Carter for the first time, and from then on, it has been a favorite of mine. Being based on a true story made it an unbelievably inspirational film because the viewer truly understands what Mr. Carter went through. With Samuel L. Jackson as Mr. Carter, I believe he truly made this film meaningful. I would definitely recommend watching Coach Carter.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

People may take it as another ""hood"" movie, but if you look at the contents you see it gives an example of what teenagers struggle with through high school in this generation.

Solid and enjoyable if somewhat unremarkable sports movie,"The pupils of a Richmond, California high school have little in the way of academic potential and, in their basketball team, little to celebrate in way of sporting achievement. The team and the players get a shakeup when local sports store Ken Carter accepts the job of coach of the basketball team. Making the players focus on fitness and sign academic contracts, the team revolts but quickly comes round to the tough new regime. He technique works on some levels as the team goes on an undefeated run in the league, however when the players start falling down in other areas, Carter holds to his original promises no matter what others think.The fact that FilmFour is playing this film at all times of the day on freeview should perhaps give an indication that this is not a ""special"" film that is worthy of great attention. It isn't and nor did it get any. This is not the same as saying it is a poor film though because it is certainly not. Although it is based on a true story, it is, at heart, a sports movie that sees the underdog team winning despite the odds. Along with this it does have the message of the importance of education and respect rather than arrogance and ""NBA or nothing"" attitude and for this it is hard to dislike it ¬ñ and I suppose it isn't that heavily delivered. These elements work well together and make the film engaging enough without ever being anything particularly inventive or original. If the film is 50% accurate in regards Carter then certainly he deserves more ¬ñ particularly within the sport of basketball in US, not a minor activity by any means.The heavy soundtrack shows the target audience and is sadly another demonstration of the lack of invention in the delivery although everything is competently done ¬ñ the direction didn't wow me but the sports action is well shot, which is not that easy to do. The cast are likewise solid and effective without ever excelling. Jackson goes into ""father-figure"" mode for this and it works well as his screen presence carries him a long way. He is well supported by the players themselves; OK some of them skate very close to being stereotypes but Gbewonyo, Brown, Gonzalez, Tatum and others all hold together well. Not sure about the casting of Ashanti. Yes she is sexy and adds appeal to this MTV film but she never feels the age of her character and instead just gets by being cute.Coach Carter is a MTV film that offers sports and a ""message"" and it pretty much does what you would expect and is still good even though it is anything shockingly new or inventive.

Yeast Infection,"Inspirational sports movies are like yeast infections--treat them badly and they just keep coming back. Coach Carter is yet another in an endless line of movies with underdog teams proving everyone wrong and winning (or in this case . . . ) the big game.

Even when he's sleepwalking through a movie, he has the command presence that keeps you watching even when you have something better to do--like changing the air in your basketball.What I found most distressing about this 135 minute clich√© is the whole inner-city, gangsta culture. At every level, there's something for adults to cringe at and kids to try to emulate.

Jackson was a perfect choice for the role of the head coach Ken Carter, mainly because of the certain edge that he gives off as an actor. Samuel L. Jackson has always been an intimidating actor in most of the movies he has played in. Most have them have been action films but this was a new film for him. Instead of being the fearless hardcore hero, he played the role of a father and a coach that has inspired a group of men to be more than a basketball team.Coach Carter soon sets many standards for the team that they have to abide by. These rules soon help develop the players into very well rounded men. With the help of these rules and a new coach the Richman High School Oilers soon became a community that not only was known for their basketball skills but the maturity of their players. The director of this movie did an amazing job of integrating the challenges of each player and having the coach help them through their troubles. The director really did a good job of controlling the young actors and giving the audience a good view of how the story really happened. Each player faced a huge wall that they had to overcome and Coach Carter influenced them through it all.Another thing that made this movie stand out was the fact that this is a true story. It's hard to put together a movie that has the appeal of a great sports obstacle, but also the development of the players how went from never having a chance of going to college to become mature men who had a chance to go to college. It's hard to take a true story and put it into a big screen movie. Thomas Carter again did a wonderful job with this movie.I would seriously recommend this movie to anyone who has a passion for films that are as deep and inspirational as this one. After watching this film I have found that anything is possible through hard work and dedication and an amazing mentor through it all. I have loved sports films ever since in started watching them and this film by far has been the greatest one yet.",,Anonymous,Biography
Song on commercial,"I was wondering if anyone has seen the previews for the movie and the song they play towards the end of the commercial. Some of the words are ""I've been waiting for this moment for all my life"" I figured it a Phil Collins remix but I don't know the name or who sings it and I am having so much trouble finding it so if anyone can help me i'd really appreciate it. Thanks................. ................... .......... ........ ................ ........ . ............ .......... ....... ......... ........ .......... ............ ........... ......... .......... .......... .......... ......... ......... .......... ........... ........ . .............. ...... ............ ......... ...... ......... ........... ............ ........ ......... ..... ..... ..... ........... ........ ...... ......... ............. .......... ........ ........ .......... ........... .......... ........ ................",,Anonymous,Biography
Coach Ripoff Another remake unbelievable!,What is with these people today? It is like they have no original ideas any more I mean first you come out with Love Don't Cost A Thing (rip off of Can't Buy Me Love) then you make Coach Carter (rip off of Lean On Me) and then you make Guess Who (rip off of Guess Who's Coming To Dinner). I believe that this movie Coach Carter is just Lean On Me with basketball and a newer version of Morgan Freeman in Samuel Jackson. Granted Jackson gives an outstanding performance as the coach himself but all they did was move it from NY to LA and change the role from the principal to coach. What are most of these people thinking? Anyway Jackson is a fast rising star just like Freeman a legend in the making.,,Anonymous,Biography
Coach and teachers who really care about the students can make a difference,"My husband and I attended the film ""Coach Carter"" and were extremely pleased by the message the Coach was giving to these young men. We also (my husband was a coach) are curious who the basketball players were who portrayed the original players as they were very, very good players. I also taught Physical Education in a school very similar to Richmond, and found that my students really did want direction, but they were slow to accept this direction. It takes time, and this film was especially realistic when the boys took a long time to realize what Carter was trying to do. These are the kind of Movies that are so good for any young person to see, and who knows just what an impact they can make on teenagers. We need more like this and other Movies like this such as October Sky, Stand and Deliver, and The Titans.",,Anonymous,Biography
A sports movie with heart...,"From the previews this looked like a charming, funny and touching movie. I was not disappointed. Every role was perfectly cast and Rob Brown especially shines. The film didn't preach and wasn't over the top trying to ploy your emotions (Ehem- Remember the Titans) and simply was was it was; a fun movie with a good meaning.This is a tale about a strong upstanding and hard working man who wants to coach a seemingly hopeless bunch of misguided teens to have a goal in life. And it works. Samuel L Jackson plays this role easily and his witty one liners have the same effect on the audience as they did on his players; they make us laugh and sort of respect the guy. It is a movie that shows you can do anything you want to do with hard work, discipline and respect (for others and yourself). It seems that a lot of teens today either don't know this or don't care. I don't think seeing this movie will change things for those teens, but perhaps they will listen to their own ""Coach Carter"" and make different life choices.But Coach Carter doesn't go over the top to preach these morals. It doesn't try to shock you with what could happen if you don't do what coach tells you. It simply shows you a story where a group of kids did listen and how that works for them.I would see this movie again. I will buy it when it comes out. And enjoy it over and over again for being exactly what it set out to be... a sports movie with heart.",,Anonymous,Biography
Sentimental but very entertaining,"How do you top the career of Sam Jackson, a classic actor who has been in many superb films all around for years. ""Pulp Fiction"" ""Jackie Brown"" and the ""Negotiator"" were all excellent, but in recent years it seemed as if he had simply scrapped all of that, and taken any offer that came his way, no matter how poor the material. ""Swat"" and ""Basic"" are perfect examples. So how does good old Sam get on top of his game again? He signs up for a fresh new film like ""Coach Carter"".Targeting the career of ""Ken"" and his quest to make the ""hood"" peaceful again and giving all the ""hardcore"" gangsters goals, you can tell this is a pro-education film just dripping with sentimentality. The only problem is: these guys just ain't gangster enough. OK, there is no denying, Coach Carter targeted the market; a smart move, fair enough. But in doing so they created a relatively pretentious view of a ""rough"" neighbourhood, with teens who don't act hard and don't speak hard. Bad language may not be completely necessary, but it certainly would of added to the realism here. That aside, this film is very entertaining, and, for a short while, almost really good; but here and there the corny side creeps up, particularly in a horribly clich√©d, unnecessary scene where young hood member ""Cruz"" proves his worth to the team. It is literally cringe-worthy.So all in all, Coach Carter is not great film. Had I reviewed this on the basis of how well and how realistically this film was done, I'd probably give it about a 1, but this was a fun, popcorn flick that is good for a short period but drags on eventually. Maybe good enough for a re-watch.***/ out of ***** (3 and a half out of 5)",,Anonymous,Biography
Coach Carter review,"""Coach Carter"" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It embodies all components of an entertaining and attention-grabbing movie. The messages sent through the movie were very serious and moving, yet entertaining. It deals with all issues facing teens today; from gang violence, to drug use, to teen pregnancy, to excellence in athletics and in school. The movie is set in an inner city California neighborhood where gang violence and drug use is a way of life. When Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) accepts the position of head basketball coach, he knows exactly what obstacles are ahead of him and what needs to be done to achieve his goals for the team. Coach Carter not only wants his team to excel on the basketball court but in the classroom as well. When the boys' grades start slipping, he proceeds to bench his entire team and lock the gym until all grades are up to par. One of the most emotional and inspirational moments of the movie is when all boys say they refuse to play for anyone but Coach Carter and decide to get their grades up. The movie is a bit long, yet there's always something going on so it never gets boring. The life lessons learned in the movie are unbelievable and nothing short of amazing. The impact that Coach Carter has on these young boys' lives is incredible. For someone to have that much influence on people's lives is a great attribute. After you see this movie, it will leave you with a sense of motivation to inspire and touch people's lives the way Coach Carter did.",,Anonymous,Biography
amazing!!,"I think I'm obsessed! I've seen the movie twice and i'm planning on going again. It was amazing! The guys are so sexy, the movie is amazing, the tracks are hype and oh my gad! perfection! (to me anyways!) Honestly, you should go see it! I'm in love! =] I thought the story line was pretty good, and it's not one of those movies where you know whats going to happen. I was sitting with my bf and hes like ""yeah obviously its going to happen!"" ha ha but he was so wrong! I promise you, you won't be wasting your money! It's a good flick and I think everyone should see it.. at least once! Ashanti was pretty good too, considering i'm not such a big fan of her acting skills. Samuel L. Jackson didn't let me down on this one. Once again, amazing movie! =]",,Anonymous,Biography
