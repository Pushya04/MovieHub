The Day I Stopped Trusting Critics,"This movie was dishonestly mauled by critics and reviewers simply because it was directed by Snyder. Watching this again in 2020, I have to say this will go down as a classic in years to come. It's an absolute blast from start to finish and is one of the most loyal adaptations and faithful to the Superman lore found in DC comics. One of its greatest achievements was the magnificent depiction of Krypton and giving Zod the gravitas and motivation that he lacked in Superman II. You felt empathy for him. Shannon was outstanding in his portrayal of Zod; up there with Ledger's Joker.I remember people actually complained about the level of destruction in this movie and the excessive use of special effects, but for me this is what makes a Superman movie. Take off your nostalgia tinted glasses and watch this with an open mind. This is the greatest Superman movie bar none.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ignore the critics,"I am old enough to have seen the original 2 Christopher Reeve Superman movies, and the idea of combining them is great. Henry Cavill is a better Superman, Amy Adams is a better Lois Lane, the script is far stronger, the baddies are more believable, I honestly can't understand the negatives; with the exception of the first 20 minutes, which just didn't work. A great attempt, far better than most DC movies, except the Nolan ones.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I've changed my mind,"Here, eleven years after this movie released, I have changed my mind about this movie. In the last eleven years, we have seen so many others DCEU and MCU superheroe movies, with one would or could connect to the other, making us assume or create some fan theories, about what happened and what will happen next.For example, I think Infinity War and End Game were the peak MCU, everything after that the storyline kinda made up. While DCEU to be honest never even started. The connection between one another felt forced.But this movie, can be a standalone movie. No need of sequel or prequel, it's already a great movie about a man.Every essential you need to he a superhero is fulfilled. The background, the struggle, the realization, principles. Everything. It's a perfect superhero movie.Initially I rated 7, but now it's a solid 9.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than WW84,I was really happy with the origin story aspect of this movie... although I would have liked to see more of Kevin Costner's character.

Best Superman to Date,"I love Superman. Every version. I'll defend Superman 4 if you want? But this is the definitive version. The version I've always dreamed of seeing - the version I'd write if I could have. Challenging, thought-provoking, insightful. Not there to be a poster child, but rather to be an inspiration. Inspiration comes through internal struggle and strife, not through BANG BANG, POW POW. I wish DC had more faith in this storyline - cause it was clearly going somewhere wonderful. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Brand New Superman You've Never Seen Before,"This is not like all the previous Superman movies. This is not ""Smallville"". This is not the sequel of ""Superman Returns"". This is ""Man of Steel""! This movie is awesome.I am not a big fan of Superman but this is the best Superman movie I've ever seen. (Christopher Reeve's version is also good, but this Man of Steel is better. And.. the Brandon Routh's version? Naaaaah...) The plot is really structural. Not so many flashbacks, so you won't get confused. The whole storyline is just really simple. It told the very beginning of Superman and then, yeah, his adulthood.The special effects here, I think it is as awesome as Marvel's Avengers. Yeah, alien and superheroes, what do you expect? Battle scenes are good, I can feel Zack Snyder ""300"" sensation in here.Henry Cavill succeeded bringing a whole new version of Superman to the big screen. He wiped out all our knowledge of the previous Superman movies and replaced it with a darker version of Superman (Nolan's kinda ""darkness"") This movie is enjoyable. See?

Ahead of its time,"I never had the opportunity to see this film in theatres, though, after my first viewing at home, I was instantly blown away by the tone, visuals, soundtrack, story, performance, thriller and action to this film.Man of steel truely felt as though it was an alien invasion film set in our present time.Superman has literally searched to find himself and when he does, he must learn not only learn his origins, though his abilities and how to use them.He was bound to question himself and make mistakes along the way and following his journey is something I'm extremely excited for.Most certainly a superhero film for adults.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The soundtrack is epic.,"Henry Cavil is my Superman. He's the best Superman ever. Interesting story, with deep meanings and realism. The camera work is not so good, some parts is good but others it feels like a Michael Bay film. The action sequences are pretty intense and excessive. However the soundtrack is probably the best thing of the movie. I've told it again, Hans Zimmer is a brilliant worker in music. The music names of the movie that I really love is:Flight

Criminally Underrated,"It is the most criminally Underrated superhero movie ever. It's also the movie that made me love Superman .Zack Snyder best work and Hans Zimmer was amazing.

Remember that sinking feeling you had watching The Dark Knight Rises?,"I wanted to like this movie. Admittedly, I went in with high expectations, but I thought the names behind the movie, the actors and the beautiful trailer justified my high hopes.And - at first - I thought it was all going to work out. For the first 40 minutes or so, this movie is awesome. Krypton, an ALIENated Clark Kent doing odd jobs on earth, a confused boy trying to cope with his powers...Some reviewers have bashed the movie for being too serious, but there's nothing wrong with a little seriousness, or a little reverence towards the character. In the first half, I think the tone is perfect. A little dark, sure, but it all feels like we're building up towards something truly awesome. Then, kind of suddenly, the main story with Zod and the action starts. And, as much as I love action movies, I really wished it hadn't.When the serious actions starts, all coherent story telling stops. In the blink of an eye the movie goes from feeling like a sci-fi Batman Begins to Transformers 3 minus the nuanced story telling. Suddenly Superman is here and we get these big sweeping beautiful scenes, and they're just completely boring and out of place. And I don't even want to talk about the totally contrived Lois Lane - Superman romance. (Lots of sighs, and ""WTF?"" comments at the theater I was in).I kept waiting for it to recapture the tone of the first half, but the action just keeps getting bigger and dumber. In the middle of the unending action spectacle of the second half, I actually nodded off.This movie had the creative talent, and the actors to make something really great. And I feel like without a Michael Bay explosion quota maybe they could have done it here... But in the end this is a missed opportunity.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What's with all the hate?! I LOVE MAN OF STEEL!!!,"Am I one of the few people who actually love this movie? Man of Steel has beautiful visuals, an amazing cast ensemble, and action scenes to blow you away.

It's no Wonder Woman or Aquaman, but its a very fun watch and completely unforgettable!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mostly good but I despise the Krypton storyline,"For a superhero movie there's definitely some positives here. Henry Cavill is fantastic and I enjoyed the take on Clark choosing to live in obscurity instead of the happy-go-lucky reporter at the Daily Planet. It felt very grounded.I enjoyed Diane Lane's performance alot. Costner and Adams aren't given alot to work with. Whilst Costner kind of stumbled through Adams' performance outshines the limited story and dialogue. But I agree with others who have said that the chemistry between Cavill and Adams is VERY forced. And finally I'm always going to enjoy seeing Chris Meloni and Richard Schiff appear on my screen.Now I pretty much hated everything Krypton related in this movie. Starting with the atrocious aesthetics between the costumes and sets. It's so black and plastic looking. And there were alot of names, references and long winded explanations of what was happening that never really made sense or came together to form a coherent picture. It's like they committed at the beginning to telling ""Krypton's story"" but halfway through realised it was going to be too much work so they did the bare minimum.The actor who played Zod was terrible (a charmless, Cookie cutter bad guy) and who the hell cares who else was tagging along with him. Russell Crowe has a handful of good moments but it's mostly pretty boring stuff.Overall it's a passable mild entertaining movie for a Sunday afternoon. But ultimately pretty forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Look Back at This Movie From 10 Year Out ...,"First of all, I've been a Superman fan since I was a pre-teen when George Reeves was cast in the role on TV. We've come a long way since then and special effects/CGI has elevated the film experience to heights we could have only imagined. I put that all into perspective and appreciate each version of Superman according to the time frame in which it was filmed. When ""Man of Steel"" was first released, it didn't really grab me. Why not? It had the most incredible cast so what was it lacking? Looking back at the movie, I compared it to, ""The Avengers"" which was released within a year of ""Man of Steel"". The MCU had humor, humor, humor and in case you didn't catch it the first time ... HUMOR. ""Man of Steel"" did not. The director/producers attempted to insert total gravitas as its driving force and that translates to a cinema experience without punch/pizzazz. ""Man of Steel"" could have been any movie which portrays a struggle between any normal person's struggle to balance his biological parents/humanity/personal strength. And it didn't do it all that well. This makes me sad. As I've said, I'm a Superman fan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Underrated Masterpiece,"Man of Steel is a breathtaking and ambitious reimagining of Superman's origin that deserves far more recognition than it received. This movie breathes new life into the classic hero with stunning visuals, a grounded storyline, and one of the most powerful scores ever composed by Hans Zimmer. This film is nothing short of a chef's kiss - an underrated masterpiece that elevates the superhero genre to a whole new level.Zimmer's background score is the beating heart of Man of Steel. His music captures the essence of Superman - hope, struggle, and inner strength - with a haunting, emotional resonance that stays with you long after the credits roll. Tracks like ""Flight"" and ""What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?"" take each scene to a higher plane, perfectly conveying Clark Kent's journey from outsider to hero. Zimmer's score is monumental and tender at once, turning each action scene into a visceral experience and each emotional beat into a moment of pure cinematic magic.The film's visuals are nothing short of stunning. Snyder creates an immersive world, filled with grand, awe-inspiring scenes that lend Superman's story a sense of mythic scale. The Krypton opening sequence alone is a visual marvel, introducing audiences to a fresh and imaginative view of Superman's home world. And when it comes to Superman's first flight, Snyder delivers a scene so exhilarating and hopeful that it feels like an invitation to believe in the impossible.This isn't just a superhero movie - it's a deeper exploration of identity, sacrifice, and the weight of destiny. Henry Cavill's Superman is both human and heroic, facing internal struggles that make his journey feel grounded and real. The movie's action scenes are intense and powerful, but they're backed by meaningful stakes that make every punch and every victory feel earned.Man of Steel deserves to be remembered not just as a Superman film, but as a true cinematic gem. Snyder's direction, Zimmer's score, and Cavill's heartfelt performance make it an unforgettable experience that soars above typical superhero fare. For anyone who loves powerful storytelling wrapped in stunning visuals and an unforgettable score, Man of Steel is a must-watch - a true ""chef's kiss"" that honors and redefines an icon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great hero gets a great movie,When I was watching the trailer for man of steel I felt that this movie will be the greatest movie for Superman and also it will take the sci-fi genre to the another level and finally when I saw the movie all of my expectations were full filled the movies action scenes were new though the origin was old but they had made a superman which is very difficult to make.I like this movie and waiting for its next sequel.In this movie Mr.Snyder has given one of the greatest directions in superhero genre. My results for this movie are positive and I hope the next installment will be greater than this one.So after watching this film my expectations are now higher from its sequel hope it will also exceed my expectations,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Loses itself when the action starts,"In a nutshell, MOS is a little schizophrenic. The first half is beautiful, touching, well-written and goes on an engaging exploration of this iconic figure; but when the action starts it's almost as if a different writer and director took the helm. Shaky cam simultaneously adds to the sense of you being there in the middle of things but also makes it so you actually can't see what the hell is going on. The majority of the second half of MOS is basically a blurry cloud of dust and flames with occasional glimpses of the characters in the middle of it all.The first half though - was a clean 9/10. The destruction of Krypton was a visual feast, the letting go of Cal El by his parents was genuinely touching and I even felt a tear welling. The film smartly jumped straight into adult-superman's life and presented his backstory with Jonathan and Martha as well-done flashbacks. Michael Shannon was incredible and sympathetic as Zod. Kevin Costner was simply brilliant (stole this movie imo).It was all good until - well, I dunno what happened really, I guess the suits up on high decided that they had to meet a quota of destruction or something, so they just abandoned all story, characterization, and theme and went for the big light show.Big, BIG shame.The closing few minutes of the movie, do redeem it a little, but after the hour of shaky cam headache that came before it, it's too little too late to save everything.Two major elements that made the Reeve movie so memorable are missing here. First, Lois knows who Kent is from the outset, so there's none of that tension of his discovery to be explored. Second, there's not even a single bar of homage to the iconic music in the theme of MOS. I understand that Snyder and Nolan were trying for a brave new direction but to remove those two supporting structures without replacing them with something similarly strong is just asking for the roof to come down.All said and done though, I'm glad I saw it, it was mostly enjoyable, and being a superhero movie fanatic I'll probably own it on DVD as soon as the price drops to reasonable levels. But if you think it's going to be as solid or spectacular as The Avengers you'll be sorely disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie has no soul,"I was really excited to see this movie considering all the creative and successful names that were attached to it. However I came out of it more frustrated than anything else. I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't, and here are some reasons why:Straight from the beginning, I couldn't help but notice that the movie was trying too hard to be similar to recently successful sci fi films rather than trying to find its own style (Avatar, The Avengers, Batman Begins and the Matrix come to mind). Then there were the minor plot holes, inconsistencies and lack of believability or followthrough that would have brought that extra touch of realism. But the real downfall of the film was the matter-of-fact and detached style by which it was presented to the audience. This left the movie emotionally empty and with no one to identify with. As the movie continued it became more of the same going through the motions (ok now this happened, and now this happened, oh and now this is happening) to the point where I didn't really care about the movie or characters any more, I just wanted the monotony to be over. This is the reason it felt rushed and long at the same time, like key elements were underdeveloped and missing. This is a great example of how you can have the most massive, amazing grandiose scale special effects and world altering events on screen but without the proper build up and audience investment I didn't really care about the characters, and continued to grow bored until I just wanted it to end. The trailers were more suspenseful than the actual movie for crying out loud.I'm not sure whose fault it was- the editor, the director, the script, post production but a little more than half way through it started to feel like it was dragging. You can walk out of a really enjoyable film after 3 hours and not realize how much time has gone by. I would not have minded if the movie was 15 minutes longer but had the slightest bit of suspense, emotion or character development in it. It felt like it was cut down to its bare bones- you cant omit that stuff to make room for more special effects, if that is in fact what they were doing. No amount of action can ever replace good story telling. Instead what we got was clichéd one liners and characters going through the motions interacting with themselves so to speak instead of playing off each other, like in a bad video game. Even great acting from Michael Shannon and Russel Crowe wasn't enough to elevate their characters from appearing as one-dimensional cliff notes. It's not being too picky when you want something essential and basic that every movie should have and when many people didn't like the movie for the exact same reasons. I also found the writing to be lazy, and without giving too much away, certain plot elements could have been used to show that Superman was not just all brawn but brains as well. Plus, Lois knows and thats just boring.It seems to be a growing trend in blockbuster movies these days, while trying to make the movie more modern, technologically up to date and fit for a younger audience, story telling takes a back seat to cheap thrills and special effects to get more people into the theater. It's a shame then that this movie feels like an attempt to mash together as many unoriginal blockbuster genres with as much mindless action special effects as humanly possible, most likely in an attempt to compete in the 'how big can we make this' superhero franchise. I like special effects and I know its good for business, but does the movie making process have to suffer to such an extent as a consequence? Even the Avengers with its multitude of characters was able to pull of an engaging thrill ride compared to this.To those trying to undermine the critics I have a few things to say. I like Snyder's previous films and particularly enjoyed Watchmen, so I would have had no problem with a darker of more serious version of Superman, except this movie was none of those things. I feel a lot of people who will defend the movie don't have much to say besides 'superman was a badass compared to other movies' and 'it was visually impressive'. They refuse to see the whole picture and realize that a shiny toy is just a shiny toy. The critics didn't rate this movie poorly because it was serious, dark or they didn't like Snyder's style- it was because the movie didn't have a unique character, or any style Snyder is famous for. While that 'satisfied feeling' you had at the end of the movie instead of the 'wanting more' feeling really shows how mundane it really was. A movie of this magnitude should leave you wanting more, for a sequel or at least for a second viewing. After watching this movie I had no desire for either of those things. Just because a film has amazing special effects does not automatically make it a good movie.What this movie did was ironically give me a new appreciation for Superman Returns. While Bryan Singer's approach to the character and story was somewhat dated, it was a polished work that (while it didn't appeal to everybody) was executed very well in all aspects, especially story telling. The difference is that people didn't like MOS not because it had a unique style, but because it wasn't a complete film, and the difference shows. An ideal Superman movie in my opinion would combine the best aspects of both films. A modern approach with exciting and relatable character development and story telling that Superman deserves. Just felt like I needed to express my disappointment and frustrations at this squandered potential.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Zack Snyder's Sci-Fi spectacle with a weak intellectual appeal,"Man of Steel is the first installment in the much-anticipated ""Superman"" reboot helmed by American filmmaker Zack Snyder. The movie marks the return of the DC Comics iconic superhero to the celluloid after a seven- year-long hiatus following the abysmal show of Bryan Singer's Superman Returns (2006).Co-written by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, Man of Steel stars Henry Cavill in the role of the eponymous superhero—a part that was immortalized by the late Christopher Reeve. The movie's stellar ensemble cast includes the likes of Amy Adams (as Lois Lane), Russell Crowe (as Jor-El), Kevin Costner (as Jonathan Kent), Laurence Fishburne (as Perry White), Diane Lane (as Martha Kent), and Michael Shannon (as General Zod).Man of Steel takes a departure from the trademark style of the ""Superman"" films starring Christopher Reeve. Make no mistake! Man of Steel's striking contrast to its predecessors is not merely because of its technical supremacy (3D, Special Effects, etc). Even the makers choose to make a statement by opting for a title that doesn't have the word ""Superman"" attached to it (not to mention about Superman's new costume). In fact, it would be safe to look upon this rather drastic transformation as a paradigm shift.Man of Steel serves to be a decent summer flick with truckloads of entertainment value for the casual viewers. But, sadly, for the most part, it remains limited to entertainment. Snyder shows flashes of brilliance but fails to capitalize on those strong moments. Man of Steel offers a lot a promise but falls short of living up to it. At best, it serves to be a run-of-the mill sci-fi adventure that is all style but very little substance. Hopefully, Snyder and team will learn from their mistakes and make a strong comeback with the forthcoming installments. 6.5/10A more detailed review of the film can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Buildings blowing,pumps exploding,guns blazing,CGI and special effects overflowing...NOT WHAT I WANTED","I had been waiting for Man Of Steel for more than a year. Watched all its trailers on IMDb itself. And look what they did.Snyder wanted to make his masterpiece. He probably considers himself a genius. But seriously are we so foolish that we consider such a movie with no decent plot and no clever twists or character development not only good but GREAT.Well its not.The first half is basically introducing kal-el and his extraordinary abilities and hiding them from the world. It is slow , uninteresting but however provides decent possibility of a lift up in the second halfNow is when it gets worse.The second half is filled with special effects, CGI and nothing more.The last half hour had me yawning and cursing zack snyder.This could have been a masterpiece. It had all the elements but missed the thread that ties it all together. And i do not think that nolan was associated with the project in any creative way. The first half was nothing special and the second half was just blowing stuff and 'aliens' beating each other,buildings been torn apart and similar BS.Almost all the actors were wasted.Although Kevin Costner was good in the screen time he had. Russel Crowe was completely wasted and so was adams. Henry Cavill didn't have to do much but to make weird sex faces while flying. Nothing special about the others either.I had great expectations from this but they were not met. Rather i left the theater bored, cheated and poorer.So i suggest not to waste your money on this.The 3d was nothing special either. Overall this was a huge disappointment.And please don't compare this to Batman Begins. Its not even in the same class.1/10 and thats because i am a generous fella........and i don't have a choice.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid Reboot,"Feeling like a breath of fresh air, 'Man of Steel' is a noble and sublime effort by director Zack Snyder. With a detailed and well structured first act, the underlying knowledge behind the history and reasoning for the main protagonist is fully defined and understood.Henry Cavill plays the role perfectly, seeming content in the character. Amy Adams is okay but the film doesn't devote enough attention for us to care about her. Michael Shannon is a fine overactor but is not given good enough dialogue.The CGI for the most part is some of the best I've ever seen. It's top tier mastery of visual effects and it is incredibly beautiful.Some minor nitpicks here and there, largely in dialogue, but it is a strong contender for my favourite superhero movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Man of Steel: When Superman has a premium gym membership!,"Imagine a world where dumbbells are made of kryptonite and abs are harder than diamonds. Welcome to the universe of ""Man of Steel,"" where Henry Cavill plays a Superman so muscular that even Hulk would want to ask him for his workout secrets. This guy must have a premium membership at the Fortress of Solitude's gym.Zack Snyder, the director of ""Man of Steel,"" must have a secret deal with a special effects factory. How on earth can he blow up buildings and destroy entire cities in every movie without blowing up the budget? It's like he's found the cheat code for free explosions. You have to wonder if his Fortress of Solitude looks like a warehouse filled with model buildings ready to be destroyed.In this film, we dive into Superman's existential crisis. He's wondering whether he should be a superhero or just a super nice guy. It's like he needs Kryptonian therapy to deal with his identity issues. But instead, he chooses to solve everything by sending evil identity thieves into the atmosphere. It's a form of therapy, right?The cast of ""Man of Steel"" is so geek-friendly it could fill a Comic-Con on its own. Amy Adams, the smartest woman at the Daily Planet, shines brighter than a superhero's gem. Michael Shannon as the villainous General Zod is so frantic he could animate a role-playing game in the blink of an eye. And Kevin Costner as Papa Kent? Well, he's so moving you'd think he was trained by Yoda himself.If ""Man of Steel"" left you sweating, get ready for ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."" It's like DC Comics threw its entire catalog into a giant blender and hit the ""action"" button. Expect more fights, more tight costumes, and more popcorn than you can handle. It's going to be more intense than a Star Wars marathon at lightspeed!In the end, ""Man of Steel"" gives us a Superman who's clearly overdosed on kryptonite protein and weightlifting sessions. Zack Snyder, the special effects magician, continues to amaze us with his ability to destroy entire cities without blowing the budget. The film tackles Superman's psychological side, but instead of seeing a therapist, he prefers to solve his problems by launching villains into the atmosphere. The cast is geek-tastic, and the sequel promises to be even crazier. So, get your capes and popcorn ready, because the DC Comics universe is becoming as big as the ""Marvel vs. DC"" debate in the Comic-Con cafeteria.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Superman Movie Ever Made,"This is what I've been waiting for my whole life - a Superman film that tackles big issues, big ideas and takes risks.

My favorite Superman movie.,"'Man of Steel' starts with the birth of Clark Kent, telling us where he comes from, who his parents are, and why he grew up on Earth. I enjoyed this detailed back story, making me root for him all the more.Henry Cavill is perfectly cast as Clark Kent, or Superman. Despite being a superhero, Kent is filled with emotion and feelings like ordinary human beings, and Cavill lends credibility to the character. Cavill is also darn sexy! Amy Adams stars as his love interest, Lois Lane. Although the romance developed a bit too quickly for my taste, I did enjoy the chemistry and endearing moments between them. I somehow would have preferred Lois Lane to be dark-haired, and not red-haired. Just a personal preference to the character...As for the visual effects and action sequences, wow it's incredible! The action is fast-paced, and the visual effects are dazzling, making 'Man of Steel' a visual spectacle of note. For such a long film (almost 2½ hours), it was never boring and captivated me from beginning to end. Even when there were no action, I was so invested in the characters that I didn't even miss the action. I found it compelling with interesting characters.Michael Shannon stars as the film's antagonist, General Zod, and I thought he, too, did a really good job. He was a fearless and determined character, and a worthy antagonist. In general, 'Man of Steel' is a top-notch production, fast-paced and exciting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Far better than the 7.1 rating on IMDB,"I see what people mean now by this movie being underrated. With 7.1 stars, It's underrated in terms of IMDB reviews and potentially elsewhere. This movie should have at least 7.9 stars. I understand people didn't like the CGI, and I think that's understanable but at the same time I think it's being picky and too ""left-brained"" for me. But at the same time, Henry Cavill is highly regarded on social media as the best Superman ever.Personally, I think ""Man of Steel"" is an incredible Superman movie and one of DC's best along with the Dark Knight trilogy. I'm still sad this was Henry Cavill's only solo Superman movie. Really wishing they never made Superman vs. Batman, and just came out with a second solo movie for Cavill. It's unfortunate, because the set-up at the end of the movie was perfect for a sequel.Watching back in 2024 on MAX, it's still just as good as it was in 2013. I found it interesting that Kal-El was too often referred to as simply Kal. It makes sense, as he is from the house of El, thus it's treated as a surname. That said, then why isn't Jor-El just called ""Jor""? I also don't love Amy Adams portrayal of Lois Lane. Adams did portray her as smart, definitely fiercely determined as she follows Clark Kent in the beginning of the movie, and brave as she steps into an escape pod without hesitation, but she didn't quite capture her moxie, wit and spirited energy. Cavill did well with his ongoing struggle between humanity and being Kryptonian, often embracing his love for humanity and peace as Superman always does.Overall, this movie was like a non-stop super train of out-of-this-world action, with so many great little moments sprinkled throughout (especially with Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent). Great editing, soundtrack, and special effects. It captured the essence of the classic Superman story so incredibly well. With some tweaks to special effects and characterization, Man of Steel could have been a timeless treasure. Not bad for a stand-alone solo superman movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Bad,"Worst movie. The opening had promise with Russell Crowe as Jor-El sending his son on his journey. The minimal dialogue revealed very little about the characters. Even Lois Lane is a shadow of her former self, with longing looks and not much of the spunk we expect from her character. Where is the fun news room banter? The entire project is based on computer graphics explosions and destruction. They destroy building after building after building, gas station, supermarket, skyscraper, until you are just bored with the repetitive plot. It is terrible. The fighting is a blur and Superman is just not his super self. Don't waste your money unless you are a young male looking for a movie that looks like a video game. I am so disappointed that they made an awful Superman movie. If you like anything besides violent fights and explosions, you'll be bored to tears. Save your money for the next Spiderman, Bat Man or Iron Man movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Good!,"So we are looking at essentially a remake of Superman (nothing wrong with that).
So how does it compare? Favourably.The original is perhaps a little softer, more romantic and more idyllic whereas the remake is darker, richer and a little more interesting.2 changes that worked for me, the origin part of the story on Krypton which is much more expansive (creating more of a universe feel, literally) and the extended character of Superman Senior. Brando was the quintessential sci-fi 'head in a bottle' character using him to explain Supe's back story in the original, Crowe's character came full combat ready and I think it added well to the overall story.Really enjoyable effort that sits well as a representative of the DC universe :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A truly amazing film,"This film is about how Clark Kent grew up on Earth, and how he battles with the evil General from Krypton to save the Earth.""Man of Steel"" completely blew me away. Firstly the visual effects are really amazing. Almost every scene is made up of splendid computer effects. The extra terrestrial futuristic battles in the beginning is already spectacular, but it only gets better. Later in the film, the destruction of a metropolis on a never before seen scale and in such vivid detail, that I was completely entranced.It's easy for the abundance of special effects to drown out the plot, but fortunately that was not the case. The story spans a long time, with characters time to be developed and to make an impact on the viewers. I was drawn to Russell Crowe's integrity and his determination to save his planet, and I was impressed by Amy Adams' pursuit of the truth. Henry Cavill's superman is a very engaging character, he really shows the pain of growing up different. The human side of the plot is told very well, touching heart strings that ultimately make the emotional climax even more effective.After the film, I felt almost weak from exhaustion of adrenaline, and any other brain chemicals that the film had me firing. It's such a powerful film that never ceases to amaze and inspire awe.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A shallow movie that tries too hard to be something else,"Without disclosing anything about the plot, I can say, the plot is interesting, its one which has a lot of potential, and one of those that avoids many of the clichés of a general superman movie. Unfortunately, the treatment for the plot is as shallow as it can get. I understand the directors perspective, and what he was trying to show, but it just doesn't connect, all the suffering kid Clark has, feels completely unnecessary, we all know Superman's abilities, nobody is worried about what 'they' will do to him, the whole outcast thing doesn't add up. In fact at a particular point in the movie, it becomes enough. The emotions between the father and the child were portrayed in an exuberantly poor and soulless manner. Clark shares a much more convincing relation with his Kryptonian father - Jor-El, and also with Lois Lane. Zod is a very interesting Antagonist whose potential has been completely wasted, Instead all we get is some ridiculously heavy fist fighting. The problem with the treatment to the movie, is that, they tried to over complicate the story, what was supposed to be a simple and enduring story has now turned into a convoluted attempt at 'adapting' it to a modern audience who have seen the story a couple of times already. Do not get me wrong here, as i have already mentioned, the plot holds a lot of promise, but fails to deliver.Liked : The plot line, Jor-El, Superman(Not Clark), Lois ZodDisliked: The tone of the movie (a little unnecessarily grim and sad), Clarks human father, Clark, The lack of intelligence in most of the characters. ( This seems to be something in more then one of Zack Snyder's films )Final verdict : Mindless Blockbuster :: The studios should really stop making these sort of movies, extravagant CGI doesn't really make for a good movie, if a commercially entertaining movie is all that is aimed for, at least do it like the avengers / star trek, where the intention of the movie is to entertain and engage the audience, and not be some pseudo philosophical drama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Solid movie,"The casting was great, the SFX is great the story is great but a little long. Probably the first movie I've ever though was too long instead of too short but they definitely drug a pretty thin story line out further than needed.

Definitely a better movie than most of the reviews, especially the reviews from when the movie first debuted.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Man of Steel: A Bold and Visually Striking Reinvention of the Iconic Hero,"""Man of Steel"" (2013) presents a visually stunning, modernized take on Superman's origin story, offering a darker, more brooding portrayal of the iconic hero. Directed by Zack Snyder, the film excels in its action sequences and spectacular visual effects, particularly in the destruction-heavy scenes that showcase Superman's immense power. However, this focus on action often comes at the expense of character development and emotional depth.Henry Cavill's Superman embodies the physicality and solemnity of the character, but the film's tone often veers too far into bleakness, which is at odds with Superman's traditional role as a symbol of hope and optimism. The film takes risks with its portrayal, notably the controversial decision to have Superman kill General Zod in the climactic battle. While this choice adds a layer of moral complexity, it alienated some fans who saw it as a betrayal of the character's core values.The narrative spends considerable time exploring Kal-El's internal conflict and struggle to find his place in the world, yet it fails to fully explore the emotional connections between key characters, such as Clark Kent and Lois Lane. Their relationship feels underdeveloped, as does the emotional impact of Superman's actions on the people around him. The film's pacing also falters in its final act, where the extended, destruction-filled battle scenes feel excessive, overshadowing the quieter, more personal moments that could have grounded the story.Despite its flaws, Man of Steel remains a bold and ambitious reimagining of Superman, one that introduces complex themes of identity and destiny. However, the film's somber tone and over-reliance on CGI spectacle leave some audiences longing for the brighter, more hopeful version of the hero they've come to know.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This really was Super,"I was fortunate to have just finished viewing a midnight premier of Man of Steel. All I can say is WOW! This movie was all I could ever want from a Superman movie. I've been a superhero and Superman fan my entire life. However, the Superman character in the movies was always so tacky and the movies as a whole were just average. Man of Steel, though, is completely different.I thoroughly enjoyed how they made the character of Superman much more realistic (as realistic as he could be). Henry Cavill was the perfect choice as he made Superman seem like an actual man. To make this easier, I'll list the pros and cons in my opinion:Pros:1. The plot was extremely well done. The movie really took the time and effort to explain everything and made sure it connected. 2. Henry Cavill has the ""look"" of Superman (just look at him without a shirt) and knows how to give him more human qualities. 3. The special effects were stunning. Everything from the explosions to the future technology was believable.The flying especially was jaw-dropping. 4. The acting was superb. I especially enjoyed Crowe and Costner, but everybody did a phenomenal job (Amy Adams bothered me at times but that was just her character, not here). 5. The ending (not going to say what it is) gave me chills. 6. The use of flashbacks was effective in telling the story. 7. It was a believable superhero movie. 8. There are some good one-liners that are memorable.Cons: (Not many)1.It was a little slow at times but only because the background or plot was being explained. Superman fans won't mind this at all, but the casual moviegoer might. 2. Some action scene extended a little too long to the point where it seemed like the fight was dragged out just a tad.Overall, I give it a 9.5/10. One of the best, if not the best, superhero movie ever made.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

correct,"In Comunist period, Superman, grace an episode of series who , in cinema of that time worked as full film , was a sort of source of fascination , maybe more than a superhero.So, for long time I expected to see Man of Steel but good reserves were more convincing. And the beginning of movie offered more motives, because the first idea was about a new demonstration of avanced technology; and just nothing more.But the first impression was pure wronk.Because, not ignoring the smart - precise crafted story, the best point were the cast . From Russel Crowe to Kevin Costner and Diane Lane to Michael Shannon and Amy Adams, not ignoring the supporting actors, the film was the perfect to fascinating puzzle.Sure, I admitt, I hoped Clark Kent be not ...journalist . But, bad luck. So, I saw it as a great film. Not for special effects, spectacular, indeed , but for a correct story. And this is more than beautiful virtue.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Outsider,"Man of Steel reinvents Superman the same way Batman Begins reinvented Batman. The success of the previous franchise might give the producers an idea that using the same direction could also transcend this mythology. The film is so ambitious, any silliness from the last edition is abandoned and replaces them with a deeper and more sophisticated storytelling. The plot mostly runs like an almost endless wheel of clashes and explosions. It is overall fun, but it would have been much fun if it also possesses the extraordinary part of the hero's character rather than just his human side. Majority craves for darker blockbusters, but a broody Superman seems too awkward to accept. Still, there are plenty of merits to mention and the film is actually decently crafted. Man of Steel is undeniably big and fun that mainstream audience would be satisfied.Besides, there is still a good reason why Superman should get rebooted. The Donner series didn't actually flesh out much of Clark's relationship to the Kents and his motivation to become a hero is somehow shaky. Man of Steel fills them all with a down to earth sentiment and little sense of allegory. What's amazing is the first act somewhat follows the footsteps of the intro of Batman Begins. It started with the hero as an outcast then it presents various flashbacks of his downfall until he finally finds his true destiny. It seems repetitive for an origin, but it's the cleverest thing the film has ever done. The story itself is shrouded with brood and preach. There is a philosophy and depth attached to the concept. While they are deliberately compelling, the film didn't take enough time to breathe in the midst of the explosions. But really, the film is all about being big and epic. The film is just having a hard time balancing between the gravitas and the epicness.Kal-El is probably too human in trait which is kind of an ironic idea, but theoretically it is meant to be like this: he is inherited by his experience in earth and manifested himself with humanity. It can be a smart speculation, but it could have also shown his alien side when he is less whiny and more slick and curious to his powers. I've already stated Henry Cavill is the most good looking actor to play Superman(no homo). The actor has natural charisma. Here, there is a sense of swagger beneath his performance, but the script didn't allow him to do much of that and aims more to his character's drama. Cavill is still excellently enthusiastic to the role. At least we get to see him punch amazingly. In other cast, Amy Adams' Lois Lane is an improvement. She gets to be smarter than just a damsel for Superman to rescue. Adams tend to make all of that credible. Kevin Costner brings genuine gravity inside the hero's pathos. Michael Shannon has the menace that General Zod needs.Zack Snyder thankfully abandons his slow-mo fetishism and created a new style that works even better. Two hours of the film is all speed and action. The explosions get out of hand sometimes. It's all big and heavy, but real thrills and fortitude are definitely there to overpower what could have been an excess. It's a magnificent surprise from Snyder. However, the vision to Krypton slightly becomes uninspired compared to the original one. The world has a strange generic turn. To be fair, the CGI effects made it look grand and eye candy enough.Man of Steel has improvements and missteps. We see more of Clark's love for his Kent family, Superman finally knows how to wear his underpants, and the damsel in distress is now designed to be more than to be in distress. Although it's unevenly trippy, and it's more preachy than powerful. I understand it is ought to be as serious as Christopher Nolan's Batman because seriousness and darkness made The Dark Knight trilogy a knockout. As much as it tries to be a superior version of the story, the film still lack something. It probably needs more spark of light, or it needs to be more adventurous, or it needs to ease down the use of explosions, or maybe Superman here needs more swag. What I could guarantee is it's a great entertainment pleasure. The craft's and performances' heart to the hero pretty much made the film more than only okay. Man of Steel is just an origin by the way. If it gets it right in the sequel, then everything in this film would be forgivable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Worth seeing,"I've been fascinated by Superman since I was a small child, so it's been 63 years since I first watched George Reeves portray the man of steel on television back in the 1950s. Reeves was very fatherly, a very wise, dependable superhero; even as Clark Kent, he seemed very dependable.Christopher Reeve is still my favorite Superman, but Henry Cavill looks like a Greek god on screen. He has a faraway look in his eye as if he truly was not-of-this-earth, but he seems essentially gentle, kind and, above all, helpful. When this Superman has to face people who possess all of his powers, he acts, quite realistically, I thought, shocked and stunned. Many scenes strongly sense that this Superman could be defeated by creatures who possess his super powers.Having seen ""Watchman"" and ""300,"" I knew that Zach Snyder's interpretation of the Superman story was going to be very realistic, edgy, dark. The violence in this movie is like watching real violence, man-made or natural; since it is created by creatures who are more-than-man, it seems like a little of both.Amy Adams just can't seem to go wrong. Even in a very uneven story like ""Trouble with the Curve,"" she adds perky, happy, spirited feminine animation; here, too, she is more alive than any other character. Her Lois Lane comes across as a vivacious rainbow alongside the very laid-back, mellow, gentlemanly Superman that Cavill presents.In many scenes, I caught myself wondering whether Cavill had truly studied Christopher Reeve. Under his clothing, Cavill displays much more of a massive body builder physique, layer upon layer of hard, thick, tough muscle. He looks more like Hercules with his shirt off.I was very impressed with Russell Crowe as Jor-el, Superman's Kryptonian father; and the technical creation of Kryptonian civilization, spacecraft and so forth is fresh, at times scary. The destruction is frightening at times -connoting in my mind images of Sandyhook, and other sudden, brutal events the world has suffered or witnessed this past year.Laurence Fishburne's Perry White did not seem special to me. He spoke his lines; he is an African American. I sensed no special or unique angle on his dramatization of the character. I still cherish my salient childhood image of the actor with the white hair and the decisive manner who performed along with George Reeves back in the 50s.Despite the cutting back and forth across time, showing Superman as a small child, then as an adult, I was not the least bit confused.I thought that Kevin Costner and Diane Lane held up creditably as Jonathan and Martha Kent.Michael Shannon reveals far more of General Zod's personality, motivation, and mind set. He is on screen and speaking to us in a very direct manner in far more scenes, and we have a chance to see him as more of a multi-faceted character. In previous cinematic interpretations, actors portraying Zod came across very one-dimensionally, very flat: mean, cruel, heartless and ruthless. Shannon suggests that he had hoped that Superman would help him in his mission here on earth.The movie cleverly leaves itself open for a possible sequel, and I sincerely hope that this crew gets that chance. I will be eager to see how they produce a sequel, knowing what worked and what could work better the second time.Several characters need to be more finely and deeply tuned. Cavill's Superman needs to be more assertive next time. Amy Adams has set the bar perfectly for Lois Lane: sure of herself, well-grounded, very capable, dignified, proud and assertive.""Man of Steel"" is a great action thriller, an excellent epic, a could-be-great-saga with great writing. In one scene where Clark Kent is a child and saves lives, he and his adoptive father, Jonathan Kent, have a heart-to-heart discussion about Jonathan's strong suggestion that he keep his super powers strictly secret. The boy asks plaintively whether he should have simply allowed people to die, and his dad replies, ""Maybe."" I thought that line fell totally flat.Not only was there no Jimmy Olson, Mike Kelly obviously portrayed some important Daily Planet employee who was never identified, and he never really did much other than look important.There is much to build on in a sequel or prequel or both. Strengths to augment and weaknesses to renovate. I'm hopeful that Zach Snyder will receive the opportunity to create a follow up opus, and that he will use and listen to test audiences galore.I'd like to see the characters of Superman, Lois, Perry White and others deepened, sharpened, and more clearly defined.I want more humor and more heart in the next one. The many obligatory scenes, characters, conflicts and themes from previous ventures were addressed in this film. The sequel to ""Man of Steel"" needs to seek to accomplish what J.J. Abrams has done recently for ""Star Trek,"" i.e. use the talented newcomers to create a great movie that can stand alone as a work of art.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Reimagining Superman: The Bold and Brooding Man of Steel,"""Man of Steel"" offers a fresh and surprisingly dark take on the iconic Superman, challenging expectations of a more optimistic and inspiring approach. Zack Snyder, under the supervision of Christopher Nolan, chooses to break sharply from the lighter versions of previous adaptations, investing in relentless realism and psychological tension that permeate the entire storyline. From the beginning, it's clear that the goal is to humanize and reframe the character, transforming him into a figure who feels out of place yet deeply driven to protect humanity. This Superman asks the audience to see him not as an unbreakable symbol of virtue, but as someone fighting internal battles just as intense as his external ones. He must earn his place on a planet that greets him with suspicion and distrust, and this provocative view of the hero makes the movie a rich, emotional experience.Visually, the film is a spectacle, with striking cinematography that evokes a heavy, serious atmosphere. The austere aesthetic and pronounced shadows create a sense of gravity that reflects the character's and story's emotional weight. The muted color palette, sophisticated special effects, and massive scenes of destruction all carry a profound symbolism, reflecting contemporary fears and collective traumas. The opening sequence on Krypton is a true masterpiece of art direction and design, presenting an alien world with its own culture, grand architecture, and advanced technology-elements rarely explored in such depth in previous Superman adaptations. Inspired by sci-fi classics like ""Alien"" and ""Dune,"" the setting of Krypton is so detailed that viewers feel immersed in a civilization with a unique history and tragedy, which gives Kal-El's mission on Earth an even greater dramatic intensity.Henry Cavill, in a restrained and introspective performance, redefines Superman, giving an approach that's far from Christopher Reeve's warm charisma, leaning more towards an anti-hero. His Clark Kent is an outsider who, despite his powers, carries a deep loneliness and longing for belonging, reflecting a struggle that's both moral and existential. Cavill expresses his character's layers through a minimalist performance, where pauses and silences speak as much as the dialogue, creating a hero who, rather than offering easy inspiration, generates empathy through the complexity of his inner journey. He's not looking for simple applause; instead, he invites us to contemplate the angst of someone who must prove himself worthy of a world that sees him as a potential threat, a narrative choice that resonates in times of ever-present questions about power and responsibility.The portrayal of Zod (Michael Shannon) is another highlight of the story. Shannon brings an intensity to the villain, making him not only threatening but almost tragically idealistic, as his motivations are rooted in his own moral code. Zod isn't just a typical antagonist; he's a survivor who truly believes his mission is noble, even if it means Earth's destruction. Shannon injects into the character an unyielding determination and conviction that make Zod almost a tragic figure-a dark reflection of Kal-El, whose desire to save Earth clashes with Zod's vision of resurrecting Krypton at any cost. Their conflict, then, isn't merely physical but ethical and philosophical, bringing a rare moral complexity to the genre, which makes their confrontations even more intense and emotionally charged.Lois Lane (Amy Adams) shines as a character who combines bravery and intelligence, serving as a fearless journalist and perceptive ally for Superman. Her role in the narrative is strategic and significant, portraying a professional committed to the truth and willing to face great dangers to achieve her goals. The relationship between Lois and Clark is developed subtly, highlighting the depth and understanding between them, suggesting a connection that transcends words and is based on mutual respect and understanding. This approach avoids romantic clichés, bringing authenticity to their dynamic and keeping the focus on Clark's journey as a hero in search of acceptance and balance.The action sequences, while technically impeccable, have divided fans to this day. Snyder pushes the concept of epic showdowns to a level of visual intensity rarely seen, resulting in battles that culminate in the massive destruction of Metropolis. This aesthetic and narrative choice reinforces the global threat but alienated some viewers with visual exhaustion. The intensity of the destruction scenes, reflecting Superman's desperate struggle to contain Zod, ultimately diminishes the emotional impact to some extent by prolonging the violence without pauses. This focus on nonstop action distances the film from the hopeful archetype traditionally associated with the character, but it reinforces the idea that this version of Superman is dealing with a harsh reality, where saving the world requires sacrifices that are hard for him-and the audience-to absorb.At its core, ""Man of Steel"" is a challenging, atmospheric experience that asks viewers to let go of certain conventions. Snyder and Nolan's reinvention is designed to adapt Superman for an era where heroism needs to be reevaluated, reflecting dilemmas that transcend fantasy and touch on questions of power, responsibility, and identity. The lack of humor and lightness, though risky, aligns with the story's dark tone and is consistent with the film's vision. With deep questions, solid performances, and impressive visuals, ""Man of Steel"" stands as a bold reimagining of one of cinema's most iconic heroes, cementing it as a powerful, modern take that resonates far beyond the screen and leaves an indelible mark on the audience's imagination.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A loud, brutal slugfest","Man of Steel is a merciless bludgeoning, and nothing more. Superman keeps getting told that he's conflicted and torn between two worlds, but the plot provides no moral dilemmas for him other than ""bash things."" He is humanity's Jesus of punching.The action is staged beautifully and looks great, and this from someone who hated Watchmen for every reason there is. Zack Snyder came through! If you haven't seen Man of Steel, you've never seen someone throw a person through a skyscraper and believed it. There are some moments that approach awe, such as the austere architecture and landscape of Krypton (where we spend about half an hour but which we never see not blowing up) and the famous shot of Superman breaking the sound barrier. The only problem is that it's followed by 5 more shots of Superman breaking the sound barrier. This applies to every stunt and action set-piece in the movie.Production design is outstanding, my favorite being the Pinscreen-inspired alien computer interface. Sounds silly, but the history of Krypton told in gunmetal and graphite pixels is an inventive and lovely visual.Unfortunately, the things that aren't alien ships, fistfights or explosions aren't interesting or good.The music is standard Zimmerklang: brass and drums. It's monotonous and obnoxious.The writing is... You know how trailers chop in snippets of dialogue between the cool music? ""Welcome to the FBI. - His methods are... a little unconventional. - Bank of Luxembourg - twenty million dollars - stolen. - He hasn't been the same since - killed his wife."" Imagine a whole movie done this way. I can barely think of an actual conversation in this movie - everything is either an order, an instruction or a threat.The plot is easy to follow and hard to get invested in. The Badass General Zod comes to Earth from Krypton because the phantom dimension gate was disrupted by the codex DNA which became unstable when the planet core was mined for energy that was transcribed in the cellular matrix of the genesis probe that the supreme council rejected after the coup attempt which caused the distress beacon to go off in the consciousness hologram - basically, to give Superman something to chew on. Zod has henchpeople, and they all get into loud, massive fights with Superman while Earth soldiers surround them and shoot impotent blanks.That's the common problem to watching godlike aliens fight - humanity comes off as totally useless. Lois Lane is briefly relevant once, when she plugs in an alien flash drive. And in the end, the movie gets humans to deliver a thing to a place, like a mother letting her idiot child carry a bag of chips so he can feel like he's helping.Naturally, aside from crouching victims, the Superman canon has use for earthlings as teachers, parents, colleagues and love interests, none of which comes through in this movie. Clark Kent's entire earthly backstory comes down to: being told how historic he is by Ma and Pa, and saving people from disasters in flashbacks. All this happens in short, out-of-order clips that play like a badly-organized family slideshow. The romance with Lois Lane is non-existent, since about the only time they're on screen together is when he's catching her in mid-air.Positive characters who die do it with such serenity that they almost look bored.A huge battle takes place in Metropolis and results in several dozen 9/11s. Nobody dies on screen, because PG-13.General Zod and his people could probably achieve their goals on Mars or Venus with equal success and don't have to try and kill everybody, but they can't be reasoned with because they're genetically like that.So there it is. See this movie if you want to see Superman and his enemies punch things, punch through things, punch people, punch things through people, punch people through things and punch things through other things. But who punches the punchmen?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Epic, Ambitious, and Earnest","There's something big and ambitious and earnest about Zach Snyder's take on Superman that I find really admirable. Not everything in this movie works, but the mythic scope and embrace of the idea of gods coming to fight it out on Earth is handled with such weight and energy that I get swept up in the spectacle every time.Snyder took the well-worn story of Superman's origins and recast it rather dramatically in a couple of different directions. The first is aesthetics. Krypton looks browner and weirder than we'd seen it in film before. There are giant monsters and an embrace of weird science fiction visuals in how Krypton's technology works. There's also an embrace of a handheld camera that evokes independent filmmaking, especially in smaller moments. I remember when the first trailer dropped and people were saying that it almost looked like a Terrence Malick movie. Sort of (there's too much of an embrace of lens flares), but it certainly provides an interesting contrast with the epic visuals, giving it an inherently grounded feel while dealing with a rather zany story of supermen and terraforming machines.The second different direction largely focuses on John Kent, Superman's adoptive father from Kansas. The movie decides that it wants to explain Clark Kent's hiding of his power out of fear and a question of trust. The closest this movie comes to a strong theme is this idea of building trust in the face of something new. It pops up from time to time and gets mildly explored, but the film is much more of a character driven exercise in its first half and a plot driven one in its second. The first half is about Clark Kent's lifelong quest to find a way to belong while having incredible powers no one else has and protecting himself from what he imagines to be a paranoid and violent reaction to his presence should it become widely known. Still, he can't help but try and make the world better around him, so he saves kids from a bus crash despite his father's insistence that it might have been better to let them die rather than risk revealing himself, and he rescues some oil rig workers despite coming away with nothing and needing to move on to another life again.The irony is, of course, that he's so strong that mankind could probably never hurt him, so the fear is less about his personal safety and more about the unpredictable results of his reveal. What happens after he finally figures out who he is and where he's from when he finds a long lost Kryptonian ship? It's his announcement to the universe that he is there, and Zod shows up. Zod, Krypton's general who tried to lead a coup in the planet's final decadent and collapsing moments and was punished in the Phantom Zone, comes back with the objective of rebuilding Krypton. Superman's actions on Earth bring Zod there. Driven to insanity, he wants to terraform Earth into a new Krypton, no matter the living denizens, and exact his revenge on Superman's father at the same time (with some extra stuff about a genetic codex imbued in Superman's genetics put there by his father). This plot doesn't really develop until the second half of the film, which I have no problem with.The problem is really with Zod himself. I like the idea of Zod more than the execution. Michael Shannon is stilted as the dedicated antagonist, and his dialogue is often the most unnatural sounding of any of the principals. This is probably be design, giving him a different cadence from the rest of the characters to imply a different culture, but it comes off as stilted rather than elegantly natural. Part of that is the dialogue as written, and part of that is Shannon himself who haltingly moves through every line. Still, I love his plan and the epic fight that breaks out.The terraforming of Earth as a threat provides room for some incredible destruction. I know some people have problems with the scale of destruction throughout the movie, but I love it. This is a fight between gods. On the one side are a group of malevolent warriors who think of nothing of the lives they endanger. On the other is a greenhorn hero who is suddenly faced with a fight he can't handle on his own.The fight that erupts in Smallville is a favorite. It starts with Superman attacking Zod directly after they threaten his mother in order to find the craft that Superman came to Earth in. It turns into a two on one beat down as Superman tries to fight off two Kryptonians. The US military gets involved and starts firing at both sides, and Superman ends up gaining the first trust from the official governing bodies on the planet through his actions. It's the fight over the terraforming machines that really stands out, though. The leveling of Metropolis has a scale and terrifying feel to it that I love. The gravity field that pushes down on the buildings, leveling them to dust, while Zod crashes the Kryptonian ship into buildings, toppling them over, is quite a sight. The fist fight that breaks out between Zod and Superman in the sky is less impressive, and the final moment where Zod is going to kill a random little family is poorly set up, though the idea of Superman having to take the solution to an extreme to ensure Earth's safety is an interesting one in general.I love the ambition of the film. It's desire to reach beyond mere spectacle and enter into something of mythic scale is quite well handled. I also like Superman's challenge in finding how to make himself known to the world, and it ultimately comes out of necessity and to make up for his own contribution to the violence being visited upon Earth. It's rough, though. Zod is poorly written and delivered. I think the stuff from Clark Kent's childhood in Smallville might have worked better as a sustained sequence instead of snippets going back and forth. Overall, the movie feels like the product from a promising first draft screenplay that needed another couple of passes, but I still really like what I got.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Action sequences are too close together,I loved this movie filled with so much emotion and stakes. Given how powerful Superman is it's rare to see his struggle physically but this movie along with it's sequel Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice portray that part perfectly. However the action sequences are too close together which isn't necessarily a flaw if your coming for action Specifically. However if you want a good balance between story and action then this movie is not for you. There is an appropriate amount of fights but putting them close together just make it 50 minutes of none stop action with only a 10 minute break in the middle. It makes the first half of the movie and second half appear like 2 different movies. However both the action scenes and the emotional conflict are great. They make this one of my favourite Superman movies. However the problem is that action and story is not very well balanced otherwise the perfect Superman movie and a must watch.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very OK,"Redo of Superman. Superman (Henry Cavill) was rocketed from Krypton when he was a baby and lands on Earth. Ma and Pa Kent (Diane Lane, Kevin Costner) find him and bring him up. He realizes he has strange powers but his parents tell him to control his impulses. Then evil General Zod (Michael Shannon) invades Earth and demands that Superman surrender himself...or else. There's more to the plot but it makes little sense (if you think about it).This IS well-made with great special effects and all but it's not that good. Basically it suffers from overkill. The movie is far too long--there was no reason for this movie to last almost 150 minutes. The opening on Krypton is too long also. The last hour is virtually non-stop destruction and fighting which quickly gets boring instead of exciting. Also TONS of product placement is apparent during it. The script is all over the place. It's constantly trying to tie Clark being an alien and growing up in the USA--and it doesn't work at all. Characters appear (and are given no introduction) and disappear without rhyme or reason. Gaps in the plot too. Acting doesn't help. Cavill is tall, handsome and muscular as Superman--and also sort of a blank. Amy Adams is even worse as Lois Lane. She tries but the material isn't there for her. Even worse her and Cavill have zero sexual chemistry so their romance seems more than a little forced. Shannon spends the whole movie snarling and yelling. And, worst of all, Superman commits an act at the end of the movie that Superman would NEVER do! All in all this is OK--nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Had the potential to be great, then Hollywood went CGI crazy","I believe I was first introduced to Man of Steel with the original trailer (more like a 20-second teaser than a trailer, of our hero bursting through the sky) while I sat in the cinema anticipating The Dark Knight Rises.I left the cinema somewhat frustrated that day however, as The Dark Knight Rises was full of plot holes and writing that simply didn't make sense. Simply put; I felt Nolan got complacent after he absolutely nailed Batman Begins and the masterful Dark Knight.Now we have a reboot of Superman, with Nolan as Producer and action-junkie Snyder as Director. Nolan seems to take up where he left off on the Dark Knight Rises by producing a movie filled with plot holes. I don't want to divulge any spoilers beyond what you will have gathered from the trailers, but to give 1 example, our villain (played by Michael Shannon) & his goons survive the demise of Krypton because they are outcast on a spaceship as 'punishment' for their crimes while the rest of the planet perishes. There you have it, an advanced Alien race living on a doomed planet is able save only 1 new born baby and a gang of crooks, despite having the technology to scope out and evaluate another planet in seconds, then terraform it to accommodate their race. Is this the standard of script-writing we can associated with Nolan now? After-all he served us up the genius plot of Gothams ENTIRE Police Force being trapped underground for 3 months, with no food, yet still able to charge out into the battlefield when Batman sets them free. Like The Dark Knight Rises, Man of Steel is full of these kind of pot holes that is likely to leave even children scratching their heads.I did however enjoy much of the first half of the film, Kevin Costner gives the best performance in this movie by a distance in my opinion. His emotional interactions with his adopted son are heartfelt and he plays a pivotal role in shaping Clark's path to finding himself. Snyder strings the background story together pretty well, maybe a little too much use of 'flashbacks', but Snyder's storytelling is actually good here... which is why it's all the more frustrating that he lost control in the 2nd half of the movie.Once we have the back story in place and Superman gets some answers as to who he really is, well, this movie simply doesn't feel like Superman. He doesn't become the caped hero saving civilians from bank robbers (although we get a couple of instances of his good deeds before he ever dawns the cape). There's no disguise as Clark Kent, no news reporter or phone booths. No feeling of 'is it a bird?' or 'to the rescue'. No adventures. Instead it just jumps into a showdown with the goons from Krypton who have tracked him down to planet Earth (as you will have seen from the trailers). At times I felt like I was watching Independence Day as the US military is rolled out with tanks & fighter jets to protect the entire human race from superior beings threatening our existence.The last 60-90 Min's of this film is just 1 giant action sequence, loaded to the teeth with CGI, trucks smashing into skyscrapers & Alien light-beams. The Metropolis half destroyed... Superman probably kills a few thousand civilians himself as collateral given the amount of vehicles he uses as bowling balls. I enjoy a bit of action, but this was way too much, and way over the top to the point it just got tiresome and the film starved itself of dialogue, character development and audience interaction. We the audience are asked to endure some horrible one liners such as ""they say it's all downhill from the first kiss"" in between the brain-dead smashing up of skyscrapers. I was firmly switched off in the last half hour because the director asked nothing of me while he got his kicks.This action overkill wasn't really what we were sold in the trailers which focused on the gritty & emotional interactions of a young Clark with Kevin Costner over an Enya score (almost Gladiator-esque) - this sold us a totally different tone to the alien-action movie we actually get.Overall i'm left with a feeling of what this movie could have been with the right director & stronger writing. Perhaps Sam Mendes would have been a better choice given the job he did on Skyfall and the human interaction of Craig, Dench and Bardem throughout while maintaining awesome action set-pieces. Snyder had a great cast at his disposal here he that really should have done much better with. Crowe & Shannon did the best they could with what they had to work with. Costner stole the show. Cavill was a perfect fit for Superman and brought a physical presence to the role of Superman that Bale & Hardy brought to Batman & Bane. Laurence Fishburne may as well have been cut from the movie all together in his utterly pointless role as Editor at the Planet and Adams was wasted in the weakly written part of Lane.It's perhaps unfair to expect another Dark Knight, given it's standing as one of the greatest films ever alongside The Godfather & Shawshank here on IMDb, but I was at least hoping for a movie on a par with Batman Begins, to really set the tone for another epic series of modern-day comic hero movies from DC. Instead I left the cinema feeling like I just saw 20 minutes of Avatar eventually turn into Independence Day meets Transformers in a piece of film-making that will be rather forgettable in the end.Maybe at some point in the next 30 years Superman will finally get his day like Batman got his in 2008 in The Dark Knight.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Instantly Forgettable,I wish I could burn this film from my memory for real. I'm seriously not kidding. I really don't know how to describe the dread I felt within the first half hour when I knew this was as bad as others had warned me it would be and even worse than most critics said it would be. It really was beyond cringe worthy and those space ships. Don't even get me started. I expected Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith to come crawling out of one with cigars in their mouth. Something blows up. A bunch of blurry images zoom by and then it starts again. And repeat. And repeat. Rinse and repeat. That's how I feel trying to wash out the bad taste this film left behind. Nolan should stick to directing and not producing. Snyder and David Goyer need to launch themselves into space so this planet never again has to be subjected to anything this illogical and monotonous.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Superman TNG is too daft to laugh at,"Depending on how old you are this is either going to be impressive artwork or vacuous nonsense. So this is Superman for the next generation - the Computer Generation, or should that be the next white Hope? Why can't the next generation get their own heroes and superheroes, and based on this does the next generation really need some heart and soul instead? I've always liked superhero movies, up till nowadays that is – I think I'll have to leave it to the next generation as I'm now feeling as much a fish out of water as General Sod was on Earth. To watch these cartoon blockbusters doesn't bring enrichment, only headache.Olde story of baby refugee from dying planet Krypton growing up and making his superhuman life on Earth but facing massive problems when his surviving former compatriots visit him to discuss some DNA. In the heat of the violent discussion millions of us Earthlings unfortunately have to die horribly, but so what. At least it looks good even if superficial. The cgi cartoonery is large, fast, spectacular and relentless, so when are they going save paying for real actors? The duel scenes were done cheaper, quieter, quicker and better in High Noon. If only Jeremy Irons had had such a deadly female sidekick in Die Hard 3! I wish I could see Mighty Mouse again to compare Henry Cavill and Amy Adams as Clark and Lois are certainly easy on the eyes, but compared to splintering cartoon concrete, pulverising metal and continuous mayhem anything is. Really missed having some Ker-Pow!'s for fisticuff scenes and Krunjjj!'s for when Supey was hurled through half a dozen skyscrapers at a time though.I enjoyed it to a point, but got nothing of value from it and will never intentionally revisit it.

Migrant Worker Gets Caught Up in Intergalactic 9/11,"Critics overly maligned this one methinks. The reboot of the Superman saga, ""Man of Steel"" updates the Metropolis Marvel as an allegory of America in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Sure, it's flawed, if not crass. The depiction of Krypton, in particular, seems to be the consequence of some artists being too carried away in imitating other fantasies such as, say, ""Avatar"" (2009) or ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Still, I'll take it over the desolate 1978 iteration of Kal-El's birthplace. The depiction of the United States military, too, is rather placid, which was surely a demand of the real army in assisting the movie's production. Although the troops here are quite busy in their active spectatorship of Superman, their involvement doesn't lend much of interest to the extended 9/11 allegory. Similarly, Lois Lane is partly her usual constant damsel in distress, but at least she's not an idiot this outing, and she even assists Superman, while also providing the meta-narrative context of her being the reporter of the very story we see. She's the surrogate author within the movie. Being portrayed by Amy Adams doesn't hurt, either. Indeed, the cast in general is good and well balanced between up-and-coming stars and veteran talents who lend their celebrity of past projects to the proceedings here.To bemoan loud explosions or to debate the salience of whether Superman punches and kills or not misses the point. Professional entertainment criticism of superhero flicks, if not in general, often confounds me. Besides a couple blatant masterpieces (""The Dark Knight"" (2008), ""Logan"" (2017)), darker or seemingly-more-realistic superhero movies are largely panned. They appear to want cartoons, as though one can't take comic-book characters seriously and, thus, neither should the superhero genre treat itself in earnest. Much of the movie-going public must agree, too. Hence the dominance of the MCU, I suppose. But movies in general and superhero ones, too, are always ideological; they're a product of the real world. It's just that the smarter ones tend to be more coherent about it. Don't pretend, for instance, that Tony Stark doesn't reflect our society's infatuation with tech CEOs, or that ""Black Panther"" (2018) and ""Captain Marvel"" (2019) aren't about overcoming historical racial and sexual misrepresentations. So, too, Superman has long been claimed a symbol of American virtues, as well as a reflection of Christianity by the association of the Man of Steel with Christ.Clark Kent is the most vital fictional character to come from America's middle state, Kansas, since Dorothy Gale. I think it would be interesting merely to compare these two works of genres, children fairy tales and comic books, that are often frowned upon, and to trace their influence in shaping how the United States is seen--especially through the wildly-popular film adaptations, but I digress. Expanding upon ""Truth, Justice and the American Way"" and the messiah metaphor, ""Man of Steel"" reimagines young Clark as a refugee and migrant worker--an illegal alien or ""dreamer"" (note all the fatherly talk of dreams) taken to the ""nation of immigrants"" when he was but a baby and who has since been nurtured in the idyllic settings of America's heartland, upon the farm and by Ma and Pa Kent. He's something of an ideal immigrant.General Zod and his gang, on the other hand, realize the country's most xenophobic fears. They don't share the values of our world; indeed, Zod preaches about purity of bloodlines and submitting to his rule. Social Darwinism, eugenics and genocide--Nazi pseudoscience, basically. Inadvertently, Kal-El (and since christened Clark Kent) brings about this intergalactic chain migration, whereupon Zod and his crew insist upon remaking our world as their own rather than conforming to our ways--and atmosphere--as Clark had. This results in the famous destruction sequence of Metropolis that, none too subtly, recalls the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001. Of course, there's also a clumsy environmental message of destroying one planet and setting out do so to another one.There is one more important thing to note here, however, which is that Clark is only able to become our savior by embracing his roots and bringing his culture into the light of our and his own American one. His race is literally encoded in his blood (via that codex thing). He's of two worlds, two sets of parents, two remembered fathers, two identities. This is an apt addition not only because it finally makes sense of the Superman costume, CGI cape and all, but also because it celebrates contemporary notions of diversity. It's not the melting-pot narrative of Kent the Daily Planet reporter; it's the story of the good immigrant who embraces the best of two cultures and, thus, enriches the lives of those around him. Whether or not one finds the city destruction gratuitous, the writing stupid (that bit about the first kiss is my most hated piece of dialogue here, and don't hide below an underpass from a tornado!), or is fond of Zack Snyder and company's snap-zoom style, and regardless of one's political and cultural views, that's a coherent ideology for a blockbuster superhero movie, and it's a change of pace from the credo of DC's other most famous vigilante, the plutocratic billionaire who likes to punch the poors and mentally deranged, Batman.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A decade too early,"In a time when Marvel had been setting the stage and defining the superhero genre, Warner Bros stepped up to the growing competition; throwing their hat in the ring with their most popular character. At that point, people wanted the Marvel filter, especially from a character like Superman. Ultimately, it was Zack Snyder's daring vision, a brilliant piece of art at the wrong time, that led to it's lackluster reception; dooming all possibility from said point on to build to something greater with WB executives breathing down his neck. Had this been released a couple years ago instead, even today, this film alone would have given Marvel a run for their money. This is a quality superhero film, something very rarely seen these days. It's absolutely criminal how poorly it was received at the time, but my hopes is in the new era of the upcoming DCU with David Corenswet, James Gunn takes cues from this masterpiece for its tone, atmosphere, biblical telling of the worlds greatest superhero.When I first heard of this movie being made, I in the middle of watching the hit CW show Smallville; as a young child falling in love with Superman, you can probably gather just how exited I was. Every image released, every trailer, every piece of news I could find I was there and waiting for the day this would release.I went to watch this film as a freshman in high school on opening day; my friend and I had the day off. We got the best seats, ultimate features at our top local theatre. I was even feeling incredibly ill that day, but nothing was stopping me from watching my second favourite superhero come to life on the big screen (as a DC fan, there's an obvious first 🦇).Like so many people at the time, I left the theatre disappointed, disheartened and feeling betrayed. The Superman I grew up with, the boy scout from Kansas that beamed optimism, positivity and hope.. Was turned into this dark, heavy murderer. I had just come out of Smallville, previously having watched the Reeve films and the Routh returns. Needless to say, I was an echo chamber of the hundreds who said ""Not my Superman"".Rewatching this today, after a decade, I can say with full confidence that I was wrong. This film does have it's flawed moments, but it showcases itself as a refreshing glass of water in a genre of milk. I am so pleased to stand corrected, as I can confidently say that this is the best film of the DCEU. Like I cannot express this enough, we live in a reality where superhero films are theme park rides. This, like The Dark Knight and Joker, is an art piece.Looking to the future for this character, we will see. Superman may be this bright and optimistic character that brings hope, but the Man of Steel delivers an artistic telling of a hero set in a grounded world filled with gods.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This is NOT Superman,"Before I even review this movie itself, viewers need to recognize the fact Warner Bros. spent millions on mass marketing of a new Superman movie when it doesn't even have Superman in the title and the actual name of the character is never spoken. That says a lot. While DC comics decided to ""reboot"" Superman, there is still a very specific mythos to Superman as a character which cannot be changed or it's no longer Superman. Essentially, director Zack Snyder with the studio's blessing decided to make him ""cool"" by veering off course and violating very basic principles of who Superman is morally and ethically. To change the signature costume of Superman is one thing but Snyder and company go much further. No spoilers here just plain fact that this is NOT Superman and nothing more than an attempt to slap Christopher Nolan's name to a film in order to get people to see it. While it may work in the short term, the problem is how monumentally flawed this ""new"" and ""updated"" incarnation is of what is supposed to be Superman which is why it is getting such a poor reception from most critics. The chemistry between Superman and Lois Lane is nonexistent and with a horrible script by David Goyer, the actors cannot be necessarily blamed entirely. As for Henry Cavill, I wouldn't call him a horrible actor but he does not pull off the charisma and most importantly the essential dichotomy between his alter ego as Clark Kent and as Superman. However the producers, director, and writer of this mish mash mess of a ""reboot"" didn't help. At least, Brandon Routh had the all-American wholesomeness similar to that of Christopher Reeve. Certain liberties are taken with how Clark Kent is presented in this movie which I won't give away. This movie is full of creative choices that make absolutely no sense and defy logic in general not to mention everything about who Clark Kent/Superman is. That's why this should really be referred to as a ""reimagining"" and a very poor one at that. The race of Perry White and gender of Jimmy Olsen is changed for no plausible reason other than to be ""progressive"" but Laurence Fishburne is a gifted actor wasted with the bland material he had to work with. Ultimately this is a knockoff of the real Superman character playing off the success of ""The Dark Knight"" films. The worst part is the CGI overkill which is a page ripped right out of Michael Bay's book on worthless filmmaking. It is becoming painfully clear how much like The Transformers this film is and any subsequent installments will only get worse. Hence we have Christopher Nolan's involvement to thank for this garbage. However I'm sure he is regretting his name being attached to this right now with the kind of reviews it is getting. Fanboys will surely cry when he chooses not to be involved and have his name attached to any sequels. Director Zack Snyder is definitely on his way to becoming the next Michael Bay. This ""reimagining"" is far from a masterpiece like Richard Donner's 1978 classic, ""Superman"". John Williams epic theme is sorely missed but fortunately not associated with this disaster. Even ""Superman Returns"" with it's flaws at least remained true to who Superman is as the character has and always will be. ""Man of Steel"" is a complete insult to over 70 years of rich history regarding the most iconic superhero character in the world. It's truly sad to see the character portrayed so badly and ruined by this film. I'm sure we'll be seeing ""Man of Steel vs. Transformers"" coming soon in 2016. No matter how much money or how it appeals to today's junk minded kids it will never be fondly remembered the way Superman always was and should be.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
he's the origin not a character,"Henry Cavill's portrayal of Superman in Man of Steel redefined the iconic superhero for a new generation. Directed by Zack Snyder, the film offers a darker, more grounded interpretation of the Kryptonian legend. Cavill brings a mix of strength and vulnerability to the role, showing Superman not just as an invincible being but as someone struggling with his place in the world. The action scenes are epic, particularly the intense battle between Superman and General Zod (played by Michael Shannon), and the visual effects are top-notch. However, the film received mixed reactions for its tone, which some found too grim for a Superman story. While the narrative's weight sometimes overshadows the character's traditional hope and optimism, Cavill's performance shines through. His Superman is more contemplative, making the audience ponder what it truly means to be a hero in a complex world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Needs a Shot of Fun,"Man of Steel (2013)** 1/2 (out of 4)Zach Snyder's attempt to reboot the franchise finds Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) secretly living on Earth after his planet was destroyed. He struggles with himself over whether or not he should put his ""talents"" to use but soon he has no choice when General Zod (Michael Shannon) comes to Earth looking for him. Everything from the acting to the sets to the special effects look quite good here but could someone had found a few extra bucks in the budget to allow for some type of story with some character development? Look, I understand the darkness that Christopher Nolan brought to the Batman films worked wonderful but that same dark tone doesn't transform to this film and I think the biggest sin about MAN OF STEEL is the fact that it's just not that fun. I thought Cavill did a good job with what he was given but the screenplay really didn't make Clark Kent or Superman all that interesting. Amy Adams is a fine actress but she's given nothing to do. Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner and Lawrence Fishburn are all fine actors and do nice things with their roles but they too are letdown by the screenplay. Shannon is always fun to watch but he's pretty much just given a generic villain role. The special effects for the most part are excellent but at the same time I think they're so overpowering that you can't help but feel that they suck any life away from what little story there is. I'm going to avoid ruining what happens but the major scene with Costner just lacks any emotional connection as does the entire set up of Russell sending his son away from the dying planet. Snyder certainly knows how to put cool images on the screen but at the same time I really see nothing from this film or his previous works that shows he can handle characters. MAN OF STEEL isn't a bad movie but it's just not a good one either and it's a shame they forget to make it fun.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I don't love or hate this movie, there's some masterful moments in it....and some other stuff.","Following a failed insurrection on the distant planet Krypton inhabited by humanoid aliens, the mastermind behind the attempt, General Zod (Michael Shannon) is banished along with his accomplices to the interdimensional prison The Phantom Zone. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) has come in possession of data saying that Krypton will soon be destroyed as its core begins to distablize, but Jor-El's warnings are ignored by the council. As a last resort Jor-El and his wife send their infant son, Kal-El, to the planet Earth, where Kal-El's physiology will make him stronger and more resilient than humanity, as Jor-El embeds the Codex of Krypton's entire genetic knowledge into Kal-El's cellular structure. The ship crashes on Earth in Smallville, Kansas where Martha and Johnathan Kent (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) find the child and adopt him soon discovering his superhuman abilities. The boy, whom they've named Clark (Dylan Sprayberry -teenager, Henry Cavill-adult), grows up keeping his powers secret at the wishes of his father, John. As Clark wanders the world he eventually finds the answers to who he is at an abandoned Kryptonian scout ship that can access Jor-El's consciousness but is discovered by intrepid reporter Lois Lane. Additionally Zod locates Earth and is intent on conquering it and turning it into a new Krypton.In 2008, Warner Bros. Began exploring ways to reboot the Superman franchise following the underwhelming reception of Superman returns. Following a series of pitches, producer Christopher Nolan and writer David S. Goyer's pitch was selected based on the duo's success on the Christian Bale Dark Knight films. Zack Snyder then boarded the film as director in 2010. The end result of the final product isn't the masterpiece many claim, but it's also not some sort of ""insult to Superman's legacy"" as many have spouted.To start on a positive note, Henry Cavill is really good as Clark Kent/Superman. Cavill feels like a good man with extraordinary power and when we see him don the Superman suit it sells the premise quite effectively. Amy Adams is also quite good as Lois Lane who's given added grit and a hardened edge that builds upon the reinterpretation we got from Margot Kidder in the Donner films. I also rather liked performances by Diane Lane as Clark's adoptive mother Martha and Russell Crowe as Clark's biological father Jor-El who both give committed performances to these roles. The story also has a good core if you look at it from a distance. Thematically it's about Superman's struggle both internally and in the primary conflict between the Kryptonian side of Superman and the Earth side with the duality of Clark Kent/Kal-El reflected with antagonist Zod and his soldiers who stand as quite possibly the last remnants of his birth planet.What doesn't work as well is the execution of this story. Man of Steel is visually speaking a very busy movie with a lot of lengthy sequences that are there solely for the sake of creating visual noise. While the Man of Steel may be the titular focus, the actual focus is on destructive excess taken to the nth degree. The third act in this movie features a lengthy sequence of Metropolis being literally leveled and the destruction becomes gratuitous to a level equivalent to Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich. I will admit the destruction is better produced and lacks a lot of the more obnoxious bits you see in those movies in that you can actually see what's going on, but every action sequence goes on way longer than it needs to and it goes from exhilarating to exhausting. Action sequences are a lot like ketchup: good in small managed amounts, but loses its appeal with too much. I also didn't like the performance of Michael Shannon's Zod or Kevin Costner's Johnathan Kent with some of Johnathan Kent's scenes such as one involving a twister being ridiculous.Almost a decade ago when this movie first came out I was split on it, neither loving it nor hating it as so many others did and continue to do so. All these years later I remain conflicted on it. It's an ambitious movie, it's a well made movie, it's also a well-acted movie (for the most part), but it's also a movie that feels at odds with the core of Superman. Destruction is expected in a Superhero movie and it has it's place, but Superman's first priority mostly seems to be punching or lasering foes and maybe (occasionally) rescuing people. I wish I liked this movie more than I actually do because there are parts of this movie that are brilliant but they're held back by the creative decisions that just feel at odds with the character.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

What a Superman movie should be...,"A modern and updated take on Superman, man of steel is thrilling, thoughtful and incredibly rich and vibrant. The opening krypton scene alone is worth the price of admission and is absolutely breathtaking. There are complaints from people too stuck in the past to get over Christopher Reeves. Complaints of pacing, and too much action. Clearly these people have never read a comic, this is the definitive comic book movie because it plays out like a comic, how can any TRUE fan not love that?
The cast is Phenomenal, Henry Cavill is the physical embodiment of what the Superman of a modern age should be. He's thoughtful, compassionate and selfless, yet feels wildly out of place and yearns for acceptance and to find his place in the world. And he just looks like he could demolish a skyscraper with one punch. Shannon is fantastic as Zod, the tyrannical general consumed with Kryptons resurrection. Crowe shines as Jor-El, the guiding hand and hopeful father of Kal, I only hope we get to see more of him in future stories. Costner is great as the voice of caution, the worried parent desperately hoping to keep the world from taking his son away for being different. All in all this is a fantastic movie, we even get glimpses of a more self assured and even cocky Superman when he allows the authorities to handcuff him and the scene with the drone at the very end. If only the studios would have stayed out of things and allowed a true sequel to come organically, rather than push to catch up with Marvel.
At least now with the Snyder cut coming, we may get to see that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Invulnerable people punching each other..,.Yawn","Can't believe the high IMDb score on this one to be honest. I was very disappointed with this film. It starts off OK with Krypton, and the early part on Earth is OK-ish, but about half of the film is one long moronic punch-up. Invulnerable people hitting each other seemingly endlessly does not a dramatic encounter make. Superman gets punched, flies back into building which is demolished. Gets up as he's invulnerable. He punches person who punched him, who flies back into building which is demolished. Gets up as he's invulnerable. Repeat for 2nd half of film. The next film I viewed was Watchmen. The comparison with such a rich packed storyline just threw into sharp contrast the wasteland which is the Man of Steel script.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Even for Marvel fans this is a must GO!,"The trailers of this movie were released in a so effective way that you start to fear if the product will fill your expectations. And with the usual critics-know-about-everything-nothing-is-good- to-me reviews the chances of be confused about this are increasing. As high as the expectations were raised after trailers, i have to tell you that you will not disappointed with this movie. Is different in many ways to the usual superhero movies but is a solid product that fits in what you expect from this kind of film. Nice references to previous movies are well executed and new plot additions are well received too. As you can expect from a Zack Snyder movie, there are several scenes that try to resemble graphic novel arts and in my opinion are very well made. Some of the nicest things about this movie is the way they made the fast moving scenes. The most of them (unfortunately i can't say all of them) look very realistic according laws of physics, the CGI are so well made that you wish that development for many movies you seen before. The movements are what you expect if such kind of people exist in reality.About the plot, i believe this is the more controversial point of what i see in reviews across the internet. Most moviegoers like it a lot, but are critics the ones ( not all of them) that are giving mixed reviews. What you realize is that critics expect another Dark Knight but this movie is not looking to be a darker one of your beloved Superman. If you are smart enough to understand that this is ANOTHER hero you will be happy with the story. If you are looking for a fourth darker than Batman movie for sure you will agree with critics giving bad reviews. This is a Superman movie and in that scenario this is a very good one.The movie has some flaws to me for sure ( i don't know about a perfect movie) but i will not comment about that as i believe everyone need to discover by themselves what - if any- dislike for their preferences.In summary this is a super hero movie that even Marvel fans will appreciate as is giving a whole new level to a classic story, turning the most beloved hero in an actual hero and mixing a great graphic novel specialist with great digital artists to give you a full action packed movie that make a good foundations for sequels.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ultimately a weak and cheap film,"Maybe I was wrong to expect plot, character development and emotional engagement. This film is all special effects, superman running around. Whats stupid though is that there is almost zero back story what so ever. We see superman on a fishing boat early in the movie for about 2 seconds before he goes off to be a hero, and that was supposed to be like a big emotional arc ohhh he worked a regular man's job.I found myself about halfway through completely disengaged from this film and had I not been with friends I probably would have left. Now don't get me wrong I like entertainment I enjoy Iron Man and Thor but this movie was just lacking any kind of personal connection.There are also long sequences of Superman fighting these other alien villains in the film who are also generally unbeatable so there's no suspense and its pg-13 fighting so you don't want to actually show anything.I wasn't expecting much going in to this film and I got even less than I expected, all the reviews that are on here are from pumped up fanboys who have been waiting for this movie for months. I am sure if you are into special effects and mindless action you will enjoy this but if you want something more you won't get it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Watched Twice and Considerably Less Impressed the Second Time,"This movie played real tricks on me. When I first watched it in the theater I was blown away. I loved the film and considered it part of my top five superhero films. I thought the movie was flawless and the best rendition to date of Superman. I couldn't wait to watch it again.Let us move the clock forward to yesterday; I watched it again and the euphoria wasn't there. I felt like the guy who won the lotto and finds out he's sharing it with 40 other people. What I glossed over the first time was just glaringly obvious the second time around.The things I liked before and still like are the special effects, the story to some degree and the nemeses. It was an excellent display of Superman's powers, how he found them and how he was able to use them. I never tire of his super strength, flying and acts of heroism. And the villains... bravo. Zod was the leader, yes, but his right hand woman, Faora Ul (Anjte Traue), stole the show with her ruthlessness and fighting prowess. There was quite a bit of destruction when it was all said and done... OK that's an understatement, there was massive destruction which would have resulted in the loss of thousands of lives and whereas fighting on that level is kind of cool, there is a saturation point. But, apocalypse level destruction aside, there were some darn good battles between Kal El and Zod and crew.As for the aspects of the movie I didn't like but glossed over initially: the dialog was so-so if not mawkish at times. There were some scenes put in there as well as some lines put in there in order to convey a deeper sense of purpose and meaning to Superman, which is where I think the movie tends to veer off course. They even repeated a particular Messianic pose that had me rolling my eyes at Superman Returns. Then there was Lois Lane. In order to get us up to speed on what her character is all about (i.e. a no nonsense dogged reporter) they introduced us to her at a military setup where she was unwelcome yet she was going to show them who's boss. And of course, no Superman movie is complete without saving his main squeeze at least three to five times.What I gather from my two different experiences is that seeing my first movie in 3D was mesmerizing and skewed my judgment. Because, essentially that's what happened. I had never seen a movie in 3D before, I saw this one and I was so impressed I ignored the other cinematic flaws. Well, watching a movie on my 13"" MacBook is a better test because you better have a very good product to make it awesome on a laptop. The movie was good but it sure wasn't great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The worlds greatest superhero gets the movie he deserves.,"I saw Man Of Steel last night at an advance screening and at no point was I looking down on the movie.From the trailers and TV spots the movie really gets you interested and dying for more.And the Movie itself soars(yes I know ha-ha)above the expectations.First of all Henry Cavill is an excellent Clark Kent/Superman.He really gives the character that ""not wanted"" or ""don't feel like you belong"" feeling.The cast in the movie is excellent including Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon.Russell Crowe really expands on Jor-el's character and makes him more than just a voice helping Clark.Michael Shannon as Zod is terrific.He was even better than Superman 2's Zod.The fight scenes in the movie are astonishing.It makes up for all the lack of conflict Superman Returns had.The fight scenes are very destructive yes but there is a very good story around it so it wasn't just mindless explosions like Transformers.Man of steel was by far the best movie of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lays The Groundwork for What Could Be a Perfect Superman Movie,"Ever since his first appearance in Action Comics #1, Superman has been an American icon. Being the first real comic book superhero, it was only fitting that he be brought to the big screen properly for modern audiences. With Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel,"" I don't necessarily think this is the Superman film we've been waiting for all these years, but I do think what we got is something that set us off in the right direction.This is another take on the origin story of Kal-El, a baby born in the last days of the planet Krypton who is sent to Earth by his father (Russell Crowe), where he is raised by a simple farm family, the Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). Raised as Clark Kent, he discovers that on this planet, he has magnificent powers that he eventually decides to use to protect humanity as Superman. This is a story that nearly everyone knows, but ""Man of Steel"" takes some different story beats that definitely lead down a darker, more emotional and realistic path that I really enjoyed.One of the strongest elements of the film is the casting, particularly the casting of Superman and his fathers. Henry Cavill definitely showed flashes of greatness in this film, and while he hasn't given a character-defining performance here like Christopher Reeve did in Richard Donner's ""Superman,"" I definitely believe that Cavill has the potential to grow into that perfect Superman for modern audiences. The true standouts, however, are Crowe and Costner as Jor-El and Jonathan Kent, respectively. Both of these men gave performances that elevated the emotional weight of this film beyond that of a typical comic book movie, Costner in particular. Amy Adams also does a fine job, probably giving us the best Lois Lane yet.However, this film is not without it's faults. I think the pacing felt awkward in the second half particularly. The film was primarily split off in two halves, a story-driven first half and an action-packed second. I enjoyed the action in this film for the most part, but after a while, it started to feel sort of dull and lifeless. It was borderline excessive for this movie, but I also think that the problem with the action in this movie is that it was so separated from the story elements. If the action would have been more interspersed among emotional, character driven sequences, they probably would have seemed more special when they happened, but instead, the action sort of felt redundant after a while.Despite its faults, ""Man of Steel"" is a really enjoyable film. While it's not the Superman film I've always wanted to see, I think the groundwork has now been set. I'm very excited to see where the sequels take us from here, because now that everything is established, we can now have a Superman movie we've been waiting for. And as far as the origin story goes, ""Man of Steel"" is a great way to set up this DC Universe. I can't wait to see where Big Blue goes from here!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is unlike any Superman before...,"I am not overly fond of superhero movies in general, but still I watch them, as I am a movie aficionado. And I must confess that ""Man of Steel"" is actually the best superhero movie that I have seen.This is not the child-approved adventure that Superman was back in the Christopher Reeve era - during which I grew up with those particular movies - and nor is it anywhere near ""Superman Returns"". ""Man of Steel"" quite simply pushes the entire boundary of what the audience is used to in the previous movies.""Man of Steel"" is a Superman movie for grown ups, and it really does appeal to an adult audience. The story is darker and delivers a harder punch, no pun intended, than any previous Superman movies. And the level of destruction and mayhem present in this movie is just simply off the charts. And for that alone, the movie is well worth watching.These constant reboots of previously established movies is annoying to a great extend, and the same goes for ""Man of Steel"". Was it really necessary to tell the story of Supermans trip to Earth and his upbringing here? No, not really. But still, the movie was entertaining, because it was a more serious and gloomy universe that the audience was introduced to.And while we are on the topic of reboots, then why use General Zod and his henchmen again? These were in a Christopher Reeve Superman movie already and were bested even there. So why reinvent them and use them again? I just don't get that. But thumbs up for the characters, their outfits and their more menacing and brutal demeanor.I wasn't familiar with Henry Cavill at all, and must admit that it is good that they are finally moving away from the Christopher Reeve era and anything that looks like him (hint, hint, the ""Superman Returns"" movie). It was a bold move, sure, but one that will essentially bring about a great new touch and inspiration to the Superman franchise.""Man of Steel"" is action and excitement from start to finish. And even Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner performed quite well in this movie.I can warmly recommend that you sit down and watch ""Man of Steel"", it is a much needed breath of fresh air in the superhero genre.And what is up with the hype about these so-called 'easter eggs' in the movie? Come on, get over it. It is a movie meant for entertainment, this is not rocket science.Strap in for an action-filled and adrenaline-filled ride of a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Pretty solid summer blockbuster / Do not expect Nolan wit and twist,"Just saw a preview (premier) for Man of Steel. As a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, was thrilled to see Syncopy logo at the beginning of the movie. This movie is the beginning of superman saga, kindly showing the world of superman for ones like me who have never came across the superman story. One of the major drawback in this movie is the setup of the character. There are some appealing motives that shapes up the character of Clark Kent (superman) but all stories are juxtaposed, without creating a solid figure as a symbol of justice. However, this movie serves as a great summer blockbuster, with action packed later half of the movie. As a Nolan fanboy, I was expecting more of dark twist, realism, and solid story as his previous work, but have to admit that Nolan has not played a major role in this movie. The story is linear, except for few events that shapes the character. This will make audiences easily get into the story.Overall, this movie can win the blockbuster war of Summer 2013. However, there could have been an improvement over narration, which leaves bit dissatisfaction. Bottom Line : ""Action packed movie that lies somewhere in between Dark Knight trilogy and Iron Man""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Legendary Superman Tale with Henry Cavill at the Helm!,"""Man of Steel"" is a masterpiece that redefines the Superman mythos for a modern audience. Directed by Zack Snyder and supported by an emotionally resonant story crafted by Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, this film offers a compelling exploration of Clark Kent's journey from an outsider to Earth's greatest protector.The visuals are nothing short of breathtaking, with Snyder's signature style bringing Krypton, Smallville, and Metropolis to life in a way that feels both grounded and epic. The action sequences are some of the best in superhero cinema, especially the intense battle scenes with General Zod and his forces.But the true heart of this movie is Henry Cavill's legendary performance as Superman. Cavill brings a depth and vulnerability to the character that is both fresh and respectful to the legacy of this iconic hero. His portrayal captures the internal conflict of being both alien and human, and his commanding presence makes him the definitive Superman of this generation.The supporting cast, including Michael Shannon as the menacing Zod, Amy Adams as a determined Lois Lane, and Russell Crowe as a dignified Jor-El, elevate the film further. Hans Zimmer's powerful score perfectly complements the emotional weight and grandeur of the story.""Man of Steel"" is not just a superhero film; it's an exploration of identity, hope, and the burden of greatness. Henry Cavill is a legend, and his Superman will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the greatest portrayals in cinematic history. A must-watch for any DC fan or lover of epic storytelling!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An immense spectacle that despite its flaws injects new excitement into Superman,"In this superhero-obsessed culture/Hollywood world we live in, it's a wonder that the grand-daddy of them all, Superman, hasn't had a successful debut in the 21st Century. Obviously I've just implicitly bashed 2006's ""Superman Returns,"" which I will not be taking the time to discuss beyond this sentence, but I don't think anyone disagrees that Bryan Singer's film failed to do the Man of Steel justice.Knowing they had yet to tap the full potential of one of the greatest characters of all time, Warner Bros. finally committed to bringing in the amount of mind and muscle befitting of Superman and channeling it into a new incarnation. The duo of producer Christopher Nolan (mind) and director Zack Snyder (muscle) promised an intelligent, visually extravagant and emotion-filled blockbuster spectacle. A tall order, no doubt, but they manage to breathe new life and excitement into the character.""Man of Steel"" doesn't feel like a Snyder film or a Nolan film, and it visually distinguishes itself as separate from the Christopher Reeve/Richard Donner ""Superman,"" whose imagery became the definitive take on the Superman universe. Purists might well have an issue with the liberties taken with the Fortress of Solitude, Phantom Zone and likely more. There are no visual easter eggs or homages to famous dialogue either. ""Man of Steel"" clearly wanted a fresh start.It begins fresh as well with an extended sequence on Krypton, which sets up a bit more of the reason Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sent his newborn son to Earth as well as who is General Zod (Michael Shannon). It's definitely rushed, but in showing us part of the Superman universe we've never seen before it manages to keep our interest completely piqued with an array of dazzling action, sets, costumes and CGI.The on-Earth beginning of the story, the origin of Clark Kent, also goes in a different direction. As Clark (Henry Cavill) ventures through Alaska in an effort to discover his greater purpose, the narrative flashes back to pivotal moments during his upbringing in the hands of Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane).Screenwriter David S. Goyer keeps the momentum going forward while touching on the crucial thematic points of Superman's origin, the bits about keeping his identity a secret and finding his greater destiny, etc. This creative choice also helps to avoid a total feeling of deja vu in experiencing Superman's origin story yet another time, a fault that many saw in the reboot ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" for example. That said, toying with the chronology keeps us from experiencing the greatest degree of empathy for our hero. Fortunately, Cavill plays the role with great humility, so it's tough not to like this Superman.As much as the script takes certain liberties with the origin and how its told and also how Clark meets Lois Lane (Amy Adams), it stays extremely focused on Superman and Zod's invasion of Earth the entire time. So many superhero films get bogged down with subplots, but ""Man of Steel"" has none. Anything you might deem a subplot directly connects with whatever else is going on in the film at the time.What Goyer and Nolan have done with the story could spark endless discussion (and in some circles, debate). Anyone expecting an artistic blood transfusion from ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" will be let down a tad. Batman's universe can theoretically be steeped in realism; Superman's flat out can't. ""Man of Steel"" embraces the science-fiction elements of ""Superman"" and plays them up. Considering one of every two action films these days involves aliens leveling a city, it's not hard to see why Warner Bros. was more than happy to go in that direction.At this point we can safely say that the more audiences are subjected to final sequences involving mass-scale urban destruction, the more they will begin to just tune it out. The film doesn't exactly do a great job of making us care about whether the Daily Planet turns to rubble. In fact, I can't recall if the word Metropolis is even used in the entire movie. Regardless, the photo-realism of the fight sequences thanks to advances in CGI is breathtaking. Snyder, known for his abundant use of slow-motion, goes hard left with extremely fast-moving, often airborne action and fight choreography that despite the potential for blurry, incoherent CGI, comes out stunningly vivid. Superman's showdown with Zod's buddies in Smallville serves as an incredible showcase of the visual effects work on the film. The climactic scene in Metropolis is too, but again, after Superman gets chucked through that 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th building (all in one frame), you stop paying attention and eagerly await how the showdown with Zod will finally end.Spectacle would be the first way to describe ""Man of Steel."" As much as it offers some interesting themes, the film doesn't take the time to sit on anything. It's go, go, go in order to fit the origin story and provide plenty of drama once Zod invades. It's a pure summer blockbuster as opposed to a grittier, more intellectual take on ""Superman"" (a majority of the time), but it's infinitely more interesting than similar spectacle films such as the ""Transformers"" series.All the elements of the film and characters are pretty likable, but these peripheral elements are underdeveloped. Much like how I felt after seeing ""Amazing Spider-Man,"" now that the origin story is out of the way, there's room for a little more complexity in future installments. And if just scratching the surface of this new ""Superman"" world was this exciting from an entertainment standpoint, getting an opportunity to dig deeper holds promise.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Bring on the Justice League,"With the days of their planet numbered in single digits, Jor-El(Crowe, who brings tremendous gravitas to the role) and Lara(Zurer, doing well with little time) reluctantly send their newborn to Earth. Growing up in the care of the Kents(Costner and Lane, whose talents are warranted these not-starring roles), Clark(Cavill, lending a humble, yet powerful air to the lead) is struggling with his identity and feels alone, isolated, and must keep his lineage secret(this is a realistic take on the hero, and the issue of first contact is dealt with - how do governments deal with knowing that there are aliens?). And when Lois Lane(Adams as the strong, independent woman) threatens to unveil the truth in the interest of journalism, and our world is threatened by General Zod(Shannon, not as hammy as Stamp, or Spacey's Luthor), he will have to decide between these two worlds.The first issue is of course, does this have a reason to exist. ""Returns"" was not even a decade ago, and didn't go over well. The answer is, thankfully, yes. This does things that the '78 one, in all its glory, did not, and this is like that in being of its time and generation(hence the angst in this). Yes, another origin story... this fleshes out the backstory, establishing the mythos well, and grants the wonder(and shows the inspirational nature of risking oneself to help others) that has kept this a US icon for 65 years. And this proudly embraces the core elements of the American dream and Superman, with a nobody from Kansas growing up to become a legend, an immigrant finding new hope in his new home and loneliness(something everyone feels at one point or another) and rootlessness leading to aiding the common good.All of the acting is great, including the kids portraying the titular Man in the numerous flashbacks(this is mainly set in his adulthood). With Nolan having worked on the script until he was happy with it and then fully handing over creative control to Snyder, this is very much the latter's film. This helps DC show that Batman(as envisioned by aforementioned psychological director... who, by the way, would not have fit this man in tights) is not all they've got, like Marvel, they have more flavor to offer(and here's hoping this one will launch that shared cinematic universe).He brings his comic book aesthetic and compelling sense of visuals to this, wisely opting for film over digital, and a fantastic hand-held cinematography that doesn't confuse. The 3D post-conversion(not his call) robs that technique of some of its intended effect and makes it jarring. Frankly, just watch it in 2D. This is epic(note that we see plenty of rescues and heroics before the cape is donned), with a thundering Hans Zimmer score(OK, so there's *some* Dark Knight-ness in this) and fast pace(making the 2 hour, 12 minute running time, not counting end credits, not feel as arduous). Yes, the third act is non-stop action, and in general, these sequences tend to leave the status quo unaltered(that's why often, stuff like that is left on the cuttin room floor), are at times generic, repetitive(you will believe a man can punch someone all the way through a building) or feel overly similar to other blockbusters. Michael Bay comparisons? How...? You invariably care about at least one person involved, none of them go on for too long and we're allowed to breathe inbetween each of them, when there's engaging character development and drama them.There is a lot of implied(and nonetheless, inescapable) violence and death(which, along with the 9/11 imagery evoked, is in poor taste) and a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to every fan, of any age, of the Man of Steel, and/or the people involved in making this. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Start of Something Great,"I've just got back from the cinema after seeing Man Of Steel, and I have one thing to say: it was absolutely great. I'm not taking that away from it. However, in my opinion, not as great as it could have been.Let me start off with the positives, because there are a lot of them. You have to take your hat off to everyone involved for making this film work. And it does work, really well in fact. One of the film's best attributes is that is manages to ground Superman in our modern day and age, without it seeming ridiculous. This, Snyder nails perfectly. The cinematography in this film is noticeably Snyder-esque, and the camera movement reminded me a lot of 300, which isn't a bad thing. All of the actors involved nail their roles, and Cavill does a fantastic job of portraying our modern Superman. Hans Zimmer's score is unsurprisingly stirring and uplifting, and completes the overall package, just like he managed with the Dark Knight trilogy. And the action, well, the action is something else entirely. The CGI is the best I think I've ever seen, surpassing even The Avengers of last year, and the sound FX hits all the right spots.However, it's not a perfect film. My biggest gripe is that I felt there was very little character development in any character besides Superman himself. I felt like, had someone stripped away all of the CGI and action, the resulting film wouldn't have been up to much. This doesn't mean I'm taking away any of the merits the cast & crew accomplished in the epic action sequences, because they really did take my breath away, but in the words of another critic, 'less could easily have been more'. I felt that the final standoff (not giving anything away) could have been easily halved, or even cut altogether, and the film would not have lost anything. By the end of it, the huge action scenes became somewhat dull, because I felt like I'd already seen enough of them. This is one of the things I loved about the Dark Knight trilogy - there is a fine line between character driven moments and action, a line which Nolan hit perfectly and one that I feel Snyder did not. I suppose that's what to be expected from a director like Snyder whose previous films have revolved a lot around action sequences. I hate to compare the Batman trilogy and Man Of Steel, but it's very hard not to.Overall, Man Of Steel is not as good as it could have been, that's for sure in my mind. However, credit must go to everyone involved, especially the great direction from Snyder himself, for pulling off what could easily be the start of a fantastic new franchise. I look forward to seeing where they take Kal-El next",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
How Could They Do this to Superman?!?!,"As usual, I find that for some when a movie is made about a super-hero, it has to fit into some pigeonhole, determined by years of comic books. God forbid that someone tries to find a different angle or a new approach. As usual, there is all this nit-picking about details that don't seem real. For heaven's sake, the guy can fly, comes as a baby from another planet, and can go back and forth in time. Let's check the reality thing right now. There have been so many reviews of this that I doubt I can contribute much that is new, but for me, the guy was a multi-dimensional character who has to deal with a hand that is dealt to him. I'm waiting for Superman XIX, ""Superman on the Psychiatrist's Couch."" The guy must have incredible angst during his private moments and feel the weight of the world. Anyway, the acting is quite good, there is lots of action, and under the circumstances, he seems pretty real.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Branded Tripe,"Man of Steel is what happens when high end CGI becomes affordable to bad screenwriters.This film was absolutely deplorable. There were two redeeming qualities to this film: the ending credits and the guarantee that I'll never have to watch it again.The storyline was so rushed, empty, and flat that I was laughing at how cookie cutter and formulaic it was. No, I mean I was 'literally' laughing out loud. It followed suit with all of the new ""re-imagining"" of films of late; stepping up the political correctness to a painful degree, abruptly revealing one dimensional lead characters, entirely Mickey-Mouse-scary antagonists, and unbelievably shallow motivations on all sides. Not to mention, it has so many plot holes that if it were held up against a light it would look like mesh.There was a clear motivation, however. Keeping the optioned rights to the Superman namesake by putting out a 2.5 hour piece of tripe to rake in big bucks from the uninspired and vapid herds. Oh, and merchandising.My girlfriend and I often joke about taking a shot anytime a film depicts a cliché movie phrase, action, dynamic, or scene. We would have died of liver failure within the first 11 seconds of this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie is number one on my list,"This movie is the best rendition of superman I have ever seen. Is tells the best back story and gives a whole new light and breath of fresh air to the franchise ever. And the visiual effects are stunning and so real it is like it could happen today. And if part one is like this I can't wait for part two but as I said this movie is the best movie ever made with one of the top villains ever even almost as good as Ban form "" The Dark Knight "" . It started out a lilttle bit slow but it gained momentum quickly. Even though the parts of the movie where his fortress of solitude is a space ship instead of an ice palace was a bit of a let down but other than that I give this movie 10 out 10 stars.

Man of Steel,"The dark tone of ""Man of Steel"" probably fits well with some people, but for me, it just seems like they wanted to make Superman the same way Nolan made Batman back in 2005. The darkness of this movie doesn't help the story even the slighest and it actually makes the movie a lot more flat and boring, because it doesn't fit with the character of Superman. The first half of the movie is pretty well-made, but the second and third halves are really just a visual aspect of something that we never asked for.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent movie. See the 2-D though.,"I really enjoyed this movie. I am a big fan of action and superhero movies, and this did not disappoint. First of all I thought they did a great job on casting Superman. Henry Cavill fits the role perfectly. I liked the supporting cast, except thought they could have done better with Lois Lane. The plot starts out with Superman (Kal-El) being born, and quickly jumps into him being in his 20's and saving people. They show some of his growing up, through flashbacks but I wish they would have done more of this. You don't have to see any previous Superman movies to see this one, you get the whole back story. There was a ton of good action scenes, almost too much I thought. Plot was pretty good, but also pretty predictable. I saw the 3-D version, and I am not a big fan of 3-D. While this movie did not give me a headache, like 'The Hobbit', I didn't think the 3-D added that much, and I would recommend seeing the 2-D version! Overall I gave it a 9/10. Good action, fun, entertaining movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's not a masterpiece, but it's the best Superman yet","MAN OF STEEL is the latest in a long line of comic book adaptations tackling that all-American hero. I've previously seen all four of the Christopher Reeve movies as well as the misfiring SUPERMAN RETURNS, so I had some idea of what to expect here; it's safe to say that the remarkably serious and complex MAN OF STEEL is the best on-screen Superman yet, although that's not to say it's a masterpiece.Gone are memories of the cheesy Reeve films, to be replaced by intensive and destructive action, all achieved via some remarkably impressive CGI effects. Henry Cavill struggles to bring charisma to the role of the iconic character, but he certainly looks the part and his work in the gym has paid off too. The always-great Michael Shannon makes for a fun bad guy, and others like Amy Adams and Laurence Fishburne flesh out their parts pretty well too.The only problem with MAN OF STEEL is its length. Like many modern-day superhero movies, it's a bit overlong, which makes it feel bloated. Zach Snyder offers some surehand direction, but this isn't on the same kind of level as WATCHMEN. Almost half of the running time is made up of massive action sequences, and these do get a bit repetitive when they keep doing the same shots over and over again, but at the same time it's still a visual feast and the film-makers are able to put stuff on screen that hasn't been put there before. For what it's worth I enjoyed MAN OF STEEL, although it's not one of those films I could imagine sitting through again; once was enough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best movie in my opinion I am a big fan of superman!!,Such a good movie it is so worth watching. In my opinion I could watch it again and again Fantastic. Iove the actor that plays superman he is my favourite and also like the villain of the movie because of how he played the roll. So clever to think of all the special effects which were perfect but also and the lines. The best part of the film is that Superman didn't want to kill anybody but had to. Lastly this movie is a S tier movie for or 10/10.

Not so super man!,"I wanted to love this film SO much...What a terrible assault on the senses! Yes, it was visually amazing with a great cast.... but seriously, it really does suffer from the old adage - ""If you can't make it good, make it loud and fast!"". The onslaught was relentless and could certainly have been cut by 20 minutes for the better.It's also inconceivable to think that the continuous mass destruction of Metropolis didn't result in thousands of innocent people dying because Superman made a wrong call and chose to not battle an identical machine that was located in a sparsely populated area of the world instead.Superman shows absolutely no concern for any of the people around him when he fights. Yes, he can fight battles and save people, but truly the emotional soul of Superman is that you should feel protected when he's around and in this film that is unfortunately lacking and you could now as easily be a victim of collateral damage.Another serious flaw was it's lack of heart. There was no emotional attachment to the characters. Superman, we have to remember is supposed to be a Paladin figure, whiter than white with goodness oozing through his pores. In essence a superhero that his contemporaries look up to.The final nail in the coffin for me was the dispatch of General Zod. Superman does not kill. Period. There are no ifs or buts on this one. FACT.The Marvel films although treading on similar territory have humour and soul that this DC flick fails to deliver. Dark and broody works for Batman, but Superman....??? Which exec thought that would work? If this is a Superman for a new generation then I'm afraid it's a very joyless, desensitised society we now live in...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Most Underrated Superhero Movie of all Time,"When I watched this movie recently, I saw all the bad reviews for it. I saw the 56%, and overall thought it was going to be a mediocre movie. But it blew my mind. After I was done with the movie, I was amazed at how good it was. The soundtrack for the movie was very well done by Hans Zimmer, and the action scenes were great. I also loved the villain Zod. He just had a wrong take on the world, and really, he isn't evil. He is broken. He is not one of those characters who just want to take over the world because he wants to. He wants to do it because he wants to rebuild his kind.

"A great cast takes on ""Superman Begins"" with CGI overkill","Man of Steel (2013)The Superman story from the fall of Krypton to his first moments as a full grown Superman on planet earth.And there are some thrills, including lots of retelling of the familiar story—like how he grew up in Kansas and was raised by really good, salt of the earth parents to be a good guy. (I mean, what if he was raised by Paris Hilton?) Kevin Kostner plays the dad, and he is a kind of superhero himself for his wisdom and self-sacrifice, much like Glenn Ford was in that role for the 1976 movie, ""Superman."" In fact, there is a lot here that will be an homage to that groundbreaking movie.And often it doesn't compare well by comparison. Here, the special effects are more advanced, but they are also simply more. There is so much computer driven action stuff here, and often with such fast pizzowy cuts and big explosions, it's all about sensation. The plot is there, and at least you can tell who is who, but there's little of what you would in a better movie call choreography.A good cast comes to the rescue. Amy Adams is terrific in her straight forward role as Lois Lane, and the evil nemesis played by Michael Shannon is excellent without ever being exaggerated and ridiculous. And most of all, Clark Kent a.k.a. Superman is really excellent—and hot—as played by Henry Cavill. (You can argue all you want about who is better in the role, Cavill or Christopher Reeve, but you need to see both movies first. I have and I leave it a tie because each fits the personality of the movie he is in best.)There are some raving good reviews of this movie and I don't blame them, but I'm guessing many of them have never seen earlier Superman movies. Not that the 1976 version is better—it has a similar bag of tricks and parallel flaws—but that the plot in this new one is not new. If you've seen the other movie. So if you are looking for some surprises rather than a series of reminders, you won't find them here.Except for the one big one that the enemy is from, well, you'll see soon enough. But what that means is lots and lots of high tech (and not always very well done) computer effects. The falling buildings are brilliant, and the set designs on Krypton are amazing, and they take up a large part of the movie. Some of the folksy warmth of the earlier movie is missing here, which I miss—they don't even reprise ""faster than a speeding bullet"" and all of that, which is kind of archetypal.Christopher Nolan had a hand in this production but did not direct it, but on the horizon for 2015 is a tantalizing title, ""Batman vs. Superman."" Let's see how that plays out with his superior movie-making intelligence. For now, this is a halting and sometimes numbing entry point.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Different Opinion,"I came into this movie hoping I'd like it. I heard from other reviewers saying it was great, but others disliked it. I however, am part of the latter.I'm going to try my best to write this review without any spoilers, even though there's one moment that made my sister walk out of the theater in anger and made me nearly scream.This review is coming from someone who has watched 2 Superman movies, 8 and a half seasons of Smallville, and a season of Lois and Clark. I think I have knowledge of the original source material.First off, I'll discuss what made up most of the movie, the fight scenes. The only indicator to tell what the hell was going on is that Superman is wearing blue and the villains are wearing grey. It was also shaky and the city looks absolutely ugly with the grey and brown colors everywhere. Also, Superman sometimes doesn't seem to care about people within the city dying as a result of the fights.Now the acting. Amy Adams was a very bland Lois. Her connection with Canvill's character seemed like a friendship. Costner and Crowe aren't actors I'm a fan of, so obviously, I didn't like them. Everyone else's acting was either bland or average. Also for original fans, Perry White is bland too as a character and Lana Lang shows up for two scenes.There were a couple of moments that would be spoilers if I gave away why I hated them, but I'll just summarize in this: Bland acting, awful fight scenes, gross looking scenery, missing the point within characters, and boring as hell.I'm only giving it 2 stars because at first the scenery wasn't the worst I've ever seen, some of the acting was good, Martha Kent was very good, and the fight scenes weren't so repetitive at first.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Better than the critics gave it credit for.,"Wow, the special effects in this movie are phenomenal. You can certainly tell they put a lot of money into it. It really paid off as it makes for a great action movie. Don't listen to the critics as Man of Steel is about entertainment and it does exactly that. Although the overall tone of the film is much darker than previous versions which is a little depressing and Amy Adams was quite possibly the worst choice for Lois Lane but other than that it is a great movie.I feel like this version of Superman has never been told before. It doesn't feel stale and ""done before"" but instead offers a new take on a very familiar subject. It's no shiny saviour story, it shows how toxic fear and prejudice really can be. It probably didn't need to be quite so long to send that message but it fills the time adequately nevertheless.So watch and enjoy it for what it is, the cast is more than enough reason.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

By far the best Superman Movie. But a bit unsatisfying,"Just watched the movie. The good things first, Henry Cavill is great as Superman. The visual effects are spectacular and some of the changes made to the Superman folklore was surprisingly refreshing, IMHO. Having said that I found the movie to be a bit unsatisfying. Once the action starts its goes on forever and is kind of monotonous. The supporting characters are not very well developed ,but given that its just the first of the series(reboot) it can be ignored, I guess. My biggest gripe is that it does not contain enough thrills of a superhero movie (other than the elongated fight scene). Coming from the people behind the Dark Knight series, it just does not stand up to the standards.Overall I gave it 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This is perhaps the only Superman film with the best narrative of the Kryptonian's heritage and history. Good casting and an impressive performance by Russell Crowe.

Spell-Binding,"I held off watching this movie for almost a decade, in defiance of the insane MCU culture and the fact that I felt I was sure to be disappointed. However, I should have never waited this long.Aside from the blatant disregard for the theory of relativity in dealing with space travel (which is why I gave it 9 stars out of 10), this is by far the most exquisite Superman portrayal ever made.Superman has always been the rarest of superheroes in that he overcomes his ""heroic problem""--his inner conflict--with a singular decision: to always do right and protect the Earth. He surpasses other superheroes in this regard because it is not an ongoing conflict; he resolves it everlastingly in one checkmate move. This film captures that epic choice with clarity and precision.Henry Cavill does more than shine--he glistens--in this role that was his from birth. Watching this movie, you feel with him all of the pain, sacrifice and triumph of Superman's story. I have never been so moved by a superhero.I have heard people say that Superman is ""too good"" and that they prefer dynamic superheroes who walk a fine line between good and bad. However, I find that Superman is refreshingly absolute in a world enshrouded by various shades of grey.This film does his character justice, and I encourage everyone who has the opportunity to watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Man of Steel is great.,"I have never been a hardcore superman fan, but I was fortunate enough to see an early showing of Zack Snyder's reboot. And I must say, I am quite impressed. Casual moviegoers and superhero fans will find something to enjoy. Man of Steel has great wreck- everything action that makes full use of 3D effects and simply looks awesome. The story is decently paced, and fueled by strong performances by Michael Shannon and Russell Crow(e). The character Perry White wasn't used to his full potential, but that's forgivable. If you're a fan of classic superman, you might be disappointed by the fact that this man of steel is pretty up- tight. He has only two or three lines that are humorous, making him less charming then the Christopher Reeve superman. The charm is replaced by the character development the man of steel experiences when he must choose between his past and his future. (that makes for an awesome showdown, by the way.) To summarize, I give Man of Steel an 8.6 for it's portrayal of a classic American hero.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

CGI is at its best and the action sequences are so much engaging that you would not care for 2D, 3D or N-D. So my suggestion would be to go for a 2D version.There are a few moral exaggerations in the movie that some viewers will find a bit difficult to digest, but in the overall backdrop of the movie, those would not matter a lot.

They got almost everything wrong,"There is a point towards the end of this film where in the main villain states, ""There is only one way this can end, either you die or I die"". Clearly, that is two possible outcomes and the carelessness of this line sums up a clearly inadequate script. There are no sharp interactions between hero and villain (think the Joker and Batman), the speeches seem hollow and meaningless and explaining the back story seems forced and untidy. The script is probably the largest failing here but it is not the only one. The movie is hideously paced, tediously inert for the first 90 minutes followed by 45 minutes of explosions and rugby tackles. The film tries to establish itself as dark, brooding gritty yet this appears in stark contrast with firework display of a conclusion. The casting is questionable, Adams as Lois Lane is uncomfortable fit to say the least. There also some established names wasted in nothing roles, primarily Laurence Fishburne. In general the film fails to update the Superman story to the modern world, unable to escape the campy feel and implausibility of the plot. All in all this film is not terrible but it really isn't very good.

Man Of Steel Is Enough For Any Man (or Woman),"(My first review on IMDb EVER. I don't know why I feel so strongly about defending this movie.)As a summer tentpole, Man of Steel delivers. It's sprawling, feels epic, and is loaded with enough booms and bangs to keep the popcorn going. But don't let that distract you from the story: the origin is properly managed, and although it does look back to Donner's take on Superman II, it's been given a fresh spin.Let's face it, he's called SUPERman. They've made him out to be a god on earth, and the action is adequately OTT to address it. This isn't a movie that's meant to be taken seriously; if you can believe a man can fly, you should be able to appreciate the outrageous action.This is clearly not The Dark Knight, but you'll at least leave the cinema with a hint of a smile on your face, and feeling that the money spent was actually worth it.High spot: Seeing Russel Crowe as Jor-el.

Terrific cast - lots of action but a bit too serious,"This is a visually stunning exciting serious movie. It's different from the Christopher Reeve version. It shows a lot more background about Krypton, Zod (quite noble here), Clark's childhood angst, his adult angst. I know it is no point to do a similar plot and so they have made some interesting changes in the Lois and Clark relationship. The action sequences are over the top and range from Smallville to Metropolis to space.The cast is almost perfectly chosen. Amy Adams is the ideal Lois Lane -charming and brave. Her role is sufficiently proactive. Diane Lane is moving and believable as Martha Kent. Russell Crowe is usually a bit grumpy looking but here he is alright. Chris Meloni is a good U.S. commander. Michael Shannon (who knew Boardwalk would lead to this) is quite a sympathetic and charismatic Zod. As for the comic book handsome Henry Cavill, he completely looks the part of Superman. It's too bad he has to look gloomy and scruffy for a good part of the movie. The new blue suit is an improvement on the older one with a more modern color.A few faults: The music was a highlight of the 80s version with the ""Superman Theme"" and ""Can you read my mind"" which are still memorable today. This 2013 film had a completely forgettable score.The climactic fighting and smashing into roads buildings is a bit overdone and repetitive. A few clever and original action sequences without so much destruction would have been better. But even if they went overboard, too much action is better than the Brandon Routh version which just sank.I missed the charm and humor of the Reeve version (eg the magic of the first flight with Lois) are not found here. Just a couple of chuckles in 2013. Some lighter moments might have made Superman a more rounded hero than some gloomy Dark Knight kind of action figure. Superman needs to be more fun than the other Avengers and Marvel heroes. Hopefully a sequel will go more into these other aspects of romance and humor.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Supercrap,"There are plenty of reviews which highlight the countless inconsistencies of this movie (the director should be made to watch it), so I won't mirror these.What bothered me far more were the numerous religious/theistic tones and symbolism throughout the movie, highlighting the entire wreck as nothing more than a vehicle for some Christianity-selling.I'm, of course, talking about the title character's baffling, needless Jesus Christ pose in Earth's orbit, the female 'baddie's' childish, claim that ""Evolution always wins' (that why the majority of humans are God-fearing despite no sensible reason, facts shunned in favour of here-say), and Superman's Earth-father telling him that he was 'sent to Earth for a reason', that old, egotistical attitude that encourages people to believe that the vast entirety of the universe operates solely to benefit the youngest, most destructive species on a tiny planet in a quiet corner of one galaxy among billions.And people told me that the movie was ""Awesome""?! Why? What exactly does it do that's original/inventive/creative/unique? It's simply another cleverly marketed money-machine to keep hollowood rich, and YOU, the people, allowed it.Absolutely ridiculous, and an insult to my intelligence.That said, the effects were pretty good it places.Please, though, people, let's not settle for this kind of mindless nonsense.

One of the most frustratingly underwhelming experiences I've had in cinemas,"After watching Man Of Steel, my opinion of pretty much everyone involved in a creative capacity was substantially lowered. To see the product of such a talented collection of filmmakers, many having created films I've thoroughly enjoyed, be so joyless and feel so unfinished and rough around the edges and blunt, is very disheartening. Ultimately after the film was over, it really felt like I had watched an imitation of a blockbuster film, made by people who just didn't know what they were doing, or trying to say.The movie is technically brilliant. CGI is superb. It was shot on film using anamorphic lenses, which I really appreciate for the look it creates. But what the film actually captured, and what the CGI was overlaid on top of, the actual movie, the story, is a flatline. The filmmakers just strung together a bunch of trailer shots and told Hans Zimmer to ""do that thing you do"", and that is it. There is no substance here. There is almost no character interplay, so many scenes basically only has two characters interacting. There is no effort from the filmmakers to actually weave the characters in the film into an engaging storyline, playing multiple characters off each other, exploring the dynamics of superman having two father figures. Superman has only sporadic dialogue, of which only a small percentage actually has substance and isn't just written to be a cool soundbite for the trailers.The rest of the film is just a blur of CGI destruction imagery you would be hard pressed to differentiate from Transformers or Star Trek, which I was devastated to realize while in the cinema. The last 3rd of the film is in essence a particle effects demo from the effects houses involved.I really cannot recommend this film to anyone. If you haven't seen a few previous films that destroy cities on massive scales it might still be a novelty you won't regret spending money on, but for anyone who wants to watch a movie with characters that engage you emotionally, stay away until you can watch it free of charge. Considering the film wanted to explore the character, and the huge possibilities that lie with Clark Kents dual heritage, where he belongs, who he is as a person, this film is one of the biggest creative failures in recent memory.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Man of Steel 10/10,I am a big superman fan and luckily got a chance to see its early screening and believe me it was a brilliant movie. I had very high expectations from the movie and this film has completely exceeded my expectation. The visual effects and action sequences in the movie are actually the best I have ever seen. It easily overcomes The Avengers in every single way and will for sure emerge as a big blockbuster film at the box office. I don't know why the critics are saying that it focused more on the action than on clark kent's character. It was completely balanced in all ways. Its a must watch movie for every one and in my opinion its not only the best movie of this summer but also the best comic book movie of all time. And yes with a better score also put in by Hans Zimmer. 10/10,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A nice Superman movie...,"After the last epic fail movie of Superman, ""Superman Returns"" which i did not like came out this movie which I think that it was a great movie, with good visual effects and the nice interpretation of Henry Cavill who plays as Clark Kent / Kal-El (Superman).""Man of Steel"" is a really good movie which shows us with different perspective the life of Superman and his evolution from Clark Kent to Kal-El and then Superman. I also liked in this movie that showed us how the life of Clark Kent changed and many times with many details. That was something that I found it really good because it did not leave gaps in the film and also in the story of Superman in general.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Then also it is a good movie with a nice story-line. better than previous one... hold a good grip through out the movie, a viewer never gets bored and the sequences are good.

Shadow of Christopher Reeve Will Always Be a Problem,"This is by no means a disaster. Not the hideous turky in a cape that some would have us believe. The first 40 mins is some of the best visualization of the Superman lore that I have ever seen. Unfortunately it is when the 'fully grown' Supes is established that the film began to lose me.The biggest problem is that Chris Reeve made the role of Superman so iconic that no matter who steps into those red boots and no matter who films them, the memory of the 70s/80s Reeve Superman dwells in our Brainiacs. Smallville made the wise choice of delaying the costume and cape till the 11th hour and Singer's stab was a dead duck for being a quasi-reboot/sequel mash-up. With this in mind Man of Steel deserves points for comepletely starting afresh and I did like this new Supes but I found myself popping in the Donner DVD when I got home.Also - I worry for the sequel and/or Batman Vs as if we see the Daily Planet Clark in action then the Chris Reeve comparisons will be even more unfavourably prominent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Huge Disappointment!,"So disappointed in this movie. I listened to Kevin Costner and trusted his assessment. I guess he couldn't bash a movie he was in. Way too much brutal force and destruction in this for me. Some call this high action. But it was so senselessly destructive. Chucks of cities destroyed, animals and people had to be swept away in all the blasting of towering buildings. I wanted to get out of this one about half way into it. Ongoing destruction! Admittedly, I'm not an action movie fan, but I love the Iron Man movies. I felt I was doing more analyzing than watching during this monstrosity. It was increasingly annoying to me. What was ever wrong with the Superman we knew! Whether it be George Brent or Christopher Reeves. They where enchanting. The actors were great. It was the storyline that was troubling. My goodness! where was the story! Over and over monotonous plot.

Underrated movie.,"A hugely impressive and entertaining story of arguably the most powerful character in the superhero pantheon (and also one of the biggest pop culture icons), it's clear that the Man of Steel is here to stay. One of the best movies to enter the superhero genre. This movie is very nuanced and has so much heart. Despite the troubling criticism of DC/WB studios, this movie stands apart and is very well made. Henry Cavill does an absolutely phenomenal job in this film and fits the role so well. Henry Cavill does an absolutely phenomenal job in this film and fits the role so well.

Not what I expected but good,"First of all, I absolutely LOVE Henry Cavill! I have been a fan of his since he was on ""The Tudors"". I was so rooting for him to be cast as Christian Grey but that is a different story.I liked the casting of this movie for the most part. Henry Cavill as Superman was obviously a good choice. Even though Superman was not technically human, I felt Henry's portrayal made him seem like someone I could emphasize with. Clark was always trying find where he belonged and what he was meant to do with his life. Something many of us Earth bound people should be familiar with!Both Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner did a wonderful job as the fathers'. Diane Lane was also a great choice as Clark's mom.I didn't care for Amy Adams as Lois Lane though. She was a take charge kind of girl but I found it hard to believe she really had a ""connection"" with Clark Kent. No there wasn't a lot of romance, which was fine, but I think her character shouldn't have taken such an active role in this story.Basically, I felt this film was trying to show the audience more of the history, which I liked.

God awful,"Worst film I have seen in about 10 years. I was originally going to see star trek, but watched this due to the fact some of my party had already seen Star trek into darkness. What can I say? Shallow characters, bad acting, terrible script, long winded hard to swallow fight scenes combined with a storyline that made no sense. It started off alright, Russel Crowe's performance was solid and the storyline seemed good, but then it fell apart, with characters so weak that you didn't even care if they lived or died (sorry Laurence Fishburne & co).Maybe it was due to the fact I kept expecting it to get better but I sat through the whole thing (not to mention that it seemed to go on forever), Cheesy lines and boring fight scenes don't mix. Oh yeah the fight scenes, Jesus, nothing more exciting than seeing two people knock each other through buildings only for them to get up completely unscathed...like 15 times? I get that they have superhuman strength, but surely they should be able to hurt each other?I LOVE films, love sci-fi too but this film is fit for the bin. Can't believe how much positive feedback it's getting. weak =(",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What defines perfection!,"Man of Steel﻿ - I thought it's gonna be like The Amazing Spiderman at first. Same storyline, same plot, and just a little bit fresh look and technology touch up for a new millennial version of a superhero movie. Watching it for the first hour, I was about to give it a solid 4/5, until it went up to such perfection level of watching satisfaction. The storyline was quite impressive, without losing its originality but a better improvement in line. The plotting of the synopsis was done amazingly different than the other versions of Superman we ever saw in the theater. And characteristically, it was perfectly put on such great screenplay. I wasn't sure if Henry Cavill﻿ was a suitable role player with Amy Adams﻿ for the Clark-Loise characters, but through out the movie, they seemed like doing the best as it should. Clark is a good choice. And I can see there's somewhere in the scenes, Tom Welling is never left behind for the heroic role. He resembles him very much. And not to forget, there are some extra credit deserved to this movie, which somehow balanced the movie to its perfection. I even love the arts of its photography. It was full of drama and actions, emotions and everything else needed to be there in a great, legendary film should be. Everything was perfectly there, from the storyline itself, the plotting, the casting, the cinematography, the screenplay, the actions and all the effects, the plus and minus, and the everything.

Disappointing.,"I was ecstatic at the choice of Henry Cavill, following his work ever since I saw him on ""The Count of Monte Cristo"". His chiseled made-for-GQ-cover looks and what-guns-are-you-packing body won't make it difficult for anyone to believe he is worthy of being tagged the Man of Steel.I love Christopher Nolan's work since I first saw ""Memento"" at an indie theater and the fantastic job he did rebooting the Batman franchise. But he's donned the producer's hat for this one and passed the directorial reins to Zack Snyder who I thought did okay on ""300"" but not much else (was NOT fond of ""Watchmen"" and ""Sucker Punch"").The rest of the all-star supporting cast is enough for the price of admission.The anticipation from seeing the first official trailer a year before the movie was set to come out snowballed all the way to the minute I handed my ticket stub.The opening scenes were great, fantastic. Packed with enough action and drama that I started whispering to my teenage nephew how many times did he think we'd go back to watch this again.The non-linear story-telling worked well and it transitioned effectively from current time to flashbacks as the character is slowly revealed.I really wanted to love this movie. Really. But something about it just kept holding me back.Henry Cavill was convincing as the brooding, conflicted man from another planet coming to terms with his alien status. Unfortunately the script didn't give him much substance in terms of dialogue. He seemed more of a ""listener"" and ""observer"" and the bulk of the emotional character background was built through the dialogue of his parents. This made it tough to access the core of his psyche - which is one of the crucial things, I think, that made Christian Bale's ""Batman Begins"" so effective as you follow his journey from man to superhero.The second downer was Lois Lane (Amy Adams) having about as much chemistry with our main guy as marshmallow and ketchup. Their story line felt rushed and could have used a bit more flirting to build up some semblance of anticipation. (Smallville was quite more effective with this but that was helped a lot by the spunkier, self-assured, naughty, carefree Lois version than the plain-jane-trying-to-talk-tough-but-not-really-believable version on this one) Lastly, the fight scenes in the mid to latter stages between hero and villain - while as grand and explosive as you can imagine combat between two clashing megapowers could possibly be - starts to get tedious and overextended that at some point (after dozing into quick microsleep) I muttered ""just finish him already"".It's not as fun (or funny) as the Marvel stuff. It's not as deep or engrossing as the ""Batman"" reboot. It's just stuck in the middle - a victim of its own great expectations.Seeing it once was enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The most underrated superhero movie of all time. Period.,"Honestly, if you rate everything about this movie pound for pound, you can't possibly deny that it's a great piece.Amazing soundtrack, stunning visuals and action sequences, beautiful cinematography, solid acting and some well written dialogue about morale, responsibility and how the World (probably) would react if one or more god level beings would show up at our doorstep.The overall tempo and jumpy story of the movie is one of few points where some of the criticism might be justified, even if I personally don't have any issues with it.Unfortunately for Znyder and WB, Man of Steel got heavily overshadowed by the astronomical expectations set by The Dark Knight trilogy and the success of the early and more lighthearted MCU movies. It's just a question of wrong place at the wrong time.While Man of Steel got some of the most unfair reviews of any superhero movie ever, it has however aged like the finest of wines.

The film explores his alien heritage, his relationship with his adoptive parents, and his conflict with the villainous General Zod, played by Michael Shannon.

"Another disappointing  ""remake"" of Superman 2","After seeing Man Of Steel, I'm still not entirely sure what Chris Nolan's ""big idea"" for Superman was. The film is less a mythic story and more a propulsive study in consistent movement, in a way that will remind people of J.J. Abrams's Star Trek films.The picture starts strong enough, with a prologue set during the final hours of Krypton, as Jor-El (Russell Crowe) spirits his infant son to Earth in the hopes that his son will thrive as his home planet dies. There is a rather off-hand sense of fantasy here, with random flying animals, fantastical production design, and pure gee-whiz action on display. But once Kal-El is on Earth, the film gets choppy and unfocused for the rest of its running time as nonlinear flashbacks of Clark's childhood are intermixed with present-day journeys which leads directly into a third act that takes up the entire second half of the film. The flashbacks themselves are fine and occasionally moving, as Diane Lane and Kevin Costner make a terrific Ma and Pa Kent (kudos for keeping Ma Kent at the center of the story throughout), but the flashbacks seem randomly inserted into the film, with no rhyme or reason in regards to which one appears at what point in the story. Producer Chris Nolan's tendency to explicitly spell out character motivation and themes first rears its ugly head in these early moments, a pattern than continues all the way up until the end.Henry Cavill makes a frankly terrific Clark Kent/Superman when the film actually lets him act. But this is a a film almost completely lacking in scenes where characters actually talk to each other. The emphasis is on over-complicated plot, burdened by the inexplicable need to explain every little plot detail while precious running time drips by.It's a pumped-up, seemingly dumbed-down, and action-packed franchise reboot apparently designed to appeal to the stereotypical mass audiences that allegedly like their blockbusters big and simple. The picture looks great (in 2D at least), with peerless technical credits on every level, and is mostly well-acted. But it is hobbled by a terrible script and a disjointed and rushed story that fails to gel as an emotionally-coherent adventure film. I take no joy in expressing disappointment in a film like this.My grade is 2/10. (just for the CGI).",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Good Watch,"Two things that actually made me go for this movie: First its soundtrack: Hans Zimmer just outdid himself, OST is a MASTERPIECE, fills you with energy until one feel like a superhero.

The emotional attachment between Clark and his foster parents was portrayed well (kudos to Hans Zimmers music to make it realistically emotional)What the movie lacks: The plot overall, didn't have much of a grip. The movie was released in IMAX 3D print too, but I hardly remember any substantial 3D effects or any IMAX footage.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

After viewing the movie last night, I had kind of the same feeling. It was like Superman and Superman II all mashed together. I would have rather seen an entire movie of Superman being brought up by the Kents, growing up in Kansas and discovering his powers. As it turns out, that was the smallest part of the movie.The movie focuses much time on the back story in Krypton, and then a huge war on earth with General Zod. The entire story of Superman growing up in Kansaas is just a few rushed scenes viewed from flashbacks.The casting of Superman however is perfect. Henry Cavil is amazing as Superman.

Superman & Zod from Krypton to give us a BEST OF BOTH WORLDS (Both a superb SF film with the Superhero element)I truly LOVE this film.It's one of DC's & Zack Snyder's VERY BEST films.I keep returning to it each & every year & of it's type it's damn near
perfect...The start retraces yet again Supes ORGIN STORY (Thank the Heavens James Gunn isn't once again giving us another origins of Superman story, interesting cast on this newer one to come but I doubt it will beat this cast / film version)This is hugely ENTERTAINING.Now I get that it's tonally different to ANY previous SUPERMAN films.I happen to also LOVE the Christopher Reeves Superman films (especially 1 & 2, with a soft spot for 3 also) and it's true if you want something softer, which gives a closer account to the original Superman / Clark Kent from the comics then THIS is the one to go see, they're superb films in their own rights...What's the point in remaking them like this when these were also (in their own way) kinda nearly perfect.THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT, harder, more SF Superman film & Synder kicked a

I think so but the ratings would suggest otherwise, I'll touch on those & Synder in general in a moment) as with others here...I cannot believe this movie does not rate higher than the current 7.1 score (I guess many a Snyder hater has brought this rating down) but it's surely an 8 at worst & for folks like me who can simply see past whoever directed it (although Snyder clearly brought is A-GAME to this one) it's a 9 bordering on an actual, almost perfect '10'So...JACK SNYDER as director.There is NO DOUBT certain director's have their own style, JJ Abrams has his critics also but if a films a GOOD ONE that it shouldn't be hated on JUST BECAUSE So & So directed it.They'll always be GOOD FILMS (perhaps GREAT FILMS as I think this one rates) OK films & just downright AWFUL one's made by the same directors.This for me personally rates as Snyder's VERY BEST.IMDb thinks not (fair enough) and those that beat this 7.1 for ""MAN of STEEL"" are creditable & even a close match for this one.It looks like most consider it a very close call as to which of Snyder's films RATES the BEST...Both ""WATCHMEN"" & ""300"" rating 7.6.Of these two I prefer the more inventive Watchmen, but how can one not find '300' impressive in it's way, certainly worthy of being his 2nd & 3rd BEST MOVIES in my list.I also enjoyed ""JUSTICE LEAGUE"" (the original cut) but it seems Synder was a bit put out that HIS VERSION didn't really see the light of day until in more recent times (I have NOT YET seen this version) and it seems it now rates as one of his very best...GOOD NEWS for me as I kinda liked the original with you know who taking over as director.Others I've liked from him...""DAWN OF THE DEAD"" rating 7.3 an early (might have been his first?) movie which surprisingly worked well as a more modern ZOMBIE film.One that doesn't get too much LOVE, perhaps because it is SO DIFFERENT is ""SUCKER PUNCH"" yes there are scences within it that are a bit BLAH but the overall look & feel of the film works (for me) only rates 6.1 though.Of late his films seem to be NOT SO GOOD...""BATMAN v SUPERMAN"" was a bit of an overblown mess, especially when compared to this film.""ARMY of the DEAD"" is also a bit of mess.And although I have yet to see any of the REBEL MOON films, many that have seen these also, seem to feel he's lost his unique touch & that these are inferior Star Wars or even DUNE copies (at best) which is a shame!I don't mind ZACK SNYDER one little bit.Is he one of my favourite DIRECTOR's? Not really, has he made a number of poor films? YES, no one's perfect, but he's also made ONE OF THE GREATEST Science Fiction / SUPERHERO movies I think there's EVER BEEN & this is it & if the next incarnation of Superman is to surpass this one of Henry Cavill and / or Christopher Reeves than that's a SUPERMAN film I cannot wait to see but surely he will need to be very different from these two.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I don't like superhero-movies, but this one was great!","For me, DC or Marvel-movies usually equals a lot of CGI and destruction, and 'Man of Steel' certainly has its share.Usually I get bored midway through the mayhem between good and evil, whether it's a city, a civilisation, a planet or half the universe that is threatened by usually a CGI-villain with a grudge or plan. That seem to be the template for these movies.Only a very few of these movies hold my attention from beginning to end. 'Captain America and the Winter Soldier' is one. 'Man of Steel' is another.The cast is top tier. Russel Crowe, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams. Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner, it doesn't get more A-list than that. Throughout, several emotional beats are placed and the beautiful score by Hans Zimmer accompanies both the action and the quieter scenes very well.Not much surprised me about the story here. It's basically 'Superman 1978' on steroids and with more explosions, but it was the combination of visuals, sounds, music and great acting from the leads, that really made me think that there will probably never be a more complete version.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"TRULY HORRIBLE, i want to forget this was ever made.","I have never written a review on IMDb ever before, but this movie was so bad i just had to.I cant believe how many people actually seemed to like this movie.I have always been a fan of the superman movies, and i had been looking forward to this one...boy was i wrong.The list is almost endless, but in short; I felt no connection to any character, nor did i care who lived or died, just truly horrible storytelling on all accounts, thats not an opinion, that is a fact.Endless fight scenes that does nothing to carry the story along.Sure the VFX was good (i create effects for a living), but of course when producers have the money to hire the best effects people, thats what you get... But it does not save this movie in any way.This was truly a horrible movie, in fact it was so bad i felt physically ill and embarrassed for sitting there having paid for the ticket. But now i am just angry.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"CGI bedlam, but some great moments","When Superman takes on the three Kryptonians in Superman II, I could keep track of the action comfortably. In MOS, the CGI is so chaotic it is difficult to know where to look. It's a shame, because this film has some great moments. Costner and Crowe as the twin fathers are perfect, Adams emails her usual reliable performance, while Cavill puts his own spin on Superman. No one will ever replace Reeve, but this iteration is pretty damn good 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is the greatest Superman movie ever created and is an absolutely must see.,"Man of Steel (2013) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows the fall of Krypton, a baby arriving on Earth, his adoption and his rise to becoming Superman. Unfortunately for him aliens from his home world have arrived on Earth looking for Superman for revenge for the actions of his father back on Krypton. Can Superman stop multiple beings with the same powers as him?This movie is directed by Zack Snyder (300) and stars Henry Cavill (The Witcher), Michael Shannon (Take Shelter), Amy Adams (The Fighter), Russell Crowe (Gladiator), Diane Lane (The Outsiders), Kevin Costner (Dances with Wolves) and Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix).This is easily the best ever Superman film. The depiction of Krypton is perfect and the best in a live action or animated movie. The relationships are so well established and the backstory is brilliantly depicted while we see the struggles and progressions of Superman in real time. I adored the relationship of Clark and Louis and the fight scenes between Zod and Superman were magnificent.This is the greatest Superman movie ever created and is an absolutely must see. I would score this a 9.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic movie despite the critics hate,"At first I was nervous to go see this movie. The critics hated it for the most part. Honestly, I can understand why. The story wasn't the focus of this movie. Zack Snyder's movies are all about visual interest. Nolan, I think, on the other hand is about story and realism.I was interested in the beginning to see how they would balance it out. I think critics had this idea it would be like the batman movies mixed with the Avengers. It's not really. It's a visual masterpiece. Well, maybe masterpiece is a strong word to use, but the visual special effects are amazing. I personally think they are the best I have ever seen. If you are going to see this movie, realize that you are going to see a movie with a ton of special effects and they are the thing Snyder cares about the most.The movie does a back and forth between the past and present day. Nolan really takes over the story when it shifts to the past. The past drives the current story and it does it well I believe. Without spoiling anything, the past shows why Clark Kent has become the man he is today and it doesn't hold much back. There is going to be a large battle scene at the end, the critics noted it was over 20 minutes long. It probably was, but I like to think it was well done. Critics, and a lot of people have an issue with the ending, once again not to spoil anything, it gets dark. I think people expected this to be a super kid friendly movie, it's not. I don't know what gave people this idea, but with Zack Snyder and Nolan working together, you had to expect it to be a darker, more realistic movie.Could the story have been better? Maybe. But for what that movie was, it was the perfect story for it. Could the special effects been better? No way. That's really what you're going for.It's a good story, nothing phenomenal, but a great looking movie. It's not a kids movie and you shouldn't expect it to be. It deals with how people have to make choices and the lines are never black and white and where that grey is, is what makes Man of Steel a great superhero movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
DC HAS MADE A GOOD START,"This movie is a good superhero movie, in the same time it has a great science fiction part. It goes fast everytime. Flashback sequences are awesome. There are some points which is not make sense like Zod's breathing on Earth. Also, even though movie's fast tempo is a great thing, in second part it goes so so fast and you cant figure out whats going on clearly and thats not cool. But I can say, Man of Steel is a great beginning for DCEU and Henry Cavill fits Superman role excellently.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fast paced action and visually appealing,"I have been a fan of Zack Snyder's work and when I heard he would be filling the director's shoes for Superman, I was excited. Man of Steel works at many levels. A solid story that starts from Krypton and ends at our world. One is made to feel like a Kryptonian more than a Earthling and the screenplay is very natural. I felt that the pacing was quite good and there was never a dull moment. The action is thick and realistic and you can expect a lot of destruction and havoc, but still befitting for a Superman movie. The casting was apt and Henry Cavill and Russel Crowe are the standouts but I will credit Zack for this movie's success and I hope WB persist with him for the sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""It's not an 'S'. On my world, it means 'hope'.""","Man of Steel is a reboot of the Superman film franchise, directed by Zack Snyder with a story by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, director of The Dark Knight trilogy. It stars Henry Cavill in the title role of Superman/Clark Kent, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Michael Shannon as General Zod, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, and Russell Crowe as Jor-El.Man of Steel retells the origin story of Superman, from baby Kal-El's birth on the doomed planet Krypton, to his earliest beginnings as Superman, the protector of Earth. The story moves at a leisurely pace so nothing is ever too slow, but not so quick that you would miss important information.One of my favourite things about Man of Steel is how it manages to balance a thoughtful, complex narrative with kinetic, effects-driven action. For me, action and story are two very important elements in a superhero movie, and Man of Steel has plenty of both.Henry Cavill manages to give everybody's favorite blue Boy Scout some depth to balance out his mega-powered persona. I'm sure some were hoping for a little more smiling but it didn't bother me too much, as this is an origin story, after all. Cavill and Adams had a fun dynamic as well. They play off each other as well as you'd hope from one of pop culture's most popular romantic pairings. Michael Shannon's Zod is a menacing foe, and one with a complex history, making him a worthy adversary to Superman. Russell Crowe's Jor-El is an interesting character to watch; he has the silkiest voice, and it's fun to hear him speak all mythically.Another thing I enjoy about this movie is Hans Zimmer's music. His theme for the movie is somber, with a hint of hopefulness hinting at Clark's eventual turn into Superman. As for the action scenes, all the CGI is stellar, explosions are plentiful, and the final showdown in Metropolis is one for the ages.One thing that may turn off Superman purists is the darker tone than what we've come to expect from this kind of character. It is haunting at times, but it doesn't bug me to the extent it does some people. You should be able to form your own judgment when watching the movie easily.Man of Steel: a fun, thoughtful movie that may turn off purists, but should satisfy newcomers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
For the critics who wrote bad reviews about MOS! This is absolutely a great movie!,"I have read some critics here, the great, the good, the so so, and the bad ones. I understand everyone has right for his opinions, and I certainly understand some people have high standards. But what I get out of these negative reviewers is they are just haters. Haters are going to be haters. No other ways to put it.First of all, when you walk into a theater to watch a blockbuster movie like MOS, what do you expect. Anyone who has seen the trailers should pretty much guess the story line, because general Zod's name was mentioned. So for these people to expect great story line completely blow their mind, they are simply asking for way too much. After all, superman's story has been told SO many times, there are certain things you simply can't just change. I think this movie did a great job to add some novelties to the character.Secondly, for those complain about too much fighting scene, imagine this really happens in a large city like New York or Chicago. You expect Zod will take it easy simply because it's earth? The whole point of this movie is to make it believable, we are not living in a world of 1970's any more. Things have to follow real law of physics if they want to look real. If superman can fly faster than a bullet, this is what he should fly like, not just floating in the air, so people can see how he flies. If you want to do that, go back to see the superman from 1978. That's the year you should have never grow out of. Unfortunately, this is 2013. I hate people give low scores to a film simply because they can without justifying the score while brag about their intelligence. I don't see any of that intelligence showing from their reviews at all.Finally, like every movie, this movie has its flaws, I think the kissing scene was way too sudden after all the big fights, it was not very convincing they would feel such a strong urge to kiss each other rather than looking for survivors. But again, as much as I liked Revengers, how much fighting scenes in that movie was believable? Blackwidow kicking ass using a hand gun against flying aliens, yeah, that really made sense! The point is, sometimes, you just need to throw all your prejudice out of the window and treat the film with respect, and learn to enjoy it. If with an open mind, it still turns out to be a bad movie, then by all means. I think this is a solid 9/10 superhero movie deserves better reviews.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good CGI. More acting would be better.,"Snyder is good, for sure. But all his movies have a sameness about them. Long, drawn out fight scenes, with lots of things smashing and blowing up, tonnes of CGI. While this is what the audience wants, other superhero movies like Batman and Spider-man have more dialogue and character development, to balance out the huge fight scenes. Superman, Avengers and Justice League movies are all so over the top it gets a bit tedious. Story > effects. That's why the original Star Wars is still such a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best movie of 2013 & one of the best superhero movies of all time!,"Man of Steel is a movie about the origins of Clark Kent/Kal-El(Henry Cavill). When their planet Krypton is on the verge of destruction, Kal's parents, Jor-El(Russell Crowe) & Lara Lor-Van(Ayelet Zurer) send him to Earth on a spaceship along with Codex, which is something that contains the DNA of every unborn Kryptonian. Clark lands on Earth & is raised on a farm in Kansas by two loving parents, Jonathan(Kevin Costner) & Martha Kent(Diane Lane). However, when Clark is old enough, Jonathan tells him that he's an alien & believes that he was sent here for a reason & even if it takes him his whole life, Clark owes it to himself to find out what that reason is. So, Clark goes on a journey to find out who he really is. When Clark saves Lois Lane(Amy Adams), she is amazed by his abilities & wants to know more about him. Meanwhile, another Kryptonian called General Zod(Michael Shannon) finds out that the Codex is on Earth along with Kal-El. He lands on Earth & tells everyone that they are either supposed to give him Kal-El or he's going to destroy the entire planet. Now, it is up to Superman to either do as Zod says & turn himself in or, save the day!Man of Steel was an outrageously spectacular & epic film! The special effects were mind blowing, especially in 3D. I must say that I loved Superman's new suit & I'm glad that he's not wearing his iconic red underwear. After the last couple of Superman films were huge disappointments, I was really hoping that this reboot would rejuvenate the Superman franchise. With Zack Snyder hired to direct & Christopher Nolan coming on board as the producer, Warner Bros. & DC were already halfway there. So, my expectations were pretty high. This movie did not disappoint! It surpassed my expectations by a huge margin. This is the best movie of 2013, so far. I think it's also going to be the best summer blockbuster of this year. The action in this movie is surreal, visually stunning & mind numbingly brilliant. Each fight scene between Superman & General Zod, Faora-Ul(Antje Traue) and the other enemies had me on the edge of my seat. Henry Cavill has done a spectacular job as Clark Kent/Superman. For me, he's even better than Christopher Reeve as Superman. Amy Adams is outstanding as Lois Lane. She's not just your average damsel in distress, she also helps Superman a lot. Michael Shannon is great as baddie, General Zod. Kevin Costner is mind blowing as Jonathan Kent. Diane Lane is impressive as Martha Kent. Laurence Fishburne is hilarious as Perry White. Russell Crowe is great as Jor-El. Antje Traue & Ayelet Zurer are effective as Faora-Ul & Lara Lor-Van respectively. I would like to conclude by saying, Man of Steel is an outstanding film. Even if you are not a fan of the comics, you will still love this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What happens when the filmmakers don't like their main character.,"Man of Steel is a depressing example of what happens when a studio decides it would be profitable to make a movie based on a pre-existing franchise without any appreciation or love for the franchise itself. It's obvious in watching interviews with the producers and director, that they think Superman is lame and cheesy and needed to be made cool again. Unfortunately the person trying to make him cool is Zack Snyder who has a somewhat juvenile sense of social interaction and ethics.As an example, in the movie Clark destroys a man's big rig because the man harassed a waitress and poured a beer on Clark. It's clear in the film that we are supposed to accept this as a just punishment for the man's actions. It's meant to be cathartic. We're supposed to cheer at the justice of the situation. However, what Clark did was terrible. He did a really bad thing. He destroyed hundreds of thousands of dollars in property and ruined this man's livelihood out of revenge. Revenge can be a cathartic experience for the viewer, but it's not the right thing to do. It's just the emotionally satisfying thing to do. Heroes are heroes because they do the right thing despite their emotion. Now, fanboys will argue that this is a young Superman just learning his moral code. However, this misses the point. The filmmakers themselves thought that this form of revenge was a good thing. Superman isn't learning his code. He's implementing it.It's such a cynical film you can practically hear the boardroom meeting that spurred its creation. The words, ""modern,"" ""dark,"" and ""gritty"" must have been said hundreds of times. The film is desaturated because bright colors are too campy and light. The opening is one long action scene because the creators thought we'd get bored just watching people talk. They need to talk while a war is happening behind them! Superman can't have red trunks because they're ""silly."" Ignore the fact that the film is riddled with silly nonsense. It's dark and gritty silly nonsense so it's cool I guess.Now people like to throw around the word, ""realistic"" sometimes to describe movies like this. This is a Hollywood marketing gimmick that they've unfortunately fallen for. This movie is shot almost entirely with a hand-held camera and features a significant amount of bouncing and snap zooms. This is meant to subconsciously evoke the feel of news footage from the audience. The color is desaturated to remind us of 9/11 and WWII footage. This is simply an aesthetic trick. Nothing about the film itself is more realistic in tone or content. None of the characters act or talk like real people. Things happen just because they need to happen in this type of movie. Zod could have won easily but he gives a cheesy villain speech that has been the downfall of so many movie characters. Lois appears places seemingly randomly just to hear or espouse expository dialogue. She loves Superman because she's the girl in the movie. They kiss because market research dictates that more people will buy the film if there's a romance subplot. There's no in universe explanation for why they would like each other. They have no apparent common interests or personality traits. They get together because they do in all the other versions we've seen. That's it. Why is Superman going to the Arctic? Cuz the ship is there and he needs to find it to talk to Jor-el and get the suit and send the signal that starts the invasion. Things just needed to happen for script reasons. Character motivation is irrelevant.Basically this movie is a marketing scam. They know that people will buy it because it's the most recognizable superhero in a day of very successful superhero films. They didn't know how to sell it so they made a generic alien invasion action movie full of one-dimensional characters and gave them the look and name of Superman characters. It's loud, it's dull, it's boring, and it's full of melodrama in an effort to convince us that it has themes and heart. I'd give it a zero if I could. Please don't support movies that have such little faith in the audience and put forth so little effort in actual story telling.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Man of Steel & The Avengers Tied for best Super Hero movie,"Man of Steel is the reason why I take movie critic reviews with a grain of salt (I accept their review as a personal opinion but there are too many variants at play that I always wait till its mass release to see what the common folks have to say about it)in this case I couldn't wait I saw it a day early in the Thursday night sneak preview, this Man of Steel is for Superman Films what the Star Trek 2009 Reboot was for Star Trek show and prior films, the story is there but just slightly different enough to make it fresh and more realistic to make it less corny, this is a serious Superman coming to terms since his childhood that he is different and those thoughts are reinforced by his earth father Jonathan Kent because of fear that he would become a government lab experiment, Clark has to endure bully's pushing around and insults, so needless to say for him to break out of that shell it is difficult he's a quiet man that for many years has learned not to bring attention to himself and to just blend and never stand out. that's my take on why he's not a humorous man, the action in this film trumps The Avengers and those who complain that there was too much destruction and that Superman is always conscious of not destroying buildings per the comics need to understand that this is the very beginning of Superman, great acting from everybody, I give it a solid 10 Stars no doubt about it",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This Movie Would Not Allow Me to Like It,"It did so many things right.

The fight sequences were suitably huge and bombastic... all in all, this movie didn't make very many mistakes. But... the one mistake it DID make was so pervasive that I could not leave the theater NOT hating Man of Steel. EVERY SINGLE SECOND of this movie is shot in shaky-cam, pretentious, ""realistic-o-vision."" Editing the movie to look like it was filmed on an iPhone is OK for maybe ONE or TWO action scenes. Maybe a long shot or 2 as well. It is unnecessary and unforgivable in a scene where 2 people are standing still and speaking to one another, and even worse if it is every single frame of the movie. Add to that the bizarre use of intentionally blurring foreground and background to give the impression it was filmed by 1970's camera technology as opposed to the state of the art digital cameras we KNOW they used. It is a baffling (and ugly and stupid) choice of visual aesthetic, and was SO overused it never stopped being annoying. So, 2 out of 10. If petit-mal camera doesn't bother you...

ZACK SNYDERS FINEST HOUR!,"First off 7.1 is painfully low a rating for what is still DCU's best superhero movie. Secondly if you're a none superman fan or a fan of the new 52 comics you'll love snyders vision of the character.Being a true fan (read the graphic novels) I can understand why die hard fans don't like this take. Superman is traditionally a more wholesome, moralistic and optimistic character but Snyder offers the other arc which is more nihilistic.Henry Cavill is pitch perfect as supes and Clark, and shouldn't be compared to Christopher reeve, given the era and version he played. Amy adams is likeable enough and captures the right amount of spunky sass of Lois, as is Michael Shannon as zod bringing the menace to his otherworldly denizen.The action set pieces are well put together, with some nice VFX as well. A must mention is zimmers score: exhilarating, grandiose and even uplifting at times.Just to address the main bone of contention and fallacy that has outraged a huge section of fans - ""superman doesn't kill"" FALSE! Throughout superman's storied history he HAS killed and more than once. Given the tone/arc Snyder took for the character this is more than appropriate it's just a question of where your tastes lie.It's a travesty that Cavill didn't get to play the character again for a sequel But given the hate received for the above mentioned point I believe put the brakes on it ever happening.

Neck Snapper,"Apparently, this isn't a film you watch from the 2nd row in a crowded theater. I got a good view up Superman's cape but it was hard to keep up with the action since I was less than 20 feet away from the screen. Anyway, from what I was able to surmise, Man of Steel as a story is a disappointing addition to the stable of Superman movies. Perhaps it's just the character. I'm a Batman fan and I think the world is subdivided on Superman vs. Batman lines, so maybe I'm being unfair ... but I doubt it. Anyway, from a visual standpoint, it was spectacular. The action and particularly the fighting sequences with Faora-Ul, Tor-An, General Zod and Superman are incredible. How Metropolis is supposed to rebuild itself after the super-being Armageddon should be a documentary unto itself.I wrote about this elsewhere: You know a movie is in trouble when the film creators have a harder time asking you to suspend your disbelief about the relationships and drama between characters than scientifically unsound principles commonly found in superhero movies. It felt like Lois Lane was shoehorned into parts of the film where she had no reason to participate. I'm sure it was to create some sort of early emotional connection between her and Clark, but it felt awkward and unnecessary. Amy Adams should have been a miscast, but since the Lane character wasn't really working, I suppose it didn't matter that she played the role. That's not a dig at Amy, it's just an unfortunate side effect of a poorly formed role. On the flip side, Michael Shannon as General Zod was brilliant. He's such a malevolent looking character when he furrows his brow and curls his lip. I thought his final pre-fight invective was very well written and played. It took the edge off Zod's evil and exposed him as more of a relentless, unsympathetic warrior.I thought that the periodic flashbacks to Clark's formative years was a good instrument for building a better understanding of his character. It was formulaic to be sure, but the method of delivery was intriguing. Having said that, the film lost me a few times. It definitely tried to pack in a lot of material even though the film's run time was long. That's something I think is partially unavoidable in superhero movies. With interweaving story lines that span years, it's hard to simplify them into a single film even if the focus is on only one aspect of the character's tale.In all, I think Man of Steel is worth watching at least once for its sheer summer blockbuster value. If you like big special effects, and wanton destruction, you'll enjoy this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Man of Steel is a action packed yet flawed Superman movie,"Man of Steel is a action packed yet flawed Superman movie.Man of Steel centers around Clark Kent who is an alien sent to earth as a baby by his father Jor El after his home planet Krypton explodes.Clark spends most of his time in hiding until General Zod, a prisoned kryptonian criminal comes to earth looking for him as Zod plans to turn earth into Krypton using a world engine.Clark must now stop Zod from terraforming the earth as Superman.When I heard they were doing a reboot of the Superman franchise it didn't really shock me.Mostly because the last few Superman movies weren't exactly a whole lot to write home about with Superman 4 (1987) being a disaster due to its low budget and the underwhelming Superman Returns (2006) which wasn't bad but not exactly really exciting either.Man of Steel however manages to be a more actioned pack but also a little more dreary.The movie starts off on Krypton where we see the typical events of Joe El sending Kal El aka Superman to earth but they add a little more to make it more exciting. Like having there being a war while the planet was getting ready to explode and having Jor El actually fighting General Zod which I liked.I will admit there is a little too much going on in it though because not only is there a war happening but also they have other things happening like them explaining that Kal El is the last natural Kryptonian birth and him having something called the codex embedded into him.Which I guess is also interesting but because you can tell they're trying to rush through the Krypton scenes so we can get to the main earth scenes it feels a little rushed.In fact the whole 1st act where they tried to tell Superman's origin again is kind of all over the place because after the krypton scenes they cut to Kal El (now Clark Kent) as a adult which was kind of weird as I was expecting them to go over all the stuff that happens to him in as a kid/teenager in a cohesive straight forward story but instead they just randomly flashback to his childhood every so often which was really distracting.Thankfully as soon as we get to the 2nd act they stop doing that and the movie straight up just becomes an action movie with Superman fighting the kryptonians which was much better.In fact all the action in this movie is amazing. A huge improvement over Superman Returns (2006), a movie that definitely lacked that.I will admit though the characters and plot fall a little flat at times.I don't know if it's because the 1st act of the movie was kind of all over the place but all the characters in the movie feel a standard.Like they're not bad or anything just okay.Mostly because there's not a whole lot of sense of joy or fun in this movie save for a couple of scenes which I guess makes sense considering the plot but it also makes the movie feel a bit lacking too.The camera work in this movie is also terrible with a lot of shaky cam which I'm not a big fan of. I mean the camera even shakes when there just talking and it's really distracting/annoying.Still though this movie is a lot more entertaining than Superman Returns (2006) due to all the action and I can see why it has its fans.I just wish the movie was better constructed (Especially in the 1st act) and the characters were a little more upbeat.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Computer Graphics Go a Step Too Far,"I have loved comic book characters since I was 7 years old. I collected every kind of comic book possible and I still have them all, 37 years later. I was delighted when Marvel decided to get into the movie making business. The time was right and computer effects were cheap enough to create stunning movies which could be faithful to the stories they were reliving.And stunning they were, in true comic book style, as they concentrated on character development which is all important in this kind of story.An unfortunate trend has begun in the last year or two. Because anything is possible in CGI the movie makers attempt to make bigger and bigger spectacles, relying on the crutch of physically impossible action sequences, tumbling buildings and explosions to keep momentum going. This was very evident in Iron Man 3 which I disliked, and it's plain to see again in Man of Steel. The few attempts to evoke emotions from the audience were back-slappingly funny (Kevin Costner, you know what I am talking about).About 3/4 of the way through, I realized I was thoroughly bored with the commotion and I yearned for some humour and plot development. It was obvious none would be forthcoming. I am afraid despite the high scores people are giving this film, it's a real dud.I hope this recent trend to appeal to the lowest common denominator ends soon and that movie makers go back to what really gets people talking about a movie: the story.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Superman Movie,One of the most underrated films of the decade. Breath-taking visuals and action ahead of its time for a Comic film. For me the film hits on all cylinders. I believe this film gives us the most realistic adaptation of Superman and what he's truly capable of. Michael Shannon's performance as General Zod is phenomenal and I don't think they could've chosen a better actor for the role. To cap it all off Hans Zimmer delivers another masterpiece of a score to make this film one of my favorites of all-time.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good enough,"Well made and infinitely better than Zack Snyder's previous disaster Sucker Punch, the film has a great start on Krypton and then hits some narrative bumps as it shows us flashbacks of Clark's childhood. It's a bunch of vignettes that show us only the important stuff that shaped Clark into the man he will become. Being spoon-fed this origin content is basically pointless, as the Clark Kent we see all grown up fighting for what he believes in and protecting what he believes in speaks volumes and we can come to the conclusion about his back story ourselves. The usually reliable Amy Adams makes a not very believable Lois Lane and while she's not bad by any means, she comes across miscast. Henry Cavill fits the bill and is a strong enough presence on screen, where the previous Clark Kent in the unsuccessful Superman Returns Brandon Routh was like watching a black hole on screen. The action is miles over the top, with some great effects leveling Metropolis. A minor gripe is some soul deadening overt product placement that cheapens some scenes. Fighting in IHOP, 7-11, SEARS - I'm glad to know the fictitious city of Metropolis has the same annoying franchises. The action climaxes for about 20 minutes too long and becomes disaster porn and watching the 50th skyscraper crumble becomes a bit monotonous, but overall Man of Steel is a good watch and the money spent is clearly on screen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I just didn't care what happened to the characters,i just had no reason too,this jumping back & forth to explain current events,it just didn't work...I felt nothing for Johnathan Kent, he was just too much of a minor role......probably in it less than 2mins once again....I greatly preferred the previous ""superman returns"", i cared about what happened, Lex Luthor seemed bit odd but i got used to him..it mattered.....Lois was sexy & hurt that he left...it mattered it had mystery........man of steel? not for me, just for kids or people who don't really understand depth of film.....if u like avengers (puke) u may like this.....tho avengers was worse,i cant think of anything worse than that......just Cuz it has a lot of action doesn't make it good......",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Movie,Good movie does not stack up with Donner's Superman but good. Needs a better soundtrack and the costume could have brighter colors.The biggest problem I have with this movie and I had them with Tim Burton's 2 Batman movies is that you killed off a main villain. I would have ended the movie with Zod being sent back to the Phantom Zone without having his neck snapped thus leaving it open for Zod to return.The soundtrack was OK but you need to respect John Williams. I know they were going for organic and wanted nothing to do with Superman The Movie but even the Bond movies changed actors but kept the theme music that has been around since Dr. No. I am tired of the origin being retold and redone. I would have opened the movie up with the John Williams theme with images of comic book pages with the credits flashing out or something.It has taken me 3 years to enjoy this movie and after seeing Dawn of Justice I see Man of Steel in a whole new light and liked it very much.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Man Of Mayhem,"Like his watchmen and 300, Snyder's vision only includes the visuals and violence.
His compulsion to put ideas before any heart or emotion costs him again.
Yes it's watchable, it's visuals are great, the action, the score, is phenomenal.
Especially the action. But Snyder fails to keep a grip on the story rendering it uneven for most parts and only seems to have a grip when the action begins or the visuals enroll. He tries and just passes to make a competent film overall, but we expected better in terms of character and story maybe he isn't the right one for the job

Yuk...,"OK, since I am late to the game I will review briefly. Special effects 10/10. Story 4/10 (and I'm being generous). I swear, I just don't understand how they can make a movie like this since there was ample examples in the past on how to do it and how not to do it.I don't even know where to start at how bad the story was. Leave it at that. About the only thing I can say positive was that the writer(s) tried something different. Makes me wish I had gone into the movie business if this crap is considered good. And I like pretty much every prior iteration of Superman, the comics, the old and new TV shows, the first few of the Christopher Reeves movies.Update: I have watched this a few more times over the years and I bumped up my rating from 5 to 6.

Characters void of character.,"I fell for the buildup hype so much that I went to the ""just after midnight"" sneak-peek. And after the film was done, I was left with one suspicion - that the reason there weren't more characters in the film is because David S. Goyer (screenplay) must have run out of cardboard from which to cut them.Action movie fans may like the action sequences in this film. But I felt no sympathy for any character. It was almost as if I was watching an old-style movie about zombies ... trudging through their roles until the movie reached its conclusion. Normally, I doze off during soulless films like this.

The Superman We Deserve!,"I had the privilege to see Man of Steel a little early and let me say it does not disappoint plus we quite possibly get the best movie of the summer and the best Superman since the 1978 Christopher Reeve classic.The plot is as follows: A young boy discovers he has powers and not of this earth, so as a young man he must discover where he came from and why he was sent here while along the way saving the world from annihilation and becoming the symbol of hope for all mankind.The Man of Steel completely reshapes the way we see Superman from the ground up in a way that feels new and fresh. We of course owe this to director Zach Snyder and writer/producers Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer.The film stars Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman who makes the role his own along with everyone else in the cast that includes Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Diane Lane, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne, and Russell Crowe. All these actors are phenomenal and have a good dynamic together that really shows particularly with Cavill and Adams who are dynamite together.This movie is essentially perfection from the ground up for many reasons that include direction, cinematography, casting, screenplay, special effects, pacing, acting, and story. You can tell everybody involved really cares for Superman and want to open up an exciting new mythology for audiences of all ages.The bottom line is watch this movie whether or not your fan of Superman or movies in general.

Unnecessary destruction almost every minute,"""You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be, Clark. Whoever that man is, he's going to change the world."" Jonathan Clark (Kevin Costner)Man of Steel is more explosive than existential. Or in the words of a non-critic leaving the preview: ""There was an awful lot of unnecessary destruction."" My nightmare has come true—maybe the most sacred super hero story is reduced to the rubble that piles up in almost 2 ½ hours of the Superman back story, loaded with mayhem, be it with childhood accidents young Clark Kent must attend to or the bad guys from Krypton playing nasty with earth.You got it: I dislike a surfeit of destruction, and this sci-fi actioner is chock-full of it. Funny thing, though, you'd think director Zack Snyder would avoid images of Metropolis buildings falling down that remind us of 9/11. However, the hours are filled with disintegrating structures and their skeletons that are too similar to the iconic destruction of lower Manhattan a dozen years ago. Anyway, abundant destruction, not enough dialogue.The time spent on Krypton is too much with too little importance for the earth story as Superman's father, Jor-El (Russell Crowe), sends baby Kal-El (Henry Cavil) to our planet. Then more unnecessary time is spent in Kansas as adoptive dad and mom (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) help him determine what kind of a human he'd like to be. ""Unnecessary"" because the heart of the Superman story is his adventures as an adult, which mirror the struggles of simple folk everywhere writ much larger.More waste in the little attention paid to the rich possibilities of challenges with Clark's girlfriend (Lois Lane is played by a competent and not impressive Amy Adams). Lawrence Fishburne brings promise to the role of editor Perry White, a part woefully underused. Michael Shannon as General Zod, very bad guy from Krypton, has so few good lines that any mean looking dude could have played him. That homely bowl haircut, though, is distracting. Diane Lane is a believable and attractive mother, but she can't save this banal adventure by herself.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Superman and space ships. Not good.,"A remake of the Superman origin story.Great casting of Henry Cavill, Michael Shannon and Russell Crowe. Great cameo from Kevin Costner too.

THE GREATEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER MADE! NONE CAN TOP THIS MASTERPIECE!,"""Man of Steel"" stands tall as the pinnacle of superhero cinema, offering a mesmerizing blend of storytelling, character depth, and jaw-dropping action that makes it the greatest superhero movie ever made.Director Zack Snyder's vision is a fresh take on the iconic Superman character. He delves into Kal-El's origins, his struggle to fit into a world that fears his powers, and his transformation into the beacon of hope, Superman. This character exploration adds layers of complexity, making Superman relatable and human.Henry Cavill's portrayal of the Man of Steel is exceptional. His charismatic yet vulnerable performance captures the essence of Superman perfectly. His internal conflict between embracing his powers and protecting humanity resonates with viewers, making his journey all the more compelling.The film's visual effects and action sequences are groundbreaking. The destruction of Krypton, the heart-pounding battles, and the sheer scale of Superman's powers are breathtaking. Hans Zimmer's score complements the visuals beautifully, creating an emotional resonance that elevates the film to epic proportions.""Man of Steel"" challenges the traditional superhero narrative by exploring themes of identity, responsibility, and the consequences of power. It doesn't shy away from the moral complexities of being a hero. The clash between Superman and General Zod forces Kal-El to make difficult choices, highlighting the weight of his decisions.The supporting cast, including Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Michael Shannon as General Zod, and Russell Crowe as Jor-El, deliver standout performances that enrich the film's narrative.Snyder's direction takes bold risks, breaking away from the campy superhero formula. He reimagines the Superman mythos for a modern audience while respecting its iconic legacy. ""Man of Steel"" is a visual and emotional tour de force that immerses viewers in the world of Superman like never before.In conclusion, ""Man of Steel"" stands as a cinematic masterpiece, redefining the superhero genre.

An epic reboot of the most popular comic book superhero...,"Movie Review: ""Man of Steel"" While a superhero movie, Man Of Steel is also a sci-fi drama about an alien sent to Earth and trying to live among us. Unlike the 1978 Superman, it tackles the emotions of Clark Kent a.k.a. Kal-El a.k.a Superman, as we all knew him. The visual effects was awesome and it gives us an out-of-this-world look of planet Krypton and the chaos in Metropolis was way better than that of the Avengers and Iron Man 3 combined. The standouts were Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent. Amy Adams' Lois Lane is just not your usual damsel in distress and Michael Shanon's Zod was also good. The most surprising of all is FAORA, General Zod's disciple. Henry Cavill's Superman fits the Superman of the 21st Century but needs more sense of humor.

The fact that the superhero is not Superman just boosts up the score of much I liked this film. In this film Clark Kent is Kal El who is much better known as the Man of Steel. They spent loads of money on the action scenes which is quite overrated as they weren't as good as other action sequences but still make you jump up with joy and make you feel like flying around the cinema with Kal El during the movie (Even in 3D). At parts Man of Steel does bore you but gets away with it in time for you to get back on track with the movie and follow its circumstances. The plot was very good especially in the end. It has quite a few twists and turns that work in different ways but my favourite one was the one at the very end which I won't spoil in case you are going to see the film soon. The dialogs were very strong especially from Kal – El, General Zod and basically everyone else in this film. Henry Cavill as Kal-El was a good choice and Russell Crowe also does his 20 minutes of the film well but the person who's highly commendable in this film is Michael Shannon as General Zod. He's not the best villain but he does his role as good as it can get.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not much new in this outing of the Last Son of Krypton,"This reboot with Henry Cavill as the titular hero covers the famous Kryptonian orphan's origins, his early life (briefly), and his showdown with renegade General Zod (Michael Shannon), who is planning on 'Krypto-forming' Earth and restarting the lost civilisation using the DNA that was embedded in the infant Kal-El Superman by his father Jor-el (Russell Crowe) just before their home planet exploded. Between Marvel and DC, there is no shortage of CGI-rich superhero films and this one doesn't offer much new. Once again, the villains are almost God-like in their power and come with technology that can do want ever the plot calls for. I didn't like the film's depiction of Krypton - the mix of retro and futuristic, the clunky armour (really trendy these days) and Jor-El's dragon (?) was an awkward blend of styles that looked contrived and forced. The action set pieces went on too long and after while all started to look the same. The cast is fine, despite his Earthly origins, Clavill has a super-hero body and Shannon is OK as Zod (but lacks the supercilious menace of Terrance Stamp's take on the villain in 1978's 'Superman II'). Amy Adams was fine as ever-tenacious reporter Lois Lane (unfortunately Laurence Fishburne was wasted as her boss Perry White) but Russel Crowe outstays his welcome as Jor-El's avatar. The final fights between Superman and, first Zod's hench people, and then the General himself featured lots of destruction but eventually just blurred together. Superhero movies seem to be polarising themselves into grim and pretentious vs. silly and flippant.

Amy Adams is solid as obnoxious modern reporter.

It's not perfect but no modern Marvel film reaches such lofty heights.This is not a documentary biography but a sci fi human tale of young Superman trying to find his purpose in life like many ppl. He suffers from survivors guilt & is more human than god in this film. To state religion has no place in humanity is misguided as religious wars cont now in 2021. I didn't see religious zeal in this story- just a simple overly good father trying to guide an ET to be good instead of easily taking short cuts to be a billionaire or adverse force due to his great powers.So kick back & enjoy this film, both it's old & modern messages; ignore few plot holes.

For example, when Christopher Meloni's character, an Air Force Colonel, refused to force Lois Lane to go with the Kryptonians, it felt believable and just honorable enough without making you roll your eyes. In that scene, Meloni was also indifferent to Superman's fate (""the alien""), so when he later proclaimed ""This man is not our enemy,"" you felt like Colonel had a legitimate change of heart.

I am not the biggest fan of Superman, but I do like the character, and this movie does have what I like about this character.I liked Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman; he was likable, he cared about the people of Metropolis, and he worked together with the public, which is what I like about Superman. They did not put the significant times in his life in the right order, most of them being about him learning his powers and him talking to his dad Jonathan Kent played by Kevin Costner, I just think it should have been put together the right way. Other than that, I liked seeing him learn his powers, figure out who he is, and get his cool looking Superman outfit.Michael Shannon did a respectable job playing General Zod; he was intimidating enough to be a big threat, and I understood his plan to save the planet Krypton by using planet earth as the foundation. Sometimes his performance can be a little over the top, but mostly he gives a satisfactory performance, also I liked some of the interactions with him and Superman when they are arguing about saving or destroying earth for Krypton's sake.The beginning of the movie when we see Krypton, it had a unique design with some interesting technology that would only work on this planet. Superman's real father Jor-El played by Russell Crowe was an excellent choice in role; the interaction between him and General Zod was not bad, but I would have liked more of it. I also liked Amy Adams as Lois Lane; I liked her personality and what she will do for a story working at the Daily Planet, but I wanted more chemistry between her and Superman to show them build their iconic relationship with each other.The action scenes are fun to watch with a fight between Superman and General Zod, and the destruction from it, plus there was a lot of product placement in the fights in Metropolis that can be annoying. Also, the cinematography was pretty with locations like the city, the Kent farm in Kansas, or just in outer space camera shots. Man of Steel (2013) is a good Superman movie with a great actor in the role of Superman, and Zack Snyder who did a respectable job directing with good action and cool scenes that fans of Superman will like and remember.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
HENRY CAVIL THE KING!,"Henry Cavil is an amazing actor! And he was born to play the role, not only does he fit the role of Superman perfectly, he also has admiration for the role. What I loved about him is that he is different, not a lame/goofy superman with trunks and not superman who saves a cat from a tree. He was a dark, serios superman who was willing to kill to protect the people he loves. One of the greatest superhero movie we will ever have, if not the greatest. He was the best Superman we had and the greatest we will ever have! Biggest disappointment that they let Henry Cavil go.

Good but have a few issues,"Overall the movie was pretty good. Im not gonna go into a lot of detail but I will tell you the one thing that stopped this movie from being great.SPOILERS The thing I hated about this movie and a lot of movies recently is the superhero(Superman in this case)is losing almost every single battle they get into. I also saw this in Iron Man 3. Anyway Superman lost pretty much every single fight he got into. He didn't do much fighting until later in the movie but once General Zod and his mineons got to earth Superman lost every battle he was in until the final one against Zod where he just barely pulled through at the very end of the fight. Cals dad said that he grew stronger than he would have because of the earths sun, so if he grew so strong than why could Zod and his minneons so easily beat him up? Also in Iron man 3 in the end of the movie the bad guys were beaten only because the regular citizen helped defeat the bad guys.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
HUGE Disappointment. Just A Bad Film Any Way You Slice It,"The concept and character of Superman has been done to death on the silver screen. Yet, here we go again. Like the character, this movie doesn't know what it wants to be. It is advertised and sold as a piece of summer popcorn entertainment, but tries to be a ""Gladiator"" type film at the same time and ends up being neither. It's overly moody in a bad way. I always like Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner and they did the best he could given the material but that doesn't really equal anything special because their screen time is so brief. Both are gone from the film fast like they were cashing pay checks and their agents promised them they would have to spend more than seven days shooting this awful script. Was I expecting too much given this cast and director? I haven't been this disappointed since Crystal Skull hit like a bad punch to the gut.It was really disappointing. I find it very hard to believe that any intelligent critic truly liked this film. I chalk the few positives up to blind love for the character itself or the flare of Zach Snyder and not his actual work this time around. Most of the critics hate it for a good reason. It's overtly dramatic and tries to play on sympathies that they just don't set up. Character driven? That is the most overused term, thrown around by those who don't know any better. If a character strings together more then four coherent lines people love to label the movie as ""Character driven."" The fact is, the characters aren't developed during this film. The movie is presented in such a hammer-handed fashion that you just want to cringe. It's all dumb video game action all the time. So sad.Bottom line: wait for video. Don't get your hopes up. Some of this is interesting to watch but NONE of it can be classified as high quality in any way. You'll need your fast forward button if you're at all an intelligent movie fan.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
decent,"This was a decent entry in the never-ending series of Superman movies, as it attempts to reboot a never-ending movie series. It starts off well, with the story everyone knows of Krypton exploding and the infant being jettisoned off into space. It varies the theme in Clark's childhood and adolescence as he tries to ""fit in"" with his powers while his adoptive earth father tries to help him. He finally learns how to harness everything as everything ""comes together"" with Lois Lane, etc, in adulthood.This movie relies a little too much on chase scenes and special effects, but it's not too bad.

This time steel beats iron,"I watched man of steel what a fantastic movie it is, this is the best action movie i'll ever seen in my life. This is the best superhero movie of all time just because of its special and visual effects, every thing is just fantastic about this movie such as effects, story, acting, directing, cinematography and so on. It's duration about two and a half hour but when you're see this movie you'll realize that how the time will pass after you watched this movie.There are several reasons to watch this movie, here's a quick list :-1. This is the best superhero movie till date you all admit it after you watched it.2. It contains the best action scenes and special effects.3. All the actors and actress gave peerless performance in it.4. The plot of the movie is never make you bored.5. Directed by ZackSnyder and written by Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer.(we all know these legends and also know what they're capable of)Everything is just perfect about this film like director Zack Snyder, writers Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer and all the star cast. Henry Cavill as Superman/Clark Kent done amazing, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Diane Lane as Martha Kent and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, Laurence Fishburn as Perry White, Russell Crowe as Jor-El and last but not the least Michael Shannon as General Zod. All the actors and actress done peerless performance so does the directors and writers and make the wonderful movie. Man of steel has some epic scenes. Michael Shannon as General Zod done well. I gave 10/10 to this movie and now this is the best action movie till date. After watching it i am came to the conclusion that finally DC > Marvels and this is the epic superhero movie after batman trilogy (nolan's)Man of steel has good visual and special effects so its looks more amazing when you're watching in 3D.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Don't go! a 143 minute film trailer of Dubstep explosions and no plot.,"The first half an hour or so is fantastic. It has all the elements of great sci-fi high fantasy, the effects, of course are spectacular. The actors too, can't really fault them either. By about half way through the film, you've pretty much got your money's worth though and the rest is like being hit in the face and ears repeatedly by Dubstep sound effects and explosions. There is no love, no investment in any of the characters and the failings of this film lie purely with the screenplay which could have been written better by a child and the director who seems to have missed the point of sci-fi fantasy completely. This film has one story line, no twists, no characterisation, no point and no pleasure factor past the first half. The second half seems to go on and on and on and on, never ending explosions and fighting. I love a good fight, don't get me wrong but when you know how the film is going to end and there really isn't any suspense left but you still have to endure another 40 minutes of ear splitting explosions and fists hitting things, it began to actually feel like torture. I was left feeling grief for the amount of time, money and creativity that so many good film industry bods put into what could have been an excellent summer block buster. How could this film end up being SOOOOOO dull? Lois Lane was a massive fail. Amy Adams is a red head for a start and even though I love her and think she's a fabulous actor, this was not the part for her. Lois Lane is an awesome Marvel Character, you could argue that she is as important as Superman himself, her part is crucial and her relationship with Superman is a massive part of any Superman story. In this, the script basically explains the plot, there is no actual acting out of any of the story and Lois Lane is allowed to look like a helpless ditsy girl who gets into dangerous situations that make no sense, I didn't believe her character at all. It wasn't her acting, it was the script and direction at fault, not to mention that she shouldn't have played Lois Lane in the first place. The sound track could have been written by a robot, again, it had all the elements of what could have been really good but then lacked any feeling or emotion. The whole point of the music is to embellish the story and I found my self being irritated by it. So so disappointed. I can watch John Carter and Avengers over and over again, I actually read graphic novels, I love Marvel films in general and I love most things Sci-Fi Fantasy but this was a spectacular waste of money. I've looked up Zak Snyder's other films to date and I really liked 300 but I will avoid him in the future, he just doesn't float my boat.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Reboot of the iconic character thats entertaining with some minor flaws.,"Entertaining , great visuals , and action, the film takes the same story of the original superman films but improves visually on the 1978 classic although this actioner doesnt have the charm of the original and cavill is not quite christopher reeve ,this superman is much darker than reeves version, basically this flick is a remake of superman 1&2 in one movie , its good three quarters of the running time but the ending does let this movie down, 7/10 , it flys but it doesnt quite soar but on the plus side this entry is slightly better than the following sequels batman vs superman : dawn of justice (2016) and justice league (2017) .",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Man of Steel is flat out awful. What a waste of a great cast.,"Yes, Man of Steel is flat out awful. Think worst of the Mummy films meets 300 awful. This pathetic Warner Brothers money grab is pure garbage. Honestly, when CGI stupidity isn't clogging up the screen for the last half of the film, it's boring, poorly paced, with predictable ""twists"" well done enough for the taste of an average eight year old but mature intellects will be crying foul. A big budget wash over Superman Returns without the charm or fun of what we want out of our summer popcorn films. Look past its technical CG precision and you'll get one unusually dumb film. It's a true waste of a great cast.I blame Goyer for the terrible script and Zach Snyder for not being smart enough to polish that bad script enough to deliver anything fun or meaningful. This movie falls into the abyss of most summer movies - excellent advertising for an inferior product. Just think, some people thought they were disappointed by Ryan Reynold's Green Lantern.

Lois Lane is Pam Beesley (The Office) and Clark Kent is Alcide (True Blood),"I couldn't get over how much Amy Adams' portrayal of Lois Lane reminded me of Jenna Fischer's Pam Beesley from 'The Office' & how Henry Cavill's Clark Kent reminded me of Joe Manganiello's Alcide from 'True Blood'--but at least his felt more suitable in this context. It was really Russell Crowe (Jor-El) who stole the show though. And that's quite a compliment coming from me, because I'm generally not the greatest fan of our Russ (I think that's what we Aussies are meant to call him).Overall I guess the film hits all the marks it needed to and I particularly liked the opening on Krypton. Zack Snyder certainly has an inspiring handle on modern visual effects and it was wonderfully utilised. I'm so over the whole aliens-and-their-tech-causing-chaos-in-a-major-city shtick though. We seem to have had so much of it in recent years with Transformers and The Avengers and others. Unfortunately 'Man of Steel' contains yet more of this without bringing much of its own innovation. I'm eagerly anticipating how Guillermo del Toro's upcoming 'Pacific Rim' will show us all how these films are really done!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A well deserved and long awaited portrayal of Superman,"After a disappointing start to summer movies with Iron Man 3, 2013 seemed like a weak year for movies. Followed by a decent Star Trek sequel, a very successful and unexpected Fast and Furious 6 as well as an out of nowhere decent flick Now You See Me, the reins were handed to Man of Steel to be the summer blockbuster to blow everyone away.Man of Steel is a solid movie as a whole. The plot suffers from clichés and it is rushed to death, but some substantial stuff is there. Performances all around are good but special mentions go to Russell Crow and Kevin Costner for an outstanding job. As far as an action flick goes...expect a lot of it. If you thought the previews had all the action...boy, you're in for a surprise. The movie is nonstop action, things blow up and get destroyed at least five minutes within one another and the last hour of the film defines mayhem. As a superman film, here is where Man of Steel succeeds.Henry Cavill was an outstanding Clark Kent. His portrayal was on point: charismatic, fragile but strong, charming but menacing, and a pretty boy for the ladies if they felt turned off by the Fourth of July over the top action sequences that were taking place around him. The storyline was very fragmented but his character was made out to be a lot more interesting and less cheesy than other films, but still had its flaws.Now, for General Zod. As excited as I was to see a villain that can rival Superman and a break from the overused Lex Luthor, he was too much for the first film. Why do I say this? His character was developed rather poorly and his dialogue sounded very similar to that of many other villains that we have seen before. Despite that, the final fight scene was memorable. You get what you expect. Two titans go at it for a good amount of time and if there fighting does not pump your adrenaline, go check your pulse.Man of Steel. The best of summer 2013 so far, one of the best Superman film (if not the best to date), amazing action flick (believe it or not, people might say it has too much action), and overall one of the much better superhero movies out there only rivaled by Nolan's batman trilogy (Someone give the Justice League a green light, Bale and Cavill? That would be unbelievable). Forget the critics, everyone has something to enjoy here, thats for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A DECENT WATCH !!,"Man of Steel is the reimagining the story of the most famous superhero by Christopher Nolan who has written this along with David Goyer who was his collaborator for The Dark Knight trilogy. The film is directed by Zack Snyder who is a master in creating stunning visuals (300, Watchmen, Sucker Punch). So, it is quite natural that the output has shades of The Dark Knight with the protagonist having to lug some emotional baggage of his past despite being a superhero.The story basically has Superman trying to save earth from a misguided General Zod who was banished from their home planet of Krypton before the planet's core collapsed destroying the entire planet. Zod wants to build a new Krypton on earth even if it means that the present inhabitants of the planet would have to be exterminated for that purpose.The film works only in parts especially where a young Clark Kent has to get a grip on his superpowers as a young kid as well as in his youth. He is guided by his adoptive parents played by a wonderful Kevin Costner & Diane Lane. Russell Crowe also does a competent job in the initial sequences as the chief scientist of Krypton as well as in several appearances strewn through the film in guiding his son. The film also benefits immensely from a rousing score from Hans Zimmer.Henry Cavil fits the part beautifully though he could've added further dimensions & depth besides the grey & sombre moods. It might well be because the writers haven't provided him with such scope.And, that is a major issue with this movie because for, what I am sure is, a first installment of a franchise, it almost completely shuns the lighter shades and humour and seems to revel in its dark tones. Even the part of Lois Lane played by Amy Adams seems incomplete. Yes, she seems to be a capable, Pulitzer winning investigative journalist. But, little else....My next & biggest grouse is that the action sequences though awesome in all their CGI wizardry have a very chaotic & noisy feel to them and appear more from that dull & jarring junkyard rampage, Transformers. The last half hour is almost completely mired in sequences where almost an entire city is ground to dust. While Michael Bay might feel happy to find this carnage & may even feel inspired, it is such a put off.. Wonder when these guys would learn from Cameron or even Joss Whedon ...This appears even more of a criminal waste when you consider the first part of the movie seemed to be in a tearing hurry of a runaway freight train and throws so much at us including the backstory of Krypton, the growing up of young Clark Kent, his youth, his discovery of his origins, etc. All that for this crescendo of chaotic madness... Oh, how we wish they had dwelt more on building characters with more shades & depth.....Overall, while the movie is definitely a good watch & might be THE BIG BLOCKBUSTER of the season, one feels SUPERMAN deserved something more SUPERlative than this ! Hope they do a better job with the sequel !!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I'm not a fan of either and looking forward to gunn's superman but there would not have been any need of new superman if they would have just taken this superman seriously and continued his arch slowly and properly rather than just throwing in batman anmd wonder woman in the second movie without even giving batman his solo movie first which we didn't even got a chance to see.I will miss cavill's superman and his costume.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

OMG! What was this all about? Spoilertastic.,"This is one of the very few movies I've ever watched where I actually felt embarrassed for the actors involved.Forget the massive plot holes, idiotic behaviour of Kent, multiple McGuffins and the fact that a spaceship thats under 300 feet of ice and thousands of years old is completely unguarded and an untrained journalist can just walk into it via the perfectly drilled horizontal tunnel thats suddenly appeared, even though the temperature is around 30 degrees below freezing. In just the same clothes she wore when she got there. She's a hard hitting type of gal and she doesn't need thermals or anything.Once she's in there she gets to see Superman fiddle around with some stuff and gets hurt, but he uses his super powers to heal her, just like Jesus would.And that's my main problem with this big pile of plop. Ka Els story is told via flashbacks to his youth and early years where he travelled the earth doing menial jobs, saving everybody's life (apart from his dads) and never, ever hitting back when attacked. I started to wonder if I was watching Superman or The Littlest Hobo at times. These flashbacks served no other purpose than to show that he was a good guy who never asked for reward and always turned the other cheek. Well, he once destroyed a mans truck and livelihood for being a douche-bag, something he managed to do in a busy truck stop without anybody hearing or seeing it, and only eliciting a look of mild bemusement from his erstwhile assailant.So when he reaches the age of 33, duh, its time to reveal himself to mankind and show off his superpowers. The baddies are here and they wan't to kill everybody and it up to Ka El to stop them, even though he knows humanityy might reject him. They won't, obviously. He's the 2nd coming and we all know how well that went for us last time we were mean to the saviour.So the baddies come with their guns and they have a pretty impressive fight that takes them into space,through a gazillion skyscrapers via exploding trains and stuff like that, but they never seem to leave the same city block and always crash back to the exact same place. Right where the good guys are. And the cardboard cut out Lane.Now, during this fight, the baddies are crushed, burned, shot, bombed, dropped from hundreds of feet, smashed with huge steel bars etc, but Ka El manages to kill Zod with the old 'break your neck like this HEEEEAAURGH!!'choke hold trick that you'd expect to see in an especially crappy Chuck Norris flick.The dialogue in the film was dreadful, the acting atrocious, the characters completely one dimensional (especially Zod), the underlying Christian message lurked like a fart on a cold day and stank the whole thing up. It is a terrible, terrible action film made worse by the over use of special effects and sentimentality in all the wrong places.I wish IMDb would give us a 0-10 option, but as I can't go lower than 1- 10 then this gets that. It's appalling.

Why remake an old story?,"I haven't seen this movie yet, I want to, but was told by a friend the story is a reboot of Superman 2, with some exposition in the beginning that's an abridged version of the basic Superman story. My question is: Why? When Superman 2 was made, did the writer hack up some story from a previous Superman TV episode, or steal it from a comic book? No, I think he put together a fun story about Superman fighting 3 bad-guys (one was a semi-cute chick with sexy crooked teeth) dressed in patent leather jump- suits. Back then I don't think a writer could get away with hacking other movies or TV shows, you had to know how to write a story. It's not difficult to write a new Superman tale, so why re-use an old one? That sucks. And I don't care how awesome the battle scenes are and how much better it was then the original Superman 2, it's still a hacked up redo with nothing original going on.

The definition of Underrated.,"I remember seeing this in theaters and generally liking MOS, but wasn't blown away by it. I think it's release date hurt the reception. The Dark Knight trilogy had concluded the year before and DC fans / moviegoers in general were still taking that in after a 8 year run. It set the stage for realism in comic book films, while Marvel was taking over with their lighter approach. If MOS was pushed back to 2018 or so, I think the desire and reception would have been better.In 2017, I saw Hanz Zimmer live in Dallas and it blew me away. I had to talk my wife into going initially, but she absolutely loved it. Still her favorite concert to this day. We both had our favorite sets, but both agreed the MOS set was phenomenal. Like Inception, that concert planted an idea: I need to watch MOS again. Bought the 4K blu-ray, turned out the lights, surround sound, no phone - fully committed.This movie absolutely pulled me in. Even though I'd seen it and knew how it ended, I'd forgotten the majority of it. The cast performance from top to bottom is excellent. Henry owned this role, Kevin Costner is the voice of reason, and Michael Shannon is a fantastic villian. Him screaming ""I will find him!!"" gives me chills. The cinematography with the blue saturation is beautiful, and the cgi is way ahead of its time. Add in that amazing score with an inspiring character arc - MOS is great. I watch it once a year and soak it in each time. Watch the behind the scenes if you can, it will show how much went into making this film.My 9/10 comes down to a single reason. The fight between Superman and Zod was slightly too long. I feel that it starts to wander when they're flying in the air toward the end of the fight. If that was trimmed up a bit or replaced with another type of combat, it would have been perfect imo.It took a few years and I had to revisit it, but MOS is now one of my favorite movies of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Average,"Today i decided to watch Zack Snyder's Man Of Steel. It was average, but not much more.I really wanted to enjoy this film. And i did think that the first half of the movie was actually decent. It was filled with a few good scenes and a good introduction to Superman. I also liked the Introduction to Krypton. However i didn't like the second half as much. It felt like it was dragging on and at times a bit of a mess. The CGI was good enough for most of this movie and the action was okay.One of my main negatives for this movie was the overall script and story. The script felt bland and the story seemed a bit basic. I also felt that there was some major problems with the pacing and character development. Too much time was spent on action scenes and not enough on the characters. The acting performances were okay, but nothing special.Overall this was a fun enough watch, but not great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Utterly incoherent.,"Wow - what a mess of a film 'Man Of Steel' is.Scene after unconnected scene jump out of the screen. Trope after predictable trope are presented, with no connectivity and less narrative. It's as though somebody threw a few superman comics at a TV showing MTV. Most music videos contain more character development, better dialogue and more believable stories though.One gets the impression that everything surrounding the action set pieces was an afterthought. Much of the film feels unrehearsed and performances often feel like first of second takes with under-directed actors unsure of the tone of the scene they are playing and the motivation of their characters.Even the special effects, which are crucial to a film like this, are ropey. The early flying sequences are laughable; reminding one of the old superimposition methods. Later battle sequences suffer from the levity and flimsy feeling CGI often has, and since we have no idea about the people involved, we just don't care about the outcome.Avoid at all costs.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"So much potential, yet such disappointment.","I love Superman, I think he's the greatest of all the superheroes. So it saddens me to see that apparently it is so hard to get his movie just right. The four films that Reeve did were a joke, while Bryan Singer's one failed in a few big ways. Man of Steel showed such potential with the new take on Superman's story and the names behind it, such as Nolan, who I thought did an amazing job with the first two Batman movies. Yet it was let down completely by the script and some story-line choices that just didn't work.I will not enter into much detail here as there's actually so much that bugs me with this movie, but I will mention just a few things, like the need to destroy entire cities and kill thousands of people just to make the movie dark and serious. The problem with that is that, this inadvertently makes Superman guilty of mass murder and not the savior that he is supposed to be. Also, the fight scenes were so computerized that it made me feel like I was actually playing a video-game. Some dialogues were just horrible and unworthy of the blockbuster they were part of. And there were so many things that didn't make sense or questions raised, that when all put together, leave a bad taste of disappointment in the mouth.A shame really; I have no desire to play the critic, I just feel frustrated that this wasn't the movie that I was hoping for and could have been. I hope there's a very extended version when it comes out on DVD, that will contain some more material to make it feel more complete.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The legend has truly been destroyed,"Biggest disappointment, too much brainless action and too little story telling - no character development. This will never become a classic like the original.Never expected it to be just an updated and refreshed version of the original, just never thought it will end up being this bad.With all the acting talent it seems a real shame, it had all the potential just the wrong story tellers standing behind it.Sometimes as they say less is more, does not mean if you have all the technology available that you need to apply it to the full a 2 hour plus movie, special effect was a complete over kill.Hollywood seems to have lost the art of storytelling, these days it is all about the special effects and 3D.

Useless and pathetic,"This Man of Steel is a real shame. Awful script, awful image, awful music, worse superhero costum ever seen in a movie. It just should be called Man of...steal, because not only it has stolen most of the script of the Richard Donner's version of Superman, but also steals from the heroic fantasy wave that has seduced most people this last few years (Game of Throne for example) in the first part of the movie, as you will see that the costum and look of it seems to come from the middle-age. What's more, is in this first part, the strange birds on which the characters are flying, that also seem to come from Avatar. And it's only the beginning. The other part of the movie takes place on earth, and the writers (shame on them) have just done a horrible job, scrambling the chronology of the story, with flashbacks and flashforwards, totally useless and pretentious. This is one of the most messed superhero movie I have ever seen : it even has almost no humour at all. Very serious, as Henry Cavill himself who spends his time frowning you don't know why ? Maybe seeing the result of all this waste, he feels like going to the men's room ?0)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A misunderstood classic in the making,"I love this film.In a similar vein as the Nolan Batman trilogy, this first outing for Cavills Superman is a serious take on Superman's early years.The cinematography is rich and beautifully shot.The film starts with the birth of superman and the destruction of Krypton, not something we have really seen before and it's done very well. Russell Crow does a great job and plays a bad ass dad.The action is superb and keeps your gripped.It's a shame that Man of Steel (at this point) isn't looking likely. I , for one.

The first of something great!!!!!,"I saw Man of Steel in a press screening in Chile last Friday. First I'm going to say it is great. There's a lot of critics comparing it to the Donner movies, but this is something different. I loved the Donner/Reeve movies. But that is 35 years old. It's time to move on. Something that a lot of critics are also saying is that it doesn't have ""magic"", or ""humour"", taking away the ""fun"" that superman has.... Excuse me but that belonged to the Donner universe, which was fine for it's day, but nowadays some may call it ""cheesy"" and not serius, too fantasy and all powerful. Man of Steel is serious. It's in the real world. It shows what would happen if it was inserted in a real world, what would be people's reaction, governments, army, media, etc... This approach was taken with The Dark Knight trilogy and it worked. It's different than the light movies Marvel has given us (except for the first Iron Man, which I think had a little more serious tone). And believe me, it is not ""dark"", it feels real!!!. The movie gives answers to a lot of questions. The Clark 's journey from boy to man is very well done, like batman begins. Cavill is great as Superman, and he gives the role a real character's decisions and reactions. Amy Adams is a great Lois, tough and very brave, not the woman in danger every time, but a real badass!!! Russel Crowe is also great as Jor el, and Shannon is the best Zod one can hope, maybe a little over the top. Faora is also frightening and shows some robotic coldness of a society of warriors with no moral to stop them. Diane Lane is a great mom and Costner is the best Pa kent with little screen time. The other characters are all great and their screen time serves the pacing of the film. The critics also say it has little character time, but it serves for the porpose of the movie, there's a lot of things happening and there's a limited time to tell the story, which is awesome and very entertaining. Also it is built as with the sense that there will be secuels, so the romance, conflicts and characters will be more explored or developed in secuels. There's sci fi, adventure, drama, action, all in one. The best action I have seen. The Fx are really great and the fighting is similar to the animated justice league's best fight's, with massive destruction. I could go on and on talking great about this movie, but to say something, I will say it's one of the best movie experiences I've had. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Man of Steel has no heart, only flat characters without soul, a stupid and chaotic storyline, the camera is also a mess. I was so disappointed that i think i will never watch any Zack Snyder film in my life.Over 2hours of dullness, bad actions scenes and no story at all.I remember only one scene with heart and soul. This scene was a flashback and showed the problems Kal El had in his childhood controlling his powers . Everything else in this dull, long stupid ride was a shame.I really hoped that Zack Snyder would do his best like he did with the Watchmen.

Best Super-Hero Movie Hands Down,"Count me in. Triple-A Plus Plus Plus. If you watched it years ago, and were put off by Cavill, or whatever, try and watch it again! Script is sheer genius!

The movie is also seriously flawed in many different areas. The romance between Clark and Lois was a farse and in no way believable. Nothing was really explained at the point of being on the screen and the movie jumped around way too much.It's too bad people over hype bad movies like this - you wonder why movie theaters are struggling to make money nowadays...because they disappoint the high ticket prices and make an evening a waste of time.

A Great Reboot,"This is truly a great reboot of the Superman series of films. It shows a far more in-depth portrayal of how Superman came to be, showing the loneliness that an alien to another world would feel & how one would try to blend in. It also treats the hero as a god like creature, as indeed anyone with the powers he has compared to mankind would be treated. This is greatly shown in the fight scenes against Zod and his crew. The fight scenes are epic as would be the case if two gods were to fight each other. It's far more epic in its destruction than was shown in the Christopher Reeves adaptations, which were rather somewhat cleaner, tidier and somehow more clinical. Where perhaps this film does fall down is for a start there's no memorable theme tune. And you don't tend to feel the love, warmth & calmness of Supermans father, which Marlon Brando portrayed so excellently, indeed at times in doesn't even seem to matter that Jor-El played by Russell Crowe dies, as his body and mind work perfectly well afterwards, even being able to walk about! This version however does bring back the magic of Superman to a new audience, and the imagination of children can once again run wild as they reinact their hero across many school playgrounds.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as the 1978 version,"Their is no point going into the finer plot details here surely everyone is familiar with the story of the son of Jor el. The film romps along in similar vein to other comic book based summer blockbusters. The CGI if that's your bag is on a par with Iron man 3 and Avengers assemble and the soundtrack is suitably deafening.Henry Cavill is our chiselled all American hero who plays the part well. Although save for looking moody, throwing things around and having to probably do quiet a lot of chin ups daily, the role is not the most challenging. Michael Shannon following on from the excellent The Iceman plays the baddie well and doesn't ham it up. Alongside these Amy Adams is on a par with Terri Hatcher in the eye candy department.The film is as I expected of this kind of vehicle. The main problem I had was I grew up on the Christopher Reeve franchise which had a certain charm, was warmer, way more humorous and took itself less serious than this po-faced attempt. Get the bus and see this if you found the Chris Reeves version too cheesy, failing that see the 1st two in that franchise you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Superman we needed,"I have recently rewatched Man of Steel, from 2013, and I have realized how much my perception has changed in these years.I know a lot of people didn't like it when they saw it at the time. I was one of them. I didn't understand where the Superman I had known in my childhood was, where the character we all wanted was. There was this destruction everywhere as well, which leaves the city completely demolished.And recently I saw it again. With more years behind me, without prejudices nor expectations. And I have loved it. But you know, like a lot, to the point of liking it much more than the classics (which I admit have aged fatally, it's much better to remember and love them, than to see them again and hit a fiasco).Why? Because I have realized that this Superman that Snyder brought us was not the Superman that we wanted, but the one that our society needed.I explain myself:
The original character emerged at a very specific time, in a very specific country. The goodness of then has disappeared. The country where he came from exists no more. There is no trace. It is very normal that in the end he kills Zod: between being good and being an idiot there is a long stretch in this case, since we are talking about a genocide who does not regret it.And that's what they brought us: the Superman that our society needs today. Yes, darker. Yes, with some slightly twisted values. But he is, after all, the society in which we live today.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Man of Steel,"I went to watch this movie, expecting an epic movie. What I received was a mixture of emotions. I personally liked the movie, but there were some things that I did not like, which of course applies to all movies. The acting, the action sequences, and of course the CGI were all great. But, I felt that Clark's character was not fully developed for a startup to what I anticipate will be a good Superman trilogy. The plot also felt subpar, in fact one of my friends mentioned afterward how it was similar to that of Superman TV shows we watched as children. Zack Snyder does a good job directing, not to mention the score by Hans Zimmer. But, overall I felt that this movie is a good follow-up to the epic Dark Knight trilogy and lays the foundation for a future successful DC comics trilogy, if not the upcoming Justice League movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant,"This is not a real review, it should be understood more as a collection of impressions on the film.Film which in my opinion represents a small peak of DC films which with this film managed very well to manage a complicated hero like Superman giving him seriousness without making the film particularly heavy or difficult to watch. The problem with Superman is always that he is a very linear character and therefore films about him are often boring or too predictable, however this film is very particular and does honor and justice to a beautiful character like the Man of Steel. So in conclusion this is the Superman film to absolutely watch because with good action, good depth and good special effects it entertains a lot and with quality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Zzzzz-uperman,"OK so I'm not going to fly off the handle and say this is the worst movie ever or that it's the worst comic book movie, or even that it's the worst Superman movie ever (although I actually liked S.M. Returns better after watching it again, yeah I just said that) I am going to say that it's full of CGI and if that's all you care about in a movie then you'll be happy with all the destruction of property, but it just didn't do it for me. I realize I'm not saying anything new here but where is the story, ya know? This movie seemed like it didn't take the time to get it right or that it was trying to make everyone who watched happy by dumbing it down or maybe things just got all messed up with everyone who was involved and had no clear vision. Many things seemed very Implausible or out right ridiculous (like Lois Lanes ability to be everywhere Superman was-maybe she can fly now too huh?). I was really happy to see that Christopher Nolan was involved after seeing the Batman trilogy (which I was amazed by and which left me thinking or even believing that Hollywood could in fact do it right after all) but either Nolan's involvement wasn't Included enough or even he couldn't save this one, who knows. Unfortunately I am back to being my old cynical self about Hollywood again (and about most everything else i suppose.

Man of Steel isn't short on action.,"Man of Steel tells the origins of Superman, starting from his birth on Krypton to him learning to belong and becoming Superman on Earth. Superman must come to know more about his past so he could understand his special abilities. General Zod learns of Superman's destination and goes after him to get something that could help revive the deceased planet of Krypton, but not while putting the people of Earth, and Earth itself, in danger.Man of Steel isn't short on action. The last hour is basically non stop destruction, while the first hour and 20 is basically Superman's beginnings. The action gets a little over-the-top, with characters getting thrown through buildingsand I mean A LOT of buildings. Millions of people die as buildings are collapsing. It just gets a little too much. Although, the special effects were very well down and some of the action scenes were fun to watch. The random zoom-in during scenes were sometimes annoying. It was a bit overused, but it worked at times, especially when Superman was flying.The dialogue gets a little hilarious at times. A scene in particular is when General Zod, while fighting superman yells, ""either I die or you do."" I couldn't help but think to myself, who wrote that line? Of course, one of you are going to die. Superman obviously knows that. It was just one line I just couldn't stop thinking about after the film.Obviously, the few lines with dodgy dialogue weren't the actors fault. As a matter of fact, the acting was actually very good. Henry Cavill played a very good Superman/Clark Kent. He was quiet, but he looked great in the costume and looked exactly the way I envisioned Superman. Michael Shannon always plays a great bad guy. He was very animated as General Zod, and like I said, his few dodgy lines weren't his fault. He made the best of his character. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner were also good as the emotional characters. Russell Crowe plays Superman's biological father Jor-El and Kevin Costner who plays the ""adoptive"" father Jonathan Kent. The two fathers love their son and just want to see them be the best man he could be.The music was also very good. I always love Hans Zimmer's work. His work in The Dark Knight was a particular favourite for me. He never fails to make an action scene that much more epic or a emotional scene that much more emotional.I've never followed Superman very closely, so I can't compare it to the comic book or the old movies. All I know is that the film didn't mention Kryponite and there was no Lex Luther, which is okay with me because I knew it was an Origin story. I enjoyed Man of Steel. I waited awhile to see it, but I must say it was worth the wait and I will probably buy it eventually. I can forgive it for its flaws. I'm excited for the Batman vs Superman sequel coming out in 2015. Let's hope there's less random zoom in scenes.Grade: BPlease be sure to check out my other reviews and entertainment posts on www,themovieboy77.com",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very good indeed,"The man of steel comes to the silver screen and I was pained I didn't get to see it as early as I would have liked. But I thought I'd still write a review about it.Its a block-buster and I didn't expect anything less. It managed to exceed my expectations a great deal even though it wasn't perfect. The actors were well cast, it had good direction and pacing but it was the visual effects that stole the show...This is one of the best visually stunning action display I have ever seen in Hollywood (yes, right there I SAID IT). Among my top five at least. In fact the only standout movie I can recall that could beat it is The Matrix. The beauty of it is that though I have seen movies before with short well constructed visuals , and others have been jam-packed and in the process would then get to be all over the place leaving the audience not knowing what to make out of the muddle, shambles and disorderliness, like TRANSFORMERS, this masterpiece had effects in excess(and I stress ""in excess"" a good 1 hour,20 something minutes dedicated to action ) and still succeeded in pulling it off beautifully. I wouldn't like to spoil it but you need to see it for yourselves.The story was okay with the first third dedicated to showing the home planet's and its inhabitants' destruction though I wouldn't say no plot-holes *spoiler alert*: Why wouldn't a council try to save some of its planetary citizens with its technology but instead are able, and choose to transport criminals who could have been executed to another dimension. This being said, as a Fan I was still able to respect the minor exclusions from the original Superman material. In fact the exclusion of the panties over spandex costume was more than welcome. And I like as the story kept close to the source material. The struggle of Superman with being an outsider and minor romance story with Lois Lane. It wasn't perfect though as it still had plot-holes.The score was great. I wouldn't speak much on that. And the choice of actors. Visually, Henry Cavill is one of the best embodiments of superman ever. He reminds me of Tom Welling in the Smallville TV series who, I also think, along with Cavill are better than previous editions. A welcome inclusion as well as (as I strongly believe) a marketing accessory Bankable star is Russell Crowe. The perfect Jor el. Amy Adams and Michael Shannon were okay as Lois Lane and General Zod respectively but special mention goes to Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent. Diane Lane was a breathe of fresh air as Martha too. This still reminded of Smallville's Kents.Overall a great movie. Sets up well for a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
action packed to the brim,"Man Of Steel (2013) Rating- 85/100The origin story of the greatest superhero of all time ,Superman.Starring- Henry Cavill,Michael Shannon,Amy Adams,Russell Crowe Director- Zack SnyderHenry Cavill as Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman is great.He puts in a lot of effort behind the role and he is successful most of the time.You could sense the pain and loneliness behind his character ,which is essential to the tale.Amy Adams as Lois is good.She proves to be a much better representation of Lois than her earlier predecessors.Micheal Shannon as Zod is great.As a villain he is excellent and truly the best villain to face off against Superman. On a surprising note ,Russel Crowe as Jor-El, has a good amount of scenes and hes amazing in them!Diane Lane and Kevin Costner do good as the foster parents.There's a tight bond between Superman and both his parents (his dad and both foster parents) and the actors do an excellent job bringing it out.The stumbling block for MOS is its story.Don't get me wrong ,its good ,but there's some heavy structural problems and thats mostly the directors fault.Other than that ,the story is engaging.The excellent depiction of Krypton and explaining Superman's powers on Earth were all done neatly.Goyer has brought in the realistic natures that were seen in The Dark Knight Trilogy and lends MOS the same ,a hard task considering the highly out of the world powers of Superman. The relations between Superman and his parents were excellently highlighted.But his romance with Lois was not good enough.Some scenes do go a bit over the top (ex:The tornado flashback) ,and its hard to understand the choices the characters make.Zod's character was well developed and this helps in making him a great villain.The visual effects were amazing.The Krypton sequences and especially the climax was wonderful!Music from Hans Zimmer was as usual amazing.It really gives the movie an intense atmosphere.Direction by Zack Snyder was good.He keeps the movie packed with emotion and drama and amazing action scenes.The pace of the movie is a bit uneven at the start as it shifts back and forth from action to drama in the course of minutes ,but the latter half is fast paced and action packed.One of the issues i had with MOS was, Zack trying to 'Nolanise' the movie.The first half is riddled with jumping from the past and the present almost continuously.Juggling with timelines is best left to Nolan.Some scenes end all of a sudden and others just jump ahead without proper clarity.Editing is weak especially in the middle ,and this could irritate some viewers.But Zack does master one aspect of the movie and thats the ACTION.I really have to talk about the action of this movie. It was just mindblowing!!! The entire third half of the movie is one gigantic EPIC battle.I have to say that its the best superhero fight sequences I've EVER seen.Mixed with the soundtrack and the visuals ,the action is just jaw dropping.The scale of destruction was immense.It was really great to see Superman actually fighting someone that matched his powers.The finale left me speechlessThere are plenty of powerful scenes showcasing Superman's powers and all of them are spot on.Zack has made no mistake handling the action sequences ,and thats what keeps this movie afloat.Overall ,Man Of Steel will go down as an excellent reboot of Superman made memorable with those jaw dropping action sequences.Its not perfect but its a blast!Its a must watch if you love action!Acting- 4/5 Story- 3.5/5 Direction- 3.5/5 Action- 5/5 Drama- 4.5/5 Thriller- 5/5 Visual Effects- 5/5https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=673752085985052",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Could Have Been Better,"When I first saw the preview of Man of Steel I had my doubts. Sure the effects of the movie look amazing ,but at times the movie felt really choppy at places going from here to there jumping around the place. It also had no humor at all making the film dry with only serious talks not showing one simple smile to make the audience at least give us a laugh.Now as for the actor that plays Superman he did okay job yet, i felt like Superman gave no emotion expect yelling and looking at everybody with a straight face.Amy Adam played a good role which I simply enjoyed.The action is pretty cool in some sort of Dragon Ball Z way in how the fights were portrayed of having Superman and his enemies fight through buildings and delivering punches that make them fly like rag-dolls. Also seeing Superman using his heat vision is pretty badass.As for all, its watchable but a hit or miss.6.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A power packed though not so great,As I am ardent fan of Nolan (though he dint direct the movie) I went to this movie keeping high expectations but I am bit disappointed. I like the first half where you can feel a well maintained balance between Action and Drama. But second half bit over in terms of Action. I felt Lois Lane character could have been a bit better. Hans Zimmers's music is not so great as I felt it over producing. I like Henry Cavill a lot and felt he is perfect fit for Superman role.He acted well upto the mark. Russell Crowe is also good provided the limits of his role. I felt they should have shown few more details on Superman childhood.

"Action-packed, briskly-paced and featuring a stellar cast","Man of Steel, the long-awaited Superman reboot, is finally here and it rocks. The Zack Snyder-directed film revisits Superman's origin While certainly a superhero movie, Man of Steel is first and foremost a science fiction drama about an alien trying to find his place in our world and dealing with humanity's reaction to his existence. More than any other Superman film since the 1978 one, Man of Steel reminds us that Superman isn't human,The hugely entertaining Man of Steel is the best Superman movie since the 1978 original. Cavill makes a great Superman, but we don't really get a true emotional attachment to the adult Clark Kent until he meets Lois Lane (Amy Adams). The flashbacks to Clark's youth inform us of his journey thus far and give us a sense of his inner demons. Otherwise, Clark is, as Lois describes him at different points, like a ghost or a cypher.The visual effects, many of which were created by WETA Workshop, are generally great, especially the screen's most fully realized depiction of Krypton yet...Action-packed, briskly-paced and featuring a stellar cast, Man of Steel is the best Superman film since the 1978 original and proves DC can match Marvel in the massive scale department.

Engaging if superficial darker tone gives way to excessive special effects and noise later in the film – mostly works for what it is though,"When this came out in the cinemas I must admit I didn't really care; the years have left me less inclined to go and sit in packed cinemas full of code-of-conduct breakers only to be disappointed by yet more hollow noise. I had heard the promise of a ""darker"" reboot, but the effects heavy trailers and the presence of Zack Snyder at the helm really made me doubt that. However, on a long flight it seemed like a good way to fill the time when I had little else to do, and so I gave it a go. In fairness it is actually not too bad and the negative things I had heard were mostly rather exaggerated and perhaps coming from other agendas rather than meeting the film on its own terms and judging it there.The dramatic opening on Krypton lets you know that this is going to be a film with lots of special effects thrown around but it does at least set the tone well. This continues in the first part of the film where the nicely done structure allows us to have key moments of backstory without the whole film having to go back there and work forward. This section of the film does have some weight to it but could have done more and be more heart-felt. Although it deserves credit for trying, it does feel rather superficial in its delivery, I enjoyed it for the content but would have liked it to be smarter and better. The second half of the film becomes more and more about the action and it is noisily dizzying. I enjoyed it for the spectacle and much of it was well done, but some of the very specific scenes of peril involving very specific characters, could have been cut with no great loss. It uses the dramatic music and dark tone well though to add weight to this – having its cake and eating it in some ways but ultimately it does just become a blur after a whie.The cast probably has too many famous faces but mostly they work while also being a parade of distraction. Cavill makes a likable Superman, although the material never tests his emotional range too much, but just enough to work. Shannon is a very good piece of casting as he brings a really good dark intensity to Zod (as he does to everything) and he adds weight to the character which remains even when he becomes a special effect rather than an actor. Adams is OK but a little out of place – you sense her light, pretty approach is there for the romantic or flirty moments. Costner is solid while Crowe, Lane, Fishburne, Meloni and others do good work. Too many recognizable faces do float around, but it is a big budget movie and this is the danger I guess.Ultimately Many of Steel was better than I expected despite doing just what I thought it would. The darker tone is rather superficial but still just about works although the second half of the film really is just one big effects showcase without too much else to be had. It is noise and distracting for this and it did the job even if I doubt I'll remember much about it when/if a sequel comes around.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's OK, worth seeing in torrents :)","First of all, I am going to comment about what MovieGeek 218 stated about the movie. Your sentences was extremely painful to read specially the first paragraph.Anyways, in regards to the movie itself, the action could have been lessened and still has that same thrill or that ""wow"" factor. But as usual Snyder always overdone many of what he thinks are interesting scenes. However, I do like the lack of the romance in this movie; it shows a different side of clark rather than the usual redundant or very cliché romance with Lois. As MovieGeek 218 stated ""The movie focused more about superman's origin and his battle with Zod"" So, this movie is not going to have one of those moments where the hero's loved one gets abducted by the ""bad guy"" and the hero comes in for the rescue.I thought the movie was OK for an action thriller; I gave a solid 6 out of 10 and is worth watching for free in live torrents or actual movie theatre. However, one cannot possibly compare it to a more successful movie such as the Avengers. The Avengers simply beats this movie hands down in every aspect ways. But then again, everyone is entitled to their own opinion right Moviegeek 218?In conclusion, I do hope that Snyder will do a more refined Superman movie.

"Look, up in the sky!","While it's a great improvement over Stupidman (er, Superman) Returns, Man of Steel is not without flaws of its own. For one, the climax had too much building smashing. Who does Superman think he is, the Hulk? And another thing, it's not shown that Superman has weaknesses. No Kryptonite in sight. So that's a big problem when you have Superman, who is practically immortal, vs. General Zod who is also practically immortal. The ending is like watching a game of Chess that you know is going to end in a stalemate. Luckily it doesn't, but I'm not saying how. Plus, it feels like, to quote Journey ""the movie never ends, it goes on and on and on and on."" Don't get me wrong I thought this was great! For one, much better writing than Superman Returns. Another thing, it feels darker than a Superman movie normally is, which isn't surprising considering Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy) was the producer. That's a great improvement over the other films, which, compared to this feel silly. And Bonus: In 2015 when Man of Steel 2 comes out, Superman AND Batman FINALLY come together on the big screen! I'm really looking forward to that! Grade: B- 8/10 4/5 stars",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's a bird, it's a plane - it's another questionable remade movie","Man of Steel isn't the Superman movie you'd expect and that could be a good or bad thing. Superman use to be a charming, flying hero that saved the world on a regular basis, but today's superheroes are expected to be more human and, as a result, more hopeless (i.e. Batman and Iron Man). But Superman has never been either of those things, so what audiences can expect is a Man of Steel struggling with some serious identity issues.What Works – Henry Cavill plays Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman with just the right amount of bravado even if he is lacking the boyish grin. He's a man's man/lady's man – all around ""super"" man. His muscular physique is enough to keep female fans in their seats while his rugged manliness, and lack of spandex, should keep the guy's satisfied.What Doesn't Work – The infinite flashbacks seriously slow down the film. Abandoned as a baby, Kal-El makes the long journey across space and lands on earth. That's an appropriate, and necessary, back story, but his struggles as a middle schooler, teenager, bartender, fisherman and explorer are not and at 2 ½ hours, the film felt as long as Kal-El's journey to earth. Russell Crowe as Jor-El (Kal-El's father) also makes these odd Obi-Wan Kenobi flashes throughout the film – giving Clark Kent guidance and direction in the way he should go in the Force Earth.What I Thought – Superman Returns was so awful that any remake is going to be better, but better doesn't make it the best. While The Dark Knight Rises and Iron Man 3 strolled down the darker street, Man of Steel could have rose above it all. Still, for its Inception sounding-score, Avatar cinematography and all around Superhero special-effects its worth a trip to the theater – at the very least you'll be able to converse with your colleagues about how good/bad it was.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"An action-packed film about ""what's his name""?","It never ceases to frustrate me when stories or characters have ""evolved"" so much that there is little remaining from the original that endures anymore. The latest take is a far cry from the previous versions, and even the latest meaning of the ""S"" in Superman, would have Joe and Jerry shaking their heads. There was a noticeable lapse in any comedic relief as with all previous versions, including Superman Returns, which is probably why I felt so drained after this flick. In Superman Returns, Brandon Routh's portrayal was excellent and had much more depth than Henry Cavill, although Cavill was more muscular than any previous Super's (and reminded me of Gordon Scott in his Tarzan movies). I wasn't impressed with ""Lois"" in this offering. Although Amy Adams was OK, her character was very shallow and there was little effort given to knowing anything about here other than that she had the hots for what's his name (which was mentioned only in passing in this version). If wall to wall action (eg fighting, destruction, fighting, loud explosions, buildings falling, and fighting) is your thing, then you'll get your fill with The Man of Steel. However, if you want something more earthly, digestible, with more interaction and depth of characters, including the contrasts of the Clark/Superman characters, I'd consider passing on this one and re-watching Superman Returns.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An insult to Superman and human intelligence,"No spoilers.This movie should be called ""Michael Shannon the Movie"" cause beyond Zod and his crew the movie is not worth watching, not even for free. Michael Shannon (Zod)...by the gods, he is such a good actor and him playing Zod was the best thing about the movie that is not saying a lot tho since the movie is the second worst movie I ever watch. (no insult meant at Michael Shannon he was awesome at every point of the movie).This so called ""Superman movie"" has nothing to do with the comic book or animated series Superman. The writer of this movie presumes that the viewer is an idiot, I'm not talking about the Superman comics and cartoons at this point.The characters: - The actions and motivation of the movie characters don't make sense most of the time. Only Zod and his crew seem to have well written characteristics and motivations. - While on the other hand ""Superman"" does not resemble a rational or thinking human/kryptonien. I did not care much for the actors acting either, nothing special. The US army acted like a parody of the US army. the other characters in the movie seemed absolutely irrelevant.Look and feel of the movie: - Krypton looks like it was designed by some one who only sees things in shades of brown. - Zod and his crews military armor looked awesome tho. - The special effects were alright but nothing we haven't seen already. - The fight scenes are jumpy and fast cut, sometimes it can be hard to follow what is actually happening.Story: - Spoilers: Google - Man of Steel plot holes. There are too many to write em all down here.Final Verdict: The creators presume that the viewers are brain dead idiots who will not notice the major plot holes and inconsistencies that repeatedly occur in the movie. The visual spectacles are nothing special and the acting is average at best (except for Michael Shannon who was awesome as General Zod).

A true Super Man,"The 1978 is terrible, just acceptable for people from that era.
It presents an awful Superman that is good and does good ""because"". No character development, no psychological weight. A skin deep character that when really analized, it's not what the movie say it is.
He's selfish and vacant. He uses his power to get a girl or without thinking in the awful consequences that they could produce, all for personal reasons (time travel). The rest of the characters aren't better. Lex Luthor's plan is embarrasing and Louis Lane is insultingly superfitial, falling in love, basically, of power. She doesn't know Superman as a man, but she does love his powers. Great. Great character!Anyways. That was 1978. We are better now. And now we have a real human (that's how he grew up after all). Clark is filled with contradictions, complicated feelings and full of fears and weaknesses. He's phisically perfect, but mentally, he's just another boy and man. We see how he becomes Superman, slowly learning from his families (both), and finally making decisions by his own, not for himself, but for the well being of others, even sacrifizing things himself. But not by solving everything with his powers and that's it. No. It's never that easy. There is colateral damage and he has to deal with it and improve. I can love this Superman.

I happen to love Superman, but the film was way too long even for me. It's almost as if Zack Snyder went into the edit room and said, lets not take anything out. While I appreciate the origin of Superman, it was way too much origin and not enough Superman. The first hour of the film, is like something out of Firefly or Star Trek, not what you expect from Superman.

'Man of Steel' soars,"'Man of Steel' has arrived with a lot of expectation. It has been seven years since we last saw Superman on the big screen with Bryan Singer's 'Superman Returns', but that film was seemingly loved by few (I was one of the few) and declared ""a flop"", subsequently rendering the prospect of a new Superman film to be a make-or-break opportunity. As the film's production progressed, anticipation rightly built and this sense of anticipation was heightened when Christopher Nolan spearheaded the movie's production, bringing Zack Snyder in to direct his proposed reboot. So, after all this, does 'Man of Steel' live up anticipation? With a sigh of relief, I can safely say that it does.The plot of 'Man of Steel' is both familiar and fresh; we get the basic bones of Superman's origin story, but it is told in a way unlike anything we've seen before. It opens on the planet Krypton, which Jor-El (Russell Crowe) believes is on the verge of destruction. Going against the norm of manufactured birth, he and his wife, Lara (Ayelet Zurer) conceive their child naturally, and as the planet approaches its demise, Jor-El steals the planetary codex and filters it into his young son, Kal-El, before sending him into space, crash landing on Earth. Years later, Kal-El (Henry Cavill) has been raised on a farm by the Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) and is now drifting between various jobs, everything from a fisherman to a bartender, leaving a variety of incidents in his wake, as he searches for himself. As an award-winning journalist named Lois Lane (Amy Adams) gets on his tail, Kal-El discovers about his past, just as Kryptonian General Zod (Michael Shannon) arrives on Earth, fiercely determined to retrieve the codex.A lot of common criticisms have been thrown at 'Man of Steel' since it premiered. Many have declared it to be ""too serious"" and ""humourless""; many have said that there is too much action in the final act; that Henry Cavill isn't charismatic enough; that Lois Lane isn't developed enough, etc, etc. After seeing the film, I found it difficult to agree with the various and recurring criticisms. Yes, I acknowledge that this is the most serious Superman movie we've seen thus far, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. This isn't intended to be Richard Donner's 'Superman', this is meant to be a new take on Superman, for a new generation. The third act is also pure action from start to finish, but this matters little, because A) we care about the characters involved, B) it's justified in the plot and C) it's really entertaining.Even though I love his hyper-stylised adaptation of Frank Miller's '300', 'Man of Steel' is arguably Zack Snyder's finest film to date. It is also his mature; there is no slow motion or music video-like scenes; and in the quieter and more reflective moments that make up the first half, he displays both a mature tone and a clear respect for the source material. It is also a joy to look at, whether it be the beautifully realised version of Krypton or the Kents' farm outside Smallville, especially thanks to Amir Mokri's great cinematography. Hans Zimmer complements these visuals with a wonderful score that helps to further establish this as a new take on Superman, helping the viewer to instantly forget about John Williams' iconic theme tune.However, 'Man of Steel' wouldn't be the great film it is if Krypton's last son wasn't cast right. Henry Cavill makes the role entirely his role, delivering the most developed portrayal we've seen of Superman on screen; he's by turns, confident, unsure, reflective and lost. He essentially makes a superhero often disregarded as ""too perfect"" into a likable character that we really root for. Despite solid performances by Amy Adams, Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne, it is the superb trio of Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner that best support Cavill. The brilliant Michael Shannon gives a great performance as Zod, making him a formidable villain. Crowe's turn as Jor-El is magnetic, while Costner's turn as Superman's adoptive dad is properly touching.'Man of Steel' was a movie that I anticipated for years and even with this undying level of anticipation, I cannot say I was disappointed at all. This film is super from start to finish, when Kal-El is and isn't in the iconic suit. Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan have truly invigorated Superman in a way that should please old fans and make new ones. With spectacle, thrills and emotion, 'Man of Steel' soars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Too Dark for a Superman movie,"Henry Cavill makes a really good Superman. Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Dianne Lane, and Russel Crowe also all do a good job in their respective roles. It's unfortunate, though, that this is the movie that they are acting in, because that's not enough to save it.First of all, the cinematography is so dark and depressing through nearly the entire film, completely uncharacteristic of a Superman film I didn't see this in 3D since 3D films are usually shown with less than sufficient lighting and generally look inferior to films not filmed in 3D as a consequence. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with the dark appearance of the film or if that was by choice. Either way, you have to blame the director for the problem. There's been an incredible change of opinion against 3D recently, and films like this one are a big part of the reason.Second, the writing is so incredibly wrong-headed, particularly for a Superman film. As others have pointed out, it was dumb to have Jonathan Kent telling his son that it would have been better had he let the children on the bus die. It makes him sound like a monster. It was dumb to have Superman kill. The one thing that EVERYONE knows about him is that Superman does not kill. IT was dumb to make half the movie be about leveling Metropolis. I always knew that the fight scene, which was poorly filmed, and went on entirely too long, was not over every time they showed a building that was not knocked down, because you know it was only so that they could then show its destruction.As I said, there were a few good things about it.

"Man of Steel Action Soars, Characters Sink","Man of Steel is an exercise in near-greatness, hamstrung at every turn by a hero's greatest enemy - not a Kryptonian death squad, but a lead-eared script. Zack Snyder's majestic direction, earnest turns from a cast of memorable faces, and a soaring score can't mask a script with a severe identity crisis: is it the tale of a confused and lost loner in search of a home? A man-child who just needs a father figure? A brash reporter looking for an emotional tether to her world? A hero trying to find his courage? It is all and none of these things, which is why Man of Steel remains an exhilarating failure. The biggest weight to carry rests squarely on the broad shoulders of Henry Cavill as Superman. Cavill's stepped from relative obscurity (an earnest turn on The Tudors and a capable performance in Tarsem's blissfully bizarre Immortals notwithstanding) to one of the most iconic characters in fiction. The camera loves Cavill and he fills every shot with a truly resonant stoicism, warmth, and vulnerability. He capably handles both the heroism and the humor of the character, but both are in short supply in the script. When it's time for his character to talk, his performance falls apart. A variety of humanizing themes are toyed with in Cavill's Superman, but none of them ever comes to fruition. His tortured relationship with his human parents is dropped, his search for belonging in the world gets left in the dust, and what we're left with is a very promising performance that only takes flight when Cavill is allowed to eschew the script and inject personality in silent moments: among the best being his poignant catharsis after the film's brutal climax and his unbridled joy at his first flight. Amy Adams exudes a welcome feistiness and ebullience, but her character is only partially developed after a promising introduction. Superman is in love with her because the audience is, but he could only be in love with Amy Adams, as Lois Lane barely exists on the page. The lack of development in their relationship is nowhere more apparent than when Superman thanks her for believing in him 3/4s through the film: at what point did Lois do anything but act as a springboard for the film's endless supply of exposition? Mario Puzo knew enough to give Superman and Lois some genuine banter in the 1978 film. Goyer's script leaves it all to our imagination, for the sake of some glorious, repetitive mayhem. Kevin Costner injects an earthy charm into Jonathan Kent, Superman's adoptive father, but with nothing other than platitudes for him to recite, we never truly believe in his relationship with his son. Its tragic conclusion, while beautifully shot, rings hollow. Diane Lane packs every moment with heartland pluck and tenderness (though the script certainly doesn't), and Russel Crowe once again proves himself one of the screen's most charismatic actors with his majestic turn as Kal El's blood father. But even he is no match for the script's nigh-incomprehensible sci-philo-babble, which he seems embarrassed to spout in the movie's bewildering prologue on Krypton. He is far more comfortable with the moments of genuine tenderness with his wife (well-played by the lovely Ayelet Zurer), his infant son, and the grown son he was forced to give up. The movie's opening scene is a masterpiece of vivid acting and lush staging and film work - but we rush all too quickly into an almost comically flat council chamber sequence full of baffling dialogue we can't be bothered to attempt to understand this early in the film. It is into this ill-wrought fog that Michael Shannon attempts to make his grand entrance as the occasionally menacing Zod. He laudably wrestles through it, but the cheesy space opera lines he's saddled with lead to an at-times borderline comical performance. Shannon finds smaller character moments to imbue his one-note maniac with a very human rage and despair. His botched introduction is remedied by a later scene with Crowe and a very well-played climax, but one can only imagine what kind of monster he could have created with a script worthy of his considerable screen presence. The effects, the art direction, and the magnificently well-staged action sequences almost elevate the movie to the heights of grand entertainment. Zod and Superman's final conflict is easily among the greatest fights ever filmed (or rendered, given the obvious CGI). But in all the sturm and drang, the audience, without an emotional tether to the two dueling behemoths, is left wondering about the poor little pixel people scurrying through the streets as buildings collapse - how noble can Superman be if he lets his rage at Zod blind him to all of the citizens being crushed in his path? Goyer has argued it's the point that Superman is not yet fully aware of his power and the responsibility it comes with, but that simply isn't on the page. Despite Zack Snyder's earnest efforts to elevate the film with his fantastic cinematic eye, it's not on the screen. In the end, the audience fills in much of the gaps in character development and emotional payoff on the strength of the craft work that went into the movie, but we're left wishing that the film's script did more of the work for us. For their flimsiness and crass assembly line quality, the Marvel films have at least generally done some excellent character-building work that Man of Steel could benefit from. The perfect comic book movie would merry the production value of Man of Steel to the spirit of Iron Man 3. Until then, we're left re-watching Christopher Reeves and waiting for Superman to truly take flight.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Cast? It's not 10/10,it' 11/10! Henry Cavill as Superman was the cherry on top,and every other main character was the other cherry on top of another cake. Gosh,even secondary characters that you see less or that have simple lines of dialogue are perfectly suited for their role,whether it's important or notThe Acting? Marvelous. From every single actor/actress out thereThe Writing? Almost flawless,they retained the OG story extremely well and suited to our modern worldFilmography? Very very good,the CGI here is very well done, and surely it's way better than most of the MCU movies that were released in these past 4 yearsI even loved how the military was portrayed: strong,but under a heavy crisis due to facing the aliens.I can keep on going forever,so i'll just say that the Critics butchered this movie simply because it wasn't Marvel so they never understood it. Thankfully, every movie that is misunderstood in the past,becomes a gem in the future,so we just need to wait.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The greatest superhero story of all time,"Man of steel is a masterpiece. From the cinematography and effects it is by far one of the most impressive superhero movies I have seen, and finally a serious movie of the greatest superhero, Superman.What I love most about man of steel is how serious the tone is. It's a story of a man raised in a different culture, his struggles trying to fit in, to be one of them and to finally recognise who he really is. In my opinion, it's a beautiful story. With some fast paced action that needs to be seen, some scenes I wasn't able completely take in from the first watch. Man of steel definitely needs more than just one viewing. I highly recommend owning it on blue ray.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic,"Action in this movie is incredible. The story is told in full, and very clever. No boring long drawn out sections that you usually expect in a reboot of a movie like this. The casting could not be better. Not one week link. And to our new superman. Amazing. Go and see this movie. It will be a massive hit anyway, but don't miss out. The poor critic reviews are no real surprise. They want more storytelling and more romance and less action. Think they are missing the point of the movie. This is a fantastic story and brought up to date extremely well. The romance will develop in later movies. He has just met her by the way. Go go go go go . And go again. You will miss a classic action movie if you don't.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Man of Steel,"Superman was an idea of hope, which is the focus of the whole movie. The theme is buried in really well, and continuously comes up. The film, as well as the characters, seemed believable and not far-fetched. There was fantastic acting from everyone, as there were many talented actors signed into this film. The film had some great moments and great scenery, and really followed through with the story. Some parts of the story are a bit questionable, but that's really for the audience member to decide. I personally didn't like some of the choices the writer made, but that's just my opinion. The camera work for some of the film was very tough to watch. The camera continuously shook during certain scenes and made it especially hard not to focus (on top of that, the film was in 3D). Also, the camera moved too fast, making it very tough for audience members to follow. The music was definitely my favorite part of the film. Hans Zimmer comes in with a very strong orchestra and really plays the strong points of the film. The music got you absorbed in the film, and really contributed to the overall theme. If I were you, I would probably check out the soundtrack. It is fantastic! There is a lot of action, and the action scenes are great. The film seemed to be tailored to more of an action film, rather than focus on origins as much. Personally, I found the film to be a bit stretched (as some of the action scenes were drawn out) and the camera work really needed to be focused. The music was incredible, but the film could have been shorter. That being said, this is definitely a film worth watching in theatres. It was a great superhero movie, and felt somewhat balanced to the dramatic side and action side of Superman.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Haters have an IQ less than their rating,Undoubtedly the best superhero movie ever. This movie is the perfect analogy of how a superhero will be treated by the present world. Very realistic and not the cheesy cliches that you see in other movies. The soundtrack is epic and fits well. So many motivating qoutes which show how an alien is shaped into the selfless human superhero that we adore. The problem with the haters is that they want an established Superman and not an origin movie. DO NOT listen to the critics on this one and miss out on this epic masterpiece.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
i liked it more than Superman Returns,"as far as superhero movies go,this one is fairly decent.but it doesn't compare to most of the Marvel cinematic universe.as a movie in the DC cinematic universe it's not too shabby.it's got good pacing,the action and fight scenes are well choreographed.the story is okay.it is another origin story to a point.but it doesn't get bogged down in that aspect of the film.the acting is good here all around Amy Adams shines(in my opinion)as Lois Lane,Laurence Fishburne makes a good Perry White.Michael Shannon is convincing as General Zod.Russel Crowe Plays Jor-El and Kebvin Costner and Diane Lane play Clark|Kent's adoptive parents.Henry Cavill plays Clark Kent/Kal-El,and he brings some gravitas to the role.while putting his own stamp on the character.for me,this film is better than the previous installment,Superman Returns.for me,Man of Steel is a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A terrible reflection of Superman on almost all counts,"I will start with good points:Jonathan Kent has one scene where he really does feel like the character he's meant to be. When Clark learns at last that he is from another world, he comforts Clark and embraces him in his arms;Clark: Can't I just keep pretending I'm your son? Jonathan: You are my son.Likewise, there are some scenes with Jor-El that work. For instance, when he says ""You are as much a child of Earth as you are of Krypton"" as opposed to the Donner version, who was obsessed with Clark abandoning his human emotions and embracing his Kryptonian heritage above all else... despite admitting that the Kryptonians' arrogance destroyed them. MoS Jor-El sees the differences, and says that humanity's difference from Krypton could be a good thing since it could lead them to not make the same mistakes.There are some beautiful moments in this film that show Superman as hopeful and inspiring. For instance, the scene where he first learns to fly has always been my favourite part of the film, and has one of the few instances of vibrancy of colour, and Clark actually smiling. And, when he's rising up to destroy the ""World Engine"" to save the world, likewise it's quite well handled.Now, though, I get to what kills the film for me:I used to think it just wasn't to my tastes, that it was over-dark and over-grim for Superman... but now, I flat-out think it was incompetent on a lot of levels, with many stupid scenes that make no sense and add up to a whole lot of nothing.We spend FAR too long, and have far too much focus on Krypton. The story has not changed in almost any version besides this one. Doomed planet, arrogant council who don't believe Jor-El, goodbye to son, rocket. That's it... yet here we've got a ridiculous amount of action, explosions, fighting, the weird skull codex thing that isn't explained why it's a skull, weird symbolism, the ""birthing matrix"" that looks like... well, The Matrix pods... it's kind of a mess.In that same opening, Zod is pretty pathetic--he seriously gets his ASS KICKED by Jor-El! A SCIENTIST, and the supposedly great military general, genetically bread to be a soldier and fighter... gets his butt kicked by essentially a nerd. Seriously! And do I even need to go into the ""I WILL FIND HIM!!!"" line? It's hilariously out of place, and I giggled so much at that. When Zod yelled stuff like that in the original, it fit the tone of the film and he had consistent funny, goofy moments balanced out with intimidating ones. Here, though... it's just a weird bit of laughter- inducing out-of-nowhere silliness.After that, we have so many random cuts to different points in the film at entirely random intervals that it's really difficult to tell what the hell each scene is meant to mean most of the time, and the flashbacks are so jarring, unnatural, brief and out-of-order that we don't even know when they're supposed to be, and what they're supposed to link to. Most of these scenes would probably be fine if told in a proper sequence, but they aren't, so I'm left not having a clue what to think about them.So often in this film, it'll feel as if it's about to explore the characters, build towards something, explain something about their personalities, and JUST as it's about to do so something explodes, or there's a crash, or the ambush-tornado turns up.The tornado scene is one of the most idiotic moments of the movie. Pretty much everything is wrong with it, from Jonathan seeing a trapped dog and sending his invulnerable super-strong son AWAY to hide under a bridge, only to try to save the dog himself (because Clark, a young 20- something fit man saving the dog is suspicious? But the 50+ year-old-man doing it is perfectly normal?) to the complete fundamental misunderstanding of tornadoes actually work on every level.Zod captures Superman in his fortress--Clark being the ONE GUY that he needs for his plan to succeed--and he puts absolutely no guards on him, just some weedy guy who immediately runs away. Oh, and weedy scientist outright states that Clark DOES NOT have his super-powers that he gets from the sun... and yet, a couple minutes later, with no exposure to sunlight, he breaks the bonds with super-strength. There is no excuse for that level of lazy writingThe villains are idiotic at almost every turn. They give no reason for why they have to make this new Krypton civilisation on Earth, they just want to because there'd be no movie otherwise.The climax of the movie, the final fight between Supes and Zod was never supposed to be in the movie to begin with. That was added later at the request of the studio who wanted one more fight. So, that scene of Superman snapping Zod's neck wasn't part of any directorial or writing vision. And that very much shows. None of the scenes following it make any reference to it, and the tone is so jarringly different that we seriously smash- cut from him screaming about killing Zod, to him joking about destroying government equipment and smiling.I hope that in the future it'll be justly left in the dust and practically forgotten.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Appreciate how good it is years later,"This didn't get the credit at the time that I feel it would now. I mean the opening scene is amazing on its own! It's such a good film and so well cast when you look back at it. Almost flawlessly cast in fact. Beautiful film with good action and solid performances. It deserved a proper sequel. Zod was always the best villain in Superman stories and doesn't disappoint. His right hand woman is cold and efficient, everything you could have hoped for in that role. Russell Crowe absolutely nails it as Joe El and of course Henry will always be the perfect Superman. This story was a great intro that should have been built on. Can't believe at the time it seemed to be panned. Deserves a second watch and I'm sure you'll love it more if you do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good movie filled with poor choices,"I have been looking forward to seeing Man Of Steel for lots of reasons: 1. Henry Cavill, I think he embodies who we see when we see Superman. 2. Russell Crowe as Jar-El and Kevin Kostner as Jonathan Kent, great actors who really bring something to their roles. I also liked the casting of Diane Lane and Lawrenece Fishburne. In fact casting is something this movie does really right. The beginning is great with lots of time spent setting up the new Kryptonian story. I think this was a good choice it gave Russell Crowe some great scene time and set the tone for the movie. I think the Kal-El, Clark story told in real time and flashbacks was also a good choice. It worked really well even though it was non linear. The scene's with Jonathan Kent are good but I feel that Diane Lane's acting talents were wasted for the most part during the whole movie. But this movie is all about the Fathers so I guess I can understand it a little. At first I had trouble with the introduction of Lois Lane but I kind of got into it after awhile and thought that it took some imagination to come up with this. It was definitely different. I also enjoyed the whole fish out of water feel for Superman, for the first time the movie really showed what it must be like to be an alien, not a bad thing at all.All the good being said there were some really poor choices in this movie. One of which might just doom any franchise expectations. One was too many redundant fight scenes. Too much destruction. It was totally unnecessary and started to get boring which really blew the wind out of an otherwise enjoyable film. Again poor choice on what to do with your villain. I just really can't understand why writers make this really dumb choice over and over again. It just doesn't make any sense and really hurts future stories. The end (which I guess will be much talked about) was the worse choice and I think many will be very put off by it. It is the total destruction of the Superman image. Too bad because the rest of the movie has great promise. I gave it a 7/10 for Henry Cavill and the other great actors.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Bad movie, Zack Snyder, BAD MOVIE!","I am a fan of DC universe, Marvel universe, anything that has superheroes in it I am all up for it. Superman is a classic superhero movie that has been there and loved by generations of superhero fans. However, this movie is absolutely terrible. OK, it focused on action and dark tone, that is to be expected, maybe even wished for. But Zack Snyder really pushed it with his dark tone. I had high hopes for this movie, maybe it was the advertising and everyone looking forward to watching this movie, maybe it was just the fan in me. But this movie was depressing, this was maybe the movie with the least lines I have ever seen. Superman is not some brooding, depressing character. He is a person that has superpowers, yet he always wanted to be normal, just like any other guy, he always wanted to help others. This movie depicts him as some dark person, in the fight scenes the primary focus is on destruction. Have you ever seen Clark Kent fighting among as many people as possible, destroying everything around him? He is the kind of superhero that takes the fight away from the population, yet here he just destroys everything like its not important. He almost seems like he has no emotion, does not care about anything and the movie overall is just depressing and saddening. Zack Snyder, how did you manage to ruin a SUPERMAN movie, HOW?!? Shame on you! My recommendation, don't watch this movie and if you do, don't watch it with high hopes, terrible movie!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Stunning, Moving, Epic","""I believe that what Zack has done in Man of Steel will define Superman for our time."" - Christopher NolanThere is something about this movie that makes me emotional. Perhaps it's because it speaks to me on so many levels. For starters, growing up as a Superman fan, it's awesome seeing how this movie makes him come to life. It's beautiful and it's epic. I swear it never gets old watching Cavil's Superman take flight. One of my all time favorite scenes from any superhero movie will forever be when Clark first learns to fly. The visuals, the sounds, the boyish wonder and joy that Cavill displays... it's wonderful. Some moments look so good I kept rewinding to watch them again.The movie as a whole looks huge and expensive. I would even say on such a scale as 2012's The Avengers. The battles are big and destructive and the display of power and super abilities is impressive. I like that Snyder kept it real and wasn't afraid to show that this fight had many civilian casualties. It brings a heaviness and seriousness to the whole situation, and really sets up the following Batman v Superman film.It has the perfect tone for a superhero movie. It's not a silly superhero comedy that can't be taken seriously, it's not a dark drama like Joker that's hard to enjoy, and it's not a mindless action film like Black Adam. It's a mature action/ adventure with emotional depth and thrilling superhero action sequences. There's a great balance kept between the action and the storytelling sequences. I love how Snyder handled the flashbacks to Clark's upbringing and the scenes before Clark discovers his identity. It portrays a kind, good-hearted man just trying to find himself, and helping people along the way. The color, the mood, the music, and the content of these sequences make them feel unique and interesting. The artistic creativity is beautiful and no overdone.There's a lot of heartwarming moments between Clark and his parents, who by the way, are excellently cast. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are fantastic in these roles. No, I don't love how they changed Jonathan Kent's cause of death, but I paid close attention to this character during this most recent watch, and I understand him better now. Knowing better what he feared and what was most important to him, his mindset and actions don't seem so unreasonable to me anymore. He's raising, to his knowledge, the only alien on the planet. Clark's identity being discovered would in reality, change the world, perhaps in a very harmful way. Kevin Costner plays this character in a way that reminded me a little of his Yellowstone character. He's a strong and thoughtful man with strong convictions and you can't help but admire him.Everyone in this movie is so well cast. There isn't a single misstep. Amy Adams nails it as Lois Lane, and Henry Cavill is the ultimate Superman. Since the 1990s, we've had 5 men play this character, but it's like Cavill was born for this. The only other one who comes close to him is Christopher Reeves, who was the Superman of his time, just like Cavill is the Superman of our time. He doesn't just look the part, he embodies this character. Cavill displays raw emotion, grit, humility, quiet confidence, a sense of humor, and a strong sense of right and wrong.It is an absolute waste that Man of Steel will likely be the only Superman solo film we ever get with this perfectly cast Superman.With Hans Zimmer composing, Man of Steel unsurprisingly has one of the most beautiful and memorable superhero movie scores I've heard. There are dramatic scenes where the music fuels the emotion in such a powerful way, it reminded me of the 2010 masterpiece, Inception.You can't fully appreciate Man of Steel if you miss the Christian symbolism. I was moved by the imagery of Jesus Christ. It really helped me wrap my head around people's different reactions to Superman. Jesus came to earth and was mostly rejected and hated as an outsider. People celebrated Him when they thought He was fighting their enemies for them, but not long after, those who saw Him as a threat killed Him. There's a scene in Man of Steel where Clark tells the Feds, ""You're scared of me because you can't control me. You don't, and you never will, but that doesn't mean I'm your enemy."" Superman wearing handcuffs during this scene is a stark image as he surrenders himself to mankind. They are only able to do to him what he allows them to do. Do you see the symbolism? In the scene where the symbolism is most obvious, Jar-El tells Kal that he can save Lois, and also that he can save everyone. Superman then proceeds to float away with his arms spread wide and his feet together in an obvious picture of the Savior on the cross. He's also 33 in this movie. Jesus was 33 when He was crucified. As someone of the faith myself, I thought all of this symbolism was beautiful and very creatively and expertly filmed and written into the story. Hollywood isn't always very kind or fair to people of the faith, so it's refreshing and moving to see such Christian symbolism in such a big movie.Man of Steel is much more than a simple superhero movie. I think people struggle to understand why Zack Snyder has such a big fan base and why they fight for his vision for DC movies. Man of Steel is a perfect picture of why. He so thoughtfully and passionately poured so much depth and beauty into this movie. He handled it with such care. He deserved the chance to finish what he started.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

(Superman did not even spit blood!) This is rather disappointing especially when Henry was the superman this time...Since there were not enough fighting scenes, those SFX and spaceships made the whole film looked like an E.T. film.

Disappointed,"I had high expectations going into this and so wanted to love it. I was so disappointed in the overall plot and left feeling that there was way to much time spent on the demise of Krypton, how the boy got to earth etc. For almost the first 1/2 hour it was all about putting the baby in a pod and sending him off. The other disappointing factor for me was the sci-fi aspect. Way. Too. Much. With. The. Spaceships. If that is something you really like then I think you would enjoy the many, many battle sequences but for myself, I just wanted to see Superman grow up and become the hero he is.

I blame the director for wanting more action and not the lead character. Regardless, Henry Cavil is definitely the right man for the job. He not only looks like the former 1978 Superman star, but is a very good actor too! His American Ascent over his native British ascent is almost unnoticeable, while he certainly brought in a new, real dimension to the role.

the critics are crazy.,"Don't listen to the critics. I'm not sure if it's an elitist agenda against Snyder as a film maker or just nostalgic cinema fans who can't let go of the ""charming boy scout"" that set precedent over 20 years ago in Donner's camp-filled classic... but whatever the reason- Man of Steel is undeserving of the lackluster critical response it's receiving.This is EASILY one of the best superhero entries in film. No, this isn't your parent's Superman.. This is not golden or silver age Superman- THIS is for every kid that watched Bruce Tim's ""Adventures of Superman"" and ""Justice League"" or the DC animated films like ""Doomsday"" or ""Crisis on two earths"" and said ""why can't we see THIS Superman live action?!"" This is for anyone who watched Matrix and said ""now... why can't we have a Superman that does this?"" (no.. i'm not saying it's like the matrix- at all) Now, i'm not a crier- especially at movie... but, this one had me a FEW times. There's a strong emotional thread that runs through the picture. As you follow this character who can't quite find his place, doesn't quite fit in- yet has a heart for people... a true good Samaritan, who even in the face of mockers risks his own life (to his knowledge) to save them... protect them.. you empathize with him. The critics have it wrong- Clark's not dour in this movie, he's humble. He's patient and compassionate. It's not apathy he's displaying... it's a disciplined reserve. He's a man who's learned that his power and how he chooses to use it will define who he will become. The truth is, we're seeing Clark WHILE he's still discovering himself- still finding out what the consequences are when he uses his abilities and also when he chooses not to use his abilities. This is someone who's never been able to have a real relationship with anyone.(outside of his mom and dad) and throughout the course of the movie he learns to trust people- exemplified in one person that sees who he truly is, and is not only not afraid, but honors that trust. The small moments are emotional and tender (and despite what you may have read- sometimes humorous. The audience in my theater laughed at least 2 or 3 times, out loud), the big ones are exhilarating and bombastic. The battles are TRULY epic- with much at stake... This is OUR Superman... Snyder has successfully shaken the campy ""gee whiz"" and ""Crime doesn't pay, evil doer"" caricature and given us the Superman we grew up hoping that someday... someday someone would be able to deliver and they did- and it's here- Man of Steel. P.S. the entire audience loved the film, complete with applause at the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but it feels rushed.","Man of steel got so much hype. And for a good reason. It was a loud action filled blockbuster that is worth your time. But one major fault was that it felt rushed.The introduction to the movie was long, that's a good thing, but it lacked in the in depth detail to introduce us to the universe. I thought there could have been a little more talking and calmness in the film, only because I thought the amount of action was ridicules. It was fun action, and for that I didn't really care much about the plot.I also thought there was a bit of a CGI overhaul, but its Zack Snyder, it was expected.So all in all if you are looking for a Hollywood history moment like the Batman movies, then this is not your thing. But if you are looking for a bit of fun that is CGI infused, loud, all out action, a plot that you will lose interest in, then this is a film you might want to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

There was a TON of action, some of it may look a little ""Mortal Combat-ish"" because of the super fast movement and fighting. I don't want to give anything away but we'll just say they added some ""space stuff"" and it was awesome. thats where i think it differs greatly from the other superman's. but they didn't ruin it with that by any means, in fact i wish they could make a prequel off of this haha!

over complicated and rushed,"2 Min's into the movie I had a sinking feeling, actually when I heard Russell trying to sound intellectual I had a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. Then they threw in a bit from Avatar and the matrix for some reason some Prometeus was there too. And you could have tacked on that last half hour onto the Avengers or visa versa and you could hardly tell the difference. What about the ending ..""without his head he's powerless"".Superman should have being a no brainier, how can u not find a script, its there in 1979 and the one after and for god sakes take your time, you could have made 3 movies to get to the point where Superman has ended up in this one. Movie one origin, without that ridiculous krypton scene in Man of Steel (Marlon Brandos 5 Min's outclasses that whole 20min shambles. he lands family shelter him till hes able to control his powers then high school(loads of filling there for awkward teen who has the ability to kick ass but has to restrain himself), Mr Kent giving him pearls of wisdom along the way before he dies....naturally. Again the natural death of Mr Kent was important and much more profound that the tornado scene in MOS, it was an important lesson for superman and showed him to be much more vulnerable. Then he goes to figure out where hes from drawn to the crystal palace and gets his cape which I would have loved if Jor-el wrapped his son in before he puts him into the escape pod, again for me no brainier and its these little things that make a movie not skyscrapers falling down all over the place.Any way you could end there after he turns up in ,Metropolis save Louis Lane from some impending disaster in full super man outfit before turning up at the Daily planet for a job and she still doesn't know who he is.Movie two Superman doing his thing, Louis trying to figure out who he is, Lex Luther trying to harness his power all that stuff. loads of fun stuff including the iconic superman music changing persona etc.Movie 3, General Zod lands on planet earth and demands the Surrender of superman.Come on people.....",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"enjoyable, if a little loud","I saw this film with my grandson. I'm a Henry Cavill fan and was anxious to see how he did. He acquitted himself quite well, even to his American accent. I didn't mind the darkness of the film. It made sense that Kal would have a lot of questions about himself and his origins and the film did that well, I thought. The back and forth of time frames was a little off putting, but worked.If I have any criticism, it's that the battle scenes went on too long. They could have been cut back and the movie wouldn't have suffered for it. Also, it was the loudest film I've seen since the Who's Tommy and believe me ,that's saying something. I think that my ears were bleeding by the time the credits rolled. I would look forward to a sequel to see how Clark continues to try and fit in on Earth. I also liked Amy Adams portrayal of Lois Lane.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A joyless experience, Christopher Reeve is rolling in his grave","This is why i didn't even bother paying to see this stupid movie, I got a free ticket. all the movies today, even superhero movies, have sunk so low. they are all about stripping the heroes of everything that makes them good and generally awesome, and making them ""gritty"" and ""dark"". cmon, that's just stupid. cant BELIEVE they had the nerve to bring back a character that only Terence stamp is worthy to play. there wasn't even KNEEEEEEEEL BEFORE ZOD! it was just pathetic. i didn't like the new Batman's for the same reason i cannot enjoy this movie. they are all too serious, too lame, and no heart. I only went cuz a friend of mine wanted to see it, but judging from Nolan's name being attached to it, I knew all too well what to expect. I will never let a friend make me watch a movie i do not want to watch ever again after this! i will stick with the Chris reeve movies and the 50's superman TV show with George reeve if i need my superman fix. those are the TRUE representations of the character, and yes i even liked Superman Returns, which was a fitting end to the saga that Reeve started.

It's not the worst movie not not the best Zack Snyder work,"This movie has pacing issues but explores the Superman character pretty well. He doesn't really feel like Superman much in this movie, Cavill has the looks but not the script.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Superhero Ever,"""Man of Steel"" is a modern reimagining of the iconic Superman character, directed by Zack Snyder. This film revitalizes the legendary superhero with a fresh perspective, delivering an action-packed spectacle alongside compelling character development.One of the most impressive aspects of ""Man of Steel"" lies in its exceptional visual effects and jaw-dropping action sequences. The film's CGI is truly groundbreaking, making Superman's superhuman abilities come to life in a way never seen before on the big screen. From the breathtaking Kryptonian landscapes to the epic battles that redefine superhero action, the film is a visual treat that keeps audiences engaged from start to finish.Henry Cavill's portrayal of Clark Kent/Superman is a standout in this adaptation. Cavill brings a new depth and vulnerability to the character, making him relatable and human despite his extraordinary powers. His struggles with identity and the burden of his responsibilities as the last son of Krypton are explored in a heartfelt and poignant manner.The supporting cast adds strength to the narrative, with Amy Adams shining as the brave and intelligent Lois Lane, breaking away from the damsel-in-distress trope. Michael Shannon's General Zod is a formidable and menacing antagonist, adding tension and emotional stakes to the conflict.However, ""Man of Steel"" is not without its flaws. The film's pacing feels uneven at times, and some viewers may find the nonlinear storytelling approach confusing. Additionally, purists of the original Superman mythology might take issue with certain liberties taken in this retelling.Despite these minor drawbacks, ""Man of Steel"" successfully sets the stage for a new era of DC Comics films. It lays the groundwork for the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and sets a darker and more serious tone than previous Superman adaptations.In conclusion, ""Man of Steel"" revitalizes the Superman franchise, blending awe-inspiring action sequences with a fresh take on Clark Kent's journey to becoming a hero. Henry Cavill's powerful performance, combined with outstanding visual effects, makes it a must-watch for superhero enthusiasts and general audiences alike. While not a flawless film, its strengths undoubtedly outweigh the weaknesses, making it a worthy addition to the superhero movie canon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Way ahead of its time, better than the original","This is more than a Superman remake...it re-tells the entire Superman story in a much darker tone, with a stellar cast, brilliant script, with an amazing Hans Zimmer soundtrack, and enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film. I watched Man of Steel numerous times shortly after its 2013 release, and it's as good today as it was in 2013. Very entertaining from start to finish. Not a dull moment. Flows beautifully from beginning to end, begins beautifully and has an incredible action-packed ending. Even if you were a die-hard fan of the 1980s Superman originals, Man of Steel is an entirely new, darker and more exciting experience compared to the originals.Zack Snyder created a masterpiece with this film. Amy Adams is an excellent Lois Lane, Henry Cavill fits the Superman role like a glove. Russell Crowe is the perfect Jor-El, and Diane Lane/Kevin Costner further add to the excellence of the acting and cast of this movie. Man of Steel is up near the top of my favorite DC movies. It's the most polished, best scripted/acted, and most action-packed of any of the DC movies, in my opinion. I grew up as a kid watching Superman in the 1980s, and Man of Steel blew me away almost 30 years later. This adaptation of Superman is the by and large above the rest. One of the most rewarding aspects of this film was watching my oldest son fall in love with this movie when he was just 6 years old. It remains one of his favorites to this day, as a 13 yr old.Bravo and well-done to Zack Snyder and the entire cast of Man of Steel. It's a Legendary film. If you haven't seen, rent it asap. I have not rated a film on IMDB as a 10 until this review, Man of Steel is well deserving of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I was excited about the release of this movie and i thought it was going to be amazing since it was going to be produced by the powerful Christopher Nolan. But i remember that producers only have the task of promoting the film and helping it come out as a visually striking film which it was from my point of view. In conclusion:It's a must see since it's Superman but it will never compare to the work of art that is the trilogy of Batman DIRECTED by Christopher Nolan.This movie deserves a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Forgot How Great This Was,"I saw this when it came out and remember liking it at the time, but mostly forgot about the film. Now I'm watching it a decade later after seeing the Flash movie. This movie is by far one of the best DC superhero movies. Henry Cavill is great, conveying a lot more emotion than Christopher Reeves ever did. Kevin Costner is phenomenal as Jonathan Kent, even tho he has barely any screen time. For being only in the film maybe 5 total minutes, you connect with the character and feel saddened when he goes. Russel Crow is also amazing as Jor El. He too barely had much screen time, yet he clearly knew how to make the most of it. He is very charismatic and humble, and although an alien to us you can't help instinctually trust him and know his motives are pure. Likewise the brief scenes of Krypton are amazing. A world that looks both a utopia yet also very alien compared to Earth.The story all around is very good, dark but real. This at the time gave the film a much needed contrast from the more upbeat Marvel movies, and still makes the movie stand out today. This is hammered home with the villain Zod. He is evil and yet very understandable. Yes he wants to wipe out all of humanity via terraforming the Earth. And yet you understand him. He isn't evil for the sake of evil. He is a survivor, the last of his people who wants to keep his species (Kryptonians) alive and will do anything to achieve that. You could say Zod and Jor El are two sides of the same coin, both wanting to save the Krytonain race albeit through very different means.My only complaint is Amy Adams, and I had this same complaint when I saw the movie back in 2013. She is not Lois Lane. She doesn't even try. Lois Lane has black hair, she is slender, she has a very thick City accent, speaking quickly yet eloquently. Amy Adams by contrast refused to dye her hair for this film, which is odd considering she's gone from blonde to redhead to brunette depending on the role. She also has a little bit of southern accent and talks very bubbly and slow, not at all like the fast talking big city girl Lane is. Every time I saw Amy Adams, I saw only Amy Adams from Disenchantment, not Lois Lane. She is by far the worst Lois Lane there ever was, and yes that includes adult rated Supergirl parody ""Mrs Magnificent"" that sued for copyright infringement.It's a shame DC never created a strong movie franchise like Marvel because it would've been amazing to see this version of Superman get the proper arch it deserved.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Inconsistent,"An interesting but inconsistent reboot of the Superman franchise, Man of Steel definitely better than Superman Returns but there's nothing that different or new here to make it worth the time. This new script places a lot of emphasis on the Krypton story, with a long introduction segment with Russell Crowe who does a solid job as Jor-El, and Michael Shannon who provides a very good and human General Zod.On the plus side, Henry Cavill is the best Superman since Reeve and he gives the character a lot of humanity as well as charisma; although, the Clark Kent persona doesn't appear until the end, and I'm not sure he can pull that off. Amy Adams, on the other hand, is very vanilla as Lois Lane, bringing none of the character's zest or passion into the role. Since she's already in love with Clark and knows who he is, we don't even have the sexual tension to look forward to in the sequel. The script isn't as flawed as other Nolan films but it's still messy; visually, it looks good but not as stunning as other Snyder films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's 2023 and this is STEEL a great movie,"I decided to sit and watched this 10 years... YES 10 YEARS after it was made.

He had it all for this role.Michael Shannon is an impressive General Zod - who surprisingly had his role reprised for the future movies.There's so much to enjoy and I feel this film was wrongfully slated by far too many people.If you haven't seen this is a while, give it another go... its well worth remembering this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing.,"There were parts I really liked, and then there were parts - large parts - that, simply-put, sucked.Let me put it this way: remember those scenes in Family Guy where Peter Griffin runs into his giant chicken nemesis and a long, perpetual brawl breaks out that pretty much destroys everything in its path? Well, imagine that punch-fest drawn out for over an hour, and that's basically most of what you'll see when watching Man of Steel, albeit with more elaborate and over-the-top effects. It gets boring after the first minute. And then gets endlessly repeated.The script is incoherent with plenty of logic flaws to pick at. Characters that aren't Kryptonian seem to have teleportation abilities or seem to have a suspicious habit of finding themselves in constant peril for no apparent reason other than to give the supposed hero an added challenge. Which brings up the nagging question of whether he's ultimately responsible for all the destruction.Hans Zimmer's score sounded awesome in the trailer. Pity it didn't make an appearance until the end credits. Even now, I'm not sure what the new Superman theme is supposed to sound like. Certainly nowhere as recognisable as the Williams masterpiece. Not a fault of Zimmer mind you, more likely just poor sound editing.If you've seen the third trailer, then honestly, you've already seen the best version of this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Amy Adams was most definitely a miscast. There was no humor throughout the film....far too serious for my liking. The Tornado in this film was so fake!

Failed Attempt ..! Fell short of Expectation ...!,"Snyder, whose best films are 2004's ­adrenalized Dawn of the Dead remake and 2007's hyper­stylized Spartan saga 300, has teamed up with producer Christopher Nolan to give us a cooler, more conflicted Superman. But their Dark Knight-style makeover never quite comes ­together.The story falls into two halves and sometimes feels at odds with each other in its attempt to connect the two. The first half standing as a origin story heavily rooted in science fiction. We see the final days of a fully realized Krypton, as Jor-El (Russell Crowe) fends off fascist General Zod's (Michael Shannon) rebellion and places the last hope for the Krypton's existence in the hands of his infant son, Kal-El. Once on Earth, the story follows Clark Kent, Earth's surrogate son and would-be superhero Messiah, as he journeys to find the hidden answers to why he was placed on our planet. His childhood is relived through a series of flashbacks triggered by images Clark witnesses around him, which interrupted the movie flow a lot.The second half is a punch-heavy parade of action as Snyder digs deep into what he knows best, but in this case its a heavy overdose and u feel like punching Snyder. Meanwhile you learn vital things, like what the ""S"" on the Superman costume stands for.Redundant, unnecessary and a colossal waste of talent and money, you can pretty much sum up Man of Steel in the scene in which a lady police officer watches with her mouth wide open as Superman tosses aside tanks like Tinker Toys. ""What are you smiling about, captain?"" asks another cop. ""Nothing, sir—I just think he's hot.""Wait For the DVD ..!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Snyder's Reboot Sucks out Superman's Soul,"It was indeed a long time ago that I sat down to watch 'Man of Steel' and I remained stunned throughout its runtime. Stunned at how dull, dumb and lifeless the film was! Is this truly Superman's return to form? I strongly doubt it. It was the first Superman film I saw, but now that I have watched the five other instalments I can compare them. The first two films that starred Christopher Reeve in the title role remain classics of the superhero genre that stand almost head to head with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. The other two should not even be mentioned in the same paragraph. 'Superman Returns' on the other hand was a loving tribute to the late 70s and early 80s Superman that we all know and love.It is in the great tradition of reboots to try to distance themselves from the last reiteration as much as possible. Apparently that now includes making the film as dull and dreary as can be. Superman is a character who stands for ""truth, justice and the American way"". There is nothing to suggest any of this in 'Man of Steel'. With Zack Snyder showing no love or appreciation for his wide and varied source material. This time around Superman faces off against Zod! Wait didn't that happen with powerful consequences in 'Superman II'? Yes it did. Why Snyder did not choose to tell another villain's mythology is actually beyond anyone's comprehension.Let me start from the beginning. The film opens and it is literally beat for beat the same as the opening for 1978's 'Superman', albeit with a much higher budget and production values. We see Krypton, which is now a twisted darker version of Avatar's Pandora world. Then we are introduced to Jor El played with affection by Russell Crowe, God bless the man, he still tries his best even when the film surrounding him is poor. Oh dear, and Michael Shannon as General Zod hamming it all up; at least he doesn't give a damn. Baby Kal El is then sent to Earth in a thirty minute sequence which is the only glimpse of a heart in the whole film. Thirteen year old Clark Kent does not know who he wants to be and becomes feared and rejected.Kids do not want to be seen with a freak who saves a bus load of children from drowning. He looks to his parents for love. Even Kevin Costner displays emotion as Jonathan Kent. I was actually enjoying the film up until the point where Superman dons the cape. It all goes downhill from there. We are then treated to endless talking, at this point the film feels like it has lasted a lifetime. But hey wake up the action scenes have started! Oh my, they are appalling. They go on forever and consist of Superman beating the living daylights out of Zod. Then throwing him into nearby buildings full of innocent civilians. What does old Superman stand for now eh? Lies, injustice and an American death? Well that's the lasting impression that Snyder gives us.Cavill does a fine job in the role as Superman, but it is nothing like Reeves who effortlessly blended confidence and nerdiness when taking on the dual role and personality traits of Superman and Clark Kent. Hans Zimmer is no John Williams, but still reaches into his inner self to provide the best element of 'Man of Steel', a soaring score. Williams' theme would have been completely misplaced with all the death and destruction taking place in the background. So at least his legacy has not been destroyed, just Superman's.The ending is atrocious and laughable at best. Does Superman have any morale whatsoever? Because Snyder does everything in his power as a director to try and show that he possesses none. In this day and age we have seen a variety of superheroes with relationships; Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, Tony Stark and Pepper Potts, Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes, well briefly at least. I have found memories of Margot Kidder playing Lois Lane. Amy Adams is unfortunately an uninspired casting choice and even looks like she has no wish to be there. I kept on hoping that her character would walk off screen but to no avail. Snyder has not just destroyed my Superman, he has blown to smithereens my Grandfather's as well.Snyder has adopted the 'Batman Begins' approach to Superman. By doing so he has ended up in losing the superhero's appeal, essence and my interest. He has stripped down old Superman to the most boring hero imaginable. The villainous Zod feels like a complete retread, especially when 'Superman II' handled him so superbly. Maybe next time Superman will soar or actually save some innocent civilians, restoring his former glory in the process. For the moment though, Superman flies no more.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie. Great Potential for Sequels.,"First, for all the people concerned about negative reviews from critics, I can tell you that critics' reviews are not always a measure to depend on; it's as if the majority went into the movie hating it already either because they are too defensive of and attached to the Donner/Reeve's Superman, or because they simply hate Zack Snyder (Check the 300 movie reviews and judge for yourself).Second, the movie itself. Man of Steel above all is a great foundation for sequels. This is the Batman Begins of the TDK trilogy: it's not the best movie of the 3, but surely TDK wouldn't have gone anywhere without its foundation and intro in Batman Begins.In Action terms, this movie contains the Action that Superman Returns lacked. Yes, it might get a bit overwhelming at the very end but it's nothing close to boring. The same critics that wanted more action in Superman Returns are the ones that are hating it in Man Of Steel, absurd don't you think?Man of Steel presents an impressive back story that is played out well by Crowe and Shannon. Cavill is a great Superman, he's everything I could've envisioned. Lois has good screen chemistry with Superman, definitely something to weigh on in sequels. Although some other characters felt a little under-developed, it was irrelevant because the movie was keeping me busy and interested between action and conversation scenes. Also I'm sure that Goyer/Nolan are delaying some characters' development to when they will need it more in the follow-up movies. Man of Steel has a couple of scenes to weigh down the action while playing on human values and emotions; you get to see what Superman's really going through in terms of identity crisis and what makes him a human/alien. Coupled with the great music of Hans Zimmer, you will definitely be moved in those scenes.All in all, don't miss this movie; go in and enjoy it because it is exactly that, an enjoyable Superman Movie; something unfamiliar to the old superman cartoonish take, but still well worthy of its title.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"An important, albeit imperfect, game-changing chapter of the Superman saga","Zack Snyder's superhero spectacle serves as an epic and often overwhelming response to those who criticized Superman Returns for playing it too safe. There is no doubt that Man of Steel stands as the definitive Superman film in terms of action, transcending our wildest expectations of what we ever hoped to see Superman capable of. Unfortunately, and despite an incredible ensemble, the film relies too much on that notion, forfeiting restraint and levity in favor of a special effects overkill that chokes the story in its final act.The story falls into two halves and sometimes feels at odds with each other in its attempt to connect the two. The first half standing as a origin story heavily rooted in science fiction. We see the final days of a fully realized Krypton, as Jor-El (Russell Crowe) fends off fascist General Zod's (Michael Shannon) rebellion and places the last hope for the Krypton's existence in the hands of his infant son, Kal-El. Once on Earth, the story follows Clark Kent, Earth's surrogate son and would-be superhero Messiah, as he journeys to find the hidden answers to why he was placed on our planet. His childhood is relived through a series of flashbacks triggered by images Clark witnesses around him.The second half is a punch-heavy parade of action as Snyder digs deep into what he knows best. Shannon's turn as Zod provides a perfect counter to Cavill's Superman as the insanely loyal and genocidal General. The Kryptonian outcast brings out the fire in Superman, ultimately forcing him to wrestle with an extremely heartbreaking decision. Shannon's scenes with Crowe also merit attention, as the two wax philosophical with theories on how to save their race. Antje Traue backs Zod's ferocity as Faora-Ul, Zod's ruthless and lightning fast sidekick, and chews up scenery in many of the film's best fights. And my God there are a lot of them. The film ends on a lighter note, promising the opportunity for an expanded relationship between Lois and Clark, as well as a new vocation and warm welcome to the Planet (Double entendre intended).Henry Cavill deserves all the praise bestowed upon him. His interpretation of Clark/Superman is complex and hits all the right notes, bringing to light many of the emotions that remained absent in previous translations of Superman. Yes, he is introspective at times but the response is understandable given his life experiences. This is a ghost of a man who has disconnected from the world, carrying a heavy burden as he honors his surrogate father's request to wait until the right time to reveal himself. We haven't reached the point in Clark's trajectory as a superhero where he can enjoy life on Earth. There are much more important matters to attend to. It isn't until he meets Lois Lane that he learns to trust a human independent of his family. In many ways, Lois saves Superman as much as he does her. All of Cavill's moments on-screen are remarkable, whether he is offering sensible and sweet dialogue to Lois Lane or Ma Kent, or when he is finally unleashing years of pent-up aggression towards Zod. If there's one complaint to be made regarding his character, it's that we're missing the lighthearted notes Reeve offered as Kent, but that has more to do with the story and is of no fault to Cavill. He emerges as a worthy Superman for a new generation.With that said, the story's faster than a speeding bullet pacing prevents Man of Steel from truly rising above the clouds and suffers from the law of diminishing returns. A non-stop explosion extravaganza may sound thrilling to anyone who found Superman Returns to be impotent, but trust me when I tell you it gets to be a tedious exercise. The first time you see Superman battle Zod and his army, your mind will be blown. After over an hour of seeing two essentially equally powered titans smash through skyscraper after skyscraper in the destruction of Metropolis, it's hard not to feel a bit concussed. Man of Steel offers everything we've ever wanted to see in Superman as a powered-up superhero, but it also could use a little less brawn in favor of some brains. We're also never really given an explanation as to how Superman, who has little experience as a fighter, can match a battle-tested General. Zod evens asks as much. Christopher Nolan struggled with fight scenes in the Batman franchise but you at least got to see Bruce Wayne cut his teeth on way to becoming the Caped Crusader. But it's Superman so we'll give him a pass.Overall, Man of Steel deserves credit for being its own film and refusing to yield to its predecessors. It's not without its slip-ups but you have to respect Snyder for having the heart to take risks. The film puts the Superman franchise back on course, will make Warner Bros. tons of money and finally offers Batman a worthy ally in the Justice League movie that waits further down the road. If Snyder and Goyer can let off the gas once in a while and lighten the tone up a little bit, allowing the sequel to breathe, they just might have what it takes to offer a chapter in the Superman saga that rivals The Dark Knight. That alone should be enough to motivate you to see the film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Snyder brings back Superman franchise into his version,"This is a Superman movie that fans are waiting for. 'Man of Steel is one of the most thrilling and coolest movie I've seen this year. The movie opens with loud and promising story about how Kal-El was sent to earth. The plot itself is quite fast though, not what everyone think that it would be long introducing of character like 'Batman Begins' did. 'Man of Steel' tells Clark's childhood by doing flashback that is clear enough for audience. And the last 1 hour action of the movie is just epic. The action scenes really thrill, it makes something that you won't ever forget and miss this summer. Henry Cavill is satisfying as Superman, he's absolutely more fit than Brandon Routh although there's no challenging line for him.The weakest part of this movie is their plot and storyline. The storyline is silly, predictable, too hurry and just a formality that would guide to a non-stop action climax. Don't expect the storyline would be as complex as Christopher Nolan's Batman cause it's totally not. The other character is also not introduced well especially Lois Lane character that appears too sudden and many coincidences, and Perry White character could be acted by any actors besides Laurence Fishburne. May be Zack Snyder doesn't want to make same mistakes like 'Superman Returns' did. It's rather impossible to focus on storyline while he wants to create a full action movie especially in the first franchise. That's acceptable why most critics hate this movie, it's definitely because of mess storyline that really matters for them. It seems 'Man of Steel' have two sides of audience here. Audience who minds a solid and structured storyline would disappoint of 'Man of Steel'. But, audience who seeks an entertaining and massive action sequences are gonna love it. For me, Zack Synder has succeeded to open a promising franchise from one of the oldest Superhero in history for fans and non-fans with a spectacular and punches action scenes although it's a little bit exhausting in the middle. Hopefully the sequel would focus on a relationship between Superman and Lois Lane which doesn't happen in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Just go see it for yourself, you won't be disappointed!","I just got back, and wow, let me tell you.. This is not only the Superman movie we've all wanted, but its one of the best comic book movies I have ever seen. This is a very serious take on the character of Superman, but don't worry, it has its mild laughs. You should walk into this movie with complete disregard towards the Donner films or else, yeah, you'll be pretty disappointed. Wipe the slate clean and enjoy it! If I had to tell people about this movie, I'd say its a mix between a science-fiction film and an action movie. Combine the sci-fi elements of Star Trek or Prometheus with the grounded/realistic tone of the Dark Knight trilogy and you have Man of Steel.The visuals are absolutely breathtaking and these are some of the best action scenes I have ever seen. This movie made The Avengers look dinky. The casting choices were also brilliant. Great performances from everyone, notably Henry Cavill & Russell Crowe. Zack Snyder put his blood, sweat and tears into this movie and props go to him for that. This is his best movie and he has seriously just entered the ""even bigger"" leagues of action directors. And for those of who thought David Goyer coudn't write a script, you were wrong! Chris Nolan didn't have much to do with this movie, and its pretty noticeable, not much to say about that.My hopes were high for this movie but I was still blown away. In my opinion, this was a much better movie than this years Iron Man 3, and much better than some other recent reboot titles such as the Amazing Spider-Man.

Basic first movie that potentially well-developed in next sequel,"I will say that when I was watching this movie, I had no expectation. I'm not like a DC or marvel fans etc. I like a lot the dark knight, but it's not just because the 'batman' but because the film is no doubt making a good quality.watching some aliens, fighting each other, crushing all over the place, there's the win there's the loose. oh wait, also some deep story of free will human concept, deep background of 'man of steel' it self, and a very good introducing to the people in common for loving this 'next-wannabe-trilogy or sequels'.I must say that I never read any superman's comics, but then I feel like I so knew about him after I watched this movie. This movie is a complete package of super hero movie. and yes, I was feeling satisfied when this movie was started to end. And now even I am still thinking of the movie, and cannot wait for the sequel. :D",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fatastically great film!,"I think this film is one of the best superman films ever and the second best DCEU film after Aquaman, it transforms superman from a superhero for babies with crap dialogue ( "" stop right there evildoer"" ""I will stop you robber"") to a superman for teenagers which is a great result and his origin fits perfectly.
Pros-greatly visualised fight scenes.
Extremely great ending.
Entertaining.
Great new personality change of superman
Awesome music.
Tells superman's origin story in the best, most efficient way.Cons-They should have found some other way to defeat Zod except for getting him killed by KAL.
Clark does not change his personality from a tough guy to a wimp as Clark Kent to keep his secret identity.But the movie is so good that I don't care a about the cons, its still great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Where's the fun?,"Man of Steel is the newest remake of the Superman franchise, it stands decently enough on its own two feet and Henry Cavill is a good enough actor to play Superman but my biggest issue with the film is it's just not fun enough, there's no goofy Clark Kent, silly one liners or hilarious villainy, it's just a run of the mill serious action movie.Plot wise it combines both the first and second Superman films in the original Reeve series and it works well enough, it's a little darker than I would have liked and obviously needed more humour injected in my opinion but it works well plot wise, and the action is top tier. Acting wise Cavill is fine, if a bit too serious and Amy Adams as Lois is passable and Michael Shannon as General Zod is alright but not as good as Terence Stamp, acting wise it's overall fairly good but not brilliant. The music is very clever with Hans Zimmer at the frame and is definitely a positive to the film.6/10: Fairly decent overall but I expected better to be honest",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The New Superman - a modern look at the greatest hero,"To be honest, I didn't really wait for this movie, being very impressed by Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. For some reason, I thought that such a furore could not be repeated by director Zack Snyder, unknown to me at that time. Oh, how I changed my mind after I left the cinema. Snyder gave the world a great Man of Steel.What immediately catches the eye is the thoughtful world of the planet Krypton, where the film meets the viewer. It is clear with what love the director approached the project. He showed, albeit briefly, but the utopian world that is doomed to perish. Beautiful futuristic scenery and costumes, its own culture of relationships between characters - all this perfectly demonstrates an alien world.The characters are perfectly spelled out, you understand the motivation of everyone. Superman feels like an outcast, a loner, an outsider. Throughout the film, the viewer sees how he is trying to find his place in an alien world, where he is essentially god.General Zod is a great villain. Snyder and the screenwriters perfectly showed his motivation, desire to save and revive his home. After all, as he himself declares, this is his main mission in this world.Lois Lane is just fine. Contrary to popular opinion based on comics, here the journalist appears to be a rather modest person. However, she is ready to stand up for her interests, enter into the position of others and empathize. Amy Adams is great in this role. The actress shows a completely unusual Lois, it's interesting to look at her.Clark's parents, played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, demonstrate exactly what is expected of them on the screen. They prepare their son for the human world as best they can and try to protect him from all adversities. Clark's relationship with his father and their evolution are well shown. As a result, you realize for yourself that with age such a connection only grows stronger. And if conflicts are frequent in adolescence, then closer to thirty Clark misses his father very much, he lacks his wise advice.The visual component is beyond praise. Snyder has always shown himself to be a great visionary. Every frame, every scene - everything is verified and perfect. The presence of computer effects organically fit into the whole picture of the narrative. The viewer is watching a fantastic movie and is absolutely ready to see what the creators offer him.The musical accompaniment from my beloved Hans Zimmer is great. As always, he bypassed himself by creating a futuristic, slightly apocalyptic soundtrack that flows into the necessary scenes with powerful notes. However, there are also very soft melodies that are immediately associated with the parents of a superhero, a farm and something at home.The film is involuntarily compared to the classic pictures about Superman. And although Christopher Reeve was great in this image, Henry Cavill presented it perfectly. His Superman perfectly demonstrates modernity, he is young and hot, still little experienced, but still on guard of justice.The film looks in one breath, the timing of almost two and a half hours is not felt. The story is great, it gives a great start to the whole cinematic universe and looks great as an independent completed story.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"What Was Good Was Good, What Was Too Long Was Too Long","What is it with some producers these days? There are those who seem to suffer from a no shut off valve ailment. Trust me, long doesn't necessarily equate to better. Take this movie as a good example. Had about an hour of never-ending battles been cut from this film, it would have beenwellsuper. As it was, it seemed like just another villain who will not, can not, die epic. The casting is perfect. Every single character was portrayed by the right actor and actress. No quarrel with that part. But the battles and fights that seemed a constant assault on the senses were over-load. I attended this movie with a friend who is a true to the bone Superman fan, has never, nor would ever, miss a single movie about Superman...and even she came away from this one unhappy.

Good Intentions Lost,"While trying to remain impartial to many mainstream superhero movies, I found the new installation of superman, too hard not to leave the cinema feeling anger at this nonsensical, disjointed mess.Zak Snyder's brings along his usual aesthetic charm, which works on many levels and is possibly one of the only saving graces of the film. But once we get over the design of the film we are left with a feeling of emptiness. An emptiness that allows no character to develop and no character relationship to flourish. Instead we are manipulate into emotional falseness by an over relying score. With Christopher Nolan on-board we are introduced to flashbacks which worked so well in the Batman movies, but here the flashback's fail due to the lack of authenticity or fluidity.Outwith the before mentioned CGI and look of the film, the only pass marks go to Kevin Costner and Micheal Shannon who brings along his usual antihero prowess with great coolness and composure.With the building blocks now pathetically in place lets hope the next chapter can now develop into something much more complexly engaging.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best. Superman. Anything.,"Just to let you know, i am a die-hard superman fan. I love the Donner Movies and I have kept up with the comics as well as Smallville for all 10 seasons. This movie was better than all. First off, for you Smallville fans, the guy that played Lex's clone in season 10 , and the actor the actor that played Hamilton are both in this movie. As well as Amy Adams of course. For the Most part, this movie sticks with the traditional Superman Story. For the minor changes, i think they are for the better. The movie goes more into detail about Krypton, and at the end of this movie, you sort of feel sorry for Zod. But CAVILL. IS. SUPERMAN. He has the Personality of Reeve and the Whit of Dean Cain and the Charm and Overall he reminds me of Tom Welling throughout the whole movie.

"Not the best, but not the worst. Above average. An honest review","The trouble with any superman story is he is virtually impossible to kill and therefore loses a lot of excited in the plot. We all know he can't be killed. But by god this film could potentially contain some mind blowing set pieces. I mean Neo from the matrix rescuing Morpheus on top of truck on the freeway in Matrix Reloaded, for me is the nearest thing to Superman (and that was filmed about 10 years ago) to say that 'MoS' ten years on did not have set pieces is somewhat a sad but true statement.There's Lots of noisy explosions and plenty of pleasing building blowing up eye candy. The fight scenes in smallville and metropolis was very repetitive ( a lot of throwing body's through the wall) but impressive but nothing we haven't seen before.The biggest problem for me was that the action was too fast, way too fast, blink and you'll miss it.The music was brilliant until it started to grind and repeat itself after the first hour and a half.God I wanted to so like this film and like the dark knight rises I was (and still) so disappointed. The acting was good M Shannon's character is flawless and Henry C's innocence is perfect and then we have Amy's next door Lois lane is spot on and the older actors were all great.Superb flash back scenes of the younger Clark Kent but batman begins already did that 7 years ago, nothing new here but the excellent flash back scenes gels the story together seamlessly.I've read some 1 star reviews on IMDb and I think that these review are very very unfair and absolutely wrong but giving the film 10 stars is also wrong. 6.5, maybe even a 7 out of ten I'd say. Worst bits- action way too fast and repetitive. Best bits- flash backs of young Kent at school and at his teenage life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Solid Superman Origin Story,"Writer David Goyer re-imagines a Superman where he is an emo child who does amazing feats as his school friends look on. Now the idea is that though they report this child as having insane strength and odd behavior, he attempts to blend in with the crowd. The issue here, I feel, is they really lack the sentimental sensibility of the '78 Superman. The casting is off. Kevin Costner is no Pa Kent. And Diane Lane is no Martha. But the most glaring issue is Henry Cavil as the titular character. Superman, is a true innocent. The way Christopher Reeve played him was pitch perfect. Sweet, clumsy and endearing. Unfortunately, the too-cool-for-school crowd seems to think this version needs him to be Conan. Director Zack Snyder OR Henry doesn't seem to think that wholesomeness is modern day digestible. So the result is a harder edge version which seems off-putting. I'm not saying they needed to ape Reeve's version, but I was very saddened to see Clark not be that Kansas kid. Ideally, Cavil probably should've spent time in Kansas to see how they really are like. But again, it's most likely the time period. Pushed up to the 90's, according to the music choice.I also think Russell Crowe's Jor-El seemed too...forced. Marlon Brando had a presence that played better for making declarative statements. In Crowe's version, he seemed to be re-enacting ""Gladiator"" His harder edge was simply to match Michael Shannon's General Zod (he is no Terence Stamp).I don't know, perhaps I'm too married to the best one.The story itself is great though. Trying for the survival of Krypton whilst debating Earth's existence is fascinating. And done really well. The structure of that story was fantastic! And I'm sure much debate will be held of the end battle between Superman and Zod.The film runs a little too long. The city battle scene gives you too much time to realize the absolute destruction of Metropolis and all the people who perished during the melee. It hurts the stomach to realize how much was destroyed. Just because you have CG doesn't mean you need to use it. And sure, they address this in ""Superman v. Batman"" but still...a small moment where Superman calls Zod out of the city to do battle may have been a better choice. There is also the conversation about Superman as an alien. And because of his power, would he be their enemy? They brush past this because they knew they would address it in other installations. So it seemed trivia. Especially the end. After all the destruction, an inserted scene (felt like) of a general explaining why they are spying on him or his whereabouts. This seemed to fit better probably earlier in the movie.Any way, it's a really solid Superman. But just had a few nagging thoughts while watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Say What You Will, I Thought It Was Great","I'm going to start this review off by saying that most people to review this movie have COMPLETELY over analyzed it.

To those viewers I would just like to apologize for them not having their expectations of a ""The Notebook"" version of Superman met. If I'm going to see a movie directed by Zack Snyder I'm not planning on seeing a romance film. Especially if that film is a Superman remake. I thought the action scenes were great, I felt Cavill played the role of Superman very well, and i honestly enjoyed it! I mean good God after how awful Superman returns was can this movie not be appreciated?!? It wasn't the best superhero movie ever, it was not even comparable to the greatness of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, but I thought it definitely could have been a lot worse and I can easily say it was thoroughly enjoyed by myself and lived up to my expectations. It's worth seeing. I would watch it again without hesitation. It disappoints me that it was over-analyzed and critics decided and several viewers decided to pick out EXTREME specifics instead of just enjoying the movie. I feel this is an issue with several movies in our days. Movies are made to entertain, not to hate and pick on every little detail that means next to nothing.

The S on Superman might as  well be $,"In the movie, we are told that the S stands for hope in Krypton. My question is: hope for what? What hope is there in a society where its entire population is cloned and predestined to become whatever the high council decides for them? At the end of the movie, I've decided that it simply represents hope for movie makers to milk more money out of our beloved Superhero, through ticket sales and product placements.Quite fittingly, this incarnation of Superman seems both immortal and mortal at the same time - immortal because character development is so poor and shallow that the minimal amount of human/mortal quality feels either fake or it got totally lost in the chaos of the CGI effects; and mortal because Zack Snyder was actually able to murder Superman.(I used to like Snyder, starting from the remake of The Dawn of The Dead and then 300. I did not even mind Watchmen and Sucker Punch, but his credibility as a creative director has really taken a big hit for me this time.) I wonder when big name directors can turn around and realize that the overused dark and gritty tone does not always make a movie more realistic and suited for adults. It only makes it more like video game graphics.This is by no means a horrible movie. I sat through the whole movie without much of a yawn and there were even a few ""close to memorable"" moments.

There are so many scenes that are so contrived, it ruins suspension of disbelief. I was pulled out of the movie so many times, it was a chore to just sit through it to the end.I do not recommend seeing this film; if you want superhero action/adventure, you are much better off renting any of the recent Marvel films (Avengers, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, etc.) and enjoying on the small screen.

The man has very little grasp on how to actually tell a story, and after the first rather choppy hour of substance, he quickly loses himself in his own playground; he even brings it in too long. So all in all, it's not without its merits and is generally a decent blockbuster, but the good moments aside, this is ultimately disappointing; a lot of talent squandered.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Too much action spoils the day,"In spite of Zack Snyder not being liked by critics in general, he is one of my favourite directors, liked both his Watchmen and 300, one of the reasons being I always found his visual style intriguing. When Man of Steel was announced with Snyder as the director and Nolan producing it, I thought that the Superman franchise was in for a big revamp. I have watched a few Superman films before, not being too much of a fan of the action genre, as expected did not enjoy them as much. With this film I had hope that maybe they will delve deep into the psyche of Superman, which they did to some extent, but the problem was that they did not stop at that. The first half started off in Krypton , with a little bit of the Superman backstory. Then two timelines were interlaced, one showing little Clark Kent inhibited to show his superpowers to the world, and another one showing a grown up Clark starting to show his powers to the world. The best part of the film is in these parts. His conversations with Jonathan Kent ,his father were powerful. Loved them. His discovery about his past and his subsequent conversations with Jor-El were also emotionally charged. The use of Zimmer's background music was probably the best thing about this film. Absolutely Brilliant. Then came in the 'Summer Blockbuster' 2nd half with the explosions and the action sequences, quite reminiscent of a Micheal Bay film. It's a Superman film after all, only an idiot will go in with an expectation that it will be Batman Begins, but still they overdid it and the script took a backseat .I would have been totally disappointed if it was not for the last 10 minutes, which managed to salvage some of the damage already done by the mind-numbing action sequences. It was not wrong for fans to expect a better output from a Nolan , Snyder collaboration .Although the best Superman film till date but clearly falls short of expectations, and yes there was no need to make this into a 3D film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Spectacular visuals and great action,"I was positively overwhelmed by its ongoing action scenes, what mostly surprised me in contradiction to its prequel, the modern Superman comic adaptation ""Superman Returns"".

It was filled with exactly the right amount of action like it should be, because it is a Superman movie and should be like this. I wasn't expecting that much, because, honestly, Superman Returns bored me to death. Special effects were stunning. For the money that was put in this movie (220 million $), it is noticeable that most of the money went to the production of visual effects. Zack Snyder makes big action available in his movies, which tend to have respectable production values and stunning visuals. However, he always keeps the character and the story development behind and we are somehow used to it. It is a kind of movie in which you don't expect a beheading twist, you simple watch it as an average Hollywood action/blockbuster. As I said, I didn't expected it to be the movie of the year, but the selection of the actors could have been improved. Russell Crowe and Amy Adams gave their best and they are excellent, experienced actors, but other actors were just average and below. Probably it's because the most of the budget was given for production and smaller amount for actors. Also, I have to mention that the soundtrack was very good, especially in the finale.

"Packed with some of the most exhilarating action and brimming with unexpected poignancy, 'Man of Steel' lives up to its titular character's measure of mettle","Did Superman need a reboot after his last big screen appearance in Bryan Singer's 'Superman Returns'? Not really in our opinion, but nonetheless the task of making Superman relevant once again has fallen to Christopher Nolan, he who successfully rebooted another DC Comics character with a grim and gritty treatment under the banner of 'The Dark Knight'.Though '300' and 'Watchmen' director Zack Synder is at the helm here, Nolan's fingerprints are all over the material, serving not only as producer but also sharing story credit with his 'Dark Knight' scribe David S. Goyer. This is a Clark Kent conflicted with his Superman calling as much as Bruce Wayne was with his Batman persona, and the key struggle for Superman here is that tension between both his Kryptonian and Earthly identities - or to put it simply, though he was raised on Earth, Clark has always wrestled with the fact that he is not of this planet.Such an existential dilemma has been explored in similar fashion in Marvel's 'X-Men' movies, but Goyer makes it personal, heartfelt and ultimately moving in a way that no other film has done. Employing a flashback structure not unlike that in 'Batman Begins', Goyer paints an intimate portrait of a unique individual whose innate nature and ability to do good is tempered by a genuine need for self-preservation. Nowhere is this more apparent than in a stirring sequence where a young Clark pushes an entire school-bus of his classmates to safety after their vehicle plunges into a raging ravine, only to be regarded with trepidation from the ones he saved and their loved ones as well.""You're not just anyone,"" Johnathan Kent (Kevin Costner) tells his adopted son. ""You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be."" So convinced was his father that the world was not ready for Clark that he would make the ultimate sacrifice just to preserve the latter's identity, that singular demonstration of love counting as one of the most powerful emotional wallops in the film. And amidst the bombast you would expect of a summer blockbuster, there are many such heart-tugging moments to be found here, which lend a depth to the character that no other Superman film has been able to.In building the emotional core of the movie, Synder makes some unlikely yet inspired casting choices. Costner and Diane Lane play Clark's adoptive parents Johnathan and Martha, and both actors bring seemingly effortless warmth to their performances. There's also Russell Crowe, who plays Clark's biological father Jor-El, the Academy Award-winning actor injecting nobility and gravitas as Clark's other fatherly figure motivating him to realise the destiny for which he is capable of. It is indeed rare to find such acting heavyweights willing to take up supporting roles, but no matter how Synder managed to convince them to do so, the dramatic tones they add to the film makes it all the very much better off for it.One suspects that these actors might have signed up because of the creative liberties that Goyer has taken with the material in a studious attempt to ground mythology in reality. There's no Kryptonite for one, and the Fortress of Solitude gets only a passing mention - but beyond these obvious revisions, Goyer makes bolder moves to find reason for just how Superman ended up with an 'S' on his suit, or for that matter, such a spandex suit in the first place. Just as significantly, he lets Clark and 'Daily Planet' reporter Lois Lane meet and fall in love even before the former joins the very newspaper, taking that familiar dynamic between Clark and Lois in a wholly different but entirely refreshing direction. There is both ingenuity and meticulousness in his revisionist plotting of familiar elements, even to the point of building credibility and reason into what could have easily been designed as a cardboard villain in General Zod.Clearly inspired by Goyer's reinterpretation as well as Nolan's guiding hand, Synder delivers what in our opinion is his best work to date. With Goyer's character-driven script, Synder establishes a level of heart and profundity that has escaped even his best films thus far. That's not to say that Synder has let up on what he does best; on the contrary, the visuals are simply astounding, especially so in the relentlessly thrilling action sequences. Aside from the messy prologue that sets up the destruction of Krypton, all the rest of the sequences pulse with an urgent rhythm that draws you in with bated breath and keeps you on the edge of your seat. That is particularly true for the second half of the movie that begins with an awesome decimation of Smallville and culminates in an exhilarating finale right in the heart of downtown Metropolis. This is action filmed on a scale never before seen, the mano-a-mano between Superman and General Zod alone enough to rival everything you've seen so far in them Marvel superhero movies.Yet all that flying and smashing and ass-whooping would not be as stunning without an emotionally satisfying centre, embodied perfectly by British actor Henry Cavill as well as his complement Amy Adams. Cavill plays Superman as quiet, reserved and thoughtful without ever being angsty, while Adams has plenty of sass and spunk to spare as his romantic other half. Their Clark and Lois isn't what we would be well- acquainted with, but hey, if you're going to do a reboot, you might as well be audacious in spinning the oft-familiar elements of the tale.And that is what director Zack Synder, screenwriter David S.

SUPERMAN = Humans,"When I was a kid I used to watch Superman cartoon .It was used to about half and hour,they used to show 3 small episodes of Superman ,Superdog and the last one I don't remember each of 10 minutes and that shout ""up up in the air""it was amazing at that time.While watching cartoon I feel like I am the Superman .That same feeling I got after watching this movie and I really don't know how old Superman is(I mean to say when Superman was created)This movie is really awesome.The director has portrayed the Superman in a very intellectual way .High graphics and Flawless act by Crowe.Well work by Cavil .I think the DC(Warner Bros) will be dying to sign him for next Superman franchise.If you see the relation between Superman and us in all of the superman series ,there is always something the film want us to believe in us , who we are ,what we can achieve ......... and whenever Superman needed our trust we provided ,and whenever we needed his help he stand like a steel This thing made the Superman series /cartoon famous its like a Trance.

The Superman movie I was always waiting for.,"If you're a fan of Superman, rest easy. This movie truly gave us the Man of Steel in all of his super powerful glory. This is definitely a movie with flaws, of course, but if you can overlook a few minor issues and just sink yourself into it, I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I did.Let's start with the positives first. The scenes on Krypton in the beginning of the film are truly epic in scale and presentation. We get to see a view of Krypton like we never have before. Rather than just present us with the super clean, white, crystal-like Krypton from the Reeve era, we get a more gritty look this time. Krypton is in trouble and it is felt within the opening moments. Russell Crowe is fantastic as Jor-El, and gets much more screen time than I had initially thought he would. Even well after Krypton meets its fate, he still shows up as a guide for his son on Earth, and has a few surprisingly awesome moments. Even after death this guy is a formidable.Then we have the Man of Steel himself, Kal-El. Henry Cavill did a great job with what he was given here. He shows us a vulnerable and yet still formidable version of Superman. He looks the part and fills the suit well. When it came time to go to work, we truly get to see Superman do things we've never, and I mean NEVER seen him do in a film. All the while, Cavill keeps us grounded with him and does his best to keep us interested in Kal-El's journey of self discovery. Great choice.The rest of the supporting cast did their parts well also. Amy Adams did fine as Lois Lane. She wasn't completely vulnerable and was tough without seeming ridiculously over-written to be the quintessential damsel in distress turned super girl. She carried herself well. Michael Shannon was also great as Zod. He played all the right notes and didn't give us just a one-note villain who was bad just to be bad. Zod believe what he's doing is right, even though he knows it's cruel. Shannon gives us a Zod who feels regret at times, and we can read it all over his face. The only other character who was truly a stand-out here was Faora. She was a nice contrast to Zod, because while he seems grounded and aware, she is just cold-hearted and evil. She does what Zod asks her to do and is fiercely loyal to his cause, but you can tell she enjoys it much more than he does. Not to say the rest of the cast was bad in any way, but I'm just mentioning the stand-outs.The action in this movie is FANTASTIC. A few moments my jaw literally fell open. If you want to see Superman fight, and I mean REALLY fight, then this movie has you covered. I'm well aware that some people don't get off on action, but I eat it up like candy. I was VERY pleased with the action in this movie and I didn't feel it overstayed its welcome at all. Some will inevitably disagree with me, but that's the way I see it.On a small note, the score by Hans Zimmer in this film is orgasmic. I can't put it any other way. Seriously. I had chill bumps every time a new movement started up. If you're like me and feel like a movie is enhanced ten fold by the music, you'll be more than satisfied here.As for the negatives. I'll do my best to lay them out as matter of fact as I can. It is true that there is a lack of character development in this film. I didn't want to believe it, but I can't lie to myself. I felt like Snyder was trying his best to give us those notes of emotional resonance to make us feel something for some of the events that happened in flashback, but the mistake was that not enough time was given to those scenes. When we see the flashbacks, they work. We get the message of what each particular flashback is trying to convey. However, had a little more time been focused on those flashbacks, we would have felt closer to Clark by the time he dons the blue and red suit. Which brings me to my next issue.We literally get thrown into Clark becoming Superman. It happens so fast that you might feel like a part of the movie was left out by mistake. When Clark sets out of the Fortress of Solitude and tries to fly for the first time, we feel like we have barely heard him say a handful of words. It just felt ""off"" to me and going over it again and again in my head, I still think it felt a bit too rushed.Any other issues? Well, not really. I had issues with this film just like I would with any other. No film is perfect, ever. With that said, I had A LOT of fun and felt like a kid again when Superman finally threw his kid gloves off. The action scenes, again, are brutal, fast and suited to this character. We don't have a 'weak' Superman in this movie, so don't worry if you were concerned about that. He gives as good as he gets, and personally I'm glad for that. Showing a Superman who has a challenge to face is much more interesting than just making him an unstoppable god.I don't like giving number scores because it can throw everything out of balance. I won't do that for this film. All I can say is that if you go into this film with an open mind and let it take you in, you'll enjoy it. Dare I say, you just might even love it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Man Of Steel,"This adaptation of superman is an absolute winner. The man of steel (Henry Cavill) is dark, rugged and beautifully explosive and leaves chaos and destruction in his wake as he attempts to fight General Zod and his forces. We start on the planet krypton as you would expect, however this time we see an alien and technologically advanced race that really fits the bill! Their technology is based on iron filings suspended in a liquid and is seen frequently in the early to mid stages of the movie. When combining this tech with space shuttles of various shapes and sizes and winged beasts soaring through the air the viewing experience is really quite spectacular. Battle armour is worn by kryptonians and are armed with plasma guns of some kind, all of which display stunning special effects and continues to get better and better throughout the movie.Jor-El (Russel Crow) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) play superman's farther and mother and have the painful choice of sending their son Kal-El to earth before Kryptons imminent and dramatic exit from the universe. After arriving on earth Kal-El is cared for by Jonathon Kent (Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane). We are instantly thrown into a world of heroism as a certain Clark Kent displays his raw superhuman strength and his immunity to fire. He soon disappears and continues living on the road looking for work and with his non-biological fathers encouragement he eventually finds the secrets to his past. Soon to follow is the introduction of lois Lane(Amy Adams) who pursues Clark in search of a story. It will be interesting to see how this relationship is written in the next movie.I Would of liked to of seen more childhood events, relationships and generally a slightly longer filming in this area. However what was shown about Clarks childhood was very impressive. I thought the entire cast was great and as usual Kevin Costner and Russel Crow were fantastic to watch. I thought Zack Synders interpretation of superman was very good indeed and would give a comfortable 7.5/10M.Rigby",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's a bird. It's a plane. It's a dud.,"I wanted to love this film. I thought it would be especially great in Imax 3d. Unfortunately, and sadly ""Man of Steel"" is very short on Superman's story and instead substitutes fights, special effects and loud noise. It is really no more than a badly made live-action cartoon that wasted potential and opted to be just another action and little more than that film. It is difficult to comment on the acting in this film because it required so very little other than perhaps knowing how to look good in front of a green screen. Even the 3D was far from impressive.I should have watched my Smallville DVDs again instead of wasting my money on this film.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

8 Years later & still the best DC Movie,Snyders best film to date aided by Christopher Nolan's writing. Anyone missing the Richard Donner days of Superman will need a large box of tissues to console themselves with just how much better this movie is.Where Donner's movie was hammy and full of slapstick (and arguably of its time) it looks ridiculous in comparison. This is a serious attempt to tell a story of universal scale and goes all out on suspending disbelief.Man of Steel jumps in with both feet from the outset world building in a way very few movies have ever matched. And In no way is the movie too long. The opening scenes last a mere 20 minutes but they are breath taking in their ingenuity.It forgoes the traditional and tired linear narrative of Clarke growing up employing flashbacks which integrate with the story and only introduces Clarke to the Daily Planet at the very end (thankfully).Clearly the writers set out to avoid as many cliches and repetition of previous efforts which is welcome offering a fresh and modern perspective.Acting is good throughout with some excellent casting. FX are literally out of this world.The haters are just missing their spandex. Great film.. and one of the best superhero movies you will see.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A good start for something new,"The undeniably great Christopher Reeve ushered in the first generation of superhero blockbusters with 1979's Superman: The Movie. That generation brought us the Tim Burton Batman and little else of any success. The second generation kicked off with Bryan Singer's X- Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. With the reboot of The Amazing Spiderman, the re-invention of the epic blockbuster in The Avengers, the critical and commercial success of The Dark Knight trilogy, and a new team in X-Men: First Class, we have entered a third generation of superhero films.Man of Steel is Superman's return to relevance, and his first truly great screen appearance since 1979.An extended look at a much more realistic Krypton opens Man of Steel, and successfully sets the tone in a much darker way. Despite being Zack Snyder's film, the impact of Christopher Nolan is felt throughout; and although this sacrifices some of the light charm that Reeve's films were known for, it is a firm statement of independence that works in the film's favour.Unlike previous incarnations, the back story of Krypton is key to the entire film, and true motivation is developed for Superman's Kryptonian parents and the film's big bad, General Zod (Michael Shannon). Slight alterations to the technology, physics, and explanations of Superman's Kryptonian DNA are brilliant manipulations of the classic story that bring it up to date for a modern superhero blockbuster. Batman Begins started the reset where audiences would not accept a superhero without logic and reason. Man of Steel's creative team, including David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, have brought the same respect for the character that rebuilt Batman so effectively.Henry Cavill, the man who was almost cast as Aragorn then Batman and then James Bond, has finally found his blockbuster franchise. He fits the suit that few mere mortals are physically qualified for, and he manages to pull off the reluctant hero without appearing mopey or frigid. A downside to the origin story that this film tells is that we don't get much of his human alter ego. Part of what made Christopher Reeve's Superman so likable was his bumbling Clark Kent, but we'll have to wait until the next film to see if Cavill's awkward journalist is as good as his bulletproof hero.Even though the film revolves around Krypton's destruction, Clark Kent's childhood development in Kansas, and General Zod's escape from the phantom zone for revenge, Man of Steel carves a very original path from the first two Christopher Reeve films. By the credits it has established a new Superman in the same way that JJ Abrams established a new Star Trek. All the characters and elements are present, but they have not been dropped in front of us for no reason. By the end of the film we believe in them, and we see the connections that make them cohesive.With Batman joining Superman in the sequel, there is a danger that Henry Cavill's Man of Steel will get overshadowed by the (much more popular) Dark Knight. But it's possible that this film will get the Batman Begins status of being the somewhat successful opening act of great things to follow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Henry Cavill,"I can't imagine another superman. You do this to us every time.I've just received information that Henry may or may not be our next Clark Kent. It's like super man 1978 all over again. You didn't leave us on a cliff hanger, you pretty much pushed us over the edge and left us lost at sea, drowning in agony wondering when the next rendition would be release. It's abusive and I just can't take it any more. Besides the facts, I think Henry Cavill did an impeccable job, i quite frank couldn't imagine another man of steel, but I guess just like Christopher Reeves, you will probably find another replacement, disgusting. Appallingly, diluting the tangibility of the brand. Imagine what Kal El would think of this abysmal twist of inconsistent depiction of his character. If he as anywhere out there, I am sure he trying to shoot laser beams at whoever is responsible for this. Otherwise, the fight scenes were epic, with a good balance of humour and suspense that kept me glued to the screen and awaiting the sequal, until i received the traumatic news of Henry's replacement.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Same old stuff!,"Okay just got out of the cinema after 2 hours 23 minutes of more or less the same old thing. No great surprises. I got the feeling that I seen it all before, mainly because I have! It could of done with being shorter and action was a bit messy and very repetitive. When will directors also realise that using a shaky hand held camera is really annoying especially when the film is being projected onto the big screen. A couple of millimeters shake of the camera appear more like a 7.5 on the Richter scale when on transferred to the big screen. with the amount of money they spent on the budget surely they could have afforded to a have rented a steadicam. Obviously another film that doesn't live up to the hype. Has Hollywood run out of ideas? I want something totally new not a rejigging of a previous version.

Superman for the Transformers Generation!,"Let's be honest. This movie is terrible. The problem with Man of Steel isn't the laughable script or the Michael Bay-style action sequences, it is the utter lack of love and appreciation for Superman by everyone involved. In 1976, when Richard Donner accepted the job of directing TWO Superman movies at the same time, he said great movies had to be made because Superman is as American as apple pie. Comics books, like Jazz music, was born and bred in this country and Superman was the first to leap off the pages and into our hearts. Donner's passion is on every frame of his 1978 adaptation.Now compare that to Man of Steel. The set-designs and costumes are ugly. I can understand the dying planet of Krypton looking like crap, but did the entire film have to look so hideous? Secondly, the cinematography is the worst I've seen in a major Hollywood production. Zack Snyder shoots everything like if he's 50-feet away on his cellphone. Thirdly, can we please, for the love of God, get rid of Hans Zimmer and his team of ""additional composers""? John Williams is rolling in his grave and he's not even dead yet. And finally, let's get to the root of the problems. There is no heart. This is Superman. He represents hope. He represents truth, justice, and the American way. He's the ray of sunshine. So why is this movie so downbeat, moody, and depressing? Superman kills Zod. That's how messed up it is. Oh, and let's not get started on Metropolis turning into ashes. I can understanding heading there in the second installment of a trilogy or even in a movie featuring Darkseid but starting a Superman series in that direction is absolutely ridiculous. Especially when there's nothing light-hearted to balance it. Man of Steel is just dreadful.On the positive side Henry Cavill is a good Superman. Does he lack charisma? Yes, but what did you expect from a film that has no charm whatsoever? He fits right in with everything else. The rest of the cast is decent as well. And the action scenes and visual effects were impressive. So, the movie works from a shallow perspective.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Alternative Interpretation of Superman May Enthrall Some and Frustrate Others -- Visuals Accentuated Over Character and Plot,"The main issue with the latest version of Superman via Christopher Nolan is whether audiences will buy into looking at Superman through a new lens; a lens which takes the Superman mythos and warps into something quite new. Is it better? That's the fundamental question. Many of the elements from the 1979 version are here: the planet Krypton, Jor-El, General Zod, Jonathan Kent, Lois Lane, Perry White and of course the Man of Steel. However, in this version, the many ingredients are switched around and the order of the recipe turns out quite different. It's still the recognizable Superman, or is it? Several elements are changed, including Lois meeting with Superman, and later the arrival of Zod on a mission so different than any previous offering whether it be comic book, film, or television.Probably the strongest aspect of the film is its imagery rather than the dialog or the acting. The story begins on Krypton like the older film. Alternatively, the imagery of Krypton and the inhabitants ring of 1930's and 1940's SF rather than the 1979 film or the comic books from the 1940's through 1960's. The ships and devices have their roots more in the original Alien film, with dark gray's and brown's instead of the bright crystals of the 1979 version. The story is updated to reflect 21st century United States rather than Superman of the 1940's or the 1970's. Lois Lane has a cell phone and even posts a story online. When General Zod and the baddies arrive, albeit before Superman is really known, the imagery and feel is much more like a current science fiction film than Superman battling domestic bad guys. This could frustrate some purists who wanted the story to reflect the Superman of tradition.Although the look of the film is tremendous, the acting and writing department is not equal to the first two offerings starring Christopher Reeve. While Russel Crowe is not a bad choice as Jor-El, the script and his subsequent performance are not as compelling as Marlon Brando's Jor-El several decades earlier. When Brando's Jor-El appeared in a black cloak with the ""S"" insignia, proclaiming an indictment against the traitors of Krypton, Zod and company, with the words ""This is no fantasy"", we are pulled into a story about justice, right and wrong. The myth of Superman embodies the ideas of justice and morality. Although Superman itself is a fantasy, the issues of right and work, good vs evil, are every-present. Unfortunately, the present script didn't quite find a rhetorical theme from which to build a story. I had trouble really understanding what this film was about.The one character which was the most disappointing was General Zod. I realized what a tremendous performance Terence Stamp offered as Zod in the earlier films and yet here the present casting and his script were far less compelling. Somehow, the current Zod seems less intelligent and more prone to fits of rage. When Zod and his cohorts are on trial in the original film, you never sense that Zod is a victim but an individual who has acted out of malice by pure choice. In fact at the beginning of the 1978 version, we know that the failed coup, although we never saw it play out. We recognize because of the seriousness of the criminal proceedings, the overthrow came dangerously close to succeeding. The current Zod seems over his head, and not in fully in control. The coup is shown but somehow seems less believable, maybe even slightly contrived. Zod will essentially continue what he began on Krypton on Earth.What may save the film is the two leads played by Henry Cavill and Amy Adams. Cavill is a decent Superman and Adams holds her own as Lane. They definitely had more chemistry than the 2006 Superman Returns but not quite the magnetism as Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. The film then lapses into long action sequences which seem never to end, with the rather complex and convoluted plot not fully explained to satisfaction. While I understand the need not to repeat earlier Superman's, this film just misses the mark. A noble but rather disappointing entry into the Superman canon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Dark Knight is not alone: Superman brings hope to DC,"A promise is a promise and the produced have said the truth, they delivered the Superman movie they said they would. For years Warner Bros. has tried to bring back the greatest hero of all, and it was David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan the ones that find out how to do it. The seriousness of the story, the depth in Clarks feeling and the entertained spectacle they bring in screams Chris Nolan everywhere. There is no doubt (and Goyer and director Zack Snyder has said so), that without Nolan, this movie couldn't be possible.The script, based on the story by Nolan, is the first great script by David S. Goyer. Everything this guy has done is dumb, except for The Dark Knight trilogy and he did those with Nolan. But if you check out some of his solo works you will see titles like The Unborn and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. But this time, he wrote the script alone and is his first mature and serious work on his own. Excellent script, with no dumb lines and shallow characters.Then enter Zack Snyder. Because I hate everything this guy has done, I was very nervous of him directing this movie. I told to myself ""In Nolan I trust"", so if Nolan chooses this one, then he could do the job. Thank God Snyder decided to change his style for Man of Steel. He promised in the beginning there will be no slow motion scenes, and there are none. The cinematographic style goes with the premise, ""what if this happens tomorrow?"" It has a lot of hand-held shots, very fast and brutal. It must be a 3D nightmare, but if fit perfect in the mood of the movie. Snyder proved he can do better than he has done in the past.What is an awesome story, beautifully directed without an amazing score? Hans Zimmer proves he is the master. The best he did was not trying to imitate John Williams. Zimmer comes with a different score, full of emotion, and with a simple melody he makes a statement: ""This is a new Superman, and this is his song"". Music is very present during the movie and it will be as memorable as the original John William score.The cherry of the pie came with the cast. There is no superhero movie with a better cast than this one. No Avenger or X-men can be compared with this cast. First there is Henry Cavill. After Immortals I had my doubts about him, but make no mistake, this guy was born for this roll. All previously actors, were the perfect Clark Kent, but Cavill is the perfect Clark and Superman. He is big and strong, but at the same time has this sad face, full with the pain of not being part of this world.Finally we can enjoy a Lois Lane that is not a damsel in distress. Amy Adams is strong and independent. She might get in some big trouble, but she definitely can defend herself. With her it is Michal Shannon. Who would think that man could be a good bad guy? Well, he is. He is as strong as Superman and he is dangerous, he have no mercy and is capable of destroy the whole planet if Superman let him.The character I feared most was Jonathan Kent. After seeing TV series Smallville I understand that Jonathan has to be a strong man, but honest. He is the man responsible that Clark is the good man he is. He raised him, and teaches him about good and evil. Kevin Costner is a good dad. He is solid on his position and very honest. He brings to life the kind of character makes you think: ""I want him to be my dad"". Well, he is Superman dad. The other dad is Russell Crowe and he'll make you forget the ghost of Marlon Brandon. I like this Jor-El better. He is not just a voice, but a presence. He is there teaching his son who he is and what is the purpose of being sent to Earth.Even thou this is a realistic look at Superman, it is a solid sci-fi movie. There is a lot of action, a lot of science fiction themes around it, and very good special effects. At some point of the movie it feels like is going to get boring, but never does. Just when I thought, ""if you stop now it's going to get boring"", it was when it got better. The action starts and it never stops until the very end.Man of Steel is the perfect summer movie of 2013, full of action and feelings. You can't miss this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Up in the air,"I'm still not sure how to feel about this. And it's not about the story and I'm not (was not) a big fan growing up. So I'm not comparing this to anything else than the previous movies that existed rather than the comic books. That it's way better than Superman returns is something that could be expected. Especially because Chris Nolan was involved as producer, though that also meant the fun/camp feeling of Superman went out the window (without the flying abilities of our Superhero at hand here).The (main) problem I had watching this, was the action scenes. It did feel like I was watching someone play ""Mortal Kombat"" or Street Fighter. Going through walls, jumping like digital Yoda on drugs, that kind of thing.

I'm only a man in a funny red sheet,"From the opening scenes on Krypton where we see Jor-El being an action movie hero fighting, shooting guns, and riding flying dragons, it's clear this will be like no other Superman movie before...for better or worse. This is a tough review for me to write. I waited a long time to do it. There are two parts of me at war here. The movie fan didn't think it was that bad. The Superman fan hated it beyond belief.The cast is good. Henry Cavill and Amy Adams were much better than I expected. They had nice chemistry, which I liked. Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, etc. are all fine. The flashbacks are the better parts of the movie. That was kind of what I was hoping the movie would be. The present-day stuff varied in quality but got progressively dumber as the movie went along. The special effects are mostly good, although the fight scenes between Superman and the other Kryptonians seem like choppy insertions of video game animation. The codex plot device is a stupid addition to the story and one can only assume it was thrown in with the hope of seeing it pay off in a future sequel, which may not ever happen. The script gives lip service to hope, etc. but it's all mired in gloom and bleakness. Drab, depressing, with very little happiness. The last hour becomes mindless destruction. Don't even get me started on ""that moment."" It enrages me just thinking about it.As a sci-fi action summer blockbuster, I can't deny it's well-made and entertaining on that level. As a Superman movie, it's heartbreaking. Gone are the days of ""you will believe a man can fly."" No more inspiration. Now it's Superman in the 21st century: brutal, cynical, dark, self-absorbed. He's not even allowed to wear the traditional costume anymore, presumably because of infantile ""underwear on the outside"" jokes from braindead teenage boys (in age or just in mindset, no difference) raised on dark anti-heroes who have no sense who Superman is and what he stands for. Or rather, stood for. Anyway, off my soapbox. It's not a bad movie, judged solely on its own merits. But characters this iconic don't exist in a vacuum so it's very hard for me to look at it without comparison. See it and decide for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I remember her being cut throat when it came to a good scoop, but okay whatever.The police drop off Louis at the Kent's house where they see superman and her earth mother. Louis is running to superman calling him Clark and no one knows who he is at the end really?Oh and let's talk about Superman killing someone... Is this movie going based on the old comics where superman killed people? Wait that can't be right cause he feels bad about it after killing the guy... If I remember right he doesn't KILL PEOPLE even if they are trying to destroy the world. In his eyes there's always other way.. Guess not in this movie... This movie should be rated as a 1 out of 10.I hope you wait till one of your friends buy this movie and watch it then... Cause if you pay for it and you're a real fan you will feel robbed for paying for this piece of sh*t....",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A promising start to a new franchise with a good dose of outlandish comic-book action.,"Warner Bros. Pictures had to begin production on a Superman film by 2011 in order to avoid being sued by the Shuster and Siegel estates for lost revenue on an unproduced film. Even though Man Of Steel is a Hollywood product I still enjoyed watching it very much. What made the difference was Christopher Nolan's involvement as producer and David S. Goyer's script. Read historian Carroll Quigley's books if you want to know what was one of the influences. It's a solid script that tells the difficulties experienced by Clark Kent when he was growing up on Earth well. But we also get a detailed picture of Krypton's downfall, a new story behind the Superman suit, and then a great conflict when General Zod comes to Earth. The story is complex for a superhero film. Even in adulthood Clark isn't entirely sure if he can trust the people of Earth. His adoptive parents are a big help for him. These scenes of growing up and learning to coexist are some of the most effective. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are likable and earnest. Costner, playing Jonathan Kent, in particular effectively embodies goodness and wisdom. The whole cast is solid though. Henry Cavill was a good choice to play Superman. He wears the cape well. He's also sympathetic, especially when he deals with being an alien. My favorite scenes would have to be Clark learning from his biological father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and confronting Zod (Michael Shannon). Jor is a voice of reason that's an opposite to Zod's violence and cruelty. Crowe perfectly embodies virtuosity and hope. Shannon's Zod is a terrific villain with a purpose. Shannon's expressions are the best in the film, making his intentions compelling. Zack Snyder is a competent director but he often fails to draw viewers into his scenes. This problem is present in Man Of Steel. And yet the film is often exhilarating and touching too. Watching Superman fly for the first time is a joy here. Though some people criticized Snyder's ""overlong"" action scenes I think that this is exactly what was needed. Previous Superman films mostly lacked the godlike fighting that one expects, but here you get plenty of it. The addition of Hans Zimmer's new music themes gives the action a boost. It's almost like Snyder is atoning for Bryan Singer's Superman Returns (2006). My opinion is that Man Of Steel is a neat reinvention instead of an obligatory rehash. It certainly entertains and I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
So good!,"How people weren't into this is such a mystery. I loved everything about it. The only thing wrong is that the action scenes go on a little long but they're cool so it's fine. It's great to see Superman with a new spin after basically being the same for 70 years but still staying true to what he is.This isn't a Superman comic this is a becoming Superman movie, which we've never had before. He's usually young an then suddenly Superman. It's great to see him learning how to be Superman.I really like how SciFi it was. Because finding out an alien was on Earth would shake things up. Every other version people just see that a man can fly and basically accept it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as the Christopher Reeve Superman I and II,"This movie was entertaining, but the story was not as interesting to me as in Superman I and II with Christopher Reeve. I also think Superman's personality was captured better by Reeve than in this one.I will say that I think this film was better than Superman III and IV that Reeve starred in, and also the ""Superman Returns"" version which was too over the top and not credible.Rather than a straight line from the decaying Planet Krypton to his adult life, I found the flash backs to his youth more distracting than enlightening. Kind of broke up the storyline in my opinion.Another thing this version lacks is the stirring musical score that John Williams composed for the Reeve versions of Superman.To sum up, decent but not a block buster.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Man of steel"" is simply superb. A Crowning achievement and a colossal success!","Henry Cavill is Superman and Superman is going to catapult Henry Cavill into mega stardom. This latest rendition of superman is nothing short of superb. A colossal visual extravaganza of modern day technology, artistry and very strong story telling. The film begins very syfy, I was thinking ""Star Wars for several moments"" while watching the set up, but quickly turns into the comic hero, action adventure with lots of heart. The action sequences were bombastic and goosebump inducing. The fans who have been following the many editions and evolution of this superheroe saga will find this film a bit darker, more serious than previous versions.Unlike the final two renditions from the early eighties starring Christopher Reeve, thankfully there are no signs of this superhero ever going the comedic route. You may find that this Superman is pose to break many expectations specially from skeptics. Carrying the film with great elegance, character and charm and as a perfect fit is Henry Cavill. He conveys enough sensitivities to swoon the viewer yet he has all the powers it takes to crash through many buildings as he fights his nemesis General Zod and his bad guys from Krypton.The clever part of this story is that the bad guys are not the usual bad guys we have come expect, because they too have their purpose and noble agenda as well, so its not too difficult to empathize with their plight of survival. Their arrival onto earth is understandable. The stellar cast who accompany Cavill on this latest journey will leave you wanting an additional two to five hours more of ""Man of Steel"". But fear not, clocking in at almost two hours and a half you are sure to leave the theatre with your expectations fulfilled and you may very well treat yourself to repeated viewings if only to revisit the magnificence and scale of this spectacle. It is safe to say, this latest superman is so far the event film of 2013. The film you are not soon to forget. It's hair raising emotional content in conjunction with some very real and well done action sequences will keep both men and women coming back for more. The ending does a great job setting the tone for the upcoming sequels. Without question, this latest version of Superman brands Cavill into the hall of fame of superheroes and cements ""Man of Steel"" into a new, fresh longstanding franchise. 10/10Entertainment Film News review",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I agree with the critics...,"In contrast to the ""most useful"" reviews, I actually agree with the critics. The budget clearly went into the action and for this, I score the movie 10 out of 10. The fight scenes are an incredible match for what you see in the cartoons, and I was very impressed. Unfortunately, there were only two other positive aspects for me:1. Russell Crowe, who gave a surprisingly good portrayal of Jor-El.2. Although I disliked the rest of the movie, it is still better than the rubbish that is called ""Iron Man 3"".Although you could argue that this was the Superman from an alternate age, I did not get any kind of feeling for the actor's portrayal. Disappointing since he obviously felt bad after losing the 2006 role to a relatively unknown actor who, in my opinion, did a better job of playing Superman than he did. We waited 7 years for him to do a better job and yet, we get a lifeless wooden performance instead. That said, Amy Adams was no better. Both the leads gave very wooden lifeless performances which was a big big letdown. For me, the lead actor and actress had no chemistry whatsoever.I normally hate reboots but after watching this version of Superman, I can't wait for another reboot.... the decision to pull the plug on Brandon Routh was a stupid one.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Excellent Reboot, but Too Reminiscent of ""Superman II""","""Man of Steel"" gives us a twist in the usual way the story of Superman has been told. We see a number of scenes of Clark as a bullied child struggling to cope with and control his special powers. We see young Clark as some anonymous worker, hitchhiking from odd job to odd job. We see Lois Lane meet Clark in one of his odd jobs in the Arctic, not as a mild-mannered reporter at the Daily Planet. We do not hear Perry White say ""Great Caesar's Ghost!"", nor did we meet Jimmy Olsen.It was very heartening how we get to meet more of Superman's real and adoptive parents more in this film. We see that Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) lived up to 1997, and he did not die from a heart attack. We see Martha Kent (Diane Lane) still alive when Superman begin his career as a hero. We still see Jor-el (Russell Crowe) in many other parts of the film guiding Clark (and Lois!) even as we see him die at the beginning. The relationships of Kal-el/Clark with his fathers and how these shaped him as a hero is a central theme of this film, and I liked that a lot.The whole movie is essentially a remake of ""Superman II"", which was generally adjudged to be the best of the Christopher Reeve series. In that film, as with this one, Superman faces General Zod and his minions, who was able to escape his fate in the Phantom Zone and found his way to Earth to create havoc here. General Zod in this film (Michael Shannon) had different motivations for attacking Earth from the first one, which was generally for revenge.Of course, with today's computer generated technology, the special effects were much bigger and better than before. Gone was the simplistic shiny white spiked space pod which brought Kal-El to Earth or the flat rectangular mirror prison of Zod et al. in the Phantom Zone. The fight scenes were so much more explosive, ala Michael Bay style, since both Supes and Zod had matching superpowers crashing through practically all the buildings in the area where they were fighting. Both Smallville and Metropolis were practically demolished to ruins after the big scale martial combat of the Kryptonians.Henry Cavill cut a very dashing figure as the new ""Man of Steel."" His was a brawny, hirsute Clark. His acting style was serious and intense, but never shallow, unlike the last Routh version. Cavill was a fiercer, more macho Superman. I must admit though that it was a little funny how he suddenly became clean-shaven with neat shiny hair once he donned the new Superman costume for the first time.Amy Adams was a strong no-nonsense Lois Lane. Although of course she too had a scene where Superman made her knees weak, but this romance angle was gradually introduced. The dynamics of their relationship was changed quite a bit in this version. There was of course that scene where they fly together, but the situation was totally different and there was no soaring romantic music and poetry reading in the background like the Reeve-Kidder version. I am sure this relationship will be explored more in sequels to come.Overall, this is a very satisfying reboot of the Superman series by Zach Snyder. I liked that they took this one seriously, not devoid of humor but without the slapstick that made previous versions corny. The technical aspects of the film were excellent, especially the rich cinematography, the fast-paced editing, as well as the visual and sound effects of the battle scenes. I looking forward to seeing them reinterpret the evil genius of Lex Luthor in a future installment. This film has a charm distinct enough form the Reeve version and will be a successful franchise of its own.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Didn't like this movie at first, but now I like it a lot.","When I first watched this movie at the theater, I was somewhat disappointed. Mostly because it was so dark and gloomy, far from what I'm used to for a Superman movie. Ever since I met Henry Cavill in person, I have a greater appreciation for the movie. Not only that, but the more I watch it, the better it gets, and I realize what a great movie it actually is. Zod was a great villain. I even liked Faora. And of course, I like Henry even more now (as an actor of the movie and as a person). At least unlike other actors, he actually really cares for the character, it's history, and its fans. Makes me appreciate the movie even more. And at first I didn't like Zack Snyder either, but after watching MoS, BvS, and JL, I admire him more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Kevin Costner Steals The Movie,"Man Of Steel (2013)Plot In A Paragraph: An alien orphan is sent from his dying planet to Earth, where he grows up to become his adoptive home's first and greatest superhero.I will admit from the off Richard Donners Superman is in my Top 10 movies of all time, and probably always will be. But I will try to avoid comparisons.Lacking the humor and charm of Donner's 1978 Superman and Christopher Reeve's iconic performance (Damn It) pretty much starts from scratch, and has all the trademarks of Nolans work. Like he did with Batman, Nolan puts the man of steel in the real world. The fantasy is gone, as is the bright colours, triumphant music and fighting for truth, justice and the American way. Instead we get dour colours, a slow, melancholy Hanz Zimmer score, suspicion and a world that is not particularly worth saving.I think it impossible to better Reeve's take on Clark Kent/Superman (damn it again) that said, Henry Cavill has the strapping good looks of the comic book legend and the humanity to match his superheroism. And boy did he get in shape for his shirtless scenes.Of the supporting Michael Shannon is OK as General Zod. He has definitely been better, but he is OK. I like Any Adams take on Lois Lane, even if Lois is surprisingly chill with wiping out Aliens with a blaster onboard an spaceship. Russell Crowe has a great voice for the voice overs and makes a fine Jor El. I also liked Lawrence Fishburn as Perry White.But for me, Kevin Costner (who received great reviews) is the heart of the movie. He doesn't appear till over 20 minutes in, has only 4 scenes that run under 10 minutes yet his presence looms large, helped by the fact that his scenes are spaced out throughout the movie. Both Costner and Diane Lane (who I've always had a crush on, and still would here) are great as Clark's Earth parents, although Costner in particular deserves much more screen time.Those that complained Superman Returns didn't have enough action, will have been happier with this one due to three major battles in the latter half of the movie.For a movie that's all about saving Earth, there's an unaccountable amount of destruction in Man of Steel. The collateral damage caused by the battles bothered me the first time I seen it, and I was glad it was addressed in Batman V Superman.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Deviated Too Radically from the Original Story,"This movie begins on the planet of Krypton with a scientist named ""Jor-El"" (Russell Crowe) warning the planet's leaders that their world is about to explode and urging them to send at least a few people out to other planets in order to preserve their race. Having ignored him in the past they refuse to heed his warnings now but before they can dismiss him a general named ""Zod"" (Michael Shannon) breaks into the council chamber and after killing one of the leaders declares that he is now in charge of the entire planet. However, Jor-El manages to escape from the chamber long enough to send his young son out into the universe in a spaceship headed for Earth. Not long afterward, General Zod and his small band are captured and after being tried for murder and sedition they are all imprisoned in another dimension known as ""the Phantom Zone"" which, ironically, saves them from a certain death when Krypton explodes. The film then fast-forwards to a grown man with incredible powers saving some workers on an oil platform and then disappearing out of sight. Needless to say, this scene is the initial introduction of a person who will soon be known to the entire world as ""Superman"" (Henry Cavill). Now even though the CGI in this particular film gave it a significant advantage over the ""Superman"" movie produced in 1978, I was terribly disappointed with the manner in which the director (Zack Snyder) chose to deviate so radically from the original story. Likewise, the action scene towards the end dragged on much too long and was totally unnecessary. Now don't get me wrong-good CGI and action definitely enhances certain films. Unfortunately, Zach Snyder typically relies too heavily upon these two features and this film suffers as a result. Be that as it may, while this movie certainly had some good points, it could have been better and I have rated it accordingly. Just slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Superman is a welcome addition to the list of recently rebooted superheroes. It's worth catching this flight once.,"Superman is a welcome addition to the list of recently rebooted superheroes that includes Spiderman (where Andrew Garfield replaced Tobey Maguire to don the new Spidey suit in The Amazing Spiderman). Henry Cavill is the young man in blue suit and red cape (without the red trunks, thankfully) who's our Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El this time, and the actor has everything that makes him the perfect choice for Superman -  a square-jaw, an extremely ripped body  and a dashing appearance.The character he plays is the strongest of all superheroes, but he is a superhero with a big heart  and Henry Cavill has the face of a charming guy, a loving son, a doting lover and a responsible citizen, everything which makes us instantly empathise with him.The character he plays is the strongest of all superheroes, but he is a superhero with a big heart  and Henry Cavill has the face of a charming guy, a loving son, a doting lover and a responsible citizen, everything which makes us instantly empathise with him.It takes Zack Snyder an entire film to establish Cavill as the harmless, bespectacled office employee Clark Kent, yet we already get to see our Superman saving the whole world from total destruction in Snyder's Man of Steel. My concern here is that when Snyder keeps the stakes so high in the first film itself, how will this franchise (everybody knows there are two more films to come in the near future, and then a similar reboot) move to a whole new level in the sequels?That is what troubles when I see the recent 'saving the whole wide world' trend in superhero movies. There was a time when common people ( i.e. Everyone excluding the Superhero and his nemesis) had some powers of their own but now it seems everyone has little job except to be attacked until their Superhero finally rescues them. Man of Steel had me wondering that when human beings on earth could use their technology and knowledge to create televisions, skyscrapers etc, why do they fall completely helpless a race from Krypton, whose world looks quite barren compared to Earth, invades them?Apart from this, I've observed that CGI has upscaled the level of calamity to a 11 out of 10 and nobody really bothers about property destruction worth billions of dollars in Superhero movies; in Man of Steel, it seems as though the CGI team invaded the sets of the film as the second half was being shot, drove out Snyder from his chair and took over until the very end. Half the city is blown to pieces with skyscrapers tumbling like a house of cards, and still everything turns fine just like before the moment good wins over evil. Wouldn't it take months or maybe years for redevelopment of a city, but no one pays attention to that!In spite of these grumblings, I found myself liking Man of Steel more than the other Superhero blockbusters released this year like The Ironman 3. While director Snyder falters during the action sequences (he similarly botched up the nearly unbearable Sucker Punch), he is able to film the flashback sequences well, which form the core emotional content in the film.While the first half of Man of Steel is entirely taken up in building the plot, going back and forth in time to give much insight on Clark's childhood and boyhood, the second half is taken over by a non-stop chain of action sequences. Something's going on everywhere and you feel quite disoriented because the first half did a commendable job of holding you in.There is little to write about the second half except 'Noise! Blasts! Destruction! Noise! Noise!!' and the sequences are not as smart as those in Tobey Maguire's Spiderman;   Spiderman could use his web to ingeniously trap his enemies, while all Superman can do is 'Pow! Pow! X-Ray Vision!'. And while I do commend Lois' tenacity, I thought her character seemed a little too over-zealous; take the scene where Zod asks the army to hand over Lois and she says 'I'll go' like she's going shopping. I would've wet my pants had I been in such a position.Still, still, still I do believe this movie works. It's sequels should scale down the scope and scale action and restrict to the destruction of New York or whichever place they're shooting in, instead of 'World destruction'. Maybe Superman should think twice before destroying property, and the sequels could have more sequences that show him saving a specific group of people (like Spiderman saving passengers on a runaway train in the brilliant Spiderman 2). This film has its moments, like the part where Superman finds out his true identity and soars across land and seas in his newly obtained suit. The first half soars in the same way; the second half spirals unsteadily but lands safely in the end. It's worth catching this flight once.Read the whole review on http://sashankkini.wordpress.com/.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

OK, Clark is not a naive reporter, actually he is not a reporter at all, he is becoming one with the titles of the film's end. exceptional fx but that's all. nothing more. It is a movie full of ""scenario gaps"". I like Crow as Jor El, the guy playing General Zod and i found the rest of the actors insignificant for the movie.

Whoever cast Michael Shannon as the antagonist threw this movie,"I am watching this and Batman vs. Superman in preparation for Justice League this coming weekend. The only exposure I have to the DC universe is WonderWoman and Aquaman, so I am looking forward to seeing the leader introduced.First let me hit on the positives. The fight scenes involving any Kryptonians were what I wanted and more. They were so aggressive and violent, but in a crisp and calculated way. One of my biggest pet peeves in action films is when a character is hit across the room, tripped, or otherwise incapacitated momentarily, and their opponent uses it as time to drop witty lines or pace menacingly. In Man of Steel, the Kryptonians would knock their opponent to the ground and instantly divebomb them and continue to pummel them. This action style alongside the classic Snyder shaky zoom cam were certainly the highlights.The negatives included a mildly lacking story, poor first half pacing, and an awful casting of the antagonist. The biggest crime was whoever styled the antagonist, outfitting him with the most ratty goatee I have seen in a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

In short, a big action mess with little logic behind it (and, yes, I'm aware it's Superman but that doesn't mean that the characters' motives and actions should also defy logic) to an extent that you'd think that Damon Lindelof had a go at the screenplay.

"Absolutely great, don't listen to the critics","The Man of Steel is one of the best Superman film since the original in 1978. It's heartfelt, poignant and thrilling in so many ways. The production team was always a dream: Produced by Chris Nolan and directed by fan favorite Zack Snyder. Snyder has always be criticized for putting style over substance, and I have to completely disagree with the critics that seemed to yearn for the older 'Donner' Superman...Sorry folks, this is the Superman for the 21st century. As much as I revere the original (I must have watched in 100 times since I was a kid), it's a 35 years old film. That strong nostalgic value may made critics happy in Superman Returns, but heck...ask anybody whose tastes are not so 'avant garde', Returns was a good effort that failed to ignite the masses. The Man of Steel will be that movie.Brilliant move to cast both Russel Crowe AND Kevin Costner as the two 'fathers' of Kal-El/Clark Kent. Surprisingly, despite being surrounded by such great actors on all front, Cavill makes a surprisingly conflicted, modern Superman. Being told all his life to hold back and lost in purpose, before the Kryptoninans arrive and cause havoc. And what havoc it is....incredible action set pieces, that some critics found redundant but the 'younger generation' will find jaw dropping. It's always clear that Snyder is an 'anime geek' at heart, and this time he has the budget to pull it off. Building falls, super beings punching each other through the sky...'Dragonball' style fights at high speed ON AIR...It made the action sequences in other super hero felt so small and anemic in comparison.

However, in doing so, the proposition became overstuffed, or rather overwhelmed.By exposition, a constant feed of particulars, which made it less stimulating than it should have been!Even though the visuals are extravagant and the action is mounted on an extremely large scale, the writing couldn't play the match-up game, as it seemed to have taken a back seat, confined within its own boundaries, weighed down by incoherence!Perhaps a separate four-hour-long 'Snyder' cut was needed here!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Back when Independence Day came out CGI mass destruction was cool, it looked great, now, it still looks good, but it's getting old. I can't get past the fact that half of Metropolis was destroyed in this movie, a lot of the destruction was caused by Superman himself. How will the Americans fix that!? It's taken more than a decade to rebuild the World Trade Centre site! Yet I'm sure in any future sequel everything in Metropolis will be back to normal. Oh and beside the destruction let's not forget the hundreds and thousands of people that no doubt died!

When I heard that Nolan is involved with the writing of the movie, I expected a great deal from his new Superhero venture. The movie started out with a good origin background and great promise, but ultimately the flaws and screenplay made me lose interest in the movie. Some flaws in the development of the character and story are so glaring & ridiculous - 1> The day Clark Kent gets to know the details of his origins, the next day the whole earth becomes aware of it as well. 2> Lois Lane knows Superman's identity from the very beginning, and Clark joins the 'The Daily Planet' much later. 3> The whole movie turned out to be more about General Zod than about Superman. 4> And in this version, Superman didn't give a damn about the destruction and lives; he never tries to take the fight outside Metropolis, instead he slams the aliens into skyscrapers.Henry Cavill looked great as Clark Kent/ Superman, but there wasn't much to act. I don't know why Amy Adams agreed to do such a underdeveloped Lois Lane. As for the rest of the amazing cast - Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Lawrence Fishburne and Diane Lane - I don't know how they got involved with this mess.The first half gave dark and interesting glimpses into Clark's life, but the second half was just an irritatingly bombastic fight between aliens (I mean, Kryptonians), with the earth as the arena, and humans as the audience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worthy of the cape.,"Man of Steel. Let's do this.Let's start with the good. And there's plenty.The action is top notch. This is how a Superman movie should look. Flight, crazy powers, super-fast movements, collateral damage, explosions, all done well. The final battle, in particular, is pretty epic, and earned an applause from the audience at my showing.Visually stunning. 3D or IMAX is advised. It looks beautiful.Story/writing. The movie stays true to the lore of Superman, for the most part. Many factors are ripped straight from the books/comics. (The new Superman suit is almost a direct copy of the ""New 52"" version. The S-shield meaning comes from the ""Birthright"" stories. Monologues done by both Jor-El and Jonathon Kent are ripped directly from major books.)Henry Cavill is a worthy Superman. (Fan fact: Cavill auditioned, and was runner-up, in several other major roles, such as the most recent incarnations of James Bond and Bruce Wanye, and Robert Patterson's role in Twilight...)Michael Shannon (General Zod) and Russell Crowe (Jor-El) are GREAT.Now, the not-so-good...Amy Adams as Lois Lane - FAIL. Lois Lane is supposed to be a strong, spunky, smart-mouthed woman. Adams comes off as plain, annoying, and awkward. And, on a minor note...where's the dark hair? Her casting was a complete miss.The tornado scene. It's a major spoiler, so I won't get into it, but I have a MAJOR PROBLEM with that scene. It's so glaringly wrong/stupid that it absolutely slapped me out of the movie. You'll see what I mean.Lack of kryptonite. Superman's weakness is to a certain type of air now. (That's a huge exaggeration, he's not weak to air, but still, his ""weakness"" just feels kinda strange to me...)Superman...that's...that's not how you should exit the room...(it's a minor detail, but watch for the scene in a ship where Superman is talking to Jor-El...his exit is a bit strange...)NOTHING AFTER THE CREDITS. I guess only Marvel movies do that. You're free to leave once the credits start rolling.This movie is a fresh, shiny new take on a classic franchise. It's not perfect, but it's well done, and it had to be - The Dark Knight franchise is already established, but you know DC wants to work their way towards a Justice League movie sometime this decade, and they HAD to nail the Superman reboot to make it a possibility. Mission complete.Also, come prepared for the long haul...the movie clocks in at 2 and 1/2 hours.Man of Steel scores a 4 out of 5 on the BDBOS. Go see it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Action Blockbuster of the year.,"I thought this movie was great, it finally made sense why a villain wants to destroy the world. It showed a lot of Superman's past. It also shows Superman using his god like powers, cause that's what he is, a god among men. Other reviewers are saying it's action was over the top but that's what you get with Aliens from another world with such power. Best bit about the movie is that there is no kryptonite in the film, Kryptonite has been getting old and it's good to see that Superman can be beaten without having to use the deadly substance. It also made sense of why he's so powerful and can fly, but the bad part is that the film didn't explain how he got the heat vision power but they gave it a lot more uses than fighting enemies. I gave this movie 8/10. Action Blockbuster of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Super Great,This movie had so much action that it was so exciting to watch. This movie was a lot better then the old Superman movies to me. It was so intense and had a perfect plot. This is the way a superman movie should be made. I liked how they made krypton look and all the great special effects and graphics. I think they showed a little to much flashbacks and the only problem i had with the movie was the part when Superman healed Lois with his heat vision. It reminded me of Superman 2 on how they made the story and used the villains. This is a must see movie for all DC comic fans. Marvel fans should check this movie out too.

Really Really Bad,This was one of the most tedious spectacular turkeys of the summer. I was in awe of just how bad. I had that feeling after reading numerous movie critics say how it lacked pretty much everything a Superman movie should be and not enough to make a good superhero movie. Regardless I kept an open mind and was really shocked at just how lame and overwrought this movie was. It was full of clichés and made little sense most of the time. Nothing the characters did made any sense. At the end of the film one person clapped in the whole theater and all I wanted was the over 2 hours of my life back. I was especially stunned that Christopher Nolan was a part of this really bad film. I realize he was not directing it but it is so bad I can't believe he wouldn't want his name taken out of the credits.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Even the 3D sucks.,"I loved Zack Snyder's debut movie, the thrilling 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead; it must have been beginner's luck, because everything I have seen by the guy since has been utter garbage, with Man of Steel being no exception. Two and a half hours of superficial, overblown, CGI packed nonsense that fails spectacularly to make an emotional connection with the viewer in the first hour and thereafter settles for mindless action, the film is worse than I expected—and I never expected it to be good.The special effects employed in 1978's Superman The Movie might have been crude in comparison to the spectacular mayhem presented here, but as an overall experience, the Christopher Reeve film wins hands down, director Richard Donner giving his audience humour, pathos and a genuine sense of awe, helped in no small part by the wonderful John Williams score; Snyder achieves only boredom, his huge explosions and random destruction rapidly becoming extremely tedious.Tall, muscular and handsome, Henry Cavill makes for an impressive Supes (even in his dingy 21st century version of the iconic costume), Michael Shannon is suitably imposing as General Zod, and although Amy Adams is miscast as feisty reporter Lois Lane, I never complain when she is on-screen. But as hard as the cast might try, the magic is simply not there, David S. Goyer's plot-hole ridden script and Snyder's soul-less direction making this as bad as, if not worse than, Superman Returns (2006).4.5 out of 10, generously rounded up to 5 for Ms. Adams—who is as lovely as always—and that bad-ass, dark-haired Kryptonian chick, both of whom helped prevent me from dozing off.***EDIT*** I've changed my mind, this is only worth a 4 at best.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Superman of All Time,Man of Steel deserves a trilogy. It is so good. Period.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Hugely generic, utterly tedious, an opportunity wasted.","The film title Man of Steel is at least accurate. Man Of Steel IS NOT a Superman film. It's an utter bastardisation of the Superman character and this story could be easily interchanged to any generic super hero film.While the first half of the film is quite good, the second half is an exercise of CGI excess and generic action movie tropes and tedium quickly sets in. The film's last moronic half hour goes against Superman's true morals and beliefs and by that stage I lost any goodwill towards Superman that the film had earned at that point. Costner is easily the best thing in it.People may criticise Superman Returns, but after seeing Man Of Steel, I find Superman Returns is at least a true Superman film with a lot more integrity and reverence to the source, than this. Sadly they just miscast Superman Returns terribly.Man Of Steel confirms my belief than Zack Snyder is a hack. Evidence - Sucker Punch, Watchmen, 300 and this! A noisy, moronic, loud, unoriginal, missed opportunity and a far cry from the excellence of the recent Dark Knight trilogy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Man of Steel Flop,"I am fortunate to say that I have watched each Superman movie as they were released and it was thus, I waited with great anticipation for the 2103 release of Man of Steel. As each teaser trailer was release I became truly anxious as the potential to mess up such a brilliant franchise was very real. And then D day, or more aptly ""S"" day arrived. Horror of horrors. I was utterly devastated when I watched the first few minutes and realized immediately this was The Avengers but with just one superhero. How does one justify $225 million on just CG and VFX. And that's what this movie is all about. There are virtually no performances to speak off beside the moment Kevin Costner gets swept off by a Twister. He should receive his pay check. The rest...nope. It was the most painful few hours I have ever spent watching anything. The storyline was shallow and fragmented, performances were non existent, there was zero character development, everything seemed over emphasized, the soundtrack was barely audible etc etc.Zack Snyder and David Goyer should take a serious lesson from Bryan Singer of Superman Returns fame. Now that was a properly made movie. Beautifully shot, gorgeous performances, believable characters, romance, hate, fear, anger, joy, happiness all rolled into a film that has made the franchise proud.This movie is deeply disappointing. Hollywood is spitting out rubbish on almost a weekly basis but drivel on such a grand scale is nothing short of a crime. If only James Cameron got his hands on this before Zack Snyder...but then again it takes an intelligent man to pick great films and obviously Zack Snyder has proved he needs to go back to film school. A 1 star from me...",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A good death is its own reward.,"Firstly I'll miss Henry Cavill's Superman, man. I think man of steel is a pretty good movie, watched it a couple times in high school and enjoyed it then too. It was the start of Snyder's dark vision of what the DCEU was gonna be. I was afraid to revisit because I loved it then, but recently learned of how much people hated DC in the past few years.The visuals of krypton in ruin were amazing at the start. Actually reminded me of the Kryton series. Michael Shannon was acting his ass off, like he took this very seriously and made a good villain from that. We really get to see Superman's origins, not just the home planet but also his upbringing. Showing that despite basically being a god, him being raised by humans made him as human as any of us. So he's not just the man of steel. We see him as a young adult trying to find himself.I Still think it was pretty dumb to reveal to general zod he had to hone his senses. You know one thing I don't understand that annoys me so much is that humans, usually a military guy, fires guns at someone/something and can clearly tell they're bullet proof, but they still keep firing. Martian manhunter is revealed later on. So what was he doing? Watching Superman get his ass whooped in front row seats lol?This was a different take to Superman and most fans were upset. A lot of people were mad that Superman killed, but I didn't mind. We got to see a flawed more human Superman, but he was still a positive light. He was just a superhero who made mistakes like we do, who had moral dilemmas like anyone would. I also loved we got to see his connection with his human parents. I'm writing this after binging man of steel to ZSJL straight so I might be blending things a little.Some similar funny lines from different movies, I'm forgetting one more because I remember thinking of four while watching this:""Where did you train? On a farm!"" - Zod.""I am Kang, you talk to fish!"" - Kang
""You think you're so great because you have boats!"" - Napoleon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very disappointing to say the least.,"""Man of Steel"" was void of all the integral elements needed to make a good and interesting film. The character development felt like filler, the plot was unnecessarily over the top and story was full of holes and constantly trying to perpetuate itself to the next fight scene. This is not the Superman story I wanted to see. The fact that because Superman is this all powerful, demigod kind of character doesn't mean he needs an epic film. I would of been happier if it focused on the romance with Lois, how he got his morals and why he does the right thing, because with this rendition of Superman I'm really not sure.Thematically speaking this film is all over the place, it just has no identity just lots of CGI and money thrown at it.It really has the overly serious Nolan/Batman atmosphere where I think with a character like Superman Snyder should of taken a leaf out of Marvel's book and made the film fun.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too much to Handle,"I saw most of the superhero movies and my favourite has been Batman so far...So when i was said that this one comes from the factory of Batman makers,i was super excited.Superman for all reason stands the strongest of superhero according to me..His immense power and solid strength has to have a ultimate opponent to face..and that is what exactly this movie offers,But what the makers forgot was the people who are watching this are humans..At one point of time you seriously lose the track of who's fighting with whom,with so many gas stations going on fire and buildings turning down into dusts..Further 3D gives u tough time over the clarity of the scenes..First half of movie travels slowly into your mind and conveniently settles down there making you feel every bit of the fabulous screenplay and characters but second half simply knocks you down with its loudness,In the end you will leave your seats confused as to recommend this movie to your friends or not.All in all,i saw something that i have never seen before on silver screen...A good feeling !!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too much special effects,"Warning: spoiler alerts""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders"" Jor-El (Russell Crowe).Over 70 years ago. Joe Shusten and Jerry Siegel created a superhero which saw daylight in those days. The character were the first superhero which success created a massive changes and brought new era to superheroes. It was golden age to writers. Back then heroes were pure and traditional hero without darkness. There wasn't anti-heroes like Wolverine which reminded Hollywood icons like Clint Eastwood. Superman is always have been popular character and original concept is same like before. Until Zack Snyder took the film to directing.Reboots are big word on nowadays Hollywood. Man of Steel started again Superman's story. But this time in shortly way. The movie starts on the planet named Krypton which.. well every fan know how the story starts. Reboot worked very well in Batman Begins. Christopher Nolan's name is now ""hot"" and pure gold to the studios. He was one of the producers In this movie. Does his name helped and was man of steel good reboot like Batman? Unfortunately ""the gold finger's"" touch wasn't that powerful.The cast is a-list. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane nailed their roles in good way. Amy Adams were good in Lois Lane role but like many other love interest roles it became ""lady in trouble"" style and acting was not main thing. Michael Shannon as Zod was interesting choice. But the script was biggest problem that his performance was boring and unmemorable. Henry Cavill sounded good in the hero role. But once again the the story is full of special effects and the story suffered a little bit. He was like The Terminator/robot. At least he smiled a few times. The best thing in whole movie was Russell Crowe as Jor-El. I will not compare him to Marlon Brando's performance. In this movie Jor-El got more action and larger role.The visual side looked cool but some action scenes effects went to in the video game style. Not good at all. The movie has many action scenes and the battle between Superman and General Zod was quite good but boring. It reminded a lot of The Matrix Revolution final battle. Biggest problem was that Superman wasn't Superman in the end. I know that he was the rookie in this film. But Zack Snyder with his team took away man of steel morality and ""I don't kill"" attitude was gone.Man of Steel is an entertaining movie and I will wait a long awaited Superman Vs Batman movie",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Darker, more mythic Superman","While the dark tone of Man of Steel is clearly influenced by the most recent Batman series, the first thing I thought of was Excalibur. This film is Superman as legend. Here, we get little of Clark Kent on the farm, and only a second of Clark Kent reporter; this movie is all about the epic mythology of Superman.The result is quite intense. There is a more elaborate than usual portrayal of the end of Krypton, with Russel Crowe offering an action hero interpretation of Jor-el that is far removed from Marlon Brando. It's an exciting opening with terrific special effects. Kent's childhood is mainly viewed as an alien trying to cope, and the adult Kent is an angsty hero in hiding.It's a seriously different approach to the character, but I think it's quite enjoyable. No, it's not a ""fun"" Superman battling a cartoonish Lex Luthor, nor an ""all-American"" Superman defined by his farmer parents, but I thoroughly enjoyed this. The action is terrific; much of it is basically elaborate fist fights between all-powerful beings, which is more entertaining than one might expect.The story is involving, the special effects are impressive, the acting is solid, and even though I like the Chris Reeves Superman, I'm happy to see a different approach to this well-worn material.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very good start...,"""Man of Steel"" is an action fantasy movie of DC in which we watch the story of Superman. Clark Kent is a simple young boy who learns that he has extraordinary superpowers and that he is not from Earth but for a different planet. After some years he discovers that he came from a different planet to Earth and he starts to search his true identity and why was sent to Earth. The superhero inside him starts to grow when an army of survivors invade Earth and threatens to destroy it. In order for Superman to become a symbol of hope for all the people and to succeed a lot of obstacles have to be surpassed.I liked this movie even though I was never a fan of Superman because it showed him from a different perspective than all the other movies of Superman or even some series. It has a well-written script, very good visual effects, and cinematography. I also liked the interpretations of Henry Cavill who played as Clark Kent / Kal-El/ Superman, Michael Shannon who played as General Zod and Diane Lane who played as Martha Kent. I expected more from Amy Adams who played as Lois Lane and from Russell Crowe who played as Jor-El. Despite that Zack Snyder for one more time makes an average direction with too much darkness as most of his movies and many flashes of lightning which makes impossible for audience to focus on something.To sum up, I have to say that ""Man of Steel"" is a good and interesting movie to watch and have a good time. If you compare this movie after watching it, with ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" which is a $250 million average movie and nothing more, you will find out why ""Man of Steel"" is far better than this. I strongly recommend for everyone to see it because it has an interesting plot, very good cast and their interpretations which were mentioned above were excellent. It's not a movie just to spend two and a half hours of your life and I believe that if you have high expectations or hopes about it then you are not going to be disappointed by it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I hate superhero films.,"I loved this film. Just saw it for the first time today, August 2021. I regret not having seen it in the theatre as it's clearly meant to be watched on the huge screen, in bone-rattling surround-sound.I should amend the above by saying I loved the OG Superman when I was a little kid. Naturally, from a production-value standpoint this film blows that one out of the water (it was the early 80s...or late 70s?...after all), but the important bit is it does so without also coming off as incomprehensibly-CGI'd (cough *every other superhero action film in the last 20 years* cough) and it rivals the original in all other categories as well, except Reeve, who will forever be the best Superman no matter how fantastic Henry Cavill is (and he is pretty much perfect in this), except...okay, think of it this way: they're basically neck and neck for best Superman, just different kinds, Cavill the serious one, Reeve the goofier one. There's enough room in my heart for both of them.This film is beautifully shot and edited, cinematography A+, score A+. Instead of cheap action and cheap, dumb, adolescent humor, it's grown-up, as in, smart and remarkably sensitive (it's basically about love, after all); That's what happens when you produce a film around story instead of a bunch of contrivances designed to force plot points, cause explosions, and move gratuitous action along.That just about sums it up, except to say the critics were fools, and I agree with other reviewers here that it's much better than it was given credit for when it was first released.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing after so much wait and anticipation,"Let me be clear on one thing that I generally have a lenient opinion in rating movies. Also, I watched this movie first day, first show and hence I was not at all biased with any reviews in my head. Though, leniently speaking, I rate it only 6/10.The reason is clear that I was disappointed. Why? Easy. What do you expect when you hear a year ago that Christopher Nolan after his successes in Batman is producing a movie on Superman? Added to it is Zack Snyder's direction. I saw Watchmen(one of Zack Snyder's better movies) only to see his direction and I was utterly impressed. These are two classic movie makers. I had expected a gripping plot, unorthodox direction, a good story and some decent action.The only place where this movie stood out was the action part. Though, it had too much action. The second half has nothing else. So, maybe good for action fans. Next comes the story. Here are the most expectations since Nolan has got the ability to make stories exciting without twists (his special ability). Nolan has written a new story but it gives up in the first half hour itself. Very predictable. The direction from Zack Snyder promises in the first half but fails later. The first half show touches of both Nolan and Snyder trying to make a crooked plot but to no good as we all come to know where it heads. Still, I intriguingly saw the first half expecting a good climax. Hopes fail me even this time. The end is very straight. This disappoints because the second half has nothing but action and story lovers like me want to see the unpredictable or at least something fruitful of the wait. Lastly, as I already mentioned, the plot is no good since ""it is never created"" - the biggest failure of the movie.Overall, this is not what you expect when you see two of the best superhero movie makers combine to make one. The Dark Knight Trilogy was Epic with a similar to comic story though gripping and intriguing and Watchmen was a beauty in plot, climax.The acting can be said about as good since this was my first Henry Cavill or Amy Adams movie. They tried but to no good.Apart from this, there are holes in the story!!! Unanswerable happenings (don't want to write spoilers see for yourself). The dialogues, the strength of any Nolan story, are nowhere except one or two good ones which are copied themselves.Overall, the simple story goes on and fights keep up. Really disappointed (5/10). I make it 6/10 because I felt that there was hard work behind even though only in the action department. Also, I feel copyright issues are likely to have kept the story down even though this is improbable after The Dark Knight.Watch this on DVD.P.S. I talk about 1st and 2nd halves here because we had an interval in the movie about midway(created by the theater people for some snacks sale).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Would Superman Please Make Himself Known to the Audience,"Here's the problem.To make a successful Superman movie you only need one thing...SUPERMAN.Not hard is it.Why is it then that he is completely absent???Sure there's a blue and red blob that zips from one scene to the next but I didn't pay to watch a pixelated blur.I came to share a couple of hours with my favourite super hero of all time.The guy who, when I was a kid, was on my bed clothes and whose outfit I proudly wore to every fancy dress party.Alas it was not to be.I'm not knocking Henry. He ticks a lot of the boxes but we just didn't spend any time with him. We didn't get to know him. We didn't care for him.How could the writers of the brilliant Dark Knight series and the director of the equally brilliant Watchmen get it so wrong. Those films were all about character development.We got to know them as human beings.

This is exactly how a Superman movie is supposed to be.This movie got a lot of hate in the beginning and I honestly think it was just envy in the industry because it was so ahead of everything else.

Not for the non geek.,"I wouldn't classify myself as a geek, however, I am familiar with other films in the superhero genre so I thought I would give this a chance.Overall I have very mixed emotions towards it, while I found the opening drawing in my attention for the first 20 minutes, the next 30 had me struggling to keep my eyes open as the premise for Clarke Kent's life was unravelled. Having not read the comics I failed to recognise the subtle references that brought smiles to my friends and the plot went down a predictable, uninteresting route.As the plot moved forward I started to regain focus and I have to say the action/effects were pretty good. This being said I must criticise the consistent necessity in all Hollywood blockbusters to destroy every building in site for no apparent reason. I find it dull and unoriginal.I find Superman the most tedious of all action heroes and although the film brought a successful modern appeal to the character but I'm afraid the film failed to move him up the table.That all said.... 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Zack Snyder strikes again...,"If there's one thing anyone can say about Zack Snyder, it's that he is one of the most visionary directors around. He has repeatedly amazed with his visual concepts to film and has wowed us with sheer visual wonder. Unfortunately, his dedication to visual amazement often leaves characters in the dust, and this happens again with Man of Steel.While I do not particularly dislike any of Snyder's film, they seem to consistently lack the emotional appeal that I hope to feel that allows me to be more than a spectator, but rather a participant in the film. I do not feel engaged - mentally or emotionally - by Snyder's style; only a sense of visual admiration. Man of Steel is no different. While it provides the stunning presentation of Superman, Krypton, and an epic battle with Zod, I didn't feel enough emotional drive to really care about what was happening. Sure it looked cool, but in the end, I didn't really care.I had hopes for this movie with Christopher Nolan producing, and unfortunately his incredibly minimal participation in this film is felt. The script has potential, but the characters are not given the time needed to really establish the relationships that sell the story. Lois (the over- rated Amy Adams) and Clark's relationship literally develops across two scenes - well, really one and a half due to the fact that one of those scenes is broken up with a flashback. We see them meet, have one conversation a while later, and then the next time we see them, they're holding hands. Wait, when did that happen? There is the relationship with Clark and Martha (an unimpressive Diane Lane) that starts with a beautifully empathetic scene that is then left hanging out to dry. And Clark's relationship with his father is effective in it's duration, we just don't get enough of it. Meanwhile, an unnecessary length of time is spent establishing the downfall of Krypton and the character of Jor-El, that while relevant is made overly important.The pitfalls of the movie are almost redeemed by fantastic performances by Henry Cavill and Michael Shannon (Zod). Cavill brings the perfect balance of charm and power, while Shannon once again proves he is the most effective ""creepy"" guy in Hollywood. Unfortunately, these performances don't entirely make up for the bland and superficial performance from Amy Adams and a very underwhelming performance by Diane Lane. Kevin Costner definitely fits as Jonathan Kent, I just would have preferred more of him and less of Russell Crowe's Maximus (Sorry, I mean Jor-El. It's hard to note the difference other than wardrobe).Altogether, Man of Steel is the visual feet of summer entertainment that it deserves to be. Just don't expect to come out of the theater feeling any sort of emotion toward the characters. That's not what Zack Snyder does, and that's not what you're going to get here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Good, But a Bit Silly","Man of Steel is the reboot of the movie saga that started out with Superman: The Movie in 1978 and ended with Superman Returns in 2006. It tells the classic story of how Superman is transported to Earth, and how the planet is invaded by a villain called General Zod. Yeah, we all know the story by now, so let's just move on.I was not really looking forward to this movie. First off, DC Comics aren't really my favorite. I have liked the Superman movies in the past (except for Superman IV), but they've never really stood out. Another reason I was skeptical was because it is produced and written by Christopher Nolan, the creator of the Dark Knight trilogy. I was afraid he would turn the comical and family-friendly Superman into a dark and realistic character that wouldn't feel right.Man of Steel is a silly movie. It's pretty entertaining, but it's overall a stupid adaptation of the Superman name. They try to make us take the character of Superman seriously, and it doesn't work. When will they ever make Superman the comedic guy that he was in the past?This movie looks great, and the action scenes are some of the most spectacular I've seen in a while. But especially towards the end, it all becomes a bit too much. Even then, the CGI is great and the soundtrack is also pretty good.The movie starts off very promising, but eventually just develops into your everyday typical big-budget action movie. A lot of the characters are underdeveloped, and the only ones I really cared for were the relationship between Superman and his human parents.Another big flaw is how seriously the movie takes itself. It works for the first half hour or so, but when Superman puts on his suit ... oh man, that made me laugh. It just looks so silly and out of place. I was just thinking: ""What is Superman doing in this film?""Overall, Man of Steel is a pretty cool movie. However, if you enjoy the comedic Superman movies of the past, not to mention those hilarious classic cartoons, you'll probably be disappointed. The movie looks great, the acting is good, and the action scenes are spectacular. But the movie is really long and you don't care for the characters nor the story. Why does everything have to be dark and serious these days?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
No one was born as good,"The translated title in Chinese is 'Superman: man of steel', just like 'the dark knight' in 'batman: the dark knight'. So it was a little surprised when I noticed the real title in the end.I'm not so appreciate about commercial movies, but the superhero movies are the except. I like them no matter Marvel or DC. Also The Boys or Invincible are my favourite. And I have to say, when I first watched this movie 8 years ago, I get shocked.It's a Superman's origin story, which maybe not so expected for audiences especially who already know about the heroes. In fact, Captain American and Thor was so terrible, and the origin movie made me impressive in Marvel was just the Iron man. Which can show its difficulty.But Zack Snyder and his team did that. The clothes, the music, the fight, and the simple but meaningful story. No one borns good, even Superman, but everyone can choose to be good. A simple story but more close to the reality. This time we didn't see a Deus EX Machina, but a human forced to be a god. And that's the key to the next movie.What a pity for DC. Restore the snyderverse.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better attempt of superman movie but not the best one.,"Man of steel released with high expectations because of the movie directed by Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan who written story along with David S.Goyer and produced the movie also David S.Goyer scripted the film. Christopher Nolan and David S.Goyer are the team who already given a different dimension for Batman series and made huge success over it, can come out with Superman this time.As like Batman series, this movie also finds the same way of human-superhero movie concepts. Even though Superman having more powers and strengths he got beaten by villain and survive the life to make success by using his powers is the base idea of this movie and that shows the story was strongly written by Christopher Nolan. He always uses this methodology and one of the best examples is Batman series done by him.Man of steel is a much better reboot of Superman series and comparing to previous movie Superman Returns (2006) of its series; this movie is very good and done with neat story line with lot of action sequences.Zack Snyder who given movies like 300, Sucker punch directed this movie with high level of technical aspects.CG is very great throughout the movie and its Visual effects are stunning in action sequences.All the cast are done very neatly. Henry Cavill as a Superman is the best choice and he has done a decent performance. Also the costume and looks of Superman as been changed to very modern that should be liked by all very much. Russell Crowe gives more support for this movie by his brilliant acting. Amy Adams looks very gorgeous throughout the movie and acted very well. Michael Shannon as a villain tried to make fear the audience through his acting. In all the superhero movies villain is considered as the most important than hero, but no one can beat the joker.The reason for reboot the Superman again by Christopher Nolan is very clear the he finishes the Batman series and tries to make Justice League with Batman and Superman combo. That's why he given this Superman movie on his own style.But this movie should not be the best like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Because it lacks in screenplay and sound effects.BG score is not at all the best. Really felt very disturbed BG score. More noisy sound effects are done in this movie. And the screenplay should not be clear and having very lengthy fight sequences makes the movie to feel bore in the second half.Overall this is a better reboot of Superman series but not the best one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
SUPERMAN IS DEAD this film is KRYPTONITE,"I can see why this movie appeals to a majority of people, it has all the explosions, fighting and fast flickering none stop action that seems to satisfy people today and it has it in abundance.#I hate films which I have often reviewed as being ""pretentious"" and what I like to call ""Emperors new clothes"" which often get great reviews by other ""pretentious"" people who like to say how much they love some arty piece of drivel so that they can appear intellectual to the rest of us, as though we missed the greatness simply because we are not intelligent enough to have understood this cinematic masterpiece.Unfortunately in a reversal of my usual standpoint, today I can't help thinking that I have become a member of the ""highbrow brigade"" as Man of Steel is what I can only think of as a ""placebo of action for the in- intellectuals"".For me this film was tedious, I struggled to keep my eyes open and the character at the heart of the film wasn't Superman, it was ironman, thor or a generic super hero with a cape, who was indestructible and could fly...and nothing else. Assuming the writer ""Goyer"" and the Director ""Snyder"" are to blame for this debacle, what were they thinking?I cannot claim to be a comic book reader, I'm no super hero geek, and I honestly don't know whether Superman is DC or Marvel. But I do know what superman is, and this ain't it.Superman is not bolshy and tough, he is humble and meek, he doesn't allow thousands of people to die, because he is happy to push the bad guys through buildings making them collapse on the innocent public. There is a previous poster (lyre) that goes into the details of how many things are wrong with this film and I agree with every one of them.So reap what you sew those that accolade this movie, I fear is that this is the end of Superman, this film has ruined it for the future as with this being a box office success, and the great unwashed looking at it favourably. Be aware that all future Superman films will be driven by sales and money hungry corporations will say...make more like that.. so well done Snyder and Goyer..you have killed superman.one more thing to add to the nonsense reported by Lyer, how come everyone can teleport between Kansas and Whatever city ""Metropolis?"" it's supposed to be set in, seems superman and his foes push each other through countless collapsing buildings, up floors and be back and too between the desert, space, the city in a matter of seconds, to always have Lois Lane to rescue, or follow them up the stairs and be at the centre of the action...Is she super too?You may well applaud this film now, but give it a couple of years and watch it on the same day as the classic Christopher Reeve version and you will then see how lacking in substance and Superman ethics this horrible horrible film was.

What a terrible film. The WB needs To STOP making comic book movies.,"The first hour is a meandering, repetitive mess but at least it was interesting to a point. Its only redeeming quality is the fact that Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner are great actors in any setting. Too bad even that can't save this movie. The second half of this movie plays out like a moody and idiotic video game. The changes they made to cannon are annoying but not half as annoying as the terrible story they tried to hammer home as better than the Superman mythos we already know. Is that arrogance to think they knew better or stupidity? Either way, this is just a bad movie experience, period.Sometimes updates on old stories work out wonderfully. Batman Begins and Incredible Hulk, for example, got a lot of things right and are great examples. They help make the reboot idea a good one. Sometimes they're a train wreck, however, and Man of Steel is a sad example of that. This movie may have more action than the awful Superman Returns but it actually gets more wrong than right. It does rehash old Superman glory. It forges its own path but that path is so far down the wrong road that maybe another rehash wouldn't have been so bad after all. Trying so hard to go in a different direction, they really did crash and burn. Word of mouth is going to be awful from the non-fanboys. Overall, I have to say there're some fine performances here but little else to make this movie worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining but flawed,"I just finished watching Man of Steel. As I usually do, following an entertaining movie, I look at other user reviews to see what people thought. I was disappointed to see such a disparity in ratings. Either 10 stars or 1. I'm here to tell you this movie is a solid 6.5 to 7. It's not going to be on any of my all time lists. However, I loved every moment watching it. There are lots of plot holes. So many that I wonder how this can happen in a big budget film. Surely someone should be able to say, ""this doesn't make sense, we have to correct that."" I'm even a little insulted that maybe the writers and directors assume the viewers are too dumb to notice. However, in a make believe, comic book, action movie, I can look past that stuff and take the movie for what it is.It is a great ride that successfully pulls all the right strings. I was gripped, I was happy, I cried, I laughed. I think it could have been so much more, but what was here, I'd watch again. I think most of us have been spoiled by the greatness of Batman Begins. I know I secretly hoped this was going to be the Superman version. A mature adaptation of, what is likely, the most beloved comic book hero ever. It isn't. Not even close. So, instead of comparing and wishing it was a more intelligent and well written script, I will enjoy it for what it is. That is a good action movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Caught me by surprise,"Now I am a Marvel guy all the way. Have read comics all my life and never really had any affiliation to DC. I have never been a fan of their films either. The original Burton Batmans I thought were too gloomy, then they became a bit to bright and jazzy with the Kilmers and Clooneys. Even the recent Nolan films I never really warmed to. I watched Superman Returns which I found boring, Aquaman and Dawn of Justice just awful. Thinking about it the only DC stuff I have liked were the 60s Batman series, Christopher Reeves Superman films (1 & 2 only) and I saw the first Wonder Woman a while back which was ok. The thing about the DCU is that it is just really noisy. Loads of rock music, explosions and CGI, like a CGI MTV movie. Anyway I therefore had not watched Man of Steel. It popped up on Netflix and I thought I would give it a whirl. It was great. I thought Cavill was excellent in the lead role. Something I had not really noticed in Dawn of Justice. He looked the part and acted the part. The closest to Reeve yet. The back up characters were also good, his folks, Lois, Crowe, Zod. The story was great as were the action sequences. My only real criticism is the noise levels again. I constantly had to use the remote to keep turning up when they were speaking (could not hear them) and then down what with all the explosions and background music. It was a pain. The sound people at DC really need to sort those issues out with their movies. Great movie though. Was going to say that I am looking forward to the next one but DoJ has been and gone and was a disaster. I have not watched Justice League though so will give that a bash and am looking forward to the next Cavill Superman Solo movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Strong film, but it suffers from some action overdose","¨You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be, Clark. Whoever that man is, he's going to change the world.¨There is no doubt in my mind that Man of Steel is a far more superior movie than its predecessor: Superman Returns. The franchise has gotten a positive reboot with director Zack Snyder at the helm and Christopher Nolan as one of the producers. I know this isn't a perfect film, I thought it had several flaws, but compared to Superman Returns this is a masterpiece. What surprises me is that even though most critics acknowledge the fact that this is a superior film, in Rotten Tomatoes this film was only recommended by 57% of critics, compared to the 75% that recommended Superman Returns. For those of us who have seen both movies we know that is a tremendous flaw and most critics would agree that they gave too much anticipated love to Superman Returns which was a really mediocre movie. I can understand why they disliked this film because I think the film suffers from an action overdose. There is just way too much action in this film and it grows repetitive and tiresome. Snyder goes overboard with the action sequences and there is just way too much destruction that goes unaccounted for. I mean the entire city of Metropolis gets completely destroyed in this film and there are far too many 9/11 references here. That is the major issue I had with this film. Other than that I thought the movie had a great cast. Henry Cavill made for an exciting and near perfect Superman, Amy Adams nailed her role as Lois Lane, and Michael Shannon was a convincing villain as General Zod. Besides the cast, I also thought the flashback scenes involving the young Clark Kent were the strongest moments of the film. It was those quiet moments that I enjoyed more than all the loud action scenes in which Clark Kent was struggling to find his new identity. Those scenes worked really well for me and I thought Kevin Costner and Diane Lane were wonderful playing his Earth parents. I wasn't a big fan of the opening sequence in Krypton, but thought Russell Crowe also was convincing as Jor-El.The film opens in Krypton where we see Jor-El (Russell Crowe) help his wife give birth to his son, Kal-El, the first natural birth in the planet in a long time. The planet is at the verge of being extinct and Jor-El finds hope in his son, although General Zod (Michael Shannon) has different plans for his people. Despite Zod's efforts to stop Jor-El, he manages to send his son to Earth where he can survive. At Earth he is adopted by Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane) who find him in their field in Kansas. The film centers on Clark (Henry Cavill) as he struggles to find meaning and purpose for his life. With the help of his parents he begins to deal with his powers, but is reminded that he should use these abilities as little as possible because the world isn't prepared for someone like him. The scenes involving Clark's childhood and his upbringing with his parents is told through a series of flashbacks as we see a much more mature Clark searching for the meaning of his existence in one place after another. He finally finds some answers when an ancient craft from Krypton is located on Earth and that is when he also runs into journalist, Louis Lane (Amy Adams) who discovers Clark isn't a regular human being. His secret life is shattered when General Zod makes a theatrical entrance in his spaceship along with his crew and asks mankind to surrender the alien. Of course Zod has other intentions for the planet and doesn't really settle for Kal-El. This is where the battle and destruction on Earth begins, and Clark Kent ironically remains the only hope for mankind.Man of Steel delivers and fans of blockbuster action films will love this film. I thought the action sequences suffered from too much overload and repetitiveness. The scenes are extremely exaggerated and they grew tiresome after a while. I loved most of the film, but the last 45 minutes took a toll on me and made me enjoy this film less and less. That doesn't mean I didn't like this and of course I would rather sit through this than watch Superman Returns again (a film that critics seem to have enjoyed more). The problem is that after so many great superhero films, Man of Steel does fall short to other films like The Dark Knight or even Iron Man. It is probably at the same level as Thor, but I wouldn't say this is a great superhero film because it is inferior to the bar that the Batman franchise set. I even think Iron Man 3 was a better movie than this, but Man of Steel did have its moments and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people really like this blockbuster film considering the excellent cast and the wonderful performance from Henry Cavill as the new Superman.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Yes it had Super Casting...  A Super Story... and Super Special Effects,"My husband and I were very happy we went to see the new movie MAN OF STEEL. The story was fresh and interesting because it was about his home planet, getting sent here, and his role on earth so before he took on the ""Clark Kent"" identity of hiding under people's noses working at a newspaper like in previous movies. The special effects were many and fantastic and really worth seeing on a big, big screen. I loved Henry Cavill as Superman. He brought something special to the role just as Christopher Reeves did years ago in his version. Cavill was so believable, he was superman. I liked the actor playing the younger Superman. All the casting was right on and added so much to the movie. Russell Crowe as Superman's powerful father from their home world. Michael Shannon and Antje Traue playing it just right as villains who were not over the top weird as sometimes comic villains can be. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as a Kansas farming couple raising Superman and coping with his powers and differences. Amy Adams as a questioning but honorable Lois Lane. Christopher Meloni as tough military.It had something for everyone so go enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
To uneven and deviates to much!,"The Avatar-ish dragon(fly) on Krypton and the bug-like space crafts might have looked good, but at the same time they were cringe worthy when placed in a high-tech world as Krypton. In stead of cars exploding almost every time there is a crash in an American movie, we now have explosions when someone crashes into a building...! After being told to hide his whole life, Clark reveals himself several times during the beginning of the movie without getting any better at concealing himself. At least a couple of times characters went from struggling to control their powers, and then mastering them within seconds... Perhaps the worst episode in the entire movie was how the fight with General Zod ended. That ending was COMPLETELY out of character for Superman!!! After some minutes into the movie, I realized that I had seen it before, and that I had forgotten. That is not a good sign for a movie...On the other hand, the sound and the visual effects were good, the acting seemed as good as the script and direction would allow, and the action was good. Realy good acting in the movie was done by Michael Shannon as General Zod, and Russel Crowe as Jor-El.In the end, I would say that this movie is not exactly a masterpiece, but it is OK, and worth wile to watch even if the flashy CGI outshines the story in this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Cavill is superb, supporting performances are great, but production and cinematography seal the win","To this day I recall how phenomenal and chills-inducing the original teaser trailer was. What we got was everything promised and more. Russell Crowe as Superman's father was excellent, and foremost I must say that the script was amazing. Michael Shannon as Zod was awesome to the very end, and Henry Cavill was simply incredible in such a role, powerfully eliciting various emotions all while being easy on the eyes. The interspersed flashbacks were done very well. Music was great. Produced by Christopher Nolan? Clearly. The film is gorgeous but has this gritty, dramatic overtone that, when paired with certain cinematographic moments, have the potential of triggering chills or, with me personally, even tears. And I'm not a major Superman fan! With all my praise, the only real gripe I had with the movie was, ironically, most (but not all) of the action; when Superman fought Zod and co, it was a mess of flying and zipping through the air or buildings. Between headache-inducing and monotonous to watch. Which I think goes to show just how impactful of an origin story this was.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awful Reinvention of the Superman with Explosions plus Explosions and CGI,"Superman is undoubtedly one of the most ancient superheroes of many generations in many countries. The story of Kal-el and the fate of his doomed planet Krypton are absolutely well-known of most persons. Along the decades, we have read comic books and seen movies in the theaters and shows in television with minor modifications or deviations from the original story.""Man of Steel"" is an awful reinvention of the Superman, with explosions plus explosions and CGI. However, the essence of the superhero is gone. It is ridiculous the destruction of the entire city to save Earth and the visual concept of Krypton and the Phantom Zone; actually they are pretext to use more CGI and explosions. Clark Kent letting his father die? Superman killing villains? If there is no other possibility of writing a new decent adventure of this superhero, let's him rest in peace and create a new hero.

"Great cast, so-so story, too much visual trickery","Enjoyed it of course. Not bowled over. The casting was terrific. Oddly most actors dealing with this American icon were not American. But they were well cast especially Israeli Ayelet Zurer as Lara.The eugenics angle in Kryptonian procreation was a new idea and a bad one. While Michael Shannon was superb as General Zod, that character never appeared in the comics so seemed an artificial villain choice, and his dénouement scene, after all that excessive visual fluff, was muddy. Contrast all those Jack Kirby inspired comic book splash panel scenes with the calm practicality of the Chris Meloni character (who is still L&O's Elliot Stabler), which worked well.Zod and Jonathan Kent tried to be philosophical about patriotism and heroism and who Clark was. But it was fake philosophy, seemed to me, or was cut short. Half-ass try I guess. ""Our viewers don't want ideas they want action"" may well have been the operative sensibility.Interesting plot point that who Supe was became no secret to Lois Lane. But the closing scene she seems clearly to not know that this new reporter Clark was also the Clark she knew as the superman figure (though the Name Superman was not itself clearly marked out in the storyline). Was this a bluff in that scene or did she get Alzheimer's? That relationship and whether she knew or didn't know might be a better starting angle for the next Superman movie than more CGI bee-ess and more Krypton origins and more Luthor shenanigans.

"Intense, Gripping, Climactic. Must see!","First of all, to address the reviews giving this movie one star. I must say there aren't many movies that actually warrant such a low score. This is not one of them. Any self-respecting cinema-lover should appreciate the giant strides Man of Steel attempted, as the last few Superman movies were certainly didn't deliver on this caliber.The movie features stunning visual effects (some reviewers claim they were used too much, I don't feel that way, especially for a movie featuring inhuman feats), visually-surrounding environments and situations that leave you gripping the end of your seat.I must admit, I am a huge fan of what Superman stands for in culture. Henry Cavill, who portrays Superman, appears a kind-hearted, chivalrous yet confused young man trying to find his purpose in life.The other actors and actresses did a phenomenal job. I don't think I would personally replace anyone if given the opportunity.The movie offers a touching landscape amidst a complex storyline. I feel that if Superman waltzed into public view in today's time, reactions would be similar to what the movie posited.Many reviewers rant negatively about the correctness of the lore, plot holes and the like, all of which can be argued and eventually refute. To spare everyone of this silly debate, I just wanted to mention that the film simply touched my emotions. The special effects and climactic timed were placed perfectly within the movie, and it was difficult for me not to feel emotionally for the situation. Many movies do not move me on a subconscious level, yet overtime this movie constantly met all of my logical and emotional requirements.If you have not seen the movie, don't listen to the overly harsh critics, and just go see it for yourself.

A good but flawed production.,"I am old enough that I must admit that I have seen every single Superman film ever made. I am fond of of the Donner original, but it was far from perfect.

It was somewhat dull and Brandon Routh was not the best choice to play Supes.In the order of full disclosure, I will admit to not being a huge Zach Snyder fan. This film did suffer some of his shortcomings. His vision of Krypton was wonderful and very refreshing. The way he introduced Clark to Lois was probably the best version that anyone has thought of. The action sequences are second to none. The actors chosen were well selected for their respective parts. But the film was a bit over the top with all the destruction of a city and dozens upon dozens of buildings. My biggest issue was the pacing and editing. The film was slow at times and I found myself being...oddly enough...bored.

"Superficial story, CGI-packed, good for a 10-year-old","I was expecting this movie for a long time, and I must say I expected more from it. The story-line was disappointing and simple, in the style of most of today's action movie spectacles (such as Transformers II or III, or Battleship...). Acting is also not better than in the mentioned action-movie-type-sort. All of us who had seen the classic character masterfully played by Chris Reeve know that his Clark Kent (but also Superman) is hard to beat in terms of acting and depicting their/his multi-layer personality. The Clark character MUST be clumsy and a bit awkward, it MUST be something opposite to the strong and determined Superman (in order to preserve his cover-identity). Sometimes these two halves of personality collide inside, and no-one has presented this better than the great C. Reeve. This movie is totally missing that bit. The Clark Kent character seems detached, talks little, and is more of a physical character. The director often said that he wanted to display ""a new Superman/C.Kent"", but they didn't manage to make anything but a crash-smash-boom-bang movie with a week story-line and shallow performance, and muscles seem to be more important these days than acting itself. Also, American directors apparently have to explain everything to their audience, thinking that the audience is perhaps too stupid to conclude something on their own. This was no exception: Lois Lane just had to tell us that C.Kent is a sort of a misfit, someone who was not accepted or understood by society. As if we couldn't see that for ourselves. Not to mention the almost constant reference to Jesus, from 33-year-old Superman, the savior of mankind, to his arms wide spread on several occasions, just like on church icons. The previous movie, Superman Returns, was criticized as a work not as good as the classic movies about Superman, but I must say that Brandon Routh played a much more charming C. Kent, although Superman Returns was also a disappointment in many areas: miscasting (actors way too young considering the context of the movie), a long and boring story, awful K. Spacey (maybe the worst of his parts ever) etc. It seems that today's audience (or at least today's movie directors think so) asks for a lot of explosions and CGI, and a little exploration of characters themselves, and the story apparently doesn't need to be logical, or deep, or plausible, if that is at all possible in these fantasy-story lines. All in all, although by today's standards, the special effects of the classic movie series seem ridiculous, it seems that no-one can beat C.Reeve and M. Kidder in portraying these epic characters.

A unique take on the story of Superman but is it better than the original?,"Like many of the people who watched this movie, I grew up with the terrific and still sensational 1977/78 version of Superman and the movies that followed. The ultimate Superman, ""Christopher Reeve"".The original movies to me, still present the best Superman. They also introduced the world to Superman in way which was less in your face and with a story telling that flowed well.This version of Superman, certainly had some impressive CGI and an interesting interpretation of Krypton. All actors performed terrifically and even the tech had elements faithful to the original, which was pleasing.However, it had a serious flaw which made me want to go and re-watch the original, to detox.This was the jagged story telling. Jumping from past to present and everything in between. For me, it didn't work with a straight forward story like Superman. It was also trying to condense elements from the original movies into one movie(In particular Superman 1 and Superman 2).Essentially they gave Superman the treatments given to the Transformers, the main problem with this for me was that the original had a sense of realism, with this version it kind of destroyed the organic feel which Superman carried so well.Henry Cavill certainly had a tough role to play and managed to do it justice for me. At the end of the day, Christopher Reeve is always going to be THE superman for me(Kind of like Tom Baker is THE DOCTOR for example), however I understand for Superman to survive it has to continue in some way.Essentially, this movie is one of the many 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it' messages that often screams through my brain on remakes. Personally as a Superman fan, I would have preferred a continuation as opposed to a remake which while OK, was told in a silly way. The format of the original is something that makes it so special, jumping around and making Superman out to be a drifter for a while was kind of silly. Also Superman wouldn't have facial hair problems(if he did, nothing on Earth would be able to cut his hair, correct?).The simple sets of the 1978 version for me, make it timeless, they work and they work even now. I watch that movie and can't believe it's the age it is. Yes the obviously 80's scenes that come into the movie later are a dead give away, but that introduction is a flawless masterpiece that did not need to be messed with.(In particular the learning tutor as the baby travels through space educating him, was missed in this remake). Superman is not John Carter or Avatar and shouldn't be made to mimic productions like those with it's use of special effects and CGI etc. It's Superman and it's terrific in it's own right. For me, they were trying to incorporate these elements into Superman and put simply, it's neither needed, nor wanted by this fan.For all it's terrific actors, CGI extravaganza'a and an interesting idea with the terraforming machine(again though, I think the writer watched the new Total Recall movie and got the idea), this movie failed to deliver the story as well as the 1978 version. In fact it was a massive step backwards, proving once again that it's not flashy wiz bangs and all the finest actors alone that make a movie, a great movie. How I wish Hollywood would stop shooting itself in the foot and start allowing new writers into the fold. Without a decent story and a rock solid script, this is what a movie becomes. A collage of flashy wiz bang effects with story sprayed in there somewhere. It's kind of like how everyone these days is huge on sms's and Facebook etc. People are replacing listening with talking. Well here we have good story telling replaced with an extravaganza of visuals. This is sad for the great actors who probably had no control at all over the ultimate cut of finished movie.Here's hoping if there is a sequel, it will not be as jagged as this attempt at remaking one of the greatest movies of all time.Superman fan, Sean.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

So much promise but not delivered,"My first ever movie to be taken away by was Superman 2 and I have loved the character ever since. So when the teaser advert was released last year with very young superman wearing a makeshift cloak, the boat at sea and the sea gull shot. I got really excited. Really really excited. BUT this just doesn't work. It has all the seeds to be amazing but in the end doesn't deliver. The second half just ends up being a big explosive fight and because it lacks emotion it's a fight for fights sake. The story dropped. The intimacy that began with his struggle with being an outsider in the world dropped. The grainy look of him being a man without a home traveling from town to town dropped. And the result, a blockbuster without the heart, that it promised. I am guessing that it got lost in the editing floor and they decided to go with the big stupid scenes rather than the hearty grainy personal approach. I have given it a 6 cos I love superman and just can't bring myself to give it less. But it deserves less. I am really disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Superman, the Loneliest Superhero","I saw the movie ""Man of Steel"" in an IMAX theater.I didn't like Superman, because he was so comical and he didn't look cool at all. For example his costume was too gaudy. People who love the original superman would think that ""Man of Steel"" is too serious, but I was moved deeply by this powerful movie.Superheroes are lonely, because they are too special for ordinary people to understand them. They show their superpower to try to save people, but their superpower makes people fear them. Superheroes are like Jesus who was betrayed by the people he wanted to help.I think that Superman is the loneliest superhero.Bruce Wayne is basically an ordinary human being. He wanted to be special, and he wears a mask to be Batman.On other hand, Kal-El was born in the planet Krypton and he isn't a human being. He is fundamentally different from people on the planet earth. But he fought against and killed Kryptonians to save human beings. He is far lonelier than Bruce Wayne.The plot of this movie expressed the loneliness of Superman very well. He is lonely, so the plot couldn't be comical but serious.As an aside, Diane Lane, who played Martha Kent, Clark's mother on Earth, was great. I was surprised that Laurence Fishburne has became so fat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Movie of Eyerolls,"""I wanna roll my eyes right now, but the doctor said if I keep doing it, my ocular muscles might spasm and eject my eyeballs,"" Liz Lemon says in an episode of 30 Rock. I would advise Tina Fey to stay far away from the new Superman movie because that is all that awaits you on the other side of the theater door: eye roll after eye roll. By the third act I wished my eyeballs would eject from my skull. In an honest world, Man Of Steel should have been renamed Movie of Eyerolls.After The Dark Knight Rises concluded Christopher Nolan's classy Batman revival series last summer, fans didn't fall into despair, for they were suffocated with the initial Man of Steel trailer upon each showing of The Dark Knight Rises, with everyone's favorite director's name plastered as a ""producer"". Anyone could've guessed that Man of Steel was going to fall below The Dark Knight trilogy's quality, but I didn't even expect it to be as bad as it actually is. Clearly, the genre has not learned a thing from Christopher Nolan.Man of Steel is piled with bad dialogue, unfulfilling characters, and leaden visuals that never satisfy your eyes. The script has decent intentions, but the final product feels like a slapdash effort by the screenwriter. Many times, I asked myself ""Are they really going to go down this route, really?"" There is some effective aspects of a superhero tale, but most of the time it gets lost with making ""spectacular action"" that it uses clichés to fill in the gaping holes left by the characters and plot arcs. The beginning shows an idea was entirely drawn, though it's explored, it never feels as interesting as it should be. The dialogue is awful, but David S. Goyer does supply one memorable quote that hits you like a bullet: ""People are afraid of what they don't understand."" I hope, Man of Steel is a simple-minded movie, with no greater meaning, because if it does have a greater meaning, we know it will go the religion route. If that point ever came, I wouldn't wait for my eyerolling to eject my eyeballs, I would gouge them out myself with my movie ticket.Misdirection is accounts for most of Man of Steel's issues. Zack Snyder brings not much else except pretension to the table, therefore fails to shine light on the humanity that lies within the story and characters. There's countless of attempts at bringing the ""man"" to ""Superman"", all that the movie has to show for it is embarrassment. Most the film is told in unbridled periods of action it's not enough to satisfy the audience and their craving to know these characters. The action sequences are proficient and they improve in the second half. I'm not crazy about the technical aspects of Man of Steel. Sure the special effects and the sound design are give-ins that deliver, but the editing and cinematography are huge letdowns. The look of the film is unappealingly murky. I did really take to the new Superman costume, it updates the classic outfit comfortably.I'm not really sure if Man of Steel was motivated to be driven by the character of the man behind the ""S"" (which interestingly means peace in this movie) or if it's epicly driven by the destructive plot, but either way the movie hardly ever advances because the lack of development with its characters or actors. Leave it Diane Lane to supply the first and one of the only touching moments in the story. Lois Lane is the most intriguing character in the movie, but Adams doesn't try to break new ground with her even though she has audience's accessibility on her side. The characters are run-of-the-mill and fail to enter our hearts.Man of Steel hoodwinks the audience into believing that it's a thoughtful origin story that takes itself seriously. When an action movie fails technically, you know the movie is in trouble. In fact, I had the uneasy feeling like I was watching a straight-to-DVD, low budget horror movie during my two and a half hours with the new Superman. There are too many clichéd attempts at being a profound, character piece. If the movie we got is the movie sci-fi nerds and fans of the advancing work in this genre have been anticipating in Man of Steel, then the movie industry is in trouble. I walked out of the theater with haunting thoughts of an apocalyptic business down the road where originality and art are dried up.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fresh take on Superman,"Man of Steel, the first movie of the DCEU, is the attempt of Zack Snyder and David Goyer in reimagining Superman into the real world, and they both did a great job. This is the first time someone tried to do something different with Superman in film, we only had the Reeve era as Superman and Superman Returns, a nostalgic take on that same era. Giving to us a conflicted Superman, bringing him to the real world, and forcing him in situations he hadn't been before in previous movies, is a bold move. I tought every narrative choice, even the polemic ones, were great and it had a purpose, built Superman persona, and prepared us to future arcs, as seen in Batman v Superman. The unique and fresh take on Superman is the outstanding part of this film, plus the cinematography, with the incredible fighting sequences, THE flight sequence, it gave the movie this breath of life, something I hadn't seen on MCU. Zod also added to this movie this fresh look, one of the best villains in comic book movies, his motivations, the passion in Michael Shannon perfomance, the dialogue, he have a purpose that drives him, the survival of his species, and you understand his points. Superman here is fantastic, this is a great incarnation of the character, Henry Cavill does a good job, while some say this is version doesn't show the side of Superman that embodies Truth, Justice and the American Way, this is not truth, Superman is driven by his belief in the human race, even if he is conflicted with his kryptonian side. There are a lot of many aspects, the photography, the casting, the production and the costume design, god tier in the Krypton Prologue, the visual effects, the pacing is good enough, among others. The first chapter of the DCEU show to us a new and daring interpretation of the Man of Steel, distinguish itself from the MCU and delivers one of the best super-hero origin story movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is the Superman movie we needed,"After the dour and boring Superman Returns, many began to wonder if the most famous comic book icon of all could be made relevant for modern audiences. In short, the answer is ""Yes"". Zack Snyder's Man of Steel may not be win many points for subtlety, but its blend of epic action, iconic imagery and deep character exploration help to move Superman into the 21st century to stand along side the similarly re-invented Batman of Christopher Nolan's trilogy.Like 2009's Star Trek, Man of Steel will likely draw its heaviest criticism from long time fans. But, also like Star Trek, Man of Steel will appeal to the masses and help revive interest in this iconic character.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I don't like Superman, but","I've always thought of Superman as a lame old timey overpowered character that wasn't interesting. I've always been a Batman and Ironman type. But this movie was really enjoyable. It covered origin and the beginning of Superman in a interesting and entertaining way. I've always hated Superman as he's pretty much invincible. But this movie evened the odds with Gen Zod and his own kind. Overall, very good movie that was enjoyable to watch. Henry was a great fit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I went in pretty new to Superman but...,"This movie left me so disappointed. The only exposure to superman I had before walking into this movie was Superman Returns and brief looks from the Batman comics. So as far as my being blinded by fanboy obsession with Christopher Reeve, that's just not the case. This movie was boring for one, and totally focused on special effects. I felt like I was watching Transformers. I get that this was supposed to be a summer blockbuster but forgive me if I expect a little more story from such a hyped up film.Now a couple months have passed and I've had a chance to study the Superman mythos a little bit. I've watched the Reeve films and read a few comics and the only thing I have to say is that my instincts were right on. This movie didn't concern itself with preserving the Superman charm that made the character so popular. Cavill, while physically perfect, was a dark and brooding Superman, which is very opposite from the comics. I also hate that they gave Jor-el such a huge role simply because Russell Crowe played it. They changed more than personalities and costumes and expanded roles, however.You'll find a few differences from the comics that were so major to me that, even with my limited Superman experience at the time, left me confused about what did and didn't make sense in the DC universe. Seems like DC thought that since the Dark Knight films were dark and serious, this movie should be as well. Except Batman and Superman are pretty much polar opposites. In short, this movie was in one word, incongruous. Superman wasn't Superman as we all know and love him and that's what threw me off most. There's a difference between creative liberty and completely destroying a character's personality in the pursuit of box office dollars and preconceived notions of what it takes to make a superhero popular. The actual man of steel was fine the way he was.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Watch this recently late to the party 2019,"Ok so I just watched Shazam (8/10) and I watched captain Marvel (6/10) at the cinema recently and I have just recently been recommended to watch this also by Angry Joe (see utube).I was born in 1982 growing up watching the old Chris R superman movies and I loved them. One might say I'm or was a fan at the time.I watched this and I thought the first half was decent. It had heart and it had promise but then it fell into a Michael Bay explosions CGI fest with the other half of the movie which let it down I felt somewhat.With Shazam for example, super hero movie fare better when they have heart and lovable entertaining characters that we can relate to. The part in the movie - *spoiler* where Lois Lane kisses superman I rolled my eyes I'm 37 years old not 7. So things like this let the realism down for me and really let the movie down. Also the writing was a bit lame to be honest.Russel Crow and Kevin Costner both did a great job as well as Zod the villain (the guy from Tigerland) although I feel he can't talk properly he talks as if someone has taken a dump in his mouth. But overall the movie is probably worth 1 - one watch. One watch only. If your an avid Superman fan I would recommend but you might be saying to yourself through the movie 'hang on.... did that actually happen?' A lot of the way through it.It's a nice take a suppose to a side story of Superman but overall don't expect the comedy and heart of a movie like Shazam.CGI fest with a tiny bit of heart and slightly interesting story.That's what your getting ultimately. Maybe I'm getting too old for explosions to impress me these days, but as for some that state this is a masterpiece ??? What are you smoking. Have you seen a good movie ? Think Shawshank redemption, green mile, forest Gump, Braveheart (sorry guilty pleasure), the shining, meet joe black, in my opinion these are much better movies but I suppose it all depends on your taste. Man of Steel does not hold any flame of a candle to a masterpiece but it serves as a nice distraction at least for one hour. The second half of the movie ? Don't expect too much.EnjoyThanks Gaz",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ayelet Zurer drops the ball on this one.,"The kid who plays Kent Clark whines and has no honour, pride, or respect for his powers. He whines and bitches about having these powers, but he doesn't man up or do anything about it. And that comes down from his mother. This Anakin Skywalker vision for the character is miscast. Whilst the movie has no sense for a main character, there is none. Laurence Fishburne was a complete disappointment. Was expecting him to wave up and take the movie by storm, like he did with The Matrix. Since the aliens look very similar. I was expecting great things from him. Like I did with Tom Hardy in Batman. It wasn't even close. Most 3d movies over the last couple of years have brought you in and do good things. But this one, it, there's some shining bright lights in there that really burn the eye sockets.There's more boat scene in the trailer then there was in the movie. What happened to that? Hopefully we get some more of that boat action because there's a strong that there are some strong missing elements in the story there. The whole boat sequence needed to add more spice to the concentration of the character because there's so much to dream about at sea. I thought we were getting close to sea monsters and that the bad guy would get involved. There's more time in the city than there was at sea. Which is mind boggling.Where's this island that this mother figure is talking about? This whole sequence is convoluted and off-track. By the end, you think it's over but it's not. The last hour picked up a bit and the best action I've seen all year 'in a movie.' The guy who played the main character. He wasn't big enough. I don't know, this seems to be a very important character and there's no focus on him and what he deems wise, especially in that scene. All in fall, this is not a surprise ""Man of Steel"" can't jump he just hits the ground. He's too heavy for his own good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
