One of a kind,"A one of kind movie that sticks with you, it's unique and striking. The characters are so well cast and well acted, their chemistry drives this movie. The cinematography is perfectly dark and haunting and the effects/CGI still hold up. Constantine is just a cool dark movie that fits a niche religious/demonic genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Sorry...I liked it...,"This is a fable...it's not supposed to be so rooted in reality that we scoff at the implausibilities and the plot holes... We're not watching it to say ""look at how that happened"" or ""why is it all happening here in L.A. when we have these worldwide problems"" or...whatever... It has to happen somewhere; either you buy off on the fable and get into the story or you flush it...While not being Catholic, through theological edification I was able to make sense of storyline, ironies, metaphors, etc... I liked Reaves' character and again, it's a matter of preference - love or hate - but he played Constantine's miserable demon-cop just right - Reaves continues to find rolls suited to his particular, dark style. Special effects were great, and I give the film kudos for not diving in and becoming an effects extravaganza...it remains online to the story and where we're going... Weisz as heroine and Peter Stormare as Lucifer himself were well-cast. What can I say? It was great diversion and a fun DVD to watch. Check it out!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Moody, vivid occultothriller; Reeves does a fine job","John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) can see things, you know. Demons, angels, stuff like that. Oddly enough, though, people believe he can - mostly because he moonlights as an exorcist, trapping demons - who shall not stay in his plane! - in mirrors and smashing them to teeny bits. World weary and constantly sucking on a coffin nail, Constantine is beleaguered and burned out, a noir detective for the afterlife, if you will. But he's alive; he's just cursed with the gift of seeing demons and angels. And he's a suicide, having been clinically dead for two minutes once upon a time, a time during which he literally saw Hell.Cop Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) just lost her sister, a patient who jumped off the top of a mental hospital; Angela thinks her sister also Saw Something, and so she goes to John for help. Did Isabel know something? Where is she now? Can Angela see, too? Well, she can, actually, because Isabel was her twin sister, and as we all know twins share everything. So, using Angela, Constantine learns that the Bad Guys (demons), who are supposed to stay in Hell, have been crossing over to the plane of the living, presumably to raise hell. But Constnatine knows there's something else afoot, something only witchcraft, voodoo, and other otherworldly things can uncover.If there was ever a role that the adult Reeves was born to play (besides that of Neo), it's that of John Constantine. Constantine wanders hither and yon, doing good deeds and helping with crimes involving the occult, and so forth, all with a resigned and - pardon another pun - rather soulless attitude. Constantine knows he's doomed to a lifetime of doing this, partly because he tried to kill himself and partly because he has The Gift. It's this kind of dispassionate nihilism that plays perfectly to Reeves' own dull, emotionless acting range. He's perfect for the role, based on a comic book called Hellblazer.Weisz is pretty good - believable, at least - as the clumsily named Angela, but the real standout among the supporting cast is Peter Stormare as Satan himself. Incredibly creepy; he looks like a kindergarten teacher but behaves like a pedophile. The hair on the back of your neck will rise when Stormare enters the picture about three-fourths through.Two other things the movie has going for it are a rather simplistic plot and some fantastic special effects (for example, a demon made up of bugs). Movies based on comic books tend to overburden themselves and the viewer with far too many plot twists. It's not tough - you have a good guy, you have a bad guy, and the first must defeat the second. Throw in some ethical and moral conflicts, give the good guy a power of sorts, and you're off and running. Constantine does this pretty well.The atmosphere of the film is riveting as well, with effects special and otherwise transporting the viewer to Right There, whether it's a voodoo bar, Hell, or the mean streets of the city.If you watch the movie with the idea that it's a filmed comic book, you shouldn't be dissatisfied with the result. John Constantine lives in a world in which he sees unspeakable evil on a daily basis, and he himself has literally been to Hell and back on more than one occasion. His lot is to suffer for his sin; can he find redemption in a cutie named Angela?",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Hell Strikes Back,"In my view an underrated and over-criticized movie - Constantine got nice visuals, an interesting story and some good acting. No masterpiece and not Mr. Reeves best movie but a solid piece of horror if you like to watch movies with demons and exorcism and some good ol' action. Thumbs up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Fantastic effects + decent story = It works people!,"Despite what people say this film is actually quite good. Sure it had some flaws and the story kind of dragged on but the effects were very good and the acting (which is pretty amazing) didn't suck. Keanu wasn't as bad as he usually is and Rachel Weisz does a very good job with what I think is a well written part. The must annoying actor in the film is in my opinion not Keanu but Tilda Swinton. The actor who I felt brought most passion and enthusiasm to his role was Peter Stormare who obviously enjoyed playing Satan and the scenes with him are admittedly some of the most interesting in the film and even though he is only on screen for something like 5 - 10 minutes he should almost be credited as a main character thats how good he is.Now story wise the film had some issues but they weren't as serious as many people claim they are. As I stated previously the film does drag a little and it does take a long time for the film to actually reveal its point but its the little things that are really interesting. The exorcism scene is very well done and the effects are generally very well made. Effects doesn't make a film, however, and in spite of the issues the film actually succeeds in telling the story it wants to and the ending is indeed a climax.I haven't read the comics so I didn't really have any expectations when I saw the film. I have heard that the avid fans of the comic books complained that Keanu Reeves doesn't fit the role. That might be true but to me he really didn't seem that bad. He still has a very clear well defined body language which I feel makes up for his monotonous voice (at least to some degree). I went in to the cinema and saw the film with an open mind which is what I advise future viewers to do and not rely too heavily on what the critics say.All in all an excellent film8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Possibly one of the greatest supernatural films of all time,"Context.You need context.This review penned in 2017, some 12 years after the release.In this period, Marvel and DC are at each other's throats, each trying to monetize every character, sub-character, plot device and dust bunny from their respective libraries. Regardless of merit. It is all about the dollars.A story as pure as this one -- penned by Kevin Brodbin -- could never be done today because it lacks the setup for a dozen spinoffs and sequels, as well as the mandatory backstory and product placements.Sporting two of the most charismatic and photogenic stars of all time, at the peak of their careers, we have a story with no bad lines, no lapses in the arcs, and no time wasted. Just pure, engrossing, film pleasure from beginning to end.Yes, I know that it was not appreciated in its day. But the future is always the final judge.((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

What's not to like?,"It's a Hollywood mystery why 2005's Constantine wasn't more popular and didn't at least get a sequel. There was a TV show a decade later but that only got a single series and considering some of the dross which get several series, I'm looking at you, Hemlock Grove, that's got to be a shame.So we have a bankable star, a strong supporting cast, a well written script, an existing lore and decent enough special effects ( for 2005 ). Oh yeah, there's also something about the eternal struggle between good and evil. So what's not to like? I guess it's a little too dark for some and the concept that humans are only the playthings of God and the other guy might be a tough bullet to chew for those who take religion seriously.Now streaming on Netflix.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The anti-hero in us all.,"Constantine was the Roman emperor who recognized Christianity and made if possible for the Church to move from the underground into the public arena. He did it out of convenience, thinking that it would be easier to work with the Christian church than try to fight it. He lived most of his life as a ruthless leader who gave the orders to kill even members of his family. Constantine accomplished much good in his life, even though he had what most would say were impure motives.But the Roman Constantine is not the same as the same-named title character of the new film, ""Constantine,"" from DC-Vertigo Comics and Warner Brothers Pictures. Or is he? John Constantine, from the comic novels ""Hellblazer,"" is doomed to hell when he dies. His situation may be hopeless, but he operates as if he could buy his way into heaven by doing enough good by removing enough evil from the world. He's a chain-smoking, hard-drinking, rude and uncaring man who is the hero of our film.Angela Dodson is a pure-hearted, loving sister who is seeking the truth to her twin sister, Isabel's, death. It would seem she has nothing but the best motives, but conflicted people and incongruous motives are what make this movie interesting.Interesting questions surrounding the death of Jesus Christ, the existence of demons on Earth, the ultimate destination of our soul when we die and even the perfect lack of all evil in angels are woven into a screen adaptation of a character and story with a cult following. It seems as though this ambiguity regarding good and evil may exist in film as well as real life. In ""Constantine,"" it is not good verses evil -- but rather it is good and evil taking turns messing things up and making them better. In life the rule seems to be strangely similar. John Constantine's ability to do good without pure motives may give hope to the rest of us who regularly do things for all the wrong reasons.The visuals and the sound presentation in this film are wonderful. Philippe Rousselot's cinematography and Brian Tyler and Klaus Badelt's energetic soundtrack are masterful. The acting, however, is only adequate. Keanu Reaves has long since learned how to play Keanu Reaves. He continues with what he knows best. Shia LaBeouf, after a similar role in ""I, Robot,"" is becoming quite an accomplished ""plucky sidekick"" too. But the standout in this film is the emotional and endearing performance by Rachel Weisz as Angela Dodson. The movie is one worth seeing aside from her presence, but Weisz's performance take it from a ""see it if you like action movies"" recommendation to a ""see it to admire Rachel Weisz's performance"" endorsement.Constantine is rated ""R"" for demonic images and violence. It opens in theatres February 18.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constantine is another one of those movies that  you either love or hate.,"And I loved it.I just watched Constantine on PPV, and like all films, it does have its minor flaws, but overall the story was interesting, and the special effects were nothing short of amazing.Critics have been saying that Keanu Reeves' acting was horrible, but I disagree. Even though I can't deny that this wasn't him at his best, John Constantine is and angry and distant character, so Reeves couldn't display much emotion. All in all, he didn't do too bad.Rachel Weisz was the star of the movie, giving a heartfelt performance. Gavin Rossdale was good, playing the bad guy card too perfection. And Djimon Housan, and Tilda Swinton were also great in their small roles. Shia LeBlouf, like Reeves, could have done a little better. Peter Stormare was perfect as Satan and my favorite character. He added a bit of humor to his demonic role.There are some major differences between the comic book Hellblazer and the movie, like John Constantine was supposed to be British and resemble a rocker named Sting. But I've never read the comics, so I can't complain about these contradictions. But it seems to have the Hellblazer fans disappointed.I do feel I should advise that this movie has nothing to do with Satanism. And to my knowledge, it was religiously correct. Save the part about demons and angels living on earth.In the end, like I said before, you either love it or hate it. Simple as that.my rating : 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Not perfect, but still an entertaining apocalyptic horror yarn","The latest comic-book offering from Hollywood is this dark, depressing supernatural thriller which sees Keanu Reeves as a Neo-like hero, this time employed as an exorcist to prevent half-breed demons from entering our plane. The plotting and back story of the film is impressive, with plenty of technobabble to delight the viewers, and the acting isn't half bad either. Reeves is very good as the laconic, chain-smoking star, giving a relaxed and mature performance, one of the reasons I like him more and more as the years progress. Rachel Weisz is also effective as the heroine, proving to be more than just a woman-in-peril, and her natural beauty shines through many of the odd sequences in which she partakes.Further down the cast, we have a trio of outstanding performances from a) Djimon Hounsou as Papa Midnite, a voodoo practitioner with buckets of style, b) the singer Gavin Rossdale as impossible suave demon Balthazar, and c) Pruitt Taylor Vince, he of the bizarre eyes, as a sympathetic clergyman. Other, odder performances come from androgynous Tilda Swinton as the archangel Gabriel, and Peter Stormare, looking weird and repulsive, as Satan, although this latter portrayal is ultimately disappointing.One flaw is that the film does feel lengthy, with some repetition, and is let down by a last act which is dragged out to the extreme, with anticlimax after anticlimax. Saying that, it struggles admirably with religious conundrums, and isn't afraid to shy away from violence and blasphemy to achieve horrific effects. The film is not really action-orientated, like THE MATRIX series, instead acting as more of an acopalyptic horror, and there are plenty of jump-in-your-seat scares, especially one at the opening. The best thing by far are the special effects, especially those of the demons and the glimpses of Hell we get, which are simply fantastic and surpass anything else seen recently.The film does feel somewhat corny in places, and there are familiar elements from THE EXORCIST and HELLBOY which crop up in a clichéd light. It is also pretty dark and depressing, dealing as it does with death, destruction and sin, so don't expect much in the way of enjoyment. Instead, sit back and watch as this visionary ride offers something new and half-original, and ignore the shortcomings which are easily made up for by the good stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Solid and entertaining, but cliché ridden","I went to see this movie last Sunday and my expectations were not too high, so I got what I expected, perhaps even more. ""Constantine"" is another Keanu Reeves fantasy vehicle, but this time it's about demons and angels and not a parallel world aka The Matrix. It's hard to judge Reeves' acting as it shifts from poor and uninspired to solid and credible all the time. Perhaps the scriptwriter or the director are to blame. The direction really could have been better. The effects are on par with what one can expect from a big blockbuster flick, yet they tend to get overwhelming and exhausting.Rachel Weisz is undoubtedly the film's strongest point and her performance is excellent and as good as it can be in such a film. Her character is also among the few well-crafted ones in the movie. Djimon Hounsou doesn't make much impact this time and Peter Stormare's cameo as Lucifer is...well, entertaining. Although one can wonder what he's doing in this movie. Tilda Swinton's bizarre incarnation as Gabriel is just weird, hard to comprehend. I'm against all this ""womanising"" of archangels, it's so absurd and cliché-ish, typical product of the 21st century culture. Like ""why can't a woman play Gabriel?"" Well...because Gabriel was a male, not some androgynous creature.The biggest downside with this flick is the inexhaustive arsenal of bad jokes and typical Hollywood clichés which never seem to cease. Constantine's finger to Lucifer in the climax of the film is perhaps the only joke that is tasteful. The exorcism scene in the beginning was very intense and is among the better parts of the movie. All said, this is probably as good as a movie based on a comic can get, so I think it deserves a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
It was an okay film I guess,"There were some good things about Constantine. The special effects and cinematography are outstanding and keeps you interested. The music score is excellent, and there are some good performances. I do not care for Keanu Reeves, but he does an okay job in the title role, though his character could've done with more development. Rachel Weisz is a lovely actress and she is good here in two roles. Peter Stormare is fantastically suave and debonair in his villainous role. Tilda Swinton is the best though, she is absolutely delicious as the androgynous angel. Francis Laurence directs efficiently as well, and there are some good scenes such as the discovery of the relic in the desert- daft I admit though. However, the plot is very convoluted, and lacks a clear sense of direction, and the script feels rather sticky. In terms of character and storytelling, the film feels diluted. It certainly isn't a bad film, with the visuals, direction and decent performances, making up for the plot convolutions and the sticky moments in the screenplay. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constantine Comment,"This movie was really great in my opinion. If you like the horror/sci-fi genre then this is definitely for you. The effects are great and the make-up is exceptional as well. Keanu and Rachel really compliment each other in the roles they are in. I wouldn't expect something phenomenal but this genre of movies is rarely gifted with such a insightfully plotted movie such as Constantine.The character build is great and the background of the characters isn't completely clouded which is awesome, there's no feeling of confusion when it comes to whats going on. It seems in some scenes the director was going for a certain emotion which made it feel awkward but the action and reactions are nice. Keanu really came across as tough doomed and uncaring, while Rachel came across as determined and brave. There is no reason to not give this movie a chance, if it seems like something you would like, i recommend seeing it. The concepts and setups aren't something of the usual nature so its a welcomed change of pace. I don't rate this 10/10 because is was astounding and mind shattering, a movie of the century, I rate it 10/10 because it was enjoyable and i have watched it many times without feeling tired of it. The score and soundtrack are great as well, providing some depth into certain scenes. The contrast and colors are good, although looking a little too dark in some scenes. The movie takes you to many places, so there is no feeling that you are in one place, sometimes I feel that movies that take place in the same space create a feeling of urgency, not so in Constantine. Some enjoyable aspects is the historical tie ins and use of terminology. All in all, this is an exceptional movie, it moves from scene to scene with little dragging in one spot, and has a great ending.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
There's always a catch,"When a Mexican finds the Spear of Destiny (aka the Spear of Longinus) amidst ruins, it sets off a chain of events that could lead to a Hell-fueled Armageddon on Earth. Enter John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), freelance demon-hunter, and Los Angeles detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), who are to play roles in the ongoing ""battle"" between heaven and hell.Judging Constantine on visuals, style and attitude, it would easily earn a 10. But as we learn in the film, ""there's always a catch"". The catch is that the story is a bit of a mess. It was problematic enough to earn a 7 out of 10, or a C, and just barely. For much of its length, I was prepared to give it a 6.Scriptwriters Kevin Brodbin and Frank A. Cappello seem to want to throw in everything, including the kitchen sink and a lot of other water receptacles, and they want to do it without having to explain very much. So the beginning of the film takes us from the Mexican to an exorcism to a woman in a mental hospital to a detective who looks oddly like her, and so on. During all of this, there are numerous ancillary characters. It takes a long time to be told who anyone is, what they're doing, and what their relationship is to any other characters. It doesn't help that this is one of countless films where the dialogue is mixed at about negative 5 to the sound effects' 11, and where actors are encouraged to mumble. You finally learn that the mental patient and the detective who looks too much like her are twins, but it takes awhile to figure it out.And it's not just the beginning of the film that is like this. Throughout its length, Constantine keeps introducing new characters, settings, subplots and ideas, with nary an explanation for any of them. Many you eventually figure out, and that led me to believing that I might enjoy the film more on a second viewing, now that I have a half-completed scribbly score card, but I can't guarantee that. There were far too many characters who could have been excised (and probably exorcised) with no ill effect.The production design, though incredibly attractive and intriguing, is also extremely dense and bizarre but unexplained. Why was Constantine living in a bowling alley? Was he living in a bowling alley, or did he or his friend just have an office there? I couldn't tell for sure. What were all of those odd jars of stuff hanging from the ceiling? What was the deal with the nightclub, anyway? What was all of that stuff they had stashed in the back? What was the deal with the tattoos and the other occurrences of those symbols? No one ever attempts to explain any of this stuff. It's just there and seems important to the story but we're not told very much about it. The film plays a bit like a joke that you're not in on. Like eavesdropping on the middle of a conversation from a group of people in turmoil, where you needed to hear the beginning to put the delectable gossip into context.I would guess that the problem is that Constantine is based on the Hellblazer comic books, which are already up to number 200-something. John Constantine is a character with an extensive mythology surrounding him. I'm sure a lot of it is fascinating. Unfortunately, I've never read the comic so I'm not familiar with the mythology, and the film isn't about to explain it to me; it thinks I should know what everything means already. Films, at least those that aren't later entries in a series, should not have prerequisites for understanding.From what I could gather, the basic scenario in the Hellblazer universe is that Heaven and Hell exist as parallel worlds to the universe that most humans know. Full-fledged angels and demons are not supposed to directly interfere with humans, but there are ""half-breeds"" that can exist in our world and indirectly try to influence events. The basic idea is that God and Satan have a sort of wager going to see who can get more souls. Like a metaphysical game of poker. Occasionally, demons cross over into our world, like interdimensional illegal aliens, and John Constantine acts as a sort of superhero Immigration and Naturalization Service agent with a bad attitude. In the film, beings are crossing over who don't usually, and it's portentous of doom. Much of the latter half of Constantine starts to closely resemble the Prophecy films starring Christopher Walken. The problem with that is that I like the Prophecy films a lot better. They have good stories.It also didn't help much when I read some of the comments from the filmmakers that resulted from their promo press junkets--for example, in Fangoria #240. Apparently, the stuff that looks like hell in the film--the mostly reddish, very hot, nuclear-fallout-wind-with-demons-chasing-you-and-trying-to-eat-you stuff is supposed to be Heaven. That didn't make sense to me, and not surprisingly, no one bothered to explain why that's supposed to be heaven. I also don't remember anyone mentioning that in the film, but admittedly, I couldn't make out some dialogue. I don't mind heaven looking that way, but when it's so unusual--basically the opposite of what we'd expect, it seems to deserve some explanation.Still, Constantine is worth a watch for the fantastic visuals and for individual scenes--most of which are very good. Some are even breathtaking, like the opening where the Mexican is hit by a car. Or the beautiful exorcism scene that follows. The film deals with a lot of serious subject matter. It's very visceral. Occasionally it's funny and a bit campy. It has great effects. Reeves and Weisz turn in excellent performances. It's just a shame that director Francis Lawrence didn't ensure that it would make more sense and have more significance as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Excellent fantasy/horror movie,"I've seen Constantine three times and I enjoy it more each time I watch it! It is truly well-done and extremely entertaining, and I can guarantee that if you like horror, suspense and/or fantasy you will love this movie! Keanu Reeves plays a very cool Constantine, who is a modern-day exorcist but most certainly not to be confused with a priest, as he has his issues and a burden of sins from his past that he carries with him. Constantine is a very realistic and human hero who is devoid of superpowers but has all the cool gadgets and the kick-ass attitude needed to survive in a world slowly being invaded by demons and scheming angels. He meets Angela (Rachel Wiesz) after she loses her sister, Isabel to the forces of evil. She comes to Constantine in search of an answer on where Isabel has ended up following her apparent suicide. Constantine journeys to other realms/dimensions in an attempt to get those answers, even paying a couple of visits to hell. Needless to say, with such a plot the special effects, acting, sets, script and even wardrobe have to be carefully conceived and executed to make it believable, and they are... in spades.Constantine achieves what all great movies always do: it takes you into another world that makes you forget everything about your own world the whole time you are watching it. And really, in the end, isn't that what great cinema is all about?",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A good movie if you're not a Constantine fan,"This movie is actually pretty good. The story is not bad and the acting is not really as bad as people make it to be. Keanu Reeves plays a decent Constantine and manages to maintain the mysterious aura about the character. The only thing wrong about this movie, and it's a big thing for a comic book movie, is that it completely goes against the comics it was based upon...The movie was designed to depict Christian catholicism and make John out as some sort of exorcist slaying demons and talking to angels. If it's true that in a mainly Christian USA that may attract more audience, it also goes against everything the comic stands for. John is nothing like that, he's never been a Christian in his life, he's a magician.No religion has favor in the comics, John is capable of talking to angels one day and find himself in the Aztec hell talking to some weird Aztec demon the next day. He doesn't have superpowers and in no way is he a regular hero, he's capable of killing his friends to survive... He's only human, that's what made the comics so compelling.If it's true that the movie is rather good in his own right, it's also true that it should have no association whatsoever with Constantine or Hellblazer and I'm surprised that the authors allowed them to place Constantine's name in the title...",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Elizabeth Sings,"I knew from the very beginning that this would be a little different from the title sequence. It uses a font that is put together in an odd way. It is a rather jarring effect, just in that one word denoting that we'll have ordinary things presented in extraordinary ways.This told me before the movie started that they had some professional help in the production and art design... and they gave those folks power. They are the people who gave us that dancing bag in ""American Beauty"" around which that whole movie is constructed.This movie is getting panned, and I wonder if folks are seeing the same thing I saw. Yes, the characters are unengaging and superficially drawn, sort of  well  like in a comic book or a music video. Yes, the story is a bit incoherent. Some script doctoring is apparent, but the important thing in stories like this is the part they get right: the cosmology makes sense. At least it makes sense if you have exposure to biblical cosmology: I think it true that in all the key regards this is much more biblically accurate than Mel's adventure in pain and blame.What we want from things like this is the ability to tap into another world. The details of the story are superfluous. There are three ways to do this, all exploited here.1) Use folding. In this case, the fold is us seeing something which has a story about people seeing things that others do not. It seems a simple trick, but it has profound power. It is not done very well here, but it is done ambitiously. We assume subliminally that what _we_ see is something no one else can.2) Be novel in the design of the alternative worlds. In other words, make it look like we are seeing something no one else has. That's rough in movies where everything must refer to a prior vision. That's the way our minds work. So they have to show us something we have already seen in other films but make it seem different.3) Use at least a few actors that have the ability to link for us the folds among the four worlds: ours, the ""real"" world of the movie: the real world of the movie but with demons (Men-in-Black-like); and hell. I suppose they thought at first that Keanu could carry the weight merely by association with the similar layers of ""The Matrix.""But it is the amazing Tilda Swinton that does the heavy lifting in the folds here. She's another redheaded Australian-influenced actress that can do folding. You may not know her; she gets few parts I think because her appearance is so striking. But if you have a chance you may want to see her in ""Orlando,"" where she plays much the same character (also ambisexual) and ""Conceiving Ada"" where she literally conjures up an alternative world. She's been a talisman of folding in other films: ""Vanilla Sky"" (together with Alicia Witt) and ""Adaptation,"" where she is the ultimate customer of all the folded worlds.For this character, I believe she channels Jenny Runacre's ""Queen Elizabeth"" in the punk folded ""Jubilee,"" which is one spooky movie. She's the real thing and I hope we see more of her. In true folding tradition, both her and her character trigger the folds here.Who cares if the thing doesn't flow well or is poorly constructed in how any of the worlds forms a story. I think it is a point of honor that it doesn't in this case. For a point of reference on this: I thought ""The Hulk"" was cinematic.Hell is never really shown. What we see is a vision as it would be translated to someone without the tools: a ruined road in a desiccating landscape. Seems apt.

Bitterly disappointed,"it was an OK film i suppose but after reading a lot of good reviews i was looking forward to an early blockbuster hit. i was wrong. OK admittedly the special effects were quite impressive for a february release and the acting from rachel weisz was very good. keanu reeves on the other hand was awful. does he just act off of a teleprompter? it may as well be like he's reading a book or off a piece of paper. he is a diabolical actor and doesn't deserve the high standard of actor. he is worse than his sidekick chas in the film. chas (real name Shila laBoef) was quite good as a sidekick. he was a good entertaining character. but john constantine was dull and dreary. very borin. I've seen laBoef in a few other films such as I, Robot (bit part) and Holes. (i think that was him). and he really showed potential in I, Robot to be the next smooth talking actor on the big screen. like Colin Farell cos he sounds like he is confident and he is realistic with the way he acts. this boy has a great deal of potential and talent. he shud go far. but the film is entertaining in parts like the computer effects and the bath scene but everything else went out the window. literally. there was many plot holes. very much disappointing but it is worth the watch if ur into the Gothic tales of hell and the devil. 6 out of ten for the graphics",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Exorcist DC,"As a comic book fan, I enjoy reading Hellbrazer or Constantine. Comparing the movie and the tv version, tv version of Constantine is much better. Keanu Reeves is a serious Constantine exorcist demonologist is ok. Would have been better if he dyed his hair blonde. Overall the plot of the story is decent. Chas Kramer (Shia LaBeouf) provides good balance that to Constantine (Reeves) dryness. Would like to see Matt Ryan do a movie of Constantine! Decent movie and would rewatch a few times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Fun film!,"Funny enough watching another really original film brought me here. I was telling someone about it and they said oh you have to watch Constantine, The prophecy, and Devil's Advocate.Loved The Harbinger and now love all Four of these! This movie has a great ambience and darkness without being a pure jump scare movie. I love the overall mood.I've seen enough devil movies to know that a lot of them are not very original but these 4 are.Won't give spoilers, but love the endings to all of them. The Harbinger and The Prophecy have a native American element which I thought was cool, but these two Constantine and Devil's Advocate still have master storytelling and a much higher production value than The Harbinger. Devils Advocate is slightly ahead of Constantine for me. But Thumbs up on Constantine and fun watch!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
See it!  You won't be sorry!,"""Constantine"" is a dark, yet dazzling film. A terrific story backed up by spectacular special effects and great cinematography pull us into a dark and dangerous world - a world where half-angels and half-demons whisper to us mortals as God and Satan use us as pawns in an apocalyptic game of chess. Cursed with ability too see these spirits, John Constantine finds himself right in the middle of this showdown.Keanu Reeves gives a fantastic turn as John Constantine. He infuses Constantine with a grim sense of purpose and dark humor. He is the ultimate anti-hero, and Reeves deftly takes Constantine from being someone we simply root for to someone we actually like and respect.Rachel Weisz is terrific as well. Her tortured and soulful performance is the best of the film. Shia LaBeouf also blew me away.I have not read the Hellblazer comics, but standing alone ""Constantine"" is a great film.

"Great film, but too religious for some...","Constantine is a great movie, though most people do not respect it in the way that it should be. It has a very deep religious background, that is difficult to catch onto if you have little-to-no religious knowledge. The DVD speaks of the religious aspects of this film, so if you are someone who didn't necessarily enjoy it in theatres, I highly recommend you check it out.With religion out of the way, the film itself could have been quite a bit better. I have never really read the ""Hellblazer"" comics, so i can't really judge the film on its loyalty to the comic's themes and plot lines. The script wasn't the best, but the special effects were wonderful. The background of the main character ""John Constantine"" could have been touched on a little more, but the character development was still well done. Though very dark and demonic, the film is quite enjoyable unlike many other horror-esquire movies.As said before, this film is very well done, but is much more enjoyable if you have a knowledge of religion. I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in demonology, Christianity, or just want a little thrill.

A Very Entertaining Film,"John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a die-hard cynic with the unwanted childhood gift of being able to see angels and demons that walk the earth. When a police detective (Rachel Weisz) comes to him for help finding out why her twin sister committed suicide, the duo is thrown headlong into a war between heaven and hell.Constantine is a very enjoyable and exciting film to watch. The execution of the premise was done pretty well. I found the film to be engaging even though I was unfamiliar with material. I liked the way director Francis Lawrence handled the movie. He made it stylish but he also added plenty of substance to back it up. The majority of the first half was just talking and the film did a decent job of introducing the characters and story. Actually, the first half featured a bit too much talking and it was a little dull. However, the second half was very nicely done with a lot of cool scenes and dialog.At first, the running time of 121 minutes seemed to be really long but the second half was wonderfully paced and the film just zoomed to the end. The script was a little weak but that wasn't the movie's main draw so it wasn't a major flaw. The script wasn't too original but I wouldn't say the entire film was derivative. Also, there weren't too many characters so it wasn't hard to figure things out. The special effects were awesome though and it was the best thing the film had to offer.I think Constantine worked so well because of Keanu Reeves. A lot of people have blasted him for being a bad and boring actor. However, I think his mundane personality suited the role perfectly and he did a fine job. Rachel Weisz also played her role well and she's kind of underrated. Shia LaBeouf gave an awful performance as Chas. He was just annoying and over-the-top. I liked Tilda Swinton's performance and I think she's also a pretty underrated actress. Surprisingly, Gavin Rossdale gave a good performance. It wasn't amazing but it was much better than I expected. I think Constantine is a love it or hate it type of film. The movie will either wow the viewer or bore the viewer with it's story and effects. In the end, Constantine is a pretty good movie that's worth checking out. Rating 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constantine,"honestly, one of the worse movies ever... the theater was spectacular. a 10mx20m screen, but the movie...i wish i didn't see it. the trailer was far better. everybody was talking about Constantine being the new matrix. dream on. i respect those who liked it. but i can't say i've enjoyed the movie. the guy just comes back from hell and the only thing that goes through his mind is ""i'm hungry""?! please.we don't want spectacular special effects. we want something spectacular but believable. unreal but not ridiculous. compared to Constantine, ""anaconda"" is a great movie. and believe me, i hated it. nothing against Keanu reeves or Rachel Weiss. and the devil, just stupid...",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Very good, could have been better","I thought this movie was very good. The constant close-up face shots of the characters often made me uneasy, but always kept me in suspense. The fleeting moments of humor couldn't have been timed more perfectly in a movie like this.Though the film has heavy catholic undertones, you don't need to be a scholar of the religion to understand what is going on. The script does a good job of being a sort of ""Cliff's Notes"" on catholicism. But if you are catholic, or are at least familiar with the religion, you will probably have a better understanding of the film compared to those that aren't.Keanu's acting was hard to digest at times. He simply does not play a good bad-ass. A smart-ass maybe, but not a bad-ass. This goes back to my mention of the humor. Keanu has a few quips in the film, and it was these times that I found his acting to be the most believable. It was cool to see Keanu with a quick-witted rudeness.Rachel's acting was superb, as always. She is an excellent actress and really knows how to pull off a character. Though I found it hard to attach myself to her character. I wish they would have given more of a background on her earlier in the film. She's just sort of thrown into the story without any real explanation on who she is. This made it hard to feel scared for her when she was in danger.Constantine is definitely worth seeing. It's a great film to see with a large group of friends, I wouldn't recommend it as a date movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A solid effort,"Very well acted tale of making the devil take the hindmost. This could have been a topflight film for the genre if director/scriptwriter had shown more interest in keeping the pace up. As it is the highs, scenes with Gabriel and Lucifer and a trip into hell, are outstanding, vastly better than the best of an average horror movie. Tilda Swinton is tantalizing in her Gabriel role and leaves us wanting more. Reeves' laconic acting style fits the personality of the lead but doesn't add much. Definitely worth a couple hours especially if you like modern horror.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Cinematographically very solid, but lousy adaptation","First off, I'd like to say that Keanu Reeves is terribly miscast. Not because he's a monotone-voiced ham actor a lot of times, but because he looks nowhere near the guy he's supposed to depict. John Constantine's a blond, often poorly shaved, trench coat wearing mage. Yes, mage. He does perform exorcisms on a regular basis, but it's nowhere near his main line of work as this movie would illustrate.I love the graphic novel, like I do with other things coming from DC, Alan Moore's work in general, like the 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', 'From Hell' and John Constantine of course. Especially with Constantine here, we have a case of Comic Book Genocide on our hands.In this movie, John Constantine is a compulsive smoker destined to end up in hell, who lives a life replete with good deeds in the name of the Lord in order to try and secure himself a place in heaven.I think the movie nails things right on; it succeeds pretty well in showing that the man in question is trying his best to come over altruistic, although at heart he is self-centered. Needless to say, Keanu Reeves seems to fall slightly short (despite an.... okay performance) as the cast supporting him consists of actors with greater talent. The first name springing to mind would be that of Rachel Weisz, who had showed her great aptitude for acting in films like 'the Constant Gardener', which is actually slightly newer than this one. Hers is the power to show a multitude of emotions with her eyes alone. Then there is Peter Stormare, who has an aptitude for playing Russian bad guys. His Lucifer was carried almost with divine evanesce. No joke. Gavin Rossdale, the pompous half-demon Balthazar, did a great job. Rossdale, a composer at heart, has great heart for rhythm, his was the power to implement slithery, almost flamboyantly 'homosexual' flair to his character. He had little screen time, but he was a love to behold.My favorites however were Tilda Swanton's Gabriel and Shia LaBoeuf's Chas, the first scene with both granting the movie a bit of comic relief. Tilda really makes a suit look good, and she knows what she is doing. You might know her from hits like 'Vanilla Sky' or 'The Beach' and you'll be able to see her again in the new adaptation of 'The Chronicles of Narnia' too. Shia is a wonderful young actor that uses his boyish charm to the max in order to play the role of slightly gullible sidekick. One might recognize him from I-Robot, where he wants to borrow Will Smith's car to seduce his 'fine ass yummy ass hot spankable'.Constantine has a complement of fine actors, it manages to spurt a good amount of character development; the actors have something to play with and they are not afraid to do so. Yes, there are some 'cringe-moments' when Keanu is forced to speak his character's past, but those can be forgiven. Unfortunately, the heart of the film relies a lot on visual effects. Fortunately however, the CGI and the FX guys seem to actually have an idea what the heck they are doing, because these effects are mostly pretty good. Especially the scenes that involve 'hell' are very beautiful and one of my favorite new movie moments. Also, and this is mostly a very bad thing, this movie is full with conflicting stylistic elements, but somehow in Constantine it works pretty fine, although some locations look forced and much too sudden.There are also references, maybe, probably even, to other movies. The Spear of Destiny that was lost after World War II also had a mention in the 2004 hit Hellboy, where Adolf Hitler allegedly obtained the 'Spear of Longinus' (a different name for the same thing) after which his strength increased tenfold. In Constantine, this spear plays a crucial role in the plot. Stylistic elements include, but are not limited to, biblical references in the shape of set pieces (a painting showing the skewering of Jesus with the Spear of Longinus for example). All in all, this movie delivers a complete, intricate and captivating universe. Some of it is nonsense, but that doesn't really take any of the fun away.My only problem, the movie's only problem, its obstinate negligence of the Alan Moore's source material, can only be solved if you are willing to brave it yourself. For example, if Constantine is your favorite Graphic Novel character and you cannot bear seeing him transformed in - pretty much - some other character with similar name, you need to give this movie a very wide birth. If you're not too bent on seeing a truthful adaptation, you might want to try this out. *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Loved It!,"If you are a fan of Keanu Reeves then you'll love this movie. Of course, he plays a similar character to this other roles but so do most actors. I believe most actors are merely personalities and Keanu has a cool one at that.The special effects were great and there were many picturesque scenes that will leave an imprint on your mind.Even though I had never read the comic book I really appreciated this movie for it's religious theme. I think anyone can relate to the movie's notions of Heaven and Hell, good and evil.The movie was funny, had just enough action, cool weapons, and breathtaking scenes.

Constantine,"Wow, this is definitely one of the most strangest movies I've watched in a long time. It's between Devil's Advocate and Exorcist. I must say the special effects were incredible!

The part when the glass shatters and when he walks through it, hitting the glass, is so awesome.It's a film that you should really take a peek at. I wouldn't count it as one in my top 10, but in the special effects column, I would definitely rate it a 10+.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Could've been better but still a fun ride!,"My first sort-of mistake was going to see Constantine at 11:30 A.M.; this would have been a much better experience in a nighttime atmosphere I feel. In fact, I'm thinking about going again this weekend at night.That being said, I still enjoyed this movie immensely. For starters, I actually thought Keanu was quite good in the role, and it didn't take long to forget drawing comparisons to Neo. I haven't read the comics, but I thought Keanu did a great job with the role... I laughed and winced right along with him, not at him! All the supporting actors (yes, Shia LeBeouf included) were great, and my only issue is that they didn't get enough screen time to explore their characters further. Djimon Hounsou was especially cool as Papa Midnite... with a name like that, how can you not be?! Finally, Rachel Weisz deserves the ""better than the movie"" comments she's been getting in reviews. Yes, she is that good, and she's pretty foreign to genre work (but should definitely do more)! I can't believe I'd only seen her in About a Boy before this; her magnetism had almost got me to pick up Confidence and Runaway Jury at the video store (which I have not. Yet). For one, she does a damn good American accent - I had forgotten that she's British. I'm sure many other reviewers will put this in better words than me, but she really adds a whole new level to this movie. Her performance is easily the most daring and heartfelt of the bunch, and I'd even go as far to call it subtly exquisite... a phrase I don't hesitate to equate with the actress herself. If Rachel Weisz had not been a part of Constantine I wouldn't have liked it half as much as I did. Even if you're not a Keanu or genre fan, I'd still check this movie out if you (like yours truly ;) have a thing for gorgeous, talented under-the-radar actresses.Onto special effects. Pretty darn impressive, if you ask me. NEXT! I'm definitely very tempted to check out the Hellblazer comics because I really love the mythology and style of the Constantine universe. I mean, Hell as a parallel dimension to our own world? How cool is that? Certainly less banal than most movie versions of Hell. The story is based around Catholicism, and it's just how I like my organized religion -- all twisted! All in all, Constantine was made up of a lot of things that I really love in my movies: detailed fantasy universe, fun characters, good effects and action, and of course, the vulnerable-but-butt kicking woman. Yay! The major problem with the film, I feel, was bringing all of its elements together. Throughout the film I kept thinking to myself what I would've done differently. There was so much crammed into it that every single character and plot point felt underused and ignored -- not one thing was explored deeply enough for my satisfaction. They should have chosen just a few elements of this complex universe and story arc for this movie and left the other stuff for subsequent Hellblazer flicks (which I hope there will be!).So basically, the parts here are very interesting and cool and worth a look-see, but the whole just can't service all of them. Which is a damn shame. I left the theatre wanting MORE, wanting to know more about the characters and what living in their universe was like. MORE, darnit!! While Constantine is fun and nice in its own right, I would've really liked to see it expanded to its potential. Oh well! At least there's the fantastic Rachel Weisz, so I can't complain further ;) Last words: I want to see it again! Maybe not buy the DVD but definitely rent it. Oh, and those rumors about an extra (albeit short) scene after the credits are true, so STAY through them!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constantine Salvation or Damnation,"The First thing about this movie is its extraordinary visual beauty. The Hell itself is good place to draw a beautiful painting. The few action scenes are acceptable. Lightening and Photography is surprisingly nice and Francis Lawrence has the promise of an intelligent director with perfect sense of scene creating. The Fall of the twin Dodson both in hell and in the rooftop is visually crazy. John's pursuit of devil-son is perfect special effects scene.The performance in Constantine is standard, with an exceptional work from Rachel Weisz, Tilda Swinton, and Peter Stormare. Choosing Peter Stormare as Satan is perfect. unlike dragonic or demonic figures of Satan shown in other movies, this time we have a the body of a normal but extremely ugly and disgusting person who has all unmoral and devilish features of mankind.Constantin's philosophy can be viewed from different religious aspects. Muslims do not believe in angels free will as other religion do. That matter and free will itself (wether human or not) are the subject here. If you believe in this movie's philosophy you have to believe in Gabriels choice. But if Gabriel really believes in that way of redemption. Why she shoes so much interest in John's redemption(Which is in her happiness for his moral ascension in the end).""The Road to Salvation Begins here tonight"". Before Gabriel tells this to Constantine she smiles to John's anger. There is kindness in her eyes, tone, and aura. Her Breath and blow throws john away. The way she does it is kind but to John its painful (He crashes into the wall).I really had to write the part above because it meant something more than the film it self. The way Tilda Swinton acts as Gabriel (especial;y in this scene) is rare performance. She uses her innocence ,charisma ,and facial reactions to tell a fact. Whether acceptable or not, it is striking and mind using.John has a chance of going to heaven but Devil brings him back here. After his return he hits Gabriel but doesn't try kill her and on the rooftop he tells us about his new way of believing and understanding and finally he brings a gum instead of a cigarette out of his pocket and starts chewing it. For him and us chewing a simple gum can be redemption and all those heroic efforts(such as exorcism)can be damnation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Very well done, with great special effects.","I have to say, I went to see Constantine because Shia LaBeouf is one of my favourite actors. This may have made me biased before I even entered the cinema, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film anyway! The plot is a little hard to follow especially if you don't listen and watch carefully for the clues. It centers around John Constantine (Reeves) who helps ""save the world"" from demons. He's not the usual sort of superhero because he is very reluctant to fit into that kind of role. The supporting actors are very well cast, and Rachel Weisz deserves all the praise she gets for her part. Tilda Swinton as Gabriel portrays the angel perfectly as not quite male or female. The film presents interesting views about heaven, hell and death, it's very thought-provoking. In a way, Constantine reminded me of I,Robot because it has a male lead who meets a female lead, and also has LaBeouf as sidekick again. But other than that this was a good film, and I think I will buy or rent it on DVD when it comes out. Here's a tip: wait until the credits ends, there is an extra scene!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The eternal archetype...,"Since a lot of friends have already submitted their comments on the movie in details (I mention very briefly that I enjoyed the movie and both Keanu's and Rachel's acting), I'd like to comment on a different aspect of ""Constantine"".I found the movie extremely interesting, because it shows us the eternal and mot popular archetype: The man who goes even to Hell, to the world of the dead, for the woman he loves. Like Odysseus did for his Penelope or Virgil for his Beatrice...This archetype lives through the centuries and has inspired every form of art. ""Constantine"" revives it once again in the 21st century. John Constantine may have saved the world but this is only a side effect of his decision to save Angela, the only ray of light in his dark and lonely life. We can clearly see Constantine's motives when Midnight prepares him to use the chair. Midnight asks John to tell him that this is not about the girl and John replies: ""Definitely, mostly not about the girl"" in the most unbelievable and ironic way. So, John Constantine was never interested in saving the world-the only thing he wanted was to save Angela from Mammon. He even chooses to offer his life so her beloved sister would go into Heaven and Angela will be happy and relieved of her qualms of conscience for abandoning Isabel.On a second level, John Constantine knows how Hell looks like-it's not something theoretical for him like it is for us. He has seen the eternal tortures his soul will suffer. He also knows that he's going to Hell no matter what he does, he's condemned (Gabriel doesn't give him any hope at all, on the contrary (s)he confirms what Constantine already knows). Finally, he knows that he's dying young and he doesn't have much time. However, Constantine never gives up hoping and fighting for his place in Heaven. All that gives a sense of deep tragedy throughout the movie. The scene where John Constantine puts out his cigarette in his own blood is the ultimate definition of a desperate anti-hero.Well, I guess not many people will find these comments useful, but I'd like to share my thoughts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Strong Acting but Story is too ambitious,"First, I would like to say that any movie that deals with Satan and Hell is a large undertaking in any script. What usually happens is that the screenwriter needs to resort to stereotypical images of what Satan might look like to the human eye. This is the case in Constantine.Peter Stormare who plays Satan is a great character actor. He pulls off his role but I feel that he was kind of set up in a way. They made him wear a white suit. I don't know about you but the white suit was a bit laughable. As Donald Trump would say, ""Wardrobe, You're Fired!!"" I beg to differ with the other reviewer. I thought the actors were the strongest part of this production. I love Rachel Weisz. She is an amazing actress on the same scale as Kate Winslet. What I also like about her is that she is in many films but she is not a name brand. This makes me feel like she is my secret treasure when I go to the movies. You know what I mean. I don't have to share her with millions of other movie fans. Ever since I saw her in ""Confidence"" with Edward Burns, I've been hooked. The sad part is that she is going to be famous very soon and the masses are going to enjoy her as much as me.I'll see anything with Keanu Reaves in it. He was excellent as Neo in the Matrix series and he is excellent in this film too. He's the strong, silent type of actor. You either like him or hate him. I chose to support his roles and I am glad he chooses to take on ambitious roles that are risky. Actors should take risks. That is why film is art. If it were conventional, it would be boring and not creative.Unfortunately, the story falls a bit flat at the end. I will not give anything away because I do feel that this movie has some bright moments and is worthy of a screening. Let's not blame the actors. I would blame the screenwriter for taking the easy way out and using stereotypical images of heaven and hell to wrap up this story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constantine is a hell of a time,"It should have doomed from the start. A comic book movie, Keanu Reeves playing a British detective of the paranormal, angels and demons battling for the souls of mankind. Sounds like another day in Hollywood alright. Not to mention the fact that the movie was going to be helmed by first time director Francis Lawrence who had only music videos in his resume before this. Another Michael Bay? Thankfully no, and yes. No, that he doesn't cut up his movies till the inch of their lives, and yes that he has the ability to create box office gold from near impossible odds.What's surprising about Constantine? To begin with, everything. Somehow the movie that should have failed as another attempt to cash-in on comic books and the phase that Hollywood is going through right now, actually brings us a thought out, action packed but still smart supernatural thriller that never makes a parody of itself, but neither takes itself too seriously.The actors play their parts splendidly. Keanu is in top form in his first big post-matrix film, and while momentarily Neo shines through, Keanu proves himself as a good leading man once again. His Constantine is not the Constantine from the books, but rather a more human and vulnerable version of the character. A man who knows he has no time left and is doomed to Hell. Rachel Weiz plays a dual role as twin sisters Angela and Isabel. Though underused, Weiz plays her small role with conviction and subtlety. In other roles, Tilda Swinton is a marvel as the Angel Gabriel, even to such extent that it's a shame that we see so little of her character. Djimoun Honsou is Papa Midnite, the owner of the bar where demons and angels can take their own time out every once in a while. Convincing, but his part is more of a macguffin than fleshed out character in this part. As for the killer, Peter Stormare is possibly the best person to play the Devil himself. Morbidly hilarious, constantly threatening and oozing with evil, he is the manifestation of the most charming man you've ever met, and at the same time the most evil.Action, some fine moments of actual thought, great set design and some wonderful acting make Constantine a great kick off for a hell of a movie year. It's the summer blockbuster of this late winter.*****",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Not Bad,"Not too bad, definitely worth watching. The story goes that God and Devil are not allowed to contact humans, only influence them. Therefore, some halfbreed Human/angels walk the earth to help, while halfbreed demon/humans walk the earth for evil purposes. John Constantine was born with the ability to see demons and angels for who they really were. He hates the ability and leads a sinful life. He is headed for hell and does good deeds in a bid to buy himself into heaven. Not a bad movie and worth watching. Not always as good as i thought it would be, but still pretty good.

Angels and the Cosmic battle for Souls,"The Film Constantine, directed by Francis Lawrence, written by Kevin Brodbin and staring Keanu Reeves has only been out a short while and already has garnered enough acclaim to rank itself as a modern classic.

Punished by God to wonder the streets of Earth, for an attempted suicide, he now must 'earn' his way back into the grace of the almighty. To do this, he must hunt down and 'excorcise' every sort of demonic beast that plague's mankind. Aiding him are a host of penitent souls who have sinned and wish to redeem themselves. To make matters worse, is the Archangel Gabriel who want to step up the 'final' conflict and match powers with Lucifer (Peter Stormare) himself.

Beautiful dark thriller,"Constantine is a great-looking movie that's never-the-less firmly rooted in the occult thriller genre. It's got beautiful sets, pacing, dialog and lightning.Maybe it's a bit too set in the genre - it's similar to Hellboy, Angel Heart and Ninth Gate, among many others - but it competes very well with those, with both moody shots and tense action scenes.It doesn't fall into the comic-book-adaptation trap of ""yet another origin story retelling"" - we're just thrust into Constantine's world with only as much explanation as is needed, neither less nor more.Tilda Swinton does an absolutely outstanding job playing Gabriel.In my opinion, the ever-uneven actor Keanu pulls of a good performance in this one. He plays this mostly in his ""distanced"" mode, which works well for the enigmatic arcanist Constantine.Long-time readers of the comic (I've read all issues, I'm a big fan) should note that not only have the story been moved to Los Angeles and JC made American, the theology is also altered and is far from ""canonical Vertigo continuity"".Never-the-less, this movie neither pulls any punches, nor is it dumbed down. I liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Very Very Good,"Gosh, people spend so much time bashing Keanu Reeves. This film is actually quite good and the plot is quite good. Great special effects, enough religious creepiness to make to think, and a lot of action. Not quite as good as The Phophecy but damn close. Don't trust Keanu haters. It wouldn't matter how grand a film was, if he's in it they will trash it. Just rent the flick and judge for yourself. Yes, it's dark, and yes Keanu is wooden in his dialogue at times, but the movie is fantastic to watch. For anyone who has ever doubted religion, spirits, and our place in the world with them, then this is the movie to see. Great supporting cast, starting with Shia LeBouf who I like more and more with each role he takes on.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Not a Comic fan...But,"I really enjoyed this film. I liked the effects, the humor throughout the piece, the acting. I'm not a religious buff of the catholic faith, but I agree with another comment, and that is, that even though Constantine may not stay true to the faith and invented a few things- I liked the movie regardless...or maybe in spite of it. I also didn't feel that this film tried to beat me over the head with religion. Though, I liked the religious aspects...the demons, the idea of God, the depiction of the angel Gabriel (WOW), the possessions; the exorcisms...the list goes on, were well done. And yes, the depiction of Hell too.Watch it; see for yourself. I know I was surprised, & pleasantly so.

"Good, but forgettable","Costantine is yet another Hollywood attempt to adapt a comic book into a movie. I myself have never read them so I am speaking for the majority of you who have not read it.First, the acting in this movie was good and bad at times. Rachael Weiss is great as usual and Keanu Reeves is fair in this role because his character doesn't have to have emotions. However, when his character is supposed to have emotions, Reeves is wooden. This is an acting and/or directing flaw. Some of supporting cast outshine him, but if you're a casual movie watcher, you won't notice.Second, the dark atmosphere is good but it's a little too dark at times, meaning hard too see. The photography has been done in Dark City and The Matrix already. The graphic are good but not anything new. Some fight scenes are good, but some fall flat. The plot is confusing for those who don't pay attention to details.The characters are somewhat sympathetic. It is entertaining and sometimes intriguing.My Rating 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constantine Is Better Than At Least 2 Of The 3 Matrix Movies.,"Constantine is about a man who has the ""gift"" of being able to see elements of the supernatural which are all around us, just not visible. John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is able to see what he calls ""half-breeds"", which are either angels or humans which walk among us, living as humans. Unable to live with the burden, Constantine commits suicide and is successful, for a short time, until he is revived against his will. Being clinically dead for a short time, he went to Hell until he was revived and brought back. Having now experience Hell, Constantine knows he definitely does not want to go back, describing the 2 minutes he spent there as ""a lifetime"". From that point on, he is trying to make amends with God (I guess that is the best way to put it). He does this by sending half-breed demons back to Hell through exorcisms or other rituals.Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) is a cop who is investigating the suicide/murder of her twin sister, Isabel (also played by Weisz). The numbers do not add up because Angela knows Isabel was a devout catholic and by her committing suicide, she condemns herself to an eternity in Hell.Along the way they meet and eventually team up, crossing the paths of many demonic and angelic characters (mostly demonic), with Angela trying to solve the mystery of her sister's death and Constantine basically helping her and everyone else who needs him at the same time.Now, admittedly, there are many plot holes and, as many would and have said, factual errors among this story. With that being said, it is still a pretty fun movie to watch. To those who say the special effects are not up to par, I do not know what movie they watched but it was not Constantine. This movie was on par with the Matrix trilogy as far as special effects go. My favorite being the demon he faces made entirely of bugs, snakes and other creepy animals. This movie left a better impression on me than I thought it would and I was entertained pretty much throughout. I rate this movie at about an 8.5/10, as it could have been a little more thorough with the storyline. Other than that minor complaint, this movie is worth seeing because of the special effects alone.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Still is quite enjoyable...,"I remember watching ""Constantine"" back in 2005, when it was brand new. And I remembered the movie as being a great supernatural action movie, so as I had the opportunity to sit down and watch it again in 2022, I did so without even blinking.Sure, I could only remember bits and pieces of the storyline, so it was definitely nice to sit down and watch ""Constantine"" from writers Kevin Brodbin and Frank A. Cappello again.And yeah, ""Constantine"" still is an enjoyable movie now, 17 years later. So director Francis Lawrence managed to take the script and turn it into something enjoyable and watchable. Now, I haven't read the comic books, so I don't know how connected the movie's contents is to that, nor do I know how true the movie is to the comic books.The storyline was good, and it is a storyline that you quickly can get into, even without having read the comic books. Lots of action, combined with some supernatural contents and good old fashioned biblical good vs. Evil here.Visually then ""Constantine"" actually still holds up. So the visual department managed to create something that still looks good and feels genuine.The movie also has a good cast ensemble with the likes of Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeouf, Djimon Hounsou, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Tilda Swinton and Peter Stormare. So you have a good handful of skilled actors and actresses to lead you through the movie.My rating of ""Constantine"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Solid Keanu film,"I originally watched this as a younger person when it came out and thought it was slightly hokey but 100% watchable. I am not a fanboy of the graphic novels, so I was not invested in the details that the producers of the film changed. On rewatch, one appreciates the film for what it is; a popcorn film about the ongoing battle between good and evil.Reeves as Constantine is...well, Reeves. Having said that, his character is 100% believable as an apathetic soul who is aware of what is going on around him. Weisz envelopes herself in her role. Peter Stormare is the stand-out who chews the screen in his limited time.The cinematography and score all match the tone of the story. Washed out apartments and nighttime streets are never shot with such light that it becomes difficult to see what is going on. Narratively, the film is evenly paced and impressively edited.If you have not seen this one, stream it one evening with the lights out like you would a horror film. It will meet your expectations, if not exceed them!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Dude, this one ain't bad","A pleasant surprise. Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, an ordinary guy who leads a very extraordinary life dealing in exorcisms and the occult. According to the story, both heaven and hell are real, as are demons and angels, both of whom not only exist, but they even walk the earth. Most people can't see them, but for some reason John Constantine was born with the ability to see demons and angels for what they really are. After a suicide attempt briefly sends a young Constantine to hell, John learns more about heaven and hell than your average everyday guy was ever supposed to know. He also knows that, as a suicide, that he's damned to spend the afterlife in hell so he devotes his life to earning his way back into heaven by performing exorcisms and protecting our world from demons.The movie gets marketed as a sort of action-horror film, but the truth is that it's neither. First of all, it's not scary. There are no real frights involved and hell is presented in too much of a matter-of-fact manner to be considered scary. And the movie is all about ideas, story and dialogue, rather than action. In situations where you'd usually expect a knock 'em out action sequence, you instead find a compelling conversation. Some people may be put off by this, but I liked it.The biggest surprise to me was Keanu Reeves' performance. I've never been much of a fan of the actor and I walked into the theater expecting to find Keanu lacking as Constantine but I really got into his portrayal of Constantine. I suppose if I were to nitpick I might say that he looked a tad too healthy to be playing a man dying of lung cancer. An actor with a more rugged complexion might have been more believable. It's a minor complaint though.On the down side, there's a few dangling plot threads that are never really explained. Also, the ending wasn't bad, but Constantine seemed way out of character. I just couldn't see it happening.Overall, though, a good movie. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A fun filed ride,"Constantine may not be the greatest film ever made but it is still very good and a enjoyable to watch.John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a demon hunter on earth who, when he dies, is destined to be rejected from Heaven and instead spend eternity in Hell, due to something he did in the past. Now he sees demons and angels everywhere and, in the hope of being allowed back into heaven, has taken it upon himself to rid the world of the demons.He soon meets Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) who's sister has seemingly committed suicide. Angela does not believe that she killed herself and turns to Constantine for help. This sparks a chain of events that lead to the pair discovering that the end of the wold is approaching.Constantine boasts Brilliant special effects and a very god story. It is let down by being a little too bitty (it is sometimes hard to follow what is happening) and Keanu Reeves isn't at his best. However Rachel Weisz is as brilliant as ever.If you are looking for a film to watch at home that is enjoyable and brilliant on screen then this film is for you. Don't listen to the others - Constantine is good. Not great, but good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Fantastic atmosphere and cinematography ... Loved it!,"Though slightly Neo-Esq Keanu does an excellent job of portraying an extremely strong character in what for me was an engrossing film.The film worked so seamlessly its hard for me to disseminate it into pieces and give an appraisal of each so here is a brief bullet-point of why I thought it was so good.Strong character played by Keanu, Excellent cinematography, A unique approach to an old story-line, Thoroughly engrossingThe negatives were Keanu was very Neo/Matrix like and his dialog with Lu at the end was a little unconvincing.Watch this one!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
certain things- like an uncommonly bad-ass Keanu Reeves- make this better than it has any right to be,"I'm not sure if Francis Lawrence is really up to par to make any kind of great movie, having now seen his first film Constantine and his mega-hit follow-up I Am Legend. But he can make a pretty entertaining spectacle of the dark and supernatural, and add a certain edge that comes most likely for those who are thirsting for it after being out of the desert of Man vs. Satan pictures. In this case John Constantine- inspired by a comic book from the 80s (which had the hero looking like Sting and Satan looking like David Bowie)- is a demon hunter, an exorcisor, and also a hardcore chain smoker who will probably kill himself from lung cancer before getting snuffed by some out-of-the-dark demon. He is called upon by a cop (Rachel Weisz) to investigate what appears to be a suicide of her sister (twin, not too oddly enough) but is really murder. How will Constantine find out? How will she? What will she be needed for?If you don't put a whole lot of thought into some of the logistics, obviously, Constantine is a very fun movie, and chock-full of ultra hellish special effects, some keen one-liners (""Everybody leave now... go to hell.""), and an unusually cool and on-spot performance from Keanu Reeves. While he might've given more of his somewhat limited worth for the Matrix movies, it's here that one sees him trying, and nearly succeeding, a Dirty Harry imitation in the form of a kind of Christopher Walken ala the Prophecy character. It helps since there's some very good supporting work from Weisz, Tilda Swinton as a vengeful angel, and Dijmon Honsu as a witch doctor (Shia Lebouf appears as a driver and is probably the weakest link). The coup is casting Peter Stormare as Satan, however, appearing in only some make-up and a heavy ham-bone performance.So for all you looking for plenty of action with those that come from hell, this is a good flick to catch now that it's showing a lot of cable. It's fast-paced but takes its time as a story, and it has atmosphere coming out of its ears, probably the best gift that Lawrence can bestow (he also has it in spades with I Am Legend, albeit the visual effects are actually better HERE than in the Smith vehicle). It would be a guilty pleasure to rank with Ghost Rider if it weren't somewhat pretty well crafted. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A nice dark try with good effects but the writing and uncertain delivery is a problem,"John Constantine is a gifted man  he can see demons and is responsible for sending them out of our dimension when they break the rules. When he tackles one exorcism where it looks like the demon is actually trying to enter the earth rather than just possess the person, he feels something is up. Similar incidents start him asking questions and finding answers that he doesn't like. Living within the demon underworld and knowing that his only destiny is hell thanks to his attempt at suicide earlier in life, John is bitter and angry. Meanwhile police officer Dodson looks into the suicide of her gifted twin sister and finds a path that leads her to Constantine and into his world.I got the chance to look at this film recently and was looking forward to it because it looked like it would be a dark, cynical thriller with action as well. For some of the time it gets close but it never really hits the mark with any consistency. The plot is simple but the manner of delivery didn't help it; it had far too many moments where it wasn't clear what was happening. I wasn't being thick, a few moments where you are left with questions are fine but to have it happen quite regularly was off-putting and broke up the flow of the story. Without this flow the impact of the story and the scenes is reduced. It is still interesting but it can't settle on a mood that helps. The dark, cynical edge is good but it doesn't go far enough; meanwhile the action misses the Hollywood mark by not being that exciting, despite it mostly looking good and being stylish.The strong effects do help this and they were impressive across the board, supported by some nice touches from Lawrence. At times it gets close to being style over substance but this was a problem that I go into any comic book adaptation expecting to have to forgive (or try to anyway). The cast suffer a bit with the story and also the script, which really doesn't support the dark vision of the director. I don't care if Reeves doesn't look like the comic book character, but I do care that he tried to play it like a darker version of Neo, I wanted more bitterness, more bile, more self-hate  Reeves could say the words to suggest these things but he couldn't convince me he believed them. Weisz is better but she isn't given that many chances to shine. Support from Hounsou, Rossdale, Vince, Stomare, Swinton and others is all OK but the material is where the problem is. I give it credit for being darker than your average comic book Hollywood film but it isn't thorough enough and often it only looks dark, rather than being ingrained through the characters and story.Overall this is an OK film but one that doesn't get close enough to what it should have been. It is dark and impressive on the surface but the story is badly told and the characters are not convincing enough within this world. I still enjoyed it due to the tone but I can fully understand why many people also dislike it and see missed opportunity, because there is plenty of that around too. Worth seeing but you will be asked to forgive a lot as well.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Well, if you take it for what it is, you'll definitely be entertained","There are more than enough reasons this movie should suck: it's directed by a music video director, whose done no other movies so far, not even for TV or direct-to-video. It's based on a comic book, and from the looks of it, only vaguely based on it(despite the original comic being at least seemingly highly popular). It's got religious undertones, making it seem heavy-handed and/or ridiculous to many viewers. Yes, there are an awful lot of very good reasons this movie should suck... but it doesn't. It just requires you to suspend disbelief and take the movie for what it is... the story of an anti-hero battling demons and keeping the balance between good and evil. Nothing more. A fairly by-the-numbers save-the-world scenario with Keanu Reeves playing off his Neo role, killing evil creatures, usually with ease. The plot is pretty good, though at times, it's unnecessarily confusing. The pacing is pretty good, the film isn't too long for it's own good and you're fairly rarely bored. The effects are the definite high point in the film, looking exceptionally well. The action is somewhat seldom in the film, and it's mostly very quickly over with... but it looks damn good, and it's usually intense and involving. The biggest problem with the action is that Constantine says he has fought the half-breeds all his life... yet he has an easy time of killing the actual demons as well. The acting is pretty good, with few exceptions. The dialog is well-written at times, and there are some great one-liners. The great thing about the tone is that there's all these undead and demonic creatures he has to fight... so he uses holy weaponry. A Holy Shotgun, holy brass knuckles... good stuff. One of my biggest problems is the entire motivation of the 'bad guys' though. We never understand why these people(uh, creatures) do as they do. Apart from the few shortcomings, the film is quite entertaining, and surely worth the rental. I recommend this to any fan of this kind of movie(bloody action with there 'hero' saving the world) and possibly some fans of the original comic as well(just be prepared for a lot of unwanted changes from the source material). 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Battle of good versus evil,"A good old fashioned battle of good versus evil, and Reeves plays John Constantine, who is particularly good at sending demons back to Hell. Unfortunately for him he committed suicide once, so when he dies and goes to Hell, those demons will be waiting for him to tear him apart. And no matter how much good he does, he can't get his ticket punched for Heaven. There is a suicide of Isabel, and she is condemned to Hell. Her sister Angela, cannot accept Isabel committed suicide, as Isabel was devoutly religious, and asks John to find out what really happened. Overlaid with this, John finds that demons are passing into the real world, which is not supposed to happen, as there is a truce between Heaven and Hell. There will always be evil but not supposed to be actual demons. So he has his hands full trying to find out what is going on. Apparently it is setting up for the appearance of the son of Satan, which would really be bad. So a battle of good versus evil with very high stakes.

Great movie,"This is certainly one of the best religion/thriller movie ever.

He suited perfectly in the character (John Constantine), a sarcastic, black-humored and supernatural detective that fights against demons to receive his salvation from hell. Rachel Weisz is also very convincing as the sensitive policewoman Angela Dodson and works very well with Keanu.People that don't like to see supernatural stuff or alternative imaginative stories probably will hate it.

Very good unique comic movie,"This is definitely not a typical superhero movie even though it is based on a comic book. Constantine is much darker and more mature, contains a lot of demons and introduces us to a completely new world that we can only see through the eyes of our John. I found it a little strange that Keanu was in the lead role here because he doesn't play the typical good guy here like in most movies, but I think he did a great job. He is a complex character because of his past and the opportunities he has, and he is constantly faced with new troubles. A film that is not for everyone because it is different from most ""similar"" films, but for me that is a big plus. Although it relies a lot on visuals and effects in many scenes, it is not its main part because we get to know the main character throughout the entire film and the topics are not light at all. However, what bothered me about the film was that a lot of things were left open and unexplained, and the supporting characters only appear in the background without any explanation or connection to Constantine.

The first hour especially, is like a mixture of horror and noir.Anyways, it is fantastical and fun (as I said most of the times) in the way Wizard of Oz must have felt fantastical and fun. Only you.probably can't watch this one with the kids. It can be occasionally dark and hellish (pun intended.)Reeves seems to excel in these type roles, and was, in my opinion, a good fit.

Constantine puts a supernatural twist to a typical murder investigation that feels slightly underwhelming.,"I realise this film does have a cult following, and I myself actually enjoy watching this. That does not mean I love it and think it's the best thing since sliced bread...it isn't. Demon hunter John Constantine gets involved with Angela who believes her twin sister was murdered instead of committing suicide. The two undergo a personal journey together where reality may not be the only world that exists. It's pretty much any investigative crime thriller but the suspects are angels and demons. There is so much religious jargon that it rather hurts my brain. Spear of Destiny, Gabriel, Satan's Son...the list goes on. Even though I myself am not religious, I found myself intrigued by the plot and its religious context. Yes, some parts are fictionalised for dramatic purposes but I never became bored. The plot is completely overstuffed with wasted supporting characters, an antagonist with an ambiguous motive and a few plot conveniences. But in saying that, it's just entertaining and intriguing. Plenty of slow motion visual effects and a visceral stylised version of hell keeps this film feeling fresh, even when watching it today. The stand out though, is John Constantine himself. A jaded, experienced and tired individual that consistently questions his destiny. Keanu Reeves was the perfect choice to portray this character, his serious monotonous line execution was sublime. Rachel Weisz was slightly underwhelming but was functional. Everyone else? Wasted potential. Tilda Swinton, Peter Stormare, heck even Shia LaBeouf just needed more screen time. The film is solely focussed on Constantine. For 121 minutes, is there enough substance to the character? Yes and no. I found the scene editing to be slightly rushed. No real transitions for the most part, where some scenes just feel like they were stringed together with no real thought. A good adaptation for a comic, I just wished there was more substance and a more intelligent approach.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Excellent movie for those who enjoy religious themes and cynical viewpoints,"One of my very favorite movies, I have watched ""Constantine"" numerous times and still appreciate it. Perhaps I enjoy it so much because I was raised Catholic and attended Catholic school -- the movie contains many religious themes that any former Catholic will enjoy and relate to. Old-school Catholics may not like this movie at all but anyone who has questioned beliefs (which this movie does not do)and has questioned God's Will or asked ""Why?"" or ""Why Me?"" is really going to like this movie! As I said this movie does not question beliefs but builds on them in a very cool way. I'm not sure a non-catholic can appreciate this entire aspect of the film though.I am not a fan of Keneau Reeves at all, but I thought he did a very good job in this role, he was believable in the part except that he looked far too young and healthy for it. The acting in the movie was excellent and the actors (and actresses) were very well cast.Guys will love Rachel Weisz' wardrobe, indeed, all the wardrobe was excellently done, not something I usually care about or notice particularly but in this movie most viewers will agree.The only negative about this movie is the bathtub scene (seen in trailers).

Enjoyed this horror film that is more in to themes and ideas than violence,"I enjoyed this movie. It's a toned down horror movie more akin to Stigmata than Event Horizon. I haven't seen the comic book, so the movie was new and fresh to me. I thought the acting was good. I usually find Keanu Reeves a little stiff in his acting, but here he moved well and brought the right ambiance to his character. Rachel Weisz is wonderful as the police detective who refuses to believe her sister's death was suicide. When we first meet Rackel's character Angela she is confessing to a Catholic priest that she has killed yet another man. She can't understand how she manages to kill so many criminals when most police officers go three years without even drawing their guns. Angela always knows where the criminals are going to be and she always kills them. I was hooked.

Great Adventure  Do not Pay Attention to the Bad Reviews in IMDb,"I liked this movie a lot.

Maybe teenagers and children addicted in and fans of this comic book are responsible for the bad reviews, I am not a hundred percent sure, based on their knowledge of the character.

This attempt left me feeling like well, at least they tried. While it lacks the dynamics of the X-Men franchise, it is far more bold than other substandard comic book/video game lines (Daredevil, Hulk, Doom, Streetfighter) and pulls itself up well with no support from anywhere except the DC comics upon which this is based; specifically, ""Dangerous Habits,"" the edition in which John Constantine contracts lung cancer and then negotiates his way out of it.Check out the nod to Alien 3 with the ""dog-alien"" face lick and what appears to be a little bit of the musical score from that same movie.I really enjoyed Constantine and can't wait to own it on DVD.It rates a 6/10 from...the Fiend :.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
fans of the supernatural genre would enjoy,"This movie is put together really nicely . The cinematography is clean and crisp. I gave it 7 out of 10 because the pace could have been a bit faster, but the subject, the story itself and the way things are put together are great.Lets not forget that it was based on a comic book and with that said, I think both Keanu and Rachel are doing a great job. Unfortunately there is not chemistry between them(or any of the other characters - so that is a great minus, it feels quite lonely - but I guess this is what the director wanted us to feel too, and you can see that in the deleted scenes, and his commentaries on the movie.At first I thought I wouldn't be able to go trough the end of the movie since it starts with a very intense ""scare-time""... But overall - I really enjoyed it and I would recommend it. It has a warped theme about anti-suicide, but then using suicide as a mean of redemption - I love the brighter end of it, it was a little twist I really liked.In short this is a movie that fans of the supernatural genre would enjoy .",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A nice surprise...glad I've watched it!,"With all the negative press this movie was receiving, I never was really much interested in watching this movie. Still for some reason I decided to give this movie a chance and I'm glad I did! ""Constantine"" is spectacular and gorgeously visual looking.""Constantine"" can be simply described as a mix of ""The Exorcist"" and ""Blade"" because well...John Constantine is a Blade like exorcist. For some reason this movie was poorly advertised. From the advertises and trailers I couldn't really tell what for a kind of character John Constantine was and what this movie was about, also since I never even had heard of the comic books this movie is based on. Had this movie been better advertised, I'm sure it would had attracted more people to see it.Maybe best thing about the movie are the special effects. They are truly most excellent, scary and gory at times. It makes this movie visual wonderful to look at. Also the atmosphere is better than expected. OK it ain't really a comic book kind of atmosphere but it's a good dark, almost horror like atmosphere. This movie works fine as an horror as well as an action movie...and as an anti-smoking campaign. The movie has more than a few spectacular and scary moments.The story is a bit too complicated at times. I don't think that the story itself is that complex but it's just the way it is told. Rookie director Francis Lawrence still has obviously some things to learn about movie-storytelling but nevertheless this is an impressive and most certainly entertaining debut movie from him.Keanu Reeves of course wouldn't had been my first choice as the hero but he pulls of alright. At least he isn't laughable unbelievable in his role or anything but he also ain't exactly cool enough. Rachel Weisz also pulls of alright but her performance certainly isn't worth all the praise she is receiving over here. In my opinion she really isn't believable as a cop. Can you just imaging her arresting a big tough criminal? Really good were Djimon Hounsou (finally in a 'normal' role, I was getting sick of seeing him playing typical Africans like he did in for instance ""Amistad"", ""Gladiator"", ""Stargate"" and ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"".) and Peter Stormare as the greatly sarcastic Lucifer. Shia LaBeouf is also a good young actor with already an impressive CV. Surely a name we will hear a lot more about in the near future.Don't let all the negative press scare you off from watching this movie. ""Constantine"" is a gorgeously looking and entertaining horror/action movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
surprisingly good comic adaption (there aren't many out there),"Since there are so many bad user comments about this flick here I decided to do my personal opinion about the movie.First the movie is mainly about the comic and thats why you should bring the right alignment to it. Adapting a comic is never easy because you get a high chance of pissing the die hard comic fans off.As for me I never read the comics but enjoyed the movie. Personally I found the most popular comic adaptions very boring. Spiderman, X-Men, Hellboy and so on were very boring stuff. Batman 1, The Punisher and this movie here are definitely the better ones. As for Keanu Reeves it's not his best role but he does a OK job about the careless chain smoking Anti Hero in this flick. I would say he plays as usual. The part of Mr. Lucifer himself is probably the best part in the movie and also pretty funny. Another thing I noticed being positive is the soundtrack. You will mainly get instrumental music which suits the film. And you won't be annoyed by pointlessly placed cheap pop music from the category ""product placement"".In the end it seems that mainly the religious US people have problems with the movie and therefore give em bad reputation. For me it's mainly a comic adaption and with that aspect in mind this movie is pretty entertaining and worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
actually quite good for a comic book action movie.,"Based of the DC comic book Hellblazer, Constantine is the story of John Constantine, a supernatural detective who possesses the rare gift of being able to see the demons and angels that walk amongst us. Constantine teams up with a skeptical policewoman, Angela, who is trying to uncover the truth to her sister's suicide. Their investigation leads to the uncovering of an otherworldly attempt to transform the world into a harboring for hell's demons. The two must defeat the demons and make peace with peace with themselves and of course save the world.To be honest, when I first saw the trailers for this movie, I had pretty low expectations. Very low. The movie pretty much looked like any other big action comic book movie, and with Keanu Reeves, it just looked too much like him following the same formula of the matrix. However, I was pleased to see that the movie was better than expected. I actually walked out liking what I just saw.I found myself very interested in the story of an agreement between heaven and hell, that they would each control their respective domains, but could not control earth, just attempt to influence it. That story and the separate stories and lives of Constantine and Angela were rather interesting, and, in my opinion, pretty well developed for a film of this nature.The acting is decent. Keanu is, wellKeanu. If you've seen any movie with him in it, you know what that means. But this role doesn't really require him to make any big stretches. Rachel Weisz does a good job as Angela and as my friend Alex says, ""She sure is nice to look at."" And in my opinion a very good job was done by Shia LaBeouf as Constantine's young apprentice Chaz Kramer. Shia LaBeouf, famous from Even Stevens, does a good job as the comedic relief but also puts in his share of dramatic acting. And, I just like Shia as a young actor. Also look out for in the movie, Bush frontman, Gavin Rossdale as the demon Balthazar.What I liked most about this film, other than the story, was the fact that the movie was believable. Many of the big blockbusters coming out, especially those based of comic books, seem to really push the computer animation. While there was plenty of CGI in the film, the makers of the film didn't over do it, and made it look much more believable than other films. I was never distracted by any fakeness of the film and was able to sit back and enjoy.I call Constantine a mix between the Matrix, Lord of the rings, and the Passion of the Christ, and you'll have to watch the movie to fully understand. Constantine pulls of the big comic action movie better than most. Constantine gets 4 stars, and, be sure to sit through the credits for one final scene.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"It was Like ""THE EXCORCIST"" but a HUNDRED TIMES BETTER!!!","This movie was so Awesome. I enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie. It was intense and was suspense and it was not predictable like some movies are. It kind of reminded me of ""The Excorcist"" but a hundred times better. Like the underworld where he had to put his feet in the bucket of water to get to the place of fire and evil Now that is what i thought was cool. How anyone could of been bored during this movie i don't know, I guess they must be insane just kidding everyone LOLZ!!!. But I LOVED IT!!!! I could watch it over and over and over. It didn't just make me suspenseful it also made me sad like when John Constatine's partner dies i thought that was sad I could of cried but it was not sad enough to cry but it was sad. I give you double thumbs up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Better than expected,"I had heard and read all sorts of negative reviews about Constantine, but I was unexpectedly surprised that it wasn't as bad as I'd feared. Yes, Keanu Reeves is a little stoic in the movie, but that's true of most of his films; he is, in essence, a good character actor. We know the type of person he's going to portray, and I don't think that should be a strike against him. Rachel Weisz is, as always, lovely, and she at least delivers a credible performance in her role.I thought it was interesting that the angel Gabriel was played as a rather androgynous woman, and Satan was appropriately creepy without being overly demonic and horrifying. The special effects were, in my opinion, well done; nothing looked shoddy or unfinished. I think this movie contained some of the most visually arresting interpretations of Hell I've seen in film; I doubt anyone that sees Constantine will forget them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The ultimate in good vs evil with great action and a stellar cast...what's not to like?,"It's good to see that out of the top movies released in 2005 so far, the best in terms of quality are both comic adaptation films. Elektra was a good film and Constantine is even better then Elektra. I know it's early but both outclass everything else 2005 has to offer.I enjoyed Constantine and absolutely loved the Theological issues. The ultimate in good Vs evil with great action and a stellar cast...what's not to like? I have never read or even heard of a Hellblazer comic book and maybe that was an advantage for me. Coming in fresh to this film, I had no preconceived notions. The resulting story and exposition was masterfully done. I don't understand what some of the people who have been critical of this film were expecting. It's suspenseful from beginning to end and features top quality CGI. This is honestly the best work Keanu has done since the original Matrix and FAR better then the horrible mess the sequels to that film turned out to be. Nine out of ten easily from me.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Last scene,For those who haven't seen the movie if you have extra time after the end i recommend waiting for the last scene where you can see Chas Chandler becoming an angel. Personnaly i think it's not worth it but hey you'd paid your ticket you deserve to see it all and you can even enjoy yourself by reading everyone that participates in the movie :) About the movie it is a good one not like the old days but sometimes you can remember the exorcist which i believe is a good thing.

Good,"I have just come out of the movie theatre (9.2.2005). Constantine is a good movie in the sense that it is highly entertaining and it looks at religion (and beliefs) from a different perspective while keeping faithful to the doctrines of Christainity. The wars between God and Satan, Heaven and Hell, Good and Bad are all evident here. There is a juxtaposition between the supernatural and the natural. When I go to see a movie 'adapted' (even if loosely) from a comic book, I always watch it with an open mind and not make comparison with what has been in print. This also applied to the movie, Elecktra. In the same way, when I go to see a movie made from a bestseller or a classic, I do not make comparison either. Why? Because both are made to be enjoyed - in different ways, perhaps in different times and in different environment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Much better than expected,"Constantine is a surprisingly good movie if you don't have preconception about what to expect. The movie is a cross between Matrix, Exorcist and Prophecy. Unlike many other movies adapted from comic, Constantine has a decent story and the writing quite good. The visuals and FX are done quite nicely except that the demons sometimes look a bit cheesy.Keanu Reeves does not fit the description of John Constantine from the comic but that is totally fine with me because the movie does not write the character the same way anyhow. It would be really scary if Keanu tries British accent, dye himself blond or use sarcastic remarks liberally. He plays up the weariness and vulnerability of John Constantine, not the heroic aspects. Not a conventional approach but it suits the movie quite nicely, just like Parker in Spiderman 2.Other actors are good too but Tilda Swanson's Gabrielle has too little screen time to establish her importance in the whole conflict. Apart from that, Lucifer acting like some guy from a casino in LV is such an old trick and a bad fit when they portrait Hell as a furnace with alien-like demons. I much prefer a quiet, menacing Lucifer with contempt for mankind like Viggo Mortensen did for Prophecy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good action movie with a nuanced presentation of the nature of faith,"I'm never sure what to expect when I go to see a movie like Constantine starring Keanu Reeves and Rachael Weisz. Hollywood, in my estimation, does not understand Christianity and spends a great deal of time and effort not understanding it.However, looking at something sometimes require a magnification of the greater themes. Stories that illustrate big themes require big characters and big actions, an exaggeration one has to expect. Christianity is all about the fight between good and evil, but the battle for the human heart is more interesting if one uses computer-generated demons and gleaming gold guns in the shape of a crucifix.I commend the director for not squandering screen time with gratuitous sex, though this is not a movie for kids. I wouldn't recommend anyone younger than 16 seeing it. It is very violent and scary at times.As an action movie, Constantine is pretty darn good if a bit pedestrian. Reeves in the title role is Reeves as he is in every other title role but in this case it is just what the movie needs. John Constantine is a conflicted man who, through a series of events, becomes something of the James Bond of occult warriors. He dispatches otherworldly creatures who violate the uneasy truce between God and Satan here on earth.John Constantine is a cynic, and believes that he is doomed to an eternity in Hell, having been there after a suicide attempt in his youth. On his return, he's fruitlessly tried to redeem himself by crushing Hell's minions, but his cynicism toward God blinds him to grace. An interesting twist that  Constantine believes in God, just not in God's goodness. The resolution of Constantine's conflict with God is remarkably sophisticated in light of Hollywood's chronic problems with comprehending faith.I believe that God's protection is more akin to that enjoyed by Marva Munson in the 2004 version of The Ladykillers than anything proffered from Latin incantations and holy water. Nevertheless, Constantine navigates the logical incongruities of warring against principalities and powers with bullets forged from religious charms well enough to not be distracting. This is ultimately not a movie about the finer points of theology but rather a man at war with himself and God. The liberties are forgivable, in my view because they actually hit just the right note in the end.I am not a reader of the Hellblazer comic, a D.C./Vertigo imprint on which the movie is based, so I cannot speak to the faithfulness of this adaptation. On its own merit, Constantine is a top-shelf action/occult thriller with great special effects. It illustrates broad themes of good and evil particularly the internal conflicts. There are good thrills and a respectable smattering of laughs. I very much appreciate the relatively thoughtful rendering of the struggles any man would have when facing the world's pain. Watching one of Old Scratch's foul servants get punched in the head with a set of cross-inscribed brass knuckles is just an added bonus.Tim McNabbwww.fivehundredwords.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
not bad,"For all of you geeks that follow the comic, first of all, move out of mom and dads basement and get a life. Secondly, it isn't possible to properly reflect a storyline such as this to film. I supposed it would be possible if the powers that be in Hollywood would produce 10 hour movies. This doesn't happen because we as humans don't have the attention span. Screenwriters must pick out what they feel (I said they, not you) are the most important points of the story, and each character. Take it for what it is, not what you think it should be. This was a decent movie. For everyone that does not follow the comic, don't get lost in the wanna be film maker/ film critic rhetoric of those who say don't go see it.

One of the cooler Keanus,"You've got to love Anti-Heros, to like this movie though. Keanu Reeves character is this character! And all this is based on a comic book (or is it graphic novel? I wouldn't want to insult anyone), which of course made a lot of people uncomfortable ... with a first time director (feature film wise) and a not so popular lead actor (Keanu Reeves that is).But if you can overlook all that (prejudices against the director/star and the liberties it took with the story of the comic book), then you will enjoy a light hearted action movie.

Rachel Weisz and Gavin Rossdale are great but not even they can save this film from it's bad script.,"I just came back from a screening of the new Keanu Reeves clunker called Constantine up here in San Monica California. I'm a fan of the comic and I wanted to keep an open mind but the movie was a real wasted of time, and some of the effect look really cheesy in parts of the film. Keanu Reeves is not John Constantine and no matter how many cigarettes he smokes and how big his trench coat is, he still not John Constantine. He acts more like Archie Bunker than the sorcerer we all know and love who likes to add more fuel to the fire in the battle between good and evil. Rachel Weisz and Gavin Rossdale (Yes, the same man who is married to Gwen Stefani and who was the lead singer of the band Bush) were the only actors in this pile of wasted celluloid that actually turn in good performances. They at least looked like they actually gave a damn about what they were making while Keanu, the director and the scriptwriters seem like they had no idea on what they were trying to put a cross. Certain scenes in the film were just way too dark to take notice on what is going on from time to time and most of the dialog ranges from corny to so-so. The movie wants to make a statement about heaven, hell and the human spirit that is struggling in-between but the subject matter was not handled with care and it felt like it was watered down in order to commercialize this film to the brainless masses who can't really think for themselves (Dare I say the religious right?) If you are going to tackle this kind of subject matter, go for the jugular and pull no punches. Don't take a great comic book and turn it into a supernatural fluff piece that is more in tune to the Left Behind series than of the comic that it was based on. It only hurts the film in the long run and it does.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A film for those that loved The Prophecy...,"I must begin by saying that I have not read the Hellblazer comics, nor did I know anything about Constantine before viewing this film. So, perhaps I went in blindly and that is why I enjoyed this movie so much. I will say that upon viewing this movie I am very interested in reading the Hellblazer comics and learning more about our unpopular hero, John Constantine, especially since he is mentioned in some of the Sandman series (which is one of my favorite Neil Gaiman stories). I think one of the reasons I thought that this movie was ""utterly uber cool"" was because it focused less on action, more on a defined story. When you see the previews for Constantine and you are a fan of The Matrix, you will be very disappointed. This is not so much an action film as it is a character study with themes of religion and compassion. While there are some powerful scenes of violence, the central focus is around Constantine and his plight to enter Heaven. He embodies the everyman's struggle to get into the pearly gates at the end of our great journey through life. Even though he has done so well fighting for Heaven, there are outside forces that fight against him. That is the central struggle of the film. It wasn't Constantine vs. the Devil as I think several of our fellow critics think. This was not The Matrix, but instead a film that stood sturdily by itself.I am an enormous fan of the series The Prophecy. I thought that Christopher Walken brought a completely new spin on the angel character as well as screenwriter/director Gregory Widen expanded the playing field of Heaven and Hell and showed us a new creative story that seemed utterly real. This is the same as I felt with Constantine. Here we have a growing and constantly changing world, above and below us, that feeds on our souls. While they do not interfere directly, there are elements of our day to day life that will guide us on the path of destruction or salvation. It is the great gift of free will that gets us to our ultimate destination. That concept of free will is also detailed in this film. Christopher Walken grappled with it in The Prophecy films and the amazing Tilda Swinton dwelled heavily on it in this one. It was great to see the consistency of the Gabriel character. It is hard to explain, but this is the concept I loved the most. The idea that Heaven and Hell do really exist and it is ultimately our choice which one we will end up in. Also, director Francis Lawrence's vision of Hell was disturbingly original. I loved the concept that it is just like Earth, except more terrifying. The two times that we visited it in this film my jaw was on the floor. It was amazing just to see another viewpoint on an age-old concept.I thought casting for this film, especially the high budget production that it was, was exceptional. Tilda Swinton nearly stole the entire film, if it hadn't been for Peter Stormare's turn as Satan. I was also very impressed with the acting ability of Gavin Rossdale. When I had first heard that he was going to be in this film, I had my doubt, but he pulled through and was a great choice for the sleazy demon named Balthazar. While I just didn't enjoy Shia LaBeouf's character portrayal in this film, it was the coupling of the other actors that kept me going. Keanu did exactly what I wanted him to. He played this really cool anti-hero that had been to Hell and back while not being afraid of what was to come. He embodied the struggles that Constantine had to deal with while also bringing out that sense of humanity that I don't know if other actors could have done. He also was able to capture some great chemistry with Rachel Weisz, who was a strange choice for a big budget film, but turned out for the best. If the story doesn't impress you as much as it did me, then at least you can be happy with the acting. I thought that it stood out as one of the better lineups in this year's cinema releases.Finally, the last aspect that I enjoyed were the small details that if you were not paying attention you would miss. The cultural mix of fantasy and reality was perfection. The Nazi flag in the beginning coupling to the character of Papa Midnight (possibly Father Time) just seemed to click with me. I know this story arrived from a graphic novel, but I thought that director Francis Lawrence did his homework and should be very proud. The colors and tone of the entire film never became light nor was it ever positive. This is a dark work, and Lawrence showed it. The only down side to this entire movie was the Hollywood influence on the final cut. There were two scenes that I could just feel that big studio bosses forced Lawrence to make either to get a laugh or to have some sort of completion. Either way, the two scenes were pointless and really felt forced. You could tell that they just were not meshing well with the rest of the film.Overall, I was impressed. I cannot wait to get my hands on some of the Hellblazer stories and read more about this hero from beyond. This film got me psyched about watching The Prophecy and see the war between Heaven and Earth fought again. I have to warn you through, this is not an action film. This is a character study of one John Constantine, which is more dramatic than action. A perfect blend of CGI and modern culture, Constantine is exactly what I needed to tie me over until Sin City.Grade: ***** out of *****",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Demon Hunter C,"Well, there goes the world again, for the End of Days is nearing. I must admit that I'm not a real fan of 'Angels versus demons' of 'God versus Lucifer' films, but I thought that the comic book based Constantine could bring a nice twist to the oh so familiar story. Sometimes it even does. The film is well filmed and at times it is really surprising. What the film lacks though is depth and excitement. The film is not very gripping and I think that is because the lead character (played by Keanu Reeves) is not gripping enough. Whether this is a failure of the script or Keanu I can't really say, since I don't know the comics but I admit I felt little connection with our hero. I could connect much better with Angela (Rachel Weisz) and I think she acted very well. She was about the only one who brought some feeling into this. Sure Keanu had some funny lines and his cynical ways were pretty good most of the time, but his character and Weisz's didn't seem to connect at all (on any level). Another minor 'bug' in my mind is that the bad guys weren't well-cast either. They just weren't scary in any way...it always seemed that while Constantine was just a man and they were demon's they couldn't do him one bit of harm. Silly...but an explanation for the lack of thrills in this one. In the beginning I expected something like The Crow, Dracula or Vampire Hunter D and in the end I got 'The Exorcist on the road' or...well you've read the summary...somewhere between 6,5 and 6,75 out of 10 (with a small 7 given upon voting)",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

To hell and back - Constantine summary,"A detective, John Constantine (keanu Reeves), has been to hell and back once, since he tried to commit suicide as a youngster because he was able to see things.

Because of his trying to take his own life, Constantine cannot enter the gates of heaven and furthermore he's dying from lung cancer.

Her sister has just committed suicide (or has she?)and now Satan's very own son needs Angela to arrive on earth reborn and inflict a lot of pain onto the human race. But he needs divine help.It's a good thing if you know your religion before seeing this movie, but most of the religious plot is carefully explained throughout the movie.

Saw was the last good movie I've seen, until this. Let me start off by saying Keanu Reeves is a mediocre actor, but there's one thing I like about him, He picks his movies, and doesn't just sign his name unto anything (like Ben Affleck). Sweet November, I suppose, was contractional. But he just doesn't do any movie. He made a very good choice with this movie. Keanu did a bang up job with this movie. He was Constantine.

Decent combination of occult and modern visual.,"Personally, this movie is really a memorable one to me. I was 15 when I watched it in theater. And totally stunned by the visuals and world of it.The stories of ""Exorcist and Devil"" have already been told thousands of times by many kinds of media. Even in the era of Jesus Christ himself. ""Constantine"" proved that with such a classic theme, filmmakers can still make something different from others.With great visual effects, it shows us the world of hell, which is something you might never forget. Even the movie itself was released in 8 years ago, still, they are fascinating and unique enough to stand the test of time.The plot is nothing special, to be honest. It is another ""kill the bad guys"" stuff. However, props and directions are successfully making diversion to it. You can't miss one single moment of scenery that is full of gadgets and super-natural being dancing in the dark street of Los Angeles. And of course,Keane Reeves. He is taking control of whole atmosphere of this film. I think the role of John Constantine is definitely settle with him.It's not the movie liked by everyone I suppose, however it's not cheesy B-class film either. It's well directed and modernized occult movie. If you like dark fantasy or anti-hero style story, it's definitely the one for you to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
It was okay,"Constantine (Reeves) committed suicide (Catholics go direct to Hell when this happens) when he was a boy and was brought back in a deal with Heaven to send demons who have crossed the line (to our world) back to Hell. By doing this he is trying to work his way back on the path to Heaven. Why he was brought back is not known but he has the ear of both Heaven (Gabriel) and Hell. Now, too many demons are crossing over and Constantine believes the Devil is up to something not agreed to with God.The title of this could have been The Spear of Destiny as some believe that Christ died when he was speared by the Roman soldier. Whoever holds this spear controls the world. The spear was lost, of course, and found for this movie. It's impact was short lived and it's easier to name a sequel Constantine 2, rather than the Spear of Destiny 2. You may remember Constantine, but not the short lived spear that really didn't have the impact I thought this story would give it. This story was too much concerned with sending demons back to Hell. I think the sequel will have more to do with the Spear of Destiny. I can't wait. Can you?If the sound on my DVD version was any better I might have enjoyed this more. Sometimes it was very difficult to make out what a character said. You would think that a little rewind to go over the audio again and again would have helped, but it didn't' the countless times I rewound. Those who watched this in a movie theater really must have gone crazy with ""what did he say?"" But, I got the idea and that is enough, I suppose. Maybe I just had a bad DVD. Maybe.However, everything was good, the acting was good, the cinematography was outstanding and a few demons startled me when I least expected it. Those I heard clearly wouldn't you know. The story got more complicated when Lucifer arrives on the scene near the end, almost like it was another story entirely and I got lost for a moment (sound, remember?) or two, but I got the idea, I think, maybe. Now, if I told you why he appeared that would not be any fun.But, all in all, not bad. Not scary, and the suspense was not really there for a suspense movie. Is it just me or is Keanu Reeves getting better? He did a really good job. But, no ""whoa."" I missed that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Skip it, it's as bad as they say it is.","Moronic and self indulgent Keanu Reeves vanity project lacks the heart and the wits of the comic book which it steals most of it's ideas form and ruins them with a horrible acting performance by Keanu Reeves, which looks more like he's reading from cue cards than remembering a script. The rest of the actors do better in their roles than he does with Rachel Weisz stealing the show with a deep and strong performance, Gavin Rossdale, doing a very convincing job as an agent of the underworld and Djmon Hounsou giving a bit role more class than he should have.

Read The Comics,"Constantine was a comic first.Hellblazer is a great comic. Brilliant, intelligent writing backed up by awesome artwork. Why does Hollywood have to make changes that aren't necessary when the original provides enough proved material? A simple example of the pointless changes is that J Constantine is English. Is it really impossible for Americans to believe in a lead character that isn't American? If this isn't a problem for the majority of Americans then why do the studios consistently replace foreign leads with U.S. versions? The story is set in London, not LA. This entirely pointless change is not quite as bad as casting a witty, cynical, intelligent, cunning and determined character with an actor who is a one trick pony. What a shame. The casting for the rest of the film was inspired. The film looked good, and was written and directed very well.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constant...something or other.,"Although I have a confession to make - I actually found this movie passably entertaining - I have to say that it does have its faults.The first is Keanu Reeves. The character he plays here is almost a carbon copy of Neo from the Matrix - even Robot Chicken makes fun of his acting range. There's almost no differentiation in his acting between the two movies. Whilst this may work for some actors - Arnie, John Wayne etc. - here it only serves to make him him appear, much like the comic this movie is based on, as two-dimensional. If you had to look at a list of Hollywood actors and pick an action-hero from them, Keanu is surely not going to be your first choice. He's more like an accountant than a hero.Despite his miscasting, the movie, thanks mainly to the effects and pacing, moves along quite well. Also, supporting parts do a lot to make this movie more enjoyable than it should be, with Rachel Weisz, Peter Stormare and Djmon Honsou all giving far better showings than poor old Keanu.The story is forgettable religious clap-trap involving heaven and hell. Apparently Hollywood can only think of Christianity when it comes to good and evil. What that says about Hollywood I don't know, but it's a theme that constantly resurfaces time and again. Suffice to say, ignore acting, plot and dialogue and the movie is enjoyable. Think too hard about any of it and the irritation will creep in.Summary: Switch of thine brain and go forth and observe this film. Thy will be done (out of a few quid, anyway).",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Excellent comics adaptation,"This overlooked gem of a comic book adaptation often slips under the radar, but as a casual fan, I found myself thoroughly enjoying it. ""Constantine"" blends action, fantasy, and a touch of horror into a captivating ""fantasy exorcism"" concept that's both unique and intriguing. Keanu Reeves truly shines as the protagonist, depicting John's character quite nicely, complemented by some truly explosive action scenes.The film's opening sets the stage for John Constantine's world, effectively capturing his essence through his actions and attitude. However, it takes a bit too long to establish tangible stakes, leaving the first act feeling somewhat aimless initially. Thankfully, it finds its footing with the introduction of the heroine and her problems. Throughout, the cinematography adds layers of symbolism, like John entering the apartment building crossing into darkness symbolizing a point of no return.As the story progresses into the second act, the stakes are solidified with the involvement of Angela, delving into the villain's (Balthazar), character backgrounds (how Jhon came to be), the intricacies of the world (rules between angles and demons in society), and introducing interesting elements like Papa Midnite and mystical artifacts (Holy shotgun, Dragon breath).The third act delivers on the action, showcasing impressive action scene, production design and costumes, though it falls short by not providing enough insight into the villains' perspectives making the final action scene lack a little weight.While there are aspects to critique, such as underdeveloped side character + villains and rushed romantic subplots of Jhon and Angela, ""Constantine"" ultimately ties together neatly, offering viewers a satisfying journey into John Constantine's world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constantine A Decent Comic Book Movie,"Constantine is a decent movie based on the DC/Vertigo comic book Hellblazer from director Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend). The movie tells the story of John Constantine a supernatural detective gifted with the curse to see half angels and half demons living amongst us disguised as humans who is mankind's only hope for survival against the sinister forces that threaten their world. Keanu Reeves is solid as the title character portraying a man whose trying to buy his way into heaven for a past mistake by ridding the earth of demons because he doesn't want to damned to hell for eternity. Reeves may not get any nominations for his performance but he does a good job with the role of Constantine. Rachel Weisz is equally impressive as detective Angela Dodson who's investigating the mysterious death of her twin sister and joins forces with Constantine to find out the truth. Weisz continues to show her talent in this movie. Well done. The rest of the cast including Shia Labeouf, Dijimon Honsou, Pruitt Taylor Vincent and Max Baker are admirable in their roles but none of them get much to do and lack screen time. The same can go for Tilda Swinton, Gavin Rossdale, and Peter Storemare in a brief cameo role as Satan himself who are decent in their roles but they like some other characters get the short end of the stick. The pacing of the movie did seem a little slow at times too but other then that Constantine is an above average comic book movie brought to the big screen. Its no Dark Knight or Iron Man but it's certainly not like Spider-man 3 or Punisher War Zone. The special effects are state of the art and the few scenes where hell on Earth is shown are magnificently done. It's a nightmarish landscape overrun by demonic creatures from the darkest pits of hell. The music seemed to match well with what was going on the screen and the tone of the film. This film may be a bit light on action but what it does have is some character development, suspense, a few surprises, solid acting, an interesting story, and cool special effects that make for a good movie to watch. It may not be a classic or a masterpiece but the movie is better than some other ones that failed to entertain.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good one for genre fans,"I really liked ""Constantine"". I think it was a worthy addition to the Daemonology genre, kicked off by the Exorcist and Omen back in the 1970s. These movies often promise a lot, but too often fall apart due to poor internal logics, failure of realization, or just plain old cheesiness. ""Constantine"" evolved along a clear narrative path, where all characters had a certain consistent part in the storyline, yet still surprised here and there. The Daemon & Occult motif was well done, bringing in the typical paraphernalia in a working way.In addition, it was a delight to see Peter Stormare as the big L, a match made in heaven. Keanu Reeves was solid as always in his stone-face non-acting ""Neo"" style.I gave Constantine an ""8""; I think it was clearly above average for the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Review noob but a brilliant film (why the low ratings?),"Really enjoyed this film. Not sure why there is some hate, I will need to read a little deeper into some other reviews.All star cast brilliantly acted - quality CGI blended with the film considering it's from 2005.

Exceeded Expectations but Needs More Work!,"I never wanted to see this film in the first place. Originally, I thought this movie would be a piece of thrash and that's rare coming from a generous reviewer like me. But, I was pressured to see this film by a few friends of mine. I decided to take the risk of wasting two hours of my life. Well, I was slightly surprised that this movie turned out to be somewhat decent.Basically, this is about a guy who's in charge of sending demons back to hell. But all he really wants to do is go to heaven. Unfortunately, he can't go to heaven because of what he does. Now he has to face off with Satan and his demon cronies.Keanu Reeves was not impressive in this film. In most of his films, he just has the same expressionless look. Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare carry this movie. They were the ones who acted well.The story is somewhat confusing. There were some scenes that did not make sense to me. The story could have been better, much better. The visuals are pretty good. This movie seems similar to a movie that came out recently, Legion. Overall, this is a film that exceeded my expectations but I would not watch it again. I rate this film 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
What the HELL were they thinking?,"Horrible adaptation of the vertigo comic book not only a smack in the face of to the followers of the book with a flat out moronic screenplay that takes all the good out of the comic and makes it into a incoherent narrative that does not translate well on screen but also has the worse actor to play the title role of John Constantine. Keanu Reeves not only makes the role into a joke with his lack of talent but makes everyone around him look bad as well. The cinematography is ugly, making the movie a real eye sour and the special effects lack a certain feel to it. Out of the entire cast, only Rachel Weisz comes out with her dignity intact with a very good performance that the movie squanders in order to let Keanu act like a darker version of his NEO character towards the latter half of the film. They should have taken the material seriously and made a great horror movie out of it but instead, we have a children's movie that geared to Matrix heads.Avoid this film like the plague.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Settles For Far Less Than What It Was Capable Of,"A fascinating fable of angels & demons with humans caught up in between, Frances Lawrence's directorial debut packs an interesting premise yet is unable to flap its wings due to issues of its own makings. Keanu Reeves' presence is no less than a divine intervention here coz without him, Constantine is very much a hopeless ride.The story concerns a demonologist who has a reputation for dealing with the mystical and has been repenting for his past sins by sending demons back to hell, hoping his good deeds will finally grant him a place in heaven. But when he's approached by a police detective to investigate her twin sister's suicide case, he learns of a conspiracy that threatens all mankind.Directed by Frances Lawrence, the first act is rather impressive & piques our interest with ease while paving the necessary groundwork. But it's unable to keep a firm grip on our attention for long as the plot only gets sillier & goofier with time and goes full bonkers in the finale. It is lacking in atmosphere, has no build-up whatsoever, and is missing the required seriousness.It would've helped if the film had a dark, gothic vibe with skilfully executed moments of tension & suspense. What we get instead is a watered down version of a material with far greater potential. Keanu Reeves' charisma conjures more magic here than his performance but he does enough to keep us around till the end. Tilda Swinton is reliable as always while Rachel Weisz ably plays her role(s).On an overall scale, Constantine has the beginnings of a cool, stylish & thrilling horror-fantasy but the story fails to capitalise on it. Somewhere along the line, the debutant filmmaker loses his grasp on the narrative, resulting in a finished product that settles for far less than what it was capable of. The cult following it has developed over the years may give the impression of it being an underrated gem. For me however, it was nothing but dull, bland & underwhelming.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Constantine is comic book meets catechism, and THAT's entertainment!","Todays matinée was my first experience viewing a film in DLP. Watching the turf struggle between heaven and hell it seemed a supernatural choice of venue to witness another version of the ultimate conflict. You've seen the trailers so you know what the film is about. There have been other, less entertaining attempts to depict the rise of evil among mankind on the planet. Based on many of the web reviews I read before seeing the film, Keanu Reeves will be credited for the success or failure of the film. I won't judge the fairness of those observations, however I would like to point out that seeing Keanu in this role demonstrated his sensitivity, growth and experience. Is it monotone? or is it understated? He has matured in his craft and has developed subtleties that might be missed by those waiting for the next Matrix, or who think of him only for a reprise of 'Ted.' (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure) The ease he with which he holds a cigarette or shuts a door; the emotional connection he shows with his costars may be lost on those waiting for the next demonstration of pyrotechnics. So lets be fair. In addition to actor assessment maybe we should judge the film on the merits of directing, writing and editing. The film is a fun, entertaining, imperfect ride. Like free will we have a choice once we buy the ticket: focus on the negative and leave the theater or stay have fun enjoying the sins of imperfection.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Funny Review,"""The Singapore Health Promotion Board has found the perfect spokesperson for its anti-smoking campaign  and it's none other than Keanu Reeves in the role of the reluctant anti-hero cum walking chimney John Constantine.In between exorcism rites and fight-fests with renegade demons, the cancer-stricken and hard-drinking Constantine continues to flip his Zippo with panache, fire up the fags and down cough suppressants as we would Ribena....The only grouse that gay audiences may have with Constantine lies in its portrayal of demons as homosexual or bisexual: Balthazar snarls in Constantine's face and declares him to be ""finger lickin' good"" while the white-clad Lucifer (Fargo's Peter Stormare) goes one step further by playing footsie with Constantine's inner thigh and giving him a good tongue wash.Then again, with Keanu Reeves as the shirt-and-tie walking fetish Constantine  anyone homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual or remotely sexual would be hard-pressed not to feel weak in the knees  especially when confronted with his bubble butt and a gratuitous scene of him tearing off his shirt to expose his defined abs.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Thought provoking for the moderate believers,"It is likely (as I've read from past comments here) that this movie does not necessarily do the original Jack Constantine series justice. But for those who have not heard of the original Contantine series they might find the movie somewhat acceptable when judged on its own merits.The target audience, however, is not easily discerned. Perhaps a direct relation can be made to relapsed catholics and moderate Christians. I found the story interesting even though I know of more extreme constituencies that would readily claim to be offended by everything portrayed within the movie.It speaks to the daily struggle that believers have to reconcile modern lifestyles with their fledgling faith and their own state of health and mind. Even though the believer's reality is cast in a more literal, exaggerated form, the main points are not lost in my opinion. Here are some of the important ones: No one great or small should claim to know the true will or pretend to understand God. If they cross that threshold where they truly believe they have a personal understanding of God and His wishes, they are rightly deemed to be quite mad and should be confined to a small padded room as soon as possible. No exceptions.There is a purpose and direction in everyone's lives. Death is not necessarily the final goal or destination.Attentions are still bestowed upon us all on an individual basis even while globular events both bad and good are occurring all the time. The individual pieces of the world mosaic are not overlooked or forgotten. An accounting will inevitably be made of each of us because that is the way of this world. If we allow the fear of personal failures to overwhelm our lives and let addictions however insidiously fixate us to the point of complete immobility, the cost may still be our very soul.The waves will still smash down on the beaches regardless of who is still within them or on top of them. And that, my friends, is the true meaning of life. The forces of God and nature can not be refuted by man.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Another Entertaining Movie from the One A.K.A Mr Reeves,"I watched this movie earlier this evening. While not overly impressed I still found this to be very entertaining and waaaay better than a lot of recent comic book style movies, such as Catwoman, Hellboy, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The Hulk, Elektra etc.I am not familiar with the source material. I did however contrary to many reviews here, find Keanu Reeves to be very good in this film. His Character John Constantine is a chainsmoking, arrogant and obnoxious guy, who does not let people in to his personal life. He is dying of cancer and tormented by inner demons (as well as fighting real ones outside). Having been damned to hell, he is trying to somehow buy his way back to heaven by vanquishing demons on earth (which only he and a select few can see). I think he portrayed this individual very well, the supporting cast also gave decent performances. I seem to slightly disagree with many people here on Rachel Weisz's performance, while quite good was not exceptional as many have stated here.The eventual meeting with the Devil was a little disappointing, but overall it was definitely not a bad movie. In fact I found it to be very entertaining and visually excellent.I am not a big fan of Keanu Reeves as I have only really liked him in a few films.

Constantine,"I had no idea that this was based on a comic until I actually started watching the DVD.Loved the effects. Scene where the Mexican guy finds the Spear of Destiny, changes (becomes possessed) and gets hit by the car - Priceless. Scene with the possessed girl...thought was good. Scene where Constantine goes to hell to see if Angela's twin was there...he finds her and catches the hospital band - Priceless. Loved the make up of the demons - thought that was very original. Scene were Constantine leaves the gas station and is confronted by a demon (..of bugs) - Priceless. Scene where the guy (forgot his name - he was a priest) goes to the morgue and finds Isabel's body, freaks out and tries to quench his need for liquid but can't...priceless. I then said to myself, 'break the bottle' ...no luck... priceless. Scene where the the priest dies in the store...one of the half breed's watches his death - the store clerk who was bent down over him...the wings...

Just my personal opinion,"I thought Constantine was a great movie, because it was not your ordinary horror movie. It also showed a person's issues with death and loneliness. What I also found interesting was the choice of Keanu Reeves for the title role. I think he made Constantine classier than the original character from the graphic novels. I think that since the actor himself has had tragic experiences in his life, he brought a lot of depth to the character, it's not something you can just fake.The overall choice of cast was superb and the special effects were first class. I loved watching how the effects were achieved (the DVD set is fabulous). One can truly appreciate the effort and craftsmanship.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Goth comic-book thriller that eventually picks up steam,"The mix of comic book action and palpitating priests hardly led me to expect the sort of film I might enjoy and I had to restrain myself for the first half hour of Constantine from walking out. It's like X-Men meet the Exorcist. Keanu Reeves wanders in as if he's still in The Matrix, this time calmly exorcising heavy-duty CGI demons from hapless muggles. The slim (very slim) basis of all this is that he who holds the Spear of Destiny (that, according to the gospels, killed Jesus) rules the world. Spear has been found (shades of Tolkien's Ring) and sets off all sorts of strange goings on. There is a wafer thin line between heaven and hell, which is reality as we know it. God and the Devil have fun playing at keeping a perfect balance and it takes a strange event (such as the reappearance of the Spear after it had been hidden at the end of World War II) to allow any creature from either 'side' to manifest in the real world.The trick to enjoying Constantine I discovered is not to treat it as a horror film but as some updated goth battle of good and evil. Perhaps for Roman Catholics (who probably believe in that particular version of heaven, hell, the power of the church etc), films like Constantine - and the Exorcist for that matter - hold more terror. After all, if we think we might go to Roman Catholic purgatory, a story about it is more scary than if we don't, right? The other side of the coin can be seen if we watch early Japanese horror movies that rely on their (to us, equally innocuous) mythology and ghostworld bogeymen.But once you buy into the genre (think Spiderman, Blade, The Crow) it becomes reasonably entertaining. The appearance of Tilda Swinton as the Archangel Gabriel adds a somewhat novel touch and prevents the otherwise fairly predictable action from getting staid. Constantine is enjoyable enough at a push - or push it to one side for the much better offerings that are available in its genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The trailer was better than this.,"I just came back from a sneak preview of the movie Constantine up here in California and to be honest, I'm glad I did not pay for it.The movie stars Keanu Reeves as a supernatural private eye who helps a police detective played by Rachel Weisz into inquiring about the strange suicide that was committed by her twin sister. As the movie progresses, it turns out that there is a war that is brooding between the forces of Heaven and hell and the suicides that are plaguing the city is some how connected to it. As in all movies of this nature, there are twist and turns that can be seen a mile away and it all leads to a climax that involves weapons of holy origin. Keanu brands a holy Shotgun and in one scene uses holy brass knuckles to fight against one of the main baddies. While this was decent eye candy, you can't get over the bad acting of Keanu Reeves, who is just playing the character of Neo and The rest of the actors don't fair any better in this movie with the exception of Rachel Weisz and Djmon Hounsou, who both manage to stand out in this mess despite the fact that the script does not do them or their performances any justice. I was more interested in their characters than Keanu's attempt at drama and in my opinion, it probably would have been a better movie if they just focus on their characters instead of his. The look of the film is a little too dark in some places and the script in question lacks focus, not to mention any real dialog to go with it. The special effects are decent but with how dark the film is, you could not really see any of them too clearly and when you do see them, you can see the bad CGI in all it's glory.The trailer was much better than this.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Meh.,"Overly-long, plagued by an uneven script and relying too much on fantastic special effects, Constantine also suffers from Keanu Reeves' acting  maybe his worst ever.Reeves is a sort of supernatural detective, who goes about pulling demons out of little girls. Teaming up with Rachel Weisz to try and save her hell-bound twin-sister, he ends up needing to save the world from Satan's son. Yep, you read it right.Constantine is nicely dark, and full of action...it starts strongly, and occasionally has some nice set design, but quickly flops into a mire of CGI. That looks great, but it's pretty obvious the producers saw the rushes and decided to try and blow the audience away with special effects, to distract from, and make up for, the awful acting and script.Oh, and why try to be 'unusual' or clever when depicting Satan? His appearance was possibly the worst part of the movie. No, wait - that was Reeves' acting. My mistake.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constantine not as bad as originally thought,"Watching the trailer for Constantine, I originally thought that the movie would be another Matrix ride. More time watching Keanu Reeves having ""whoa"" moments. Instead, I was happily surprised with Keanu's performance, I had to grimace every now and then at his lines but overall Keanu is not what makes this film go sour. I think there can be something said about a film which uses more than necessary swear words. Writers will add them in thinking that they'll sprinkle up a sentence just right whereas they're killing the script. On the other hand I found Constantine a little intriguing the idea that the devil and god were fighting each other only 'influencing humans.' Another thing they did true to Constantine's original story idea is they have Keanu right from the start dying of cancer. How many heroes start out with such a handicap? Perfect for a blockbuster rental, whether or not to buy this is up to you.~Chris",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constantine: 7/10,"Did you see Exorcist: The Beginning? Neither did most people, but I found it to be a creepy drama with great acting and terrible direction. Francis Lawrence's Constantine is the opposite: there's terrible acting and good direction. Both are similar to each other in plots: they're both supernatural thrillers about demon-fighters. They both also star actors who are pretty cool, and both movies are pretty creepy. That's why I liked both about the same.John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) tried to kill himself when he was younger and was literally seconds away from death and going to Hell. As an adult, he wants to get into heaven, and tries to do that by sending as many demons back to Hell as possible. He meets Angela (Rachel Weisz), whose twin sister committed suicide, and Constantine has to go and figure out what happened. Things get hairier, and there's Pruitt Taylor Vince. Need I say more? Constantine had a budget of about $100 million, and it shows. There's a lot of great images here, and about half the budget obviously went to Venetian blinds. The movie looked great, mainly thanks to Lawrence, who debuted with this movie. The opening scene, in particular, sticks with me. It's a typical scene that seems to be in all heaven/Hell dramas (an exorcism), but Lawrence's spin on it is truly unique, and makes it quite exciting. The movie is enthralling through its typical runtime (any comedy is 90 minutes and any drama/thriller is 120 minutes, no questions asked), and oftentimes quite exciting.No one will doubt that Keanu Reeves was amazing in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. However, ever since that, everyone's realized that he can't really act. Stellan Skarsgaard in Exorcist was a lot better. Still, Reeves is pretty cool as Constantine, and you need to be a certain cool for this movie. He may not be the best actor, but he's cool nonetheless. Weisz does a pretty good job, too. Djimon Hounsou, the breakout star from that mediocre movie that everyone thought would win a bunch of Oscars but ended up flailing In America, shows up as a paranormal...guy...thing. His role's not really explained, but it's pretty cool (as is the guy's who lives in the back of the bowling alley). And Pruitt Taylor Vince.People will dismiss Constantine as just a simple February release, trying to ride the coattails of Exorcist: The Beginning or something like that. Don't believe them. Although hardly original, Constantine is an enthralling, entertaining two hour thrill ride. And there's Vince.My rating: 7/10 Rated R for violence and demonic images.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Not breath taking, but entertaining, especially if you haven't read the comics","I can't understand all those one and two star ratings.

I won't go into details, if you have nothing to do in the evening, rent this movie and enjoy it. It is undoubtedly better than Blade, in my opinion better than Hellboy and as entertaining as Nightwatch.P.S.: Hollywood sucks at one thing - endings.

My review of Constantine,"I thought this was a fantastic movie. Unlike so many, the film wasn't just about the action sequences, which in themselves were very well done, but about the characters journeys. Keanu Reeves was surprisingly good, I like him as an actor but this film really made me realize how talented he is. Rachel Weisz gives a great performance. I did feel however that the character of Chas, played by Shia LaBeouf, could have been better explained. He sometimes seemed a bit out of place. I know it's different to the comic book creation in that it has been moved to LA and changed the appearance of Constantine himself but I feel that the essence of who he is and why he does what he does is kept intact. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good thriller with a little bit extra. Go see!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

It worth watching,"I think this movie is not too bad.In fact, it is an anti-smoking movie.Once Constantine appears,a cigarette will be smoked.As he said:""I used to smoke 30 cigarettes per day when I was 15 years old].So,in this movie, there is a lot of scenes that reflect the harm of smoking.For example,Constantine usually vomits blood and cough.After he had tested his gun,a poster appeared.It written:""Smoking is harmful,never try it!"".In the last scene,He ate chewing gum instead of smoking.If this is the theme of Constantine,it is really success and effective.How about the characters?Keanu Reeves is the perfect actor for John Constantine.In my opinion,He should be a depressed,elusive,sober and powerful hero.Keanu Reeves did it.His wonderful,humorous performances make Constantine to become a marvelous character who impressed audience the most.However,I don't like how he treated his friends.It leads to an anti-logy with his nature.Well,he wants to escape the world,he thinks nobody understands him,but why didn't he treat his friends better?Why did his friends help him but not leave him?I don't think I could do that if I was Constantine's friend.Rachel Weisz is suitable for this character--Angela Dodson.However,Her character show disadvantage of this movie:It just focuses on one character--Constantine.There are few good scenes for her to perform,too sad.So,some people said that COnstantine is really failed.IF the director saw this problem,it might be better.How about the theology using in Constantine?I think it is the most attraction for me to see Constantine.Hell with fire,Heaven with clouds and world with lamps.Demons and angels are colorful.A few scenes sacred me a lot.The sounds bumped out suddenly and made you horrible.All in all,it is OK but still need to be improved.The story itself is not bad,but I think it is too short.Some parts I still cannot understand after it finished.I have heard that the movie comes from a comic book Hellblazer and written by Kevin Brodbin.So it might be cut before.The climax is too long and seems no more interest.The other parts could not set off the climax.However,I love it because of the humor in Constantine.P.S: Sorry for my poor English and hope all you wouldn't mind~",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Not as bad as I would have thought,"I saw a sneak preview last night. And I was pleasantly surprised, in that the film was not awful as I was afraid it would be. Bear in mind, I am a huge fan of the comic books, so I was feeling pretty uncharitable towards this one as soon as I hear that John Constantine would be American and played by Keanu Reeves. But surprisingly, he does an...okay job. He's not the unrepentant bastard that the comic book character is. But I wouldn't have expected that take from Hollywood. He does an interesting interpretation of the comic book character, a watered-down version to be sure: but still entertaining. He had a couple of good lines here and there, and used some cool little 'magical' spells to do his thing in the movie. Tho the cross-shaped magic shotgun was sort of dumb. So take it from a semi-hardcore Hellblazer comic geek: this wasn't all that bad. I freely admit that my opinion is tainted by the fact that I saw it free of charge.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Holds as much weight as a communion wafer.,Lightweight horror yarn that is more fluff than substance. Keanu Reeves was not the right man to pull this role off and the decision to cast him was huge disservice to the entire movie because he just does not cut it in the role. He makes an effort but he just not a strong enough actor to pull of the role and the script he's working with does not cut it as well because its badly written in certain scenes and does not hold itself well once you look closely at it. The visual effects are below par with some of the movie that has come out recently and the musical score is not well done. Rachel Weisz does in fact give the best performance out of the entire film and that's manly because she gives more to her role than the story itself does and a special nod also goes to Peter Stormare who's only in the last few minutes of the film but manages to give a good performance with the little he has.,2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constantine was a surprise,"I had heard about this movie, but really was waiting to see it on DVD. I went with a friend last night and was really surprised to see that it had a decent story and the effects were pretty cool. Not too overwhelming, but just enough to make its point. I thought Balthazar was HOT!. I read some of the comments and it still amuses me to this day how most people in this society are so needy to have a stereotypical image of what Gabriel, or God or devils or demons look like. It's so lame that it's hilarious. Yes, Lucifer was supposed to be a BEAUTY, but the producer thought Peter Storare (sp) was the best to depict Satan. The beauty behind this is that if I am putting up millions of dollars to make a movie, I will make the characters look how I want them to look, not just because mullein of church teachings, say that the Devil has a red face and horns. Give me a break people. This is the 21st century. This movie is worth watching twice, because I really trying to keep up for a while in the movie, understanding what was happening. It seems that it has a little of the Dogma movie rolled into it, the way Gabriel is punished for his/her transgression.My point is this, enjoy movies because of their creativity, its insight and its originality. If you go to a movie, expecting something to appear that way you have formed in your little minds, you should save 10 bucks and stay home. That is why I love movies, the enjoy the brilliance of those that create them. If we were all such experts on the damn things, we would be making them ourselves.Constantine is a good movie. Go see it, if you don't like it.. you have no originality, imagination or fantasy.CaryRa California",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good for what it was,"Keanu Reeves gets a lot of slack from reviewers and also from the public about the rolls he takes. They say that he is always playing the character who ""knows nothing, and only finds information out as the movie progresses"", but in this movie he is the character who contains most of the knowledge, and leads the way throughout the movie. He is going to get a lot of shots taken at him for this movie, but i thought he did a great job as Constantine, and was also the perfect person for the role. As the movie was based off of a comic i don't see what else people could expect. Critics seem upset for some reason, but Keanu played a great ""super hero"" (for lack of a better term for main characters in comics), and the screenplay couldn't have gotten any better... Its not going to win an Oscar, but for those of you who like science fiction, enjoy fantasy, and have an open mind i think this movie will fit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"""CONSTANTINE"", a spiritually demonic Noir film","After seeing 3 commercials for it during the superbowl and various versions of the trailer in the theatre I just thought this was a lame action packed capitalization on Keanu's action star status.Boy was I wrong.After familiarizing myself with the comic a bit before seeing the film, my hopes for the overall tone of the film were set. I knew what it should have been and what it shouldn't have been.Constantine I would describe as a Biblical Apocalyptic Demonic Noir Film. There's very little ""action"" in the film, and when there is action it's very necessary and not at all gratuitous. Keanu surprisingly has the right look for the part and does a good job of avoiding those Ted Theodore Logan mannerisms we all recognize. His performance is stoic, disturbed, straight and well executed.My only miff about the film is that the pacing towards the end is so slow and dragged out that the whole climactic feeling and rush that we should have in such scenes is sucked out of us. Peter Stormare is brilliant as Satan, Gavin Rossdale is surprising good as the demon Baltazar and that one chick from The Mummy although speaking with a strangely low voice does a worthy job.Lawrence's direction was well done, with some influence we can see from our man Terry Gilliam. But every shot is interesting and that's what I look for in a good director.Overall, I recommend this film, just be wary that it was influenced by a DC Comic and is ALL FANTASY! I believe Neil Gaiman even contributed to one of the comics in the past, so many of us may be interested in this subject. I only hope that a film like this can open some doors for Good Omens to be made.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
'End of the World' movie with a different twist!,"Given the fact that I haven't ever read the comic book, or even knew of the comic book, watching this movie, I found it to be very good and with an excellent script and cast. I didn't get 'lost' because I didn't know how the comic book goes - or anything of the sort. The script goes through a story which is easy to follow and understand. I can understand being upset at a bad following of a comic book, ( for example what happened with the 'X-Men' movies I believe were horrible movie attempts in relation to the comics ), so I can relate and understand viewer's comments to that fact. Still, looking at this movie from a point of view as 'the only thing I have ever seen about this, it's characters, and story,' I thought it was very well done.The movie is a sort of 'end of the world' ( or the beginning of the end ), where demons from Hell are trying to enter this plane of existence and rule on earth. Being the point that they cannot enter this plane, we are presented with 'half-breeds,' half demons/humans, and half angel/humans, whom can enter, and though they cannot directly interfere with humans, can influence us to make the wrong, or right choices. The Devil's son, Mammon, wants to rule on earth, this plane, ( Hell on earth ), and the half breed angel 'Gabriel' is trying to help him to accomplish just that with the finding of 'The spear of Destiny.' ( I did find it 'strange' that both the movies from 'The Prophecy' and this one use Gabriel ).Constantine is a great seer, whom after treated as insane as a youth, which eventually leads him to suicide, grows up to be a master exorcist and knows all related with the Bible and Occult in his battle, and keeping of, the balance between both good and evil - Whilst trying to do these things hoping to 'buy his way back into Heaven' for the life he took - his own, and evade his sentence to Hell.Twists and great graphics make this movie a must see. ( Though some people thought it was lame, or that the comic book is better, give it a chance - it may surprise you ). The title represents what this movie is about, 'John Constantine', his life, and what he goes through to the movies present time and situation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Very well done for other actors as well, but I especially enjoyed Keannu and Rachel :) So please watch this movie and give your best votes for it, cause I think nothing like it was in the cinemas!

Surprisingly Watchable,"I didn't want to see this movie. I really, really didn't. But I wanted to be a good girlfriend, so I let my boyfriend drag me into it with promises he'd make it up to me. Maybe my complete and utter lack of expectations skewed my opinion a bit, but I actually found that the movie wasn't that bad. Keanu Reeves was able to use his signature ""understatedness"" (or lack of talent, whatever) to his best advantage. He's best in roles where he can act completely spaced out, confused, or determined. This one lets him do all of the above at various intervals. Rachel Weisz was also good as a set of twins. She was simultaneously tragic and determined as both of them. The sets were all well created and the story wasn't anywhere near as bad as the previews make it look. It's about on par with Hellboy, maybe a little bit better and definitely more brooding. This is a Dark Horse comic movie. They tend to be darker and more brooding than the chronically angsty Marvel and less heroic than either Marvel or DC, but if you like that sort of thing you'll enjoy this.

Supernatural Thriller,"Be careful about believing the first review. It contains an opinion that you might not agree with if you see the movie yourself. First off, if you liked Blade, VanHelsing or Hellboy, you're probably going to like this movie. It has the same kind of super-natural overtones and humor. Demons, angels and everything in-between. It's probably a bit pretentious with it's religious themes, but it's all in good fun. Keanu's performance is a bit dry, but it's the character that demands this. The other characters get developed enough to care about them too. They aren't just throw away extras or dead paperweights. Some of the characters from the Bible end up being pretty darned entertaining too. Definitely a rental, but a good matinée show too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
God awful,Horrible supernatural thriller that lacks any kind of intelligence to it. Keanu Reeves sinks up the screen in probably his worse performance since The Watcher. The special effects were bad and the script is an insult to some of the good actors who are in the movie. Rachel Weisz literally hold the film together by herself with a performance that this movie clearly did not deserve and Djmon Hounsou does more with his role than Keanu himself and he's not in the movie very much. The rest of the cast is marginal at best but it's more the fault of the script and the director then they are.Wait for video.,1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Why this movie condemned itself to hell,"Okay, so here's my typically film-student critique of this movie. I'm not going to just bash it without giving good examples and saying what I would've done to change it if only I'd written the damned screenplay.Problem # 1: Tone. It's a movie about Heaven and Hell and demons on earth and the apocalypse. A good director and writer could've really done this movie justice by making it darker, excluding the cute, witty one liners and quirks and going for the R-rated brutality of its theme. I don't totally blame the director for this: there were some interesting moments I give him credit for and some great mise-en-scene choices (devil in a white suit--classic); a little too much CGI for my taste and not enough left to the imagination, but I think he did his best, to no avail. My point is, a perfectly good excuse to use the darker, more serious tone that would've suited this concept was squandered, and my two hours were bruised because of it.Problem #2 (a more obvious problem): wasted time on too many characters and repeated actions. This movie could've saved precious time by combining characters--thereby allowing us to understand and get to know them better--and by not having 25 trips to hell and 7 exorcisms (don't say ""Nuh uh""--I'm exaggerating). Here's what I mean by combining characters: the priest, the bowling alley guy and the annoying sidekick all could've been made into one character, the ""sidekick/researcher"" character who does all the things these three do for the plot without weighing it down with three separate characters. Also, Balthazar and Gabriel could've been combined to form a singular ""tangible threat"" character; Gabriel could've easily done all the things Balthazar did without having to splinter into two separate characters. Why wasn't this done to prevent the chaos of too many meaningless flat characters with five-minute parts and deaths that came before you could even give a crap about them? Because of Problem # 3...Which is this: Constantine shouldn't have been an adaptation of the comic. It should've been based on the comic. What's the difference? It's the difference between O Brother Where Art Thou (a film based on Homer's Odyssey) and Troy (a poor adaptation of Homer's Iliad). A film based on a book or comic has more creative freedom to know which characters or events do or don't work for the film, to make changes, to deviate. The screenwriter made the mistake of thinking he had to adapt this comic to film, and thereby assuming that this meant he had to squeeze an entire comic book series and all its coolest characters into a 2-hour frame, necessity and plot be damned.That said, I'm not totally mad at this movie. Keanu gave one of his biggest efforts at acting ever (some will snort that that isn't saying much). Plus, every time I see Djimon Honsou smile I have this Pavlovian response that makes me say ""I like him"". And Peter Stormare made the most original devil I've seen in a while, with his wonderfully creepy mannerisms and discomfiting presence (funny thing: the first time I saw him in Fargo in a scene after he kills a cop, I said ""That man is the devil--in a real good way""). So to wrap it up, here's my solution: some writers need a license to adapt comic books. Then maybe we'd have more Sin City's and Crow's and less Constantine's.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
I loved the action,"This is one of my favorite action horror films, after getting use to seeing Keanu Reeves as Neo in The Matrix I never expected to see him pull off another character that I would love. The thing i seem to like about this movie is how Keanu Reeves manages to keep his demeanour on the sad, weird don't care attitude all throughout the movie, the world coming to an end didn't even seem to move him, his selfish ambition to make heaven by all cause pushed him off the edge of sane behaviour to a point where you start to wonder if this guy is real.The film is based on a comic book character and the screenplay was done by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Capello, taking stories from the Hellblazer comic book, and the main plot elements were taken from the ""Dangerous Habits"" story arc and the ""Original Sins"" trade paperback.John Constantine is a character created by popular comic book writer/creator Alan Moore; the character was given his own comic book title, Hellblazer in 1988 and it was published by DC Comics under its Vertigo Comics imprint.John Constantine is a man with the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons in their true form. After an attempted suicide gone wrong John's soul is eternal damned to go to hell. Constantine then goes on an exorcism rampage sending demons back to Hell so as to win enough favour to get to heaven.His quest led him to meet a troubled police detective, whose sister just committed suicide; while they work together to unravel the truth behind it, the stumble upon a plot for world destruction.Similarities and differences can be found in the portrayal of the character, from his appearance to the reason of his damnation. John Constantine is British in the comic book, other than the American as he is portrayed in the film. His reason for damnation was also changed in the film, his ability to see half breeds for who they really are (which is not an ability he posses in the comic book) was the reason he tried to kill himself leading to his damnation. In the comic book the reason for his damnation was his involvement in the summoning of a demon that killed a young girl.Received with mixed reviews, Constantine is not one that many will like, but there is something about the after taste this movie gives you, the idea that an ongoing action packed battle is going on here on earth for the winning of souls, was fun to think of.The movie does have some inconsistency that looks too large that the makers actually missed it, they made God look a little weak, like things were going on and he just let it, also the devil being taken unawares by a coup, all this made it look like God and the Devil don't have a hold on their minions.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Holy-Moly, This movie was Righteous!","After hearing all of the negativity of this movie, I failed to see it while it was in the Theaters. However, lately I've been able to get an early copy of the Constantine DVD and I have been pleasantly surprised.I've heard terrible comments ranging from Keanu's acting, the CGI, the story, and plot. Yet, when watching the movie, I can't seem to draw the connection. I understand Reeve's isn't the GREATEST actor in the world, but I thought he fit role very well. The CGI was awesome on my DVD; I fail to see the problems some people may have had. And when it comes to the plot, sure it may have been a little confusing, but the Matrix's plot was confusing as well! After I figured it out, I thought to my self, ""Wow, cool story"".I don't understand what's up with all of the bashing. I'm a REALLY tough critic as well... I hated the F4 and RotS.

"Demons, Grief, and Redemption: Constantine","This movie follows John Constantine, an exorcist and demon hunter, as he teams up with Detective Angela to unravel the mystery surrounding her twin sister's suicide, all while battling demons attempting to enter the world.The film has a promising storyline suited for the horror/fantasy genre. The characters are well established, with depth and development throughout the story. John is trying to do good deeds in hopes of entering heaven after being diagnosed with lung cancer, while Angela grapples with the trauma of shootouts during her duty-both additions that enrich their character arcs beyond the main plot. The exploration of the fantasy world, the methods of exorcism, the journey to hell, the half-breeds, and the psychic chair are all cleverly integrated into the narrative.As they investigate the twin sister's suicide, the discoveries they make are decent, though not particularly mind-blowing or unexpected. The relationship between John and Angela begins on a strained note, with Angela developing feelings for him. While this aspect is fine, John's consistent rejection of her advances becomes repetitive, making it unnecessary for their storyline to cling to this dynamic for too long-I don't expect them to get along throughout the film. The climax is satisfactory, as John completes his character arc and earns a second chance, while Angela manages to guide her sister from hell to heaven, resulting in a good ending.Keanu Reeves delivers a strong performance as Constantine, and Rachel Weisz effectively portrays her character as she navigates a range of emotions. Other actors also perform decently. However, the writing could have been improved at several points. The cinematography and composition are commendable, and the visual effects are impressive for the time the movie was made. The music is good but minimal.In conclusion, this movie was a decent watch for me. I would recommend it if you're looking to pass the time.

A mockery of a great comic book.,"Bad adaptation to the great comic book called Hellblazer has probably the worst actor imaginable playing the title role. Keanu Reeves is with out a shadow of a doubt miscast in the title role and makes a fool out of himself and almost everyone in the movie. The script is an incoherent mess and the direction from first time director Frances Lawrence is lackluster to say the least. Of all the actors involved, Only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou are able to give their best to their underwritten characters. Weisz gives a strong and determine performance and Hounsou does more with a throwaway role than Keanu does as the lead. The rest of the actors involved are almost as bad as Reeves himself with Shia LaBeouf being as annoying as ever and Peter Stormare over doing it as the prince of darkness.Say what you may about the Blade films but at least the first two Blade movies had a script that at least entertain you for a good solid two hours while this film will have you looking at your watch after the first 45 minutes. IF you like to see bad movies then be my guess, if not avoid.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Success, total success.","Keanu Reeves fights demons, in a movie with Shia LaBeouf, that sounds terrible. But this movie is a fine contrast of terrible, Reeves does the melancholy jackass type with perfection, his inability to show emotion does him favor as John Constantine has the same trouble. The theology of the movie is perfectly done and everything is adequately explained, even though at some points the theology is read in dialog form and it doesn't work to entertain enough. The performances and the casting are done with great excellence, my only two problems in that department were Rachel Weisz's reading lines of her background story and Djimon Hounsou's accent changes, the first couple of lines he had were in cockney and I was excited as hell to hear that, but it faded to American English then back to the creole accent. The story unfolds beautifully with twists and turns I didn't expect, and the direction is spectacular. The scene in midnight's club with the half-breeds and the perfect circle song playing was a cool element, and anytime Balthazar(Gavin Rossedale) was on scene there was a burst of awesomeness in the style of the legendary movie bad-asses. But the Prize of the entire movie is the scene between Satan and John Constantine, Peter Stormare brings in a devlish form of the timeless carachter never seen before. Every time you look at him you get the feeling he's about to burst from his skin, he has an unusual eccentricity that is almost sick, it's totally deranged, almost a Kubric like monster. And any scene that an angel was shown, there was a lightening and outstanding presence on screen, most notably was Tilda Swinton's Gabriel, she played it spectacularly, the angel knows no feeling or emotion but she made a feeling of attraction to Constantine that was delightful, as small a screen presence as she had, it radiated throughout the movie. Shia LaBoeuf's carachter hadn't much use but a failed comic-relief and was lost throughout the movie. Pruitt Taylor Vince was perfectly cast as alcoholic father Hennesy, a psychic priest, his creepy, one of a kind eye movement utilized in Identity served amazingly in this one. All in all I loved this movie, I've always loved theology and history and this was a great touch to that sweet tooth, it's with defiance worth seeing more than once.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Dangerous Habits,"Chain-smoking ""Hellblazer"" John Constantine goes from DC Comics' ""Vertigo"" (aimed at ""adult"" readers) to the movies for actor Keanu Reeves. They called it/him ""Constantine"" and hoped Mr. Reeves would help the film survive the ill-advised title change. The resulting story is nicely directed, imaginatively edited, and stylishly photographed - by Francis Lawrence, Wayne Wahrman, and Philippe Rousselot - but, the dynamic trio aren't able deliver the original, much more intriguing Liverpudlian. The plot starts out fine, but becomes somewhat overloaded and confusing during the running time.The film was based (very loosely!) on Garth Ennis' first ""Hellblazer"" story - entitled ""Dangerous Habits"" and running through issues #41-46 (May-October, 1991) of the comic. It should be available as a separate ""graphic novel"" in your local disappearing comic shop - or online, if the store is already gone. The story dealt with Constantine's deadly lung cancer diagnosis. With some changes, best pal Chas Chandler/Kramer (Shia LaBeouf) is included, but you have to wait until after the credits for his full story.

Underrated Comic Boom Adaptation,"The first time I even knew about the character of John Constantine was on the CW show Arrow. He was different and I found him interesting that I began to do more research on his comics and found this film. I had no idea Keanu played this role and it was a pleasant surprise. He was a darker and grittier character than on CW and I loved it all more for that. The lore was interesting and had a different take on all of it with the story of Gabriel and The Devil - which by the way I loved the way the actor portrayed the Devil, making him almost likeable. Whenever I hear about comic book films, I never hear this one mentioned which is strange because it is quite good. This is a top five Keanu Reeves film for me!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"Keanu Reeves as a sort of super exorcist, still it's a fun to watch movie.","My first though when I started to see this movie was; this is some kind of exorcist film. Not quite wrong, but I would call it a super exorcist. A dilemma similar to the whole movie from 1974 called ""the exorcist"" was here solved in about 10 minutes and then Keanu Reeves goes of to kill demons, monsters, visit hell and fight angels. Obviously this movie has a lot of Catholic, religious and occult stories mixed together. But it is a fun fantasy movie with an obvious horror film feel to it.Keanu Reeves as John Constantine, has by many critics been called his worst performance, I fail to see why. It's not his best, but I felt he created a very cool and enigmatic character. Rachel Weisz as Angela Dodson was just plain good. Shia LaBeouf as Chas Kramer was a good character, which sadly was forgotten in about half the movie and never got the chance to evolve. They should have involved him more into the film or just ditched the whole character. Tilda Swinton as Gabriel and Peter Stormare as Satan is just great.The effects like most movies today, are great. What can I say, it's a lot of high budget CGI that creates some really cool demons and monsters.I give this movie a 6/10. Half original idea, good acting, but moved a little slow. Still fun to watch if you like religious based horror films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
One of my favourite supernatural movie,"I know it is not comic accurate but this movie is fun and keanu really got the constantine personality just right.He is an asshole but he is likeable.All the occult is fun. You feel that Keanu is not overpowered and the whole magic, angel and devil are just super fun.Probably best as standalone constantine movie or for someone who dont know anything about the comic book (like me). I do prefer this movie than the dc series.Sure the dc series got the look right, but personality and plot wise doesnt fit well to me like this movie.Plus Tilda Swinston is amazing in this movie. Lucifer is also a delight to look at.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Father Wick??,"A cool performance by Keanu, he's always cool. Has some great moments visually and some smart imagery throughout. Solid action and creative battles with the supernatural, evil is represented in full force with this one. Does not focus on being scary at all, watch without worry of that. This is an action packed battle thriller! 
Labeouf is great, Keanu is an action hero, and Constantine is a supernatural vigilante- nice!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Weisz and Hounsou are great but the movie is horrible,"Extremely dumb adaptation of the horror comic book lacks the horror and the intelligence and makes a terrible film that has no sense what so ever. Keanu Reeves is miscast as John Constantine and makes the character into a dumb action hero who would have been put down and made fun of by his comic book counter part. Only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou give good performances and that's because they both knew what to bring to the table, while Keanu forgets that you need to believe in the main character in order for the movie to really fly. The script's dialog is horrible and some of the scenes are just too dark to notice what is going on from time to time. The script also lacks a certain amount of believability and certain parts make no sense what so ever.If you want to see this, see it for the game performances of Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou, which does respect the audience, unlike the movie which does not. If not, wait for DVD.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Awesome Effects Keep Constantine From Going To...Well...Hell....,"Keanu Reeves is the coolest looking guy around. Take for example in his newest film, Constantine, where Keanu Reeves plays the title character John Constantine, a chain smoker, dying of lung cancer, and is one of the few who can see the demons and angels that walk the earth. He walks with an internal brooding, for he is a man who committed the ultimate of sins as a a young man, and has spent his whole life since trying to redeem himself in God's eyes.Jon Constantine is one of the most interesting comic book characters I have seen in some time, The Character has a complex and troubled past, and does good deeds only so he can somehow buy his way into heaven. Now Keanu Reeves may look the part of John Constantine, but he most definitely can't act the part. Any scene where he is simply walking around, he's wonderful. Pick ANY scene where he actually has to talk, well, that's a different story.The one character that I just found to be annoying as heck would be Shia LaBleof, who basically plays and even DRESSES as the exact same character he plays in I, Robot. Here, Shia acts as Constantine's private taxi driver and wanna be apprentice. He's your stereotypical wise guy, given the funny lines, and always left behind till the final act where he proves himself. the movie would have been better without him.What really saves this movie from total disaster is the awesome visual effects that are used. There are genuine creepy moments in this film, such ads the demons themselves, or the hell that Constantine enters several times throughout the movie. the world Constantine lives in is utterly cool, dark, neutral. You have to be tough to live in a place such as this (here, LA). The plot comes off as somewhat trite, in that it never fully grabs your attention and en cloaks you in its story. there's no plot holes, per say, but there is a definite lack of meaning behind what happens to these characters and how the viewer only observes them but can't really relate.Constantine is a total guy movie, boasting a cool character, and placing him in a world full of danger and action. The movie is mostly that, with an ending that takes its sweet time concluding and a hot chick (Rachel Weisz) who for most of the movie wears wet, low cut shirts. Can I recommend it? Sure, but I'll be the first to say, it has got plenty of faults.MJR",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Not for comic fans?,"I found this to be solid entertainment in spite of other criticisms that it didn't follow original comic book plots. I don't care.

"Constantine, A Heroic Journey","Most of the viewers of this film, like myself, will come to Constantine having never seen the comic, Hellblazer, which it is is based upon. Be assured this film stands on it's own; in fact, viewers are probably better off not to have read the comic and to encounter Constantine without expectations. Also, beware of the usual critics: Don't go hoping to see The Matrix or The Exorcist. One could say this movie is like ""Dogma"" with less comedy and more eye candy, reminiscent of The Prophecy but darker and cleaner, or like Blade with demons instead of vampires. But it's more than any of these, and rises above the sum of its parts. One could most accurately say Constantine is like no other movie. You may expect a hero's spiritual journey, strikingly interpreted through an action/religious/horror medium.The leading character, John Constantine, a lay exorcist haunted from childhood by half-demons only he can see, is tough and self-interested, exceedingly churlish, hopelessly ill but not to be pitied, a lost soul who, while not particularly noble at the beginning of the film nevertheless grows even as he loses hope. Constantine rides from one gruesome scene to another in a yellow cab driven by his slave/apprentice, a wannabe exorcist named Chazz, played by Shia LaBeouf, who adds a necessary touch of brightness and innocence. Constantine makes a rather self-interested decision to help Angela, an LA cop who wants to know what really became of her dead sister, who leapt from the roof of the Catholic insane asylum she was housed in. A suicide, she cannot be buried in sacred ground. Angela--and only John Constantine knows there's much more to Angela than we know, and he's not telling--believes her sister did not really jump. The exquisite sexual tension between these two main characters, Constantine and Angela, is enough; to clutter this film with bedroom scenes would have been a mistake. Rachel Weisz is wonderful in this role; actually, the entire main cast is top notch.The charismatic Keanu captures the essence of the saturnine John Constantine; he is a terrific actor, and you'll appreciate the frequent close-ups which reveal every facial twitch, throat palpitation, bleak curl of lip and bead of sweat. Pruitt Taylor Vince is wonderful as a drunken priest, friend, and helper of Constantine. I was captivated by the scene that runs from morgue to liquor store, carried completely by Vince. If you like him in Constantine, be sure to catch him in ""Trapped,"" a suspense sleeper with another all-star cast. Tilda Swinton was strong and stately in her small but key role as the asexual Gabriel, and Peter Stormare should win top honors as the most original Satan in the history of cinema. You don't know whether to laugh at him for being so pitiful or shiver in disgust at his evil, which brings us to the black comedic elements. This film is really not funny, and I'm glad because that would spoil the intense mood, but what comedy there is for the most part so black as to be nearly unrecognizable; some viewers won't get it.The director, Francis Lawrence, honed his skills in the field of music videos. That doesn't mean this film is anything like a music video, the score is varied and subtle, used to add ambiance to a scene rather than the other way around; but Lawrence seemed to have applied the simplicity necessary in music videos to the screenplay. The cinematography is clean but not lean, with many close ups that make it more immediate; each scene a work of art. There is no more dialog than necessary, leaving the story to be told mainly by well-paced action. Often a film running more than 2 hours can bog down, but not this one; in fact, even with it's 135 or so minutes it is one of those films that seems to end too quickly; I wanted it to go on and on.The theology plays some known themes alongside new ones: concepts of hell, of balance, human purpose in spite of itself, and redemption are presented freshly, and in some cases blasphemously, with one surprise after another. As an open-minded Christian, I had no problem with it.The sets are incredible, and their juxtaposition ingenious. You get scenes from of a nuclear-style hell in all it's hideous glory paired with some of the noir elements--the LA apartments of the main characters--as well as the bright but sterile sets of the Catholic hospital and back rooms of a shopping center, where much of the action takes place Then there's the red-hazed strangeness of an underground bar cliented by half-angels and half-demons, juxtaposed with more noir--rainy night street scenes in downtown LA. And then there's a secret set, background to a brief scene that you'll miss if you don't stay through the end of the credits. When I saw the movie, almost everyone left during the credits except someone sitting up in the lofts and myself--we were the only ones to taste the final treat!Within the main action are many vignettes, adding spice--watch for the half-angel blowing on water glasses, watch for what minor characters do in the background, making this the kind of film that is always fun to see again to catch something unnoticed in an initial viewing. While the dialog is lean, there are some good lines; my favorite is one of said by Constantine: ""That's pain; get used to it.""The R rating is for scenes that will definitely frighten children, and blasphemy that might concern some religious folks. There is violence, but it's not sickening. It's the intensity of what is there that makes it unsuitable for the young and impressionable.Do see Constantine and enjoy. This film is sure to become a classic in its genre. Putting it in a genre would require a whole new article.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
silly but better than some,"John Constantine is a chain-smoking exorcist with only a few months left to live. Although he knows that he is already destined to spend eternity in hell for a mortal sin he committed in the past, John is still attempting to find redemption by dedicating himself to battling the demonic forces that exist just beneath the surface of our known reality and which have lately been making a greater effort to cross over from their world to ours.I imagine that the Catholic Church must be rather pleased with this film, especially considering the black eye it suffered at the hands of Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code."" Here the incantations and paraphernalia of the Roman church have a great deal of efficacy in keeping the demonic forces Constantine encounters subdued and at bay.Strictly as a movie and not as a theological document, ""Constantine"" is a slightly better-than-average demonic thriller that goes back and forth between the world of humans and the shadowy netherworld inhabited by angels and demons and even a few creatures that fall somewhere in between. In a role not all that far removed from the one he played in the ""Matrix"" movies, Keanu Reeves once again functions as the flawed Everyman hero whose job it is to save humanity from a fate worse than, in this case, eternal death. We're more willing to accept the silliness of the premise knowing we have Reeves to guide us along the movie's path. The special effects are impressive for the most part, with special credit going to the art designers for their imaginative view of hell (which looks much like a city after it's been destroyed by a nuclear explosion). The film is, admittedly, too long and the nonsense quotient begins to run dangerously high long about the last half hour. But ""Constantine"" is, overall, sufficiently imaginative to keep us interested for most of its duration.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"A fun, thought-provoking ride","The comments provided here on Constantine demonstrate why IMDb, and similar websites that post messages without editorial filters, are losing any real usefulness. Although this movie was receiving favorable ratings, the initial comments were quite negative. This makes no sense, except as a posting board for irresponsible adolescents (of all ages).Constantine is a very well made movie, with an engaging story, strong acting, and excellent special effects. Strongly negative comments about the movie are nonsensical: some viewers will be unhappy with the strong horror elements (the movie plays early on with the Exorcist theme), and others may be dismayed with some of the religious portrayals (e.g., the angel Gabriel, especially in her first scene). But there is nothing about this movie that deserves strongly negative comments. For those few that read the comic book and have commented here in that regard, get a life; no one else cares about those comparisons!The movie opens with a very well done, if somewhat short, exorcism scene; scary enough to keep my wife, and those like her, away. Keanu Reeves does an excellent job playing Constantine, who can observe demons and angels on earth. A big part of the storyline has to do with how Constantine can ""earn"" his way into heaven. He is cynical about the religious perspectives on heaven and hell, but has serious pressure put on him to overcome his cynicism, and figure out how to escape immortal damnation. Adding to his angst is the fact that he knows heaven and hell exist; he has visited hell on more than one occasion, and one of the many excellent scenes in the movie is when we first go with him to view this movie's vision of hell.The casting of the movie is absolutely top-rate. The angel Gabriel is extremely engagingly done by Tilda Swinton, a classic beauty that is somewhat androgynous in appearance, but whose voice is all female. This combination, along with some very abrupt and surprising dialog provide as memorable a character as I've seen on screen in a long time.Peter Stormare's portrayal as Satan provides another very, very memorable character; two big reasons this movie deserves serious attention. Stormare's characterization of Satan is absolutely surprising, but at the same time very believable. Gabriel and Satan are both given subtle costuming and makeup that strongly assists in their unusual and memorable performances.These two characters, so strongly deeply embedded in our society, will provoke very mixed reactions across the audience, and many of you will not be as awe-struck as I was with Swinton and Stormare's performances. But I do believe that all of you will agree that the portrayals are engaging, surprising, and very well directed.Rachel Weisz also is extremely good in the lead female role. She is a police officer that has to investigate the apparent suicide of her twin sister, leading her to asking for assistance from Constantine. The story provides significant tension and moral questioning for her character.The movie, in my opinion, is most interesting in how it takes all the elements of well-made modern movies (excellent special effects, plays on classic movie scenes, crisp action, and strong storyline), combines these with the fun of a seemingly (at first) comic-book-level storyline and extremely unusual takes on religion (especially with the first meeting between Constantine and Gabriel), and ties these together at the end of the movie into a truly unusual, engaging and memorable finish.The end of the movie makes some important statements that I believe any open-minded Christian would be engaged and interested in. But it does this in a way that allows non-Christians (such as myself) to be equally as engaged and thought-provoked. This is a movie I'll see again (soon), and be thinking about and talking over with friends and family for a long time. It isn't that the movie is truly important in a religious sense, but rather that it is so entertaining, and presented in such an unusual and engaging way. Movies like this can be thought-provoking and engaging at many levels.I give this movie 10 stars, as all elements of it are extremely well done, and very entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Fun with demons,"I know that a lot of fans of the comics were disappointed by this movie, because it didn't adapt the characters well. However, as someone who doesn't really know the source material, I found it very entertaining.

The script was sometimes a bit exposition-heavy and sometimes a bit confusing, going from one thing to another, but globally it told an engaging story that wasn't filled with clichés and even had a satisfying ending. As entertainment (it's not supposed to be a movie that makes you think), it does a great job of bringing you into its world and forget about anything else for the duration of the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Rachel Weisz is good but don't expect a good movie to follow her performance.,Lackluster horror yarn that has Keanu Reeves battling the devil for control over the earth. The script is just flat out bad with dialog that fifth grades would sneer at. The main character is a bore and most of the supporting cast are wasted in a matrix like film that goes for the gusto in ripping off that franchise. The special effects are not impressive and the direction is lap sided at best. Rachel Weisz on the other side gives a great and haunting performance that the film does not capitalize on and that where the major crime happens because her performance is better than the movie itself.

Too much info is revealed, or not enough. Sometimes the story is rushed.

"""Constantine"" may not be the most faithful adaptation of the comics, but it has enough positive elements to keep us stuck with the narrative","Created by Alan Moore, in Swamp Thing, in 1985, John Constantine won his solo comic, Hellblazer, in 1988, also by the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics. In 2005, director Francis Lawrence, who years later would work on the great The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, took charge of the project to adapt these comics. Constantine and not Hellblazer the film was renamed, already denoting a possible distance from the original material. In fact, the film, in general, is not known for being a comic book adaptation, not only because of the greater obscurity of Vertigo, but also because of its completely different language than what we saw in the works of Marvel or DC.Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a kind of exorcist/demon hunter, who values the balance between Heaven and Hell on Earth. His task is to send back the creatures that upset this balance, whether through exorcism or old tricks involving holy water weapons and crucifixes. The narrative already puts us at a breaking point for the character: he is on the verge of death thanks to his addiction to cigarettes (which the film makes clear from the very first shots). In the midst of such trouble, the Devil's son seeks to gain passage to our plane through a medium Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz).Producer Lauren Shuler Donner managed to bring fidelity to the film. She, already known for great films like ""X-Men: The Movie"" and its sequel ""X-Men 2"", ""Free Willy"", ""Some Sunday"", focused on developing a decent script for ""Constantine"", with screenwriter Kevin Brodbin (""Mindhunters"") and Frank Cappello. This mixed salad made the film have an excellent script, and most importantly, make it very original. It is worth saying that some things have changed, such as, for example, Constantine lives in Liverpool, England. In the film, the character lives in California, United States. Some things like that happen too much in the movie. What about the comic book character being blonde? And English? It's details.The cut made for Constantine in the cinema is quite clear: he is shown on the big screen as an exorcist, which in fact is just one of the many facets of the magician. The choice of the script written by four hands by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello, however, does not go wrong in making the story leaner, more direct to the point. Whether intentional or not, this allowed him to very faithfully transpose one of John's main sagas in comics - Dangerous Habits, written by Garth Ennis. Going beyond that could leave the story confusing, too many loose ends and also extend the production too much. The result of these choices ensured that the film was more ""rounded"". And it's a fact that, if the composition of Keanu Reeves' Constantine doesn't create a faithful and complete copy of all the facets of the character in the comic book, at least they result in a coherent story and in a character that carries striking traits of the personality of the wizard created. By Alan Moore in The Swamp Thing Saga.The significant changes de-characterize the Constantine of cinema, especially since they seem to have been used to make the work more palatable to US audiences and to rebound on the success of The Matrix. It doesn't seem to me, however, that this diminishes the weight and value of the work, unfortunately undervalued and not always seen as a successful adaptation of the comics in a time before the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy (Batman Begins is also from 2005). But the qualities of Lawrence's debut feature (veteran music video director) are many. He knew how to recognize the main elements of the story and assess their impact. I can imagine how difficult it must have been to make the sets and create a world for the film. John Constantine's world is a dark and melancholy place. Visually, it's the classic definition of a film noir, with the urban night scenes, deep shadows, shards of light bulbs on wet asphalt and smoke all around; all recorded by oblique angles and expressionist lighting.Aided by a cool-toned photography by the experienced Philippe Rousselot (who often works with Tim Burton, as in ""Big Fish"" and the new ""Charlie and The Chocolate Factory"") and the inspired art direction - note the richness of detail in the sets, like a ceiling made up of bottles. The editing is also impeccable, leaving a progressive and harrowing rhythm. And the choice of the cast, apart from Reeves, is one of tremendous happiness (not forgetting that Reeves was imposed by the studio to make it more commercial). Rachel Weisz is perfect; Gavin Rassdale (vocalist of the group Rush), like Balthazar, is affected in just the right amount; Peter Stormare, taking on a satirical tone, pleases like Satan; and Tilda Swinton masterfully embodies the Angel Gabriel. By the way, Swinton (""Until the End"") deserves all the applause for his dubious characterization, of great presence, really impressive.The symbology used is entirely from Judeo-Christian mythology, not only in objects but also in conceptual terms, moral definitions, scenarios, in short, the whole atmosphere; the film does not show smoking as a sin because it is an addiction, but because it is a form of suicide, as the protagonist uses. Such resources were assembled in such harmony that everything seems possible in an experience of complete immersion in the proposed universe, an experience perfectly livable, and reasonably intense. The message behind the narrative is in the foreground to find the purpose of life in the love of neighbor, which contrasts with the excessive love for oneself, and in the background the need for the existence of an entire metaphysical universe without which life itself would not exist. Has any meaning.Anyway, Constantine works both as a comic book adaptation and as an independent film because it's good to watch, brings together good doses of humor, action and suspense and creates an intriguing plot; has a well-told story, with twist and sarcasm in measure, and is loaded with great performances. Every time I review it, I end up with the feeling that if this wasn't the best, it was at least an excellent way to tell in cinema everything that makes Hellblazer: Dangerous Habits a comic book classic. The work is still a very daring film, mainly because of its religious theme. The film never lets itself be intimidated and delivers some memorable dialogues, which will probably offend some people. So, to enjoy it, you have to face the movie as fantasy and let yourself go. In the end, ""Constantine"" has its numerous slips, ranging from performances, going through direction and ending in a simple exaggeration of CGI, yet it is a work that entertains the viewer who knows what to expect. It may not be the most faithful adaptation of the comics, but it has enough positive elements to keep us stuck with the narrative. As much as Reeves disappoints in the lead role, the supporting cast more than gets the job done, bringing a thought-provoking mix of action, noir and horror.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Laugh out loud bad,"Tedious and very funny Keanu Reeves horror movie that lacks not only the thrills but also a real story with an actual plot in it. The dialog is horrendously bad with scenes that actually has noting to do with the story being told and characters that adds nothing to the overall story at all. Keanu Reeves is painfully miscast as the occult detective John Constantine and the direction by first time director Frances Lawrence is spotty at best. The screenplay is a jumbled mess and it contradicts itself in certain scenes of the film and some of the performances are not up to par. There is some good in the film and that is mostly coming from the performance of Rachel Weisz, and she does more for it than the movie does for her. I actually cared about her character more than I cared about John Constantine and if I were the screenwriter of this movie, I would have cut John out altogether and just focus the movie on her. For one, it would have cut about half of the unnecessary characters that is in the film but also might have made the movie more focus in its plot because her character has more of a reason of being in the movie than Keanu's, who is just there for the mandatory overblown climax, which in itself incoherent because it raises more questions than the movie wants to answer.I agree with the majority, see it for Rachel Weisz great performance only but I suggest you wait for DVD instead because the movie is not as good as she is.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"I know everyone else hated it, BUT...","Look. I used to be a die-hard comic fan. I know how INTENSE all you kids are looking for your comic book movies to be...but Christ! LOOK how awful Daredevil was! If you liked the original Superman movie w/Christopher Reeve...and if you liked the FIRST (and only, as far as I'm concerned) Crow movie, and IF you liked the most recent installment of Batman (circa Batman Begins)...give the rest of us a break, 'eh? Yes, Tim Burton's Batmans were above and beyond the rest of the CRAP that Joel Schumacher dared to release. Yes, Superman 1 and 2 beat the hell out of the rest of the franchise, and yes, only one Crow movie truly exists to us hardcore fans. But come ON! Tilda Swinton is a GENIUS in Constantine! She's a genius in EVERYTHING she does, all the way back to Orlando, as far as I'm concerned. Her role here in Constantine is no less impressive as Gabriel, and even Keanu moved me as the tortured soul who isn't ready to submit to Hell even as he battles the earthly confinements that refuse to relinquish his soul one way or the other.Give Hollywood a break on this one, kids...did you NOT jump out of your seat in that opening scene w/the knife and the immigrant when he gets hit by the car? That's good stuff!!!!! Rag all you want, but this is FAR from the worst comic book adaptation done thus farly...in fact, I call it highly imaginative (despite the spider in the glass error), and the demons gave me nightmares several nights in a row. I call that...progress!!!! Personally can't wait until this comes out on DVD, and if you want something worse than this, watch ANY Wes Craven movie, or Freddie movie, or Jason or Michael movie...HO HUM.

Whoa,"""Constantine"", ""Constantine"", ""Constantine"", you started off so well, what happened? Sorry, I just watched ""Constantine"" last night. Even though, I'm not kidding, about everyone I met who had seen this film said it was stupid, I still was interested. It did look interesting and fun to watch.First off, computer effects. I understand that CGI effects are needed in this type of a movie. It wasn't bad at first, we had some good eye candy, then it seemed like they should have quit while they were ahead. It got a little out of control and you could tell that it was beyond fake. This isn't The Matrix, guys.Second, story. It was going so well, I mean, you actually believe Keanu's character and story. Then, oh, man, the ending. Oh, what a sad ending it was. It had really no point. I didn't understand about 35% of the movie, because it never explained itself.Over all, this wasn't bad. I mean, I would actually watch it again. There are just a few complaints. It's not as bad as everyone said it was, but it just isn't that great either. So, I think this is one of those movies you should judge for yourself.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constantine Reeves,"I weirdly really like this movie. I know it's not the best thing ever, there are other superhero properties that are better, but the cast and the world is a lot of fun.

another opinion,"personally i thought the film was very good, one of the few comic book films that was actually going to see. i like comics/graphic novels/whatever the hell the pretentious want to call them.okay was a bit annoyed that as usual an English role suddenly become American, but hey, i am used to it. personally i think Constantine should have been kept in Liverpool.but allowing for that little change, i liked the film, it was meant to be over the top, its entertainment! some of us go to the movies to be excited, entertained, to suspend disbelief for a brief period of time. hell if i wanted to watch realistic stuff, i would look out my window and save myself a few quid.i personally thought it was well worth seeing, and well worth buying the DVD. watch it, make up your own mind, at the very least you get to make your own opinion then!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"""Woah...""","On the whole, this film left me with a ""Eh, it was cool, I guess."" feeling as I walked out of the theater. We all know Keanu Reeves isn't exactly praised for his acting abilities, unless he's starring in such films pertaining to the Matrix, so it's no surprised that I ended up disliking his performance in this one. More often than not I found myself laughing inside when he would deliver such a line that reminded me of his days as Ted Logan from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures. Despite his lack luster performance, and the occasional bad CGI trip, this film does hold some good.

He had lots of personality, and was just perfect in the role. I plan on seeing it again. I could have watched this movie longer, it was over before I even knew it.

"Very well done movie, worth of watching and enjoyable","Well Pretty GOOD.I enjoyed a lot. First of all I haven't even seen comic. So I really had no knowledge about the original plot. now, I liked script and dare to say those who don't like it PROBABLY are those who are under impression of comic.It's a strange thing: American movie-goers never complain about when movie has different plot then a book or is quite different from historical facts, but if you make a movie on Comic and it is not what they expect they start whining. Why? Gladiator or Cleopatra or Troy are totally different then what was really happening or what should happen, but no complaints were made.Here is a big discussion if Keeanu is Constantine or not. Why those who don't like him expect Constantine of movie to be what they have read in book? Achiless of Troy is not exactly of Achiless of Homer but who says anything? nobody.So what' wrong with script? nothing. Pretty well made.Now about other stuff: Acting: great. Directing: awesome.

cons....constant..constanti...constipated scenes,"I just came back from watching this film and felt like the fat comic guy on the simpsons going straight to the internet and posting how it is.. ""Worst comic book movie ever!"" it rates up there with spawn. Anywone remember that movie? yeah, what an embarrassment that was! same goes here.Reeves seemed like he was being forced to make this film and really didn't wanna be in it. Like his mom was on the set telling him "" you better do it or else young man!"". His performance was less than the Matrix and it seemed incredibly long. I found myself wondering what time it was during the film. I like Reeves, just not in this movie. His performance was a 1 out of 10.Gavin Rossdale (singer of Bush, married to G. Stefani) seemed like he was really into it and gave it a lot!! I found that Rossdale with Weisz's GREAT performance helped aid this film but not even they could save the film from becoming a blazing inferno of syrupy boredom. I think someone, at some point, told the writer that he could write and HE BELIEVED IT!! That someone should have been honest with him. "" You suck dude, try harder...""The movie itself seemed too hmm how can I describe this in one word..piece-y if that counts as a word. It seemed the director kept tripping over a wire while trying to balance champagne glasses and forgot this little thing called (suspension of disbelief). which is where the audience tends fall into the movie and stick with it all the way through. The second you get snapped out of this ""suspension of disbelief"" you find yourself at a theater with a bunch of people you don't know. It's hard to get back in and, sad to say, your efforts to do this in this film pretty much go through out the entire film. I think I remember people leaving.Could have been better, waste of film like spawn and any Olsen twin movie and the Angel Gabriel looks like a cross-dresser... it almost reminded me of a religious "" Men in Black "" with chucke-cheese special effects in some parts.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Decent little action/horror flick,"The Joe Cool Review For Constantine(2005)Starring: Keanu Reeves as John Constantine, Rachel Weisz as Angela Dodson, Shia LeBeouf as Chas, Gavin Rossdale as Balthazar, and Tilda Swinton as GabrielPlot: John Constantine, a man who smokes like cigarettes are going out of style and generally has a ""don't care"" attitude is a supernatural detective who performs exorcisms and sends demons back to hell. He soon learns of a plot for Satan's son to conquer the earth and only he can stop it.Openers: First off, let me say I have not read any stories of Hellblazer or Constantine before seeing this movie. Constantine is originally based on a DC/Vertigo comic book. Apparently that John Constantine is blond and British. So he's not Keanu Reeves. I don't see a problem but that's just me. Anyway let's get to the review.The Good: The best thing about Constantine(and I'm going to get crap for this) was Keanu. The man nailed the part and made Constantine look like a severely cool dude, who won't take crap from anyone and just has his own general problems too. Mainly he's trying to buy his way into Heaven by sending demons to Hell. Because he committed suicide and that's against the rules so he's doomed to go Hell, thanks to the lung cancer(does not stop smoking though). Keanu takes this role and makes it his own. I can't say I related, but I felt for the guy and wanted to see something, anything, good happen to him in the end. But Keanu's not carrying the movie on his shoulders. He's got some talent supporting him. Rachel Weisz carries herself well as Angela. She had a good chemistry with Constantine that thankfully didn't fall into the a-typical ""lead guy and lead girl fall in love"" category. Shia LeBeouf surprised me as Chas, mainly because I'm used to seeing him in family-oriented stuff. He did well and I liked his character. Constantine also had the dreary look and feel to it. Hell looked GREAT. Well, in terms of the effects and the look in general...not saying I'd want to stay there. The movie had it's fair share of gore too: A bashed in demon head, organs ripped out of ones body, blood, disintegrating demons and a slit wrist. Special considerations go to Djimon Hounsou(Midnite) and Peter Stormare(Lucifer, Satan, The Devil, etc) for bringing life to their roles when they were on screen. Who knew Satan was a funny guy?The Bad: Tilda Swinton was pretty bad as Gabriel. First off, isn't Gabriel supposed to be a guy? Not that it matters. I just didn't like her character even before I found out more about her. The CGI, while when it small doses was effective got to be a little much. For example Constantine performing an exorcism and seeing a demon in the mirror, the demon looked a little cartoon-like. Same with the ones in Hell. They worked best hidden in shadow. Also seeing a blown off chuck of face talk isn't exactly what I'd call good. Plus running in at 2 hours, this movie can tend to drag or repeat itself in spots.The Ugly: Gavin Rossdale(Yes, THAT Gavin Rossdale, of Bush fame) seemed kind of, well, gay as Balthazar. But maybe that's how the character was supposed to come off(""Finger licking good!""). He hammed it up the entire time he was on screen and left me shaking my head. Unintentional comedy at it's finest.Final Verdict: Overall, Constantine was a fun ride and I'd gladly pay to see it again.Rating: **** of *****",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"""Matrix"" meets ""Blade"" meets ""Devil's Advocate""","Just went to see ""Constantine"" this afternoon. My initial impression was that it seemed very much like a ""Blade"" type movie (instead of vampires, you have demons). Similar weapons are used here and seem as if they could be used in either movie. No Kung Fu or martial arts here though. This movie for me also seems like a collage of what Keanu has done in previous movies. Reeves character is very much like Neo from the ""Matrix""; brooding and conflicted messiah-like. There's's a similar storyline with him on a reluctant mission to save the world and ultimately himself. The final confrontation scene has a similar feel to when Keanu's character in the ""Devil's Advocate"" meets Al Pacino/the devil and he reveals his true identity, though the actor playing Lucifer here doesn't compare with Pacino's performance. The movie is entertaining and thought-provoking but the plot is somewhat confusing and hard to follow at times. I Don't suggest going for popcorn or the bathroom during it because you'll probably be lost or confused on what's going on (maybe if I had been familiar with the comics it would have helped in following the story better). So that's why I give a rating of 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Keanu is his good old Matrixy self,"Constantine is really more about the guys behind the camera than what's going on in front of it. There's some awesome cinematography that will appeal to anyone with a taste for darker movies. There's some tasteful use of unusually-angled camera angles that actually add to the film, and some really smooth depictions of hell and demons. Some of the special effects really are mindblowing.But, you can't help feel that this Keanu is just a slightly more spiritual version of Neo from the Matrix - the role doesn't stretch him much, and he spends a lot of time playing his character a little too deadpan and emotionless for one supposedly so conflicted.The story itself has an interesting plot to it (probably better than most comic book-based movies) but is detracted from by some truly awful clichéd lines scattered throughout the movie. The end was disappointing too - it really wasn't wrapped up well.So all in all, yeah, it's a good movie to go watch, but just don't go in expecting a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
I would see it again...,"For a movie that so many file in the ""comic book"" movie genre, Constantine exceeded my expectations and is an excellent piece of entertainment, in spite of being amidst the ""dumpers"" that usually are put out in the month of February.The graphics, camera work, and animation were excellent, but didn't ultimately become the entertainment value of the movie, which I consider an excellent feat for movies of this genre. The plot made me want to know more, and the acting was good. The writing wasn't excellent, per se, but didn't have me leaving the movie thinking, ""Why do people pay millions of dollars to writers when I could write a better script?"" like many other comic book movies have had me screaming. Still, having not read the comic books, I should also say that I cannot comment on the movie's ability to maintain consistency with the author's work.Overall, you can take as much away from this movie as you want. If you're looking for entertainment, this movie has it in spades. If you're looking for an interesting story, with implications on the greater picture, you can definitely take that away from this movie, too. Personally, I thought it was great  despite what many other critics have written, and I would go and see it again.Oh! And definitely stay past the credits!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
instinctual movie,"no matter what you think about the comics beware : there' s no big liaison between them and the movie.Somehow dark but nice filmed overall, Constantine is an exercise of visual art. Amazing shooting angles and stylish Fx. Sound is medium but not disturbing at some moments even exceeding expectations.Now the plot is far from excellent but i think this movie can satisfy it's targeted audience. Forget what you already knew about sanctity and biblical laws, sit in your favorite chair and watch a decadent world where everybody seems to have another goal than declared. Reeves may not be the perfect ""John Constantine"" but it fairly good in its part. Weisz seems perfect here where she compensates reeves's mistakes. Nice finale, where you could unexpected raise your eyebrows by cause of an interesting turn-back. Overall catchy movie although possibly not what you really expected when you first saw the trailer. But, as said above the movie is the right thing for the targeted audience( far above any van helsing & Co. )",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Great Entertainment,"Constantine is another of the current trend of adapting all comic book characters to the screen. The funny thing about adapting comic books is the fact that most of the times the characters come out as dense as a piece of paper (which reminds the terrible ""Batman and Robin"", by Joel Schumacher or ""Daredevil"" by Mark Steven Johnson). Sometimes however you actually have an adventure film, that boasts a great look and also something besides image trickery (""Batman"" by Tim Burton is the best example, for there you have characters with some density, motivations, inner conflicts). ""Constantine"" is a good example of an entertaining film, that doesn't have much pretensions and therefore it's results are quite decent. I personally did not know the comic, and nor do I feel the need to: I went to see the film for it's own merits and I judge it on those premises alone. Francis Lawrence the director has the visual flair of a video-clip director, but without being excessive (Tony Scott and Michael Bay are names that always comes to mind in that department). The look of the film is beautiful, thanks to Philippe Rousselot the french director of photography (he was responsible for ""Interview with the Vampire"" and ""Henry and June""), and the acting is actually not as bad as one might have anticipated. Keanu Reeves manages to infuse some credibility to his part, more so than he has done in so many previous incarnations of his (the most terrible that comes to mind is ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" by Francis Coppola). His performance isn't great, but it isn't terrible. The always wonderful Tilda Swinton doesn't have much screen time, but her beauty and talent are on full display when she does appear. Rachel Weisz has an underwritten role as the lady in distress - as a detective I was expecting another kind of character, but her performance is just plain (far from her riskier side in ""The Shape of Things"" by Neil LaBute). This film ends up being a good entertainment for two hours. It's well written and it's visually engrossing. These days, that's more than you can say about a lot of films on the theaters. Go see it!",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Like it or not, Keanu IS multi-dimensional","As it is with any actor who becomes notorious for playing a major role that spans a trilogy or so, it is to be expected that he or she will carry a certain stigma that stays with that person for a while. Well guess what? The Matrix movies are long since passed, and Keanu CAN act, folks. I'm sorry to be the one to bust your bandwagon's bubble, but start loving yourself and realize that he can pull it off. To be quite honest, if you are even considering watching this movie, do it. I knew about what to expect, but once things got moving, the movie went places I never thought it could or would go. Kevin Brodbin is a genius; the script was healthy, not forced and very robust in not only dialogue but in giving the actors and actresses something to work with unlike some recent ""dark"" flicks as of late (see ""SAW""--I felt so sorry for Cary Elwes--good talent gone to waste on a crappy script)(yes and I bow at the obvious pun). Keanu knocked one out of the park with this one--trust me, it's not a reprisal of Neo in any shape or form....so please, don't go into the movie looking for him. You won't find him.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Not the comic, but still a good film","Okay, so Keanu isn't blonde or British. Big deal. They got most of the details of the character right (although the desire to get into Heaven is kind of off base).As a huge fan of the comic, I'm definitely in the demographic of those who should be completely p'o'd but I'm not. For what it was, the movie was enjoyable and I'd see a sequel if one was made. Sure its not the comic, but if that's what you're looking for...then go read the comic.As a movie its pretty good and definitely damn fine entertainment for February. I bought Keanu as world-weary most of the time. Thankfully the CGI was minimal (for this type of movie) and the director knew how to use it. Little touches like John's friends dying because they helped him, his comment about ""another ghost following me"", his basic self-centeredness, all good.If you're a fan, think of it like this. John's in LA and needs some cash so he sells his life story to Hollywood. The comic is John's ""real life"" and the movie is the ""based on true events"" version.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

And I immediately agreed.Although avid fans of the comic book will surely complain about the changes made, having never read the comic, I'm inclined not to care about that. Keanu Reeves was surprisingly tolerable and the supporting cast, particularly Rachel Weisz, was wonderful. The story, although taking some liberties with Christian mythology, was very compelling and surprisingly logical. I was particularly pleased with the portrayal of angels in this film.

It was hell sitting though this film.,"Horrible Keanu Reeves thriller is with out a doubt one of his worse films.

I agree with the majority that Rachel Weisz is the movies only saving grace and she's so good that I really felt sorry for her for even being the movie. Her performance makes the movie better than what it really was and that's a miracle in itself considering the fact that the film is almost too bad to watch. Unfortunately, her performance is the only thing that this movie really has and it gets put in the background while the director and Keanu try to rehash the Matrix films into a supernatural thriller that has no qualms in insulting the audience with it's lack of substance and plot.Avoid.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

There is just something about the way she makes you believe that the character/s are real.Keanu Reeves as John Constantine well what can I say? Keanu is definite eye candy.

Extremely good.  Highly under-rated.,"I saw Constantine the other night and, to be honest, was somewhat skeptical, as I had read many negative reviews from this site and others. The trailers that I had seen had many the movie look incredible and incredible it was. I was pleasantly surprised. Keanu Reeves, despite getting slagged for everything he does, brings realism to the cynical, hard-boiled and ruthless role of John Constantine. Rachel Weisz is also excellent in her role of Angela/Isabel Dodson.The movie was unlike any other movie I have ever seen, mixing and bending numerous genres to create a sleek, dark, and chilling film. The images of Hell depicted in this movie are incredible and the CGI is as good as it gets, overshadowing the horrible CGI effects of the drear-fest Elektra.The ending in itself was incredible and completely surprising, reminding me of the conclusion of ""Neon Genesis: Evanelion"" in its philosophizing of Heaven and Hell and the human soul.All in all, I was highly impressed, and this dethrones any other movie for my personally favorite comic book adaptation movie as of yet. Die-hard whiny Hellblazer purists may sob and complain of slight changes from the comic books to the screen and shallow movie-goers looking for nothing but mindless killing may be confused and befuddled by its conclusion. However, if you enjoy something other than the ordinary, you will love this movie.It's worth the price of admission four times over. See it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good movie with a bit of popcorn cinema,"When i've seen the Constantine DVD cover with Keanu Reeves i just expected him as a kinda crisis-ridden, hard-boiled addicted person who's doing his job as a matter of routine. And thats what i got. You see what's necessary, nothing about John Constantines past, nothing about how he knows all the stuff, just that he's an exorcist with nothing to lose, but with a weak point - his health.What i liked about this movie is the camera work and some good shots, sunlight in the morning for example that's shining trough the windows. As well as the scriptural but not too religious storyline. On the other hand the movie failed in shock moments and had a part which was way too unnecessary, it gives Angela a touch of melancholy which is not bad at all, but more or less unimportant, i don't know if this is good or bad.I think it was a good movie. It really reminds me of Hard Ball, in which Keanu Reeves had a similar role.I liked this movie, good plot with a bit of popcorn cinema and some everyday occurrences which makes you laugh.

Best Movie I ever saw in my life,"It is the greatest movie I ever have seen. I think that everyone should watch it and Keanu Reeves acts his best on it.

I even think little children ages 10 and up should be able to watch it. But truthfully it was the greatest movie I ever saw my life. I also think people shouldn't really be saying all that stuff about the movie and Keanu Reeves acting because everyone did their best and work hard so they could give us SUCH A GOOD MOVIE LIKE THAT.EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH IT, BEST MOVIE EVERY MADE",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Not great, not bad but somewhere in between.","Lots of fuss on this board about the movie, but in my opinion, good enough to plunk down 4 bucks and rent it for a night. Th highlight of the movie are the special effects, closely followed by the performance of one Rachel Wiesz. A truly captivating performance that had me moved. I can only imagine what it's like to lose a twin sister, but from my personal experiences, I can say that most of the twin talk in the movie is dead on. It helps that I have a couple friends who have either a spouse or siblings who are twins, but what do I know. Anyway the point is Weisz pulls it off effortlessly and should be considered one of the best performances of the year.Not much to say about the special effects except that they are first rate. With so much being done on a computer these days, it's not hard to tell the difference between whats real and a video game. (""Chronicles of Riddick"" comes to mind when I think of overdone computer-generated special effects.)So in a nutshell, the movie does not suck, is not great, and is somewhere in between. And yes, Keanu Reeves is not a great actor, not even a good actor, but I will still take time to check out his movies. Check out ""Something's Gotta Give --a much better movie-- if you want a good, clean, Keanu performance. As John Constantine he was good, in a dirty, life-sucks kind of way.Lower your expectations a bit and you may enjoy this little nugget of a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constantine is visually stunning; Dogma and the Matrix without the same flaws.,"It was sort of a mix of Dogma, the Matrix, and something else that was better. I know nothing of the original comic, so I can't say it kept to the story, but damn, it was good. Keanu did his Keanu thing (""DUDE!"" and ""I know Kung Fu.""), but to a lesser extent than usual. Mostly little things like flipping off Lucifer (who was at first just called ""Lu"", which through me off for a second) and saying to a demon that was in a little Spanish girl's body, ""I'm Constantine. John Constantine. Asshole."" Some have said to me, ""I was confused in the beginning."" Well, if that's they're only complaint, then it's a pretty damn good movie, because you never know what's going on in the beginning; if you do, chances are the movie sucks (unless you were previously exposed to the story). There's no point to being confused; just be curious. It's obvious throughout everything that they're going to reveal it all in the end, and all the loose ends do come together. Hardly a moment is wasted on anything not absolutely essential to the plot in Constantine, save some character development (like the first scene were we see Shia LaBeouf's character, Chas, and he's imitating John by looking in the mirror of their taxi and saying over and over, ""I'm Chandler. Chas Chandler. Asshole."").The Dogma part was largely, of course, due to the film's religious aspects; John Constantine is a man who went to Hell in the few moments he was dead after trying to kill himself as a young man because he could see demons in our world. Since he knows that Hell is real, he's trying to ""buy"" his way into Heaven by sending half-breeds (half-demons and half-angels on Earth, who trying to influence the balance) back to Heaven or Hell. Since he has a selfish agenda, it's not a very effective method of getting into Heaven, but he continues on anyway.The Matrix I mention mostly because of the way it was filmed. There are a few points in the movie where the angle shifts when there is no motion, but this actually makes more sense than it does in the Matrix, as it's used to show time stopping for all but one or two characters. Visually, the movie was amazing -- I'm not one who's easily entertained by images alone (not to suggest that this movie is images alone), but if I were to comment on nothing but the visuals I would have still found the movie amazing. From explosions of water to flesh burning off of demons and visions of hell, everything was realistic enough to make me jump or gape at the screen.Constantine did not, however, have the interference of a rather bad love story. While one could, possibly, say that there are more than a few suggestions of romance between John Constantine and Rachel Weisz's character, Angela, whatever there was was not enough to shout ""sexual tension!"" and definitely not enough to distract from the storyline, which occurs all too often in movies today. Their connection was mostly one of being two of the few humans on Earth who know the truth about Heaven and Hell, at least to some extent.If an intricate plot based on religion, amazing visual effects, and Constantine's flippant attitude towards his fate (as he dies of cancer) while still understanding the seriousness of it all, then Constantine may not be for you, but you'll be missing out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
7.0/10 - A Cult Classic,"After a recent re-watch of a film that I held in high regard when first released, Constantine still holds my attention throughout the film. An exciting twist to Christianity and the myths of exorcism and the war between Heaven and Hell as we know it.Sadly the film after many years doesn't match the quality (both writing and special effects) of many supernatural masterpieces of today, however for its time, I can see why this film was something i wanted to rewatch.Typically my grade on IMDB for a must watch is a 7 and above. After rewatching I would of given a 6.8-7. However Keanu's performance was such a stand out (as always) he bumped it up a couple of marks.I look forward to seeing how this move stands after another 10-20 years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"O boy, this movie was really bad.","Horrible movie that leaves a very bad taste in your mouth with a bad acting performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast as a hard boiled detective who fights against demons in LA.

His co-star Rachel Weisz is ten times the actor Keanu is and she has the most interesting character in the whole movie. Her character is so good that she should have been the lead instead of poor Keanu but we don't live in a perfect world so we have to suffer with Keanu trying to act tough. The script is an absolute mess from beginning to end and the special effects are not done properly in some scenes of the film.See the film for Rachel Weisz performance alone but other than her, wait for video.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Nice supernatural horror thriller. Doesn't matter if you haven't read the comics!,"This is a nice supernatural horror thriller on its own.You don't have to know the comic Hellblazer on which is based.Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz and Tilda Swinton are looking good for the main roles. Shia LaBeouf, as the after-teenage age sidekick is good too (these roles are more suitable for him and certainly not of a leading man).There are some plot holes and inconsistencies, but the flow of the movie is suspenseful enough to keep you interested. The visuals are OK and you can expect a couple of disgusting scenes.Overall: It's an entertaining movie nevertheless. Stay for an after credits secret scene too!",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
An ok movie,"""Constantine"" is a visually stunning and darkly captivating supernatural thriller that weaves a tale of angels, demons, and the tormented soul of an exorcist. Directed by Francis Lawrence and based on the DC Comics character John Constantine, the film showcases a mesmerizing performance by Keanu Reeves in the title role, delivering an atmospheric and action-packed cinematic experience.The film's visual aesthetics are nothing short of breathtaking. From the dark and grimy streets of Los Angeles to the vividly realized supernatural realms, the cinematography and special effects create a haunting and immersive atmosphere. The depiction of the supernatural elements, especially the exorcism scenes, is visually stunning and adds to the film's overall impact.""Constantine"" successfully delves into complex religious and philosophical themes, exploring the fine line between good and evil and the nature of redemption. It challenges the notion of black-and-white morality, presenting characters with ambiguous motives and decisions, which elevates the story beyond a mere action-fantasy flick.However, some may find that the film's plot becomes convoluted at times, with certain elements feeling rushed or underdeveloped. The intricate supernatural lore might be challenging to follow for viewers unfamiliar with the source material.In conclusion, ""Constantine"" is an enthralling and visually captivating journey into the world of the occult and the battle between Heaven and Hell. Keanu Reeves's powerful performance, supported by a talented ensemble cast and mesmerizing visuals, makes it a must-watch for fans of dark fantasy and supernatural thrillers. While it may not fully adhere to the source material, ""Constantine"" stands on its own as an immersive and engaging cinematic experience that leaves the audience contemplating the blurred lines of morality and the eternal struggle between light and darkness.The only thing that i didn´t like in the film was the ""propaganda"" for was an anti-tobacco advertisement, it was super forced and seemed at certain points an advertisement against tobacco consumption.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Not one for the comic books fans ...,"This movie has been met with a lot of mixed opinions about its quality. There's certainly been a lot of aggro from dedicated fans of the comic book 'Hellblazer,' as they have discovered that their beloved Constantine is now an American living in Los Angeles with dark hair. Originally, he was from Liverpool and looked like Sting.John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a chain-smoking, cynical exorcist who is gifted, or cursed as he sees it, with the ability to see things that are not of this world. Because he tried to commit suicide earlier in his life he is destined to go to Hell when he dies, which isn't too far off as he is dying of lung cancer. Wanting to avoid this fate, he goes round sending unruly demons back to Hell with the hope of buying his way into Heaven.The story starts with the suicide of mental patient Isabel Dobson (Rachel Weisz). Isobel claimed to be psychic and could see things that others could not. Her twin sister, Angela (also played by Weisz) refuses to believe that her sister would take her own life and enlists the help of Constantine to investigate. Together they unravel a conspiracy that could bring an end to all life on Earth, as we know it.Keanu Reeves plays the role of Constantine in pretty much the same way as he plays every other character he's ever played. His acting is lazy and void of emotion, but it suits the character of Constantine well, so it actually pays off this time round! Rachel Weisz was an excellent choice to play twins Angela and Isobel Dobson. The only downside with her performance is that her American accent isn't that good. Together Reeves and Weisz have great on screen chemistry. Anyone who has seen Chain Reaction, in which they previously starred together, will agree.The film is almost stolen by two of the supporting characters. The archangel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) is a bit of fruit and is not all s/he* appears to be. Satan (Peter Stormare) is slightly camp, but extremely sinister and utterly evil, which is what we would expect from the Prince of Darkness, wouldn't we? There are a lot of things that are left unexplained, and it is never made clear what Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale) has to do with the main plot. It's not even worth talking about the Bush front man's acting ability because he has absolutely none. There are also a lot of religious references in the movie that might make people want to switch off until the action starts, but unfortunately people need to pay attention to these as they are important to the story.This is a movie that one would think consists of action, violence, etc. In truth, the movie is a thriller with little bits of action thrown in. There is a lot of violence, several suicide references, and even references to self-harm.The special effects are quite good. There is good use of CGI, creating very real and quite horrifying looking demons. The depiction of Heaven and Hell is interesting to see.If you're a fan of the comic book, this may probably anger you. If, like me, you've never read the comic book, you may find this to be an enjoyable film.6/10 * Angels don't have genitalia; therefore they are neither male nor female.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Slaughters the comic book, but still a decent movie","As the topic says, this movie does nothing to honor the original comic.. and I mean nothing at all. I guess this is old news in adaptation movies, that fans of the original don't like the adapted result, so I'll be quick: John Constantine is a shabby English guy, part caught in the 80s and 70s, wearing a worn, brown trench-coat. He doesn't spit words out like Reeves here, he's just tired and very very disillusioned. Wants to be the good guy, but hasn't always the strength or the courage. Yes, he does dabble with the Christian universe, but mostly with heathen religions. John is certainly no traveling, believing, catholic exorcist like in this movie. In other words, Hellblazer-fans, leave every hope of seeing a ""LOTR-style"" respectful adaptation behind you.As for the actual movie, yes I could yab about how moments like a main character discovering his terminal cancer and another finding her twin sister dead (plus other subjects of life, death and religion) would require much better acting and less cliché. But why bother.. This is a good action and effect movie, that's all.So if you tolerate those movies well, watch until the last part of this, and you might even find more rare movie content, which appeals to the less than casual moviegoer as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

It has its shortcomings but it's still good fun.,"I looked at the reviews for Constantine prior to seeing the movie. I must say that I was a bit less than optimistic about how good the movie was going to be. To my surprise, I liked it.Keanu Reeves plays the role of John Constantine. He is a man who has been to hell and returned to earth with the knowledge that he is damned. Rachel Weisz plays the role of Angela Dodson, an intuitive cop who always seems to know where the bad guys are. The two come together when Angela's sister dies in an apparent suicide and Angela gets the help of Constantine to find out if it was truly a suicide or if it was murder.Constantine is far from flawless but what it does right, it does very well. One could forgive the holes in the plot and a strange animated movement that Keanu Reeves makes every time he shuts the lid on his lighter. The movie's faults don't seem so bad when you notice that you're having fun watching the movie. The interaction between its characters is interesting and the overall look of the film goes back and forth from exotic to spooky.Francis Lawrence, the director of Constantine, did a fine job considering that this is his first major motion picture. Prior to this he has directed music videos including those of Britney Spears and Aerosmith. One could say that sometimes it takes a fresh perspective such as that of a music video director to add some new light to the theatrical movie scene. Oddly enough, his road is quite similar to that of Russell Mulcahy when he directed the original Highlander back in the 80's. Incidentally, I liked Highlander as well.There will always be little things that anyone can say to put down a movie such as this one but after watching countless mind numbingly boring movies as of late, it's nice to finally see something that I enjoyed. I also liked the little bonus that is given after the credits.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Leave your prejudices at the door,"People love to pick on Keanu Reeves. Even before this film came out, people were bashing his performance without even seeing the film, and now that the film has been released, these people are letting loose even more  despite the fact that the film is extremely well made. There are also the people who think the film is bad simply because they're obsessed with the source material. ANY adaptation, now matter how well crafted would not be enough to satisfy them. These two groups hated the movie going in, and hated the movie going out. The rest of us can actually enjoy the movie, and see that it's a cut above the schlock that gets peddled in theaters these days. Now I'm not saying that you have to like Keanu Reeves, but why are you still seeing his movies if you hate him so? Just admit that you're prejudiced and deal with your own problems  you can at least TRY and be objective. Keanu certainly isn't going to stop acting, now matter how bad you think his movies are - It certainly hasn't stopped the Waynes brothers. And in the end, Keanu still wins, because you still went to see his movie. These criticisms are absurd, because the last thing John Constantine is supposed to be is flamboyant and exaggerated. Reeves' performance is completely appropriate. I loved reading Hellblazer, and I'm well aware Reeves isn't the most over-the-top actor in the world  but I still enjoyed Constantine a hell of a lot.It's a great movie, despite what all the haters will have you believe.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Rachel Weisz, Peter Stormare and Djimon Hounsou all do great work here but the movie is really beneath their talents.","This is a very bad movie, no doubt about it but it does have its great points which is the performances of Rachel Weisz Peter Stormare and Djimon Hounsou which makes this movie much better than it really is. Rachel Weisz is with out a doubt one of the most versatile actresses of our generation, and in this movie, she is quite literally carrying the huge acting weight from Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in his role and gives a pretty lousy performance. She holds the audience attention with her strong and gutsy performance and she does give this movie a lot more than it asked from her. Peter Stormare only has about eight minutes of screen time and does more with it than Keanu does in his whole performance. He gives a funny and down right scary realism to his portrayal of the king of the underworld. This role should prove to people on how versatile an actor Stormare is and it should give him the respect he deserves. Djimon Hounsou is a great and charismatic actor who also does more with his role than Keanu does. He brings a strong sense of bravado to his underwritten role and makes the audience have fun with him while he chews up the scenery with is great performance.Weisz, Stormare and Hounsou are great actors who give more to the audience than the film does, and for that, they should be commended. The movie unfortunately is beneath their great talents and it does not deserve their efforts at all with a story that confuses more than explains and a leading man who can't act his way out of a garbage can.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Reeves was perfect,"A lot of viewer comments reflect a severe dissatisfaction of Keanu Reeves' portrayal of John Constantine. I have to say that I thought he was excellent in the role. The story was taken from the comics, so it's not supposed to be ""Passion of the Christ"". Parts of it are a wee bit cornball, but Keanu seemed real in the role of Constantine, kind of like a Bogart turned exorcist. The zippo thing might have worn a little thin, but it was obviously an extension of his manhood. The other actors did well also, and the demons were nothing short of endearing. I am a horror movie buff, and I did not think this movie predictable in the least. It is a legitimate thriller and I would recommend it for ages 12 and above.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Hell Wants Him, Earth Needs Him, Film Lacked Him","Heaven won't take Constantine. WE should take the movie though and leave the lame ones of this genre behind. Many films having to do with supernatural forces, demons, angels, the occult, etc all attempt to be something original and interesting but fail. Some examples include Lost Souls and the prequel to the Exorcist. But this movie gives us something a little different. It has a good concept--a doomed man exorcising demons on earth to get his way into heaven. That is only a tad of the story--there is more to it that kept me quite entertained and waiting to see what would happen next. It is not only brainless action and special effects. I was actually afraid that it would be that way and that the story would be weak. There is a story and it follows through a bit smoothly. There are only a few dull moments where I lost track of what was being said because the dialogue was much too prolonged. But other than that I will say that they did a fair job with this one. It is not awesomely great either; it had its flaws. There are some instances in the movie that was unnecessary and if they were taken in another direction, this would have been better. But as I said before--compared to the other films of this genre--this is one of the better ones fortunately. It has a dark and ominous atmosphere and it puts you through each plane in the film--Hell, Earth, and Heaven. The visuals were very well done for all three of them and transitions through them were good. Added on to that, Constantine is actually an interesting and cool character to put in a movie like this. Hell wants him, Earth needs him, but Film lacked him; and by that I mean that many movies in this category lacked an attention-grabbing lead character...and story for that matter. This one succeeds in those two departments. So if you are a fan of this movie and were able to sit through the mediocre End of Days, then you will like this one. It is one of the better movies of the year so far =)6.8/10 Stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Producer Really Made Research,"After watching the movie, I realised that the producer really made a thorough research prior producing the movie. This is because through my own experiences, I have seen some scenes in 'live' and it is truly happened, very logic. My personal favourite scene is through the first scene where Constantine was summoned to get release a teenager from a demon. The set up was very real where I have seen with my own eyes before, the mirror and the ritual.I think Constantine is the best film in its category and I feel that most scenes could happen in our real life. The sound effect made the whole movie more interesting. More intriguing! Even though there was no obscene scenes or even love making scenes, it is still a very good movie and worth watching. For those ladies who fan Keanu Reeves, you will not disappoint, because I can't see he is kissing any ladies in the movie, unlike Matrix. So, you don't have to be jealous.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Well-crafted fantasy movie with stunning imagery and fascinating characters,"This is a well-crafted example of formulaic story-telling. The hero has abilities that separate him from the common fold, yet he pays a steep price for them. John Constantine is the classic flawed hero. Many formulaic movies end up being predictable but in this movie the characters (and film makers) keep their cards close to their chests, so there are several surprising twists to make this an exiting ride. The beautiful cinematography and costumes make this visually stunning. I gaped several times. And even when I went to see the movie a second time, just a week later, I was still impressed and awed by some of the sequences. The acting was appropriate. Keanu Reeves delivers solid enough work. He portrays an emotionally stunted man, and the script does not ask for great displays of either affection or guilt. John Constantine is bitter and cynical - and Reeves brings that across. Rachel Weisz had a bit more to work with and did so satisfyingly. Her character is more than damsel in distress. Tilda Swinton deserves extra mention for her portrayal of Gabriel. Her scenes are particularly memorable. She brings a fascinating androgynous and transgressive flavor to this movie.I am not familiar with the comics this movie is based on, so I don't know if it's a faithful adaptation or not, I can only say that I really enjoyed this movie and that I will rush out to buy it the moment the DVD hits the stores.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A look into heaven & hell,"Keanu does a great job playing John Constantine, a man who tries to save mankind from demons, half-breeds, and should eaters. The movie also stars Rachel Weisz, who portrays a police detective with her own motives to help Constantine. Constantine has the ability to see things behind every wall & window, but in his quest to save the salvation of mankind, he doesn't prove to me he is any type of hero. The movie wasn't as dark and sci-fi as I expected it to be. It gives us a nice portrayal of what L.A. could really look like, but then again in reality it isn't what we want. I recommend this movie to anyone, especially those ""Keanu fans,"" it is definitely worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"a smooth and refreshing transition, overall a good movie.","I went into Constantine not knowing fully what to expect. I just knew of what I had read in the Vertigo/DC comics ""Hellblazer/Constantine"". Having read a few of the graphic novels I knew a few things about it and when i judged by the previews I was a bit off put by it. Although when I actually saw it in the theater I was pleasantly surprised that it was as smooth as it was. Visually it looked great and the director did a great job with it, especially since I believe since this was his first full feature motion picture. On top of that I thought Reeves executed the character of John Constantine quite well. For those of you that don't know John Constantine is English and blonde in the comics but his attitude is what was important and Reeves nailed it down. Overall I really enjoyed it had I not knew anything at all because it stands alone well and does referrals to the comic back and forth which the normal movie fan would not need. I liked it quite a bit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A simplified view...,"I have learned long ago not to expect a comic book-turned-movie to be (necessarily) like the comic book. And so, if you are a fan of the Hellblazer rag, you may not find this film as deep or as detailed as you might have become accustomed. This film however, freed of the continuity baggage of the comic, presents a believable glimpse into a man's life of divine sarcasm. You see, he doesn't have faith because he knows the truth about heaven and hell. Yet, without faith, the theological elevator can only go down in the end. This is the dichotomy: he is revered for what he knows about the balance of heaven and hell...but his knowledge ensures he will never reach redemption. With all of the ""shocker"" films coming out this time of year, Constantine DOES have the depth which will keep audience members talking long after the credits have rolled. And keep an eye on the brief performance of Peter Stormare as Lucifer...brilliant. A perfect movie for people who spent many a night at college discussing religion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Terrible Film....Definitely not what I expected.,"I don't know what director Francis Lawrence was thinking when he made this film. Weak plot and Keanu Reeve's worst performance to date. Constantine starts out kinda strong and then it's all downhill from there. The plot lacks excitement, and the characters were empty in the sense that not much is known about them(unless you had read the Hellblazer comics).The only good things about this movie are the special effects and Rachel Weisz who delivered a great performance. Everything else in this movie is utter crap. This movie is just like ""Catwoman"", a huge buzz about it and then you watch it and it leaves you wanting more, it does not satisfy you. Lets hope that a sequel is not in the works because it will crumble as well. My overall thought on this film: Terrible, oh and yeah I wanted my money back. Avoid Constantine at all costs.......",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"My God, it's not bad.","I walked into Constantine with rock bottom expectations. It's a February release, which usually hints that the studio is not confident in the film. It's a comic book movie, and unlike the good ones of the last few years, it strays from the source material. And of course it stars the old oak bloke himself, Keanus Reeves.That said, the movie is actually pretty good. Despite it's R rating, one should not expect a serious horror movie in the traditional sense. This is a comic book movie, with overblown cgi and slo-mo battle sequences. I say overblown cgi, but I was actually impressed with the restraint the director showed in this sense. The movie is propelled mostly through dialogue, and it helps that most of the characters are well cast.Tilda Swinton was the perfect choice to play the ambiguous angel, and Peter Stormare as Satan was an inspired decision. However, Keanu Reeves as the chain smoking cancer stricken Exorcist is the key performance, and the best. It is truly a revelation to Reeves fit so snugly into this role, for the first time I could not imagine him saying 'Whoa'. I've heard his performance likened to a modern day Shatner or Heston, and I think that's accurate. I am please to see that Reeves has finally found his calling as an actor, after being wasted over the years on romantic comedies and the Matrix sequels (He was pretty good as a man discovering the truth about the world and his role in saving it in the original Matrix, but I don't think he pulled off the part of the messiah in action in the latter two.) and here he really shines.The script is above average at best, but the moody sets, pacing, and Reeves' performance keep it from burning in the same fires as 'Elektra'.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
From one of the books which started it all...Occult Thriller,"In the 90s lots of stuff emerged from graphic-novels like HELLBLAZER (from which this movie was made) and role-playing (KULT). You could say: Hellblazer is for Comics, what NEAR DARK is for Vampire Movies. Or Anne Rice for Vampire Novels: A fresh disrespectful approach in their own time. By now the ""adult-occult-thriller-genre"" has spawned lots of other movies and Comics like PROPHECY with Christopher Walken. So this is the ""original"" thing, but it's late, and its not that bad, if you know what to look for... . And its made BEAUTIFUL. Of course a movie has to place more into dynamics instead of Text and Inside-Jokes. But it gets the allover feeling. DO THIS: Read some Hellblazer-Graphic-Novel before going to the movies (HARD TIME or DANGEROUS HABITS) and you get more out of the movie. Without read before, it's like Lord of the Rings without Tolkien in the Background: You don't get the half of it. Always remember: the Movie is more than a comic book, it very often pictures the mythology of a whole genre (like the Lord of the Rings-Movies , like Matrix) and this is about the 90's occult stuff: From NEIL GAIMANs The Book of Magic (where Harry Potter originates together with Constantine, yes) over Garth Ennis PREACHER and of course to HELLBLAZER.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Better than expected,"From the trailer I knew it wouldn't be the comic-book Constantine, but Keanu Reeves' prosaic and typically deadpan performance grounds a movie that would otherwise be pure sfx schlock. It was also a treat to find a few more subtleties and nuances in the script than might be anticipated. Lots of nice supporting performances, too. I was especially fond of Peter Stomare.It was also nice to see that new (?) director Francis Lawrence jumped the learning curve and avoided the typical shortcomings of directors recruited from the music video arena. The movie's flow is quite good, the build-up to the movie's climax satisfactory and there are a few nice surprises saved for the end. Thankfully there's not the big revelation that many movies have recently become fond of.If you haven't read the comic, and are a fan of metaphysical good vs. evil conflicts (with big budget sfx that look great BTW), you'll find a lot to like in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
From pitch black class to pure camp!,"I'm always up for a story about that handles about demons and darkness, so I was pretty enthusiast in anticipating this ""Constantine"". It's the third comic book adaptation in row that centers on a anti-hero (after ""Hellboy"" and ""The Punisher""), men that are really not too keen on the supernatural powers they developed or were born with. John Constantine is a sinister private eye, capable of whooping demon-butt back to the depths of hell. His duty is to keep an eye on ""halflings"", beings that attempt to cross over the borders of heaven, hell and earth. When Constantine is approached by police woman Angela Dobson for help concerning the strange suicide case of her twin sister, they slowly discover that Satan's son is preparing his arrival on earth. Many people around this website seem to hold a grudge against Keanu Reeves but I really liked him in this role. The ""you-don't-like-it-go-to-hell"" attitude really suits him! Unlike many other 'critics' here, I really enjoyed the first hour of ""Constantine"" as it features a constantly ominous atmosphere, sublime black humor and even a few efficient and impressive shock moments (the cows!!). The images of hell, or simply the use of special effects in general, is well considered and very compelling while the interactions between Reeves and fellow unearthly creatures often leads to terrific kitschy fun. Unfortunately, but almost evidently, director Lawrence can't keep up this quality-level and the film sinks deep towards the worthless camp section. The twists then become more ridiculous, the cheese factor increases and the effects become more and more flamboyant. The only real aspect to enjoy during the second hour is a glorious OTT appearance by Peter Stormare (Fargo, 8mm) as Lucifer. ""Constantine"" sure isn't the turkey many people here claim it to be, but by no means it's an essential milestone, neither.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Keanu Reeves leaves the special yellow short-bus of acting,"This is an almost great movie. The world below versus the world above is always a good topic for a movie-if you do it right. Keanu Reeves has almost learned how to act. This is a good idea for a leading man. Keanu is a weathered and sickened extra-spiritual crime-fighter who can see through not only lousy alibis, not only through walls like superman, but can see through the impermeable walls between life and death-and between salvation and damnation. He is Superman times two. Imagine that. He is Superman with warts and all--spiritually. What a great fricken idea! A science fiction movie where all heaven and earth may be torn asunder. Your soul, dear viewer, is thrown onto-gambled- on the roulette wheel of all creation. There's a screenplay! Then there's Tilda Swinton-a miraculous actress-playing angel Gabriel-who tells Constantine: He's F***ked for all eternity! This is real solid journey into story-telling that transforms hell into Earth, and Earth into hell, and churns your stomach at every turn. Peter Stormare as The Devil is intensely vile. His performance is just stark-raving outstanding. All of this movie stretches your capacity to comprehend its sick intelligence and dire beauty. It is a descent into hell. You the viewer barely escape its awful world-view. It has a greatness, but an awful spiritual desolation. As I said: Tilda Swinton is a beautiful artist, as are all the actors in this sickly fascinating fable of spirit and damnation. It is a gigantic creation of weird reality which cannot be easily shaken off. I think Keanu Reeves has finally grown up as an actor. That is not a small thing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

I disagree,"OK.First off, I have never read the comics and to be perfectly honest I knew little to nothing about the film before I saw it. I didn't even know the story or much about the characters.I saw the film because it looked good. Turns out, very good. The special effects are top notch, and the whole portrayal of Hell looks really nice. I slight twist on an underground cave of fire and brimstone (but still keeping traditional elements). I don't want to go into much more detail because it might spoil it, but trust me, it is a visual treat. Also, look out for the glass.As far as the storyline goes, its quick, I think the whole film is contained in the time-span of one week or so, but there's a few flashbacks and conversations that explain the back-story. It really isn't hard to pick up, and it isn't that complicated, but it serves the purpose well. I'm not really sure what genre this film sits in, but it isn't really a horror, or a thriller, or an action movie (and it definitely isn't a drama). I guess its got aspects of each, but I'm sure its probably been classed as something weird like COMIC BOOK PYSUDO-RELIGIOUS EXERCISM ACTION-THRILLER.If you're religious and think this film may be blasphemous (appologies for poor spelling), it isn't. It does have a catholic theme, but only slightly. It is fiction. Remember that.The acting (except for the chas) is good, and Keanu proves he can do other roles than simply neo or ted. Kudos to him anyway for smoking all those cigarettes. If he ain't a smoker, that'd be quite nasty. Oh, and he ISN'T a detective as far as the film makes out. He's an exorcist.Its nice to see a DC comic made into a good film, and I hope it will continue with batman begins. Also, they took a risk making it a 15 certificate, to my recollection there isn't that many comic-film crossovers that do that (except the blade series), and it worked well. I think with the theme and the content, it would've sucked if it was made for little kids.This review probably isn't of any use to anyone, but I just wanted to rant on while I'm on my lunch hour. I'm gonna see it again. You should see it at least once.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Fun for what it is,"This movie does a pretty good job of combining action and effects. I enjoyed it. I can't compare it to the comic because, although I've read several of the Hellblazer comics, the series felt aimless, and I stopped pretty soon after starting them. What this film does well is to tell a bizarre story of a battle between demons and humans (with some angels to even things out) with some, albeit predictable, excitement. Unfortunately, it isn't consistent. Some moments in the film went so far beyond credibility that even the actors couldn't pretend to believe it anymore. A further problem, but a common one for the comic-book-turned-into-film genre (so we can't blame this movie for it) is some of the corniest lines ever. At one point, a demon talks about how much he wants one of the characters to die, and he uses the phrase ""finger-lickin' good."" Yes, the writers actually put that one in. The acting is sometimes good and sometimes not so good. Keanu Reeves does a mediocre job as usual and Shia Lebeouf plays the same annoying character he played in I, Robot. Rachel Weisz by far outshined all the others in the production, even though she stumbled over some of the more unrealistic exchanges. All in all, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it as a decent time killer at most.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Read the comic instead of paying for this movie.,"Lousy comic book movie that spits in the face of its comic books creators and basically makes it a potential franchise for Keanu Reeves. The movie fails on many fronts, including the main character that is the most underdeveloped character in the film and the script that lacks any sense what so ever. The direction is a joke and the visual effects are flat horrible. Some of the acting is good with Rachel Weisz doing what she can with the bad script she has to work with and she almost succeeds because she gives the movie its only real and compelling performance. Too bad the script really focuses on the lousy lead character instead of her and that's where the movies biggest problem is. You don't really give a damn about the main character at all and you really don't give a damn about his kid sidekick, who is just the most annoying character in the entire film.I don't know what went though the minds of the people who made this film but if there is a special part in hell for the director and the screenwriters of this movie, I hope they go there quick for what they did to such a great comic book.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A horror film with somewhere to go.,"Jonah Goldberg, editor at large of National Review OnLine, recently wrote that ""we couldn't appreciate that evil is real and it exists. In a society where everyone is a victim and it's not right to 'judge' others, there's not much room left for real monsters, while society itself becomes monstrous."" And so Hannibal Lecter is a ""charming rogue"" rather than a monster.A new paranormal action thriller, Constantine, brings us back to the days of discernible demons. An old Catholic boy like me truly enjoys any struggle between good and evil that features luminaries such as Lucifer, Balthazar, and Gabriel. Have minimalist actor Keanu Reeves play a supernatural detective with echoes of Matrix's Neo and the talented Tilda Swinton (The Deep End) a genderless Angel Gabriel and you have a horror film with somewhere to go, to Hades that is. These are monsters and angels I can see and love and hate and most of all, call them what they are.Reeves' lung-cancer-terminal John Constantine is from the Hellblazer comic book, a bad boy sleuth who has literally been to Hell and now chases half-breed Hell denizens back to where they belong so that he might win his way to heaven. His partner, Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), tags along to find out why her twin sister committed suicide in circumstances that have hellish affiliations. Beyond this summary lies a convoluted story about Constantine's attempts to keep a balance between heaven and hell that stops long enough for us to enjoy an over-the-top visit from white-clad Satan, played with obvious delight by Peter Stormare (Minority Report).The f/x is as impressive as any horror/thriller's out there today, and Reeves' performance is as one note as we have come to expect. His clothes, thanks to Louise Frogley's monochromatic costuming, are slick black, a complement to the noirish world of black and white. (For you purists, the comic book hero is made into a Los Angeles native allegedly because Reeves couldn't be counted on to keep a proper Brit accent for over two hours).The theme of good versus evil having been overplayed in our cinema, we are left with little but a titillating twist to keep us interested. So the interest for this Catholic boy is the idea that evil must exist in order for good to triumph. Constantine, therefore, tries to figure out how evil survives and why it must. Maybe he decides that without evil there is just a bunch of blue staters waiting for the second coming of a Clinton in 2008.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
For those of you that want a CGI version of hell...,"I Tivo'ed this and watched it with the idea it was really bad. It was not that bad. In fact it was pretty good. Yes the CGI is eye candy. Yes Keanu delivers his bad attitude lines in cheesy form. Yes the plot is silly. But if you look past those set backs you'll find some chemistry between Keanu and Rachel. I liked them together and the whole ""I'm in it for myself...except now that I met you I do selfless things, ala Han Solo"" thing has been done to death, but it works. I liked Keanu's character, bad boy, dammed to hell, trying to buy his way into heaven by banishing demons back to hell. That's new. I enjoy CGI when it's well done and relevant (liek here). 7/10 Not bad at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
I enjoyed it....,"I found this flick quite refreshing. It was interesting and the special effects were great! I quite enjoyed Hollywood's twist between God and Satan as well as the sense of humor displayed. Over all it was very entertaining and I would recommend that people see it. I was not aware of the plots origin, in the comic books; but I found the plot got my attention and held it for the entire time. I was also glad that it was rated R as I did not have to contend with so many young kids in the theaters. I read the negative comments before seeing the flick but went and saw it anyway and I would suggest others do the same. Then make up your own minds.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Nothing like as bad as everyone seems to say it is.,"I can't understand just why everyone insists on attacking this movie left right and centre. I'll admit even I'm ashamed to admit to liking a Keanu Reeves movie under normal circumstances- but you almost feel people slate this just because it's not 'ok' to like anything he's in.His passive acting style actually rather lends itself to this character because he's just a little bit arrogant, and I think it's nice to see Keanu really acting for once. It's a role that fits.Naturally Weisz is excellent ( when is she not?) pulling out a great emotional performance and the supporting cast ( including surprisingly creepy Gavin Rossdale and hauntingly androgynous Tilda Swinton as Gabriel) were all nothing short of brilliant and held this movie together admirably.Although the plot might not have been wonderful, and might have been a 'dishonour' to the original comic- you just have to admire this movie for what it is. A good enjoyable action movie. The special effects are nothing short of lovely. Since when has it been a crime to have a movie with good effects?I found it entertaining and enjoyable. Give this movie a chance, it's nothing like as bad as they insist it is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Rather be in hell than to sit though this again.,"Super dumb Keanu Reeves horror film lacks the mind bending fun of the matrix movies and has instead a lackluster core that makes this film as hollow as a helium balloon. Keanu gives a very tired and unsparing performance that does drag the movie down most of the time and the script lacks a voice. The second half of the film manages to go against what the first half establishes and the last thirty minutes absolutely makes no sense what so ever because it has a certain revelation that makes no sense what so ever and leave you wondering on what the hell just happen. The rest of the cast is solid with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Peter Stormare which the film does not expand on and the script does not give more time to because it only wants to focus its energies on Keanu's bad attitude than the real actors that are in the film.What a shame.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Worthwhile trip to the cinema given the competition this time of year,"First of all, disregard any comments on this film that compare it the comic book Hellblazer. Honestly, I would be surprised if one typical movie goer out of every cinema this movie fills up has read the comic book, and much less is a die hard fan of it. Forget that the ""original"" story takes place in London and all that crap. Those not familiar with the comic book are just fine with the fact that this story takes place in L.A. - and in the states. Secondly, I must use a disclaimer that I am a fan of Reeves. I think these roles are what he was born to do. Now, what worked in this film are the acting, direction, and visual effects. Those points alone are what places this movie head and shoulders above the typical PG-13 ""horror movie"" sewage that has been leaking into the theaters this month. Where this movie lacks is the script. We are thrust into the life of John Constantine with very little preparation or introduction. He is a fascinating character and it would've been cool to see how he grew into the person he is when this film begins. The story is also a little convoluted and has subplots that are not developed enough. The ""cool stuff"" in the movie is done very well, but there isn't enough ""cool stuff"" and there is a lot of downtime. Props to the crew for presenting a unique and ""wow""-inducing depiction of Hell. A better plot would've worked better, and you still could've had all the ""cool stuff."" Nevertheless, if you've seen all the Oscar contenders by now, then this is worthy of a checkout - much more than the silly teen horror flicks that dominate the theaters this time of year. Sequel? I'm up for it. But how about a prequel? It would work just as well.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good Acting and Interesting Material,"Rachel Weiss does a great job acting as usually. Tilda Swinton gives a great performance as Gabriel. Keanu Reeves, in one of his more darker roles, does 'okay' in this film.

The visual effects and imagination displayed by the movie was excellent.

My Comments,"Now first off I am a huge HellBlazer Constantine fan ,and unlike most I loved it,I went to go see this as I go and see all comic book films with an open mind i prefer to see them as alternate universes,like the same characters in a different world where things happen differently ,frankly I like Keanu Reeves's acting he is certainly not the best actor but he has grown by leaps and bounds (watch point break sometime),and while not my first choice on who id want to see as Constantine he works well within the story . oh and another thing you people need to relax yes the movie has Religious overtones but Jesus its not saying ""belive this it's real"" it was just a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"The man tries to gain redemption for a previous suicide by sending evil beings back to hell, the only soul the devil would come up to claim himself","I had read some bad reviews on this movie so I wasn't expecting much but this movie was well worth it. I had read the comic book a few times but found it hard to keep focused on. This movie actually kept my attention pretty well if with the Ted Theodore Logan in the lead. He did well and I think it is definitely better than if Nicholas Cage had been in the lead. Reeves will be contantly remembered as the guy who never showed any emotion in anything he ever did. While watching the matrix I kept waiting for him to whip out a wild stallions reference or maybe melvin the oracle. Oh well maybe he learned too much from Lawrence Fishburn about how to be to serious. Back to Hellblazer here, it was worth the watch and takes itself just serious enough to have fun. The graphics weren't real commercial and the characters were engaging. The story was easier to follow than I was expecting and you actually find yourself cheering for certain characters at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Solid film,"There has been much savagery leveled against Constantine's re-imagining of the comic book Hellblzer. It's re-location from London to LA, and its disregard for John Constantine's Liverpudlian origins are actually artistic decisions which in some ways benefit the film. Constantine's LA is a dark, seedy place of insidious characters and shadowy alleys and Constantine's hard-drinking, hard-smoking paranormal private dick is played relatively straight by Reeves. It is beautifully shot by Phillippe Rousellot and the effects are also noteworthy with interesting designs and an inherent quirkiness in the execution of set-pieces (Constantine's bizarre method of entering hell through the use of cats and foot-baths and knuckle dusters inscribed with holy crosses etc)that holds the interest. There is some fine support from Rachel Weisz, Djimon Honsou and Tilda Swinton, and Peter Stormare excels in his brief appearance as Lucifer (worth waiting for). Despite some drastic alterations to the source material, it is best to make your own mind up with regards to Constantine as it is worthy of praise (it is Francis Lawrences first film). It is an underrated film that deserves a certain cult status.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A lot of fun,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's more a story of a human being with no redeeming characteristics, save a significant hatred of evil, and I find that oddly appealing. John Constantine's journey toward heaven or hell is effectively portrayed as the human journey we all have to take, with of course the requisite explosions and great special effects. Shia LaBeouf's character is as fun to watch as he always is, though I wish he had more screen time; hoping that that will happen in the inevitable sequel. The opening scene is particularly potent, and a warning that the usual rules of a horror movie will not be followed. A great deal of fun for those looking for a good time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
It's a good movie but it's a matrix type,A good movie from Francis Lawrence but it's a Matrix type of film if you seen Matrix u can say that you've seen Constantine 2.The same 2 battles good and evil on earth this time is the battle between Haven and Hell. Keanu is playing excellent his part (John Jonstantine) (a kind of chosen one)is sick and he must go in hell and the devils can't wait to hes appearance in hell because he sent half of them back in hell from earth.The special effects are good but it could be better there are no science fiction moves like in matrix and that its a good thing i say.

"Please, this movie was horrible.",Awful and down right degrading horror crapathon that has Keanu Reeves redoing his Matrix role for a supernatural tale that makes no sense in what it was trying to accomplish. The screenwriters of this film look like they were making all of this up while they were going along and the cinematography is murky at best. Not even the special effects were up to what they are in terms of what is standard now and you can see how bad they look once you see some of the demons are in the light. Some of the acting is very good with Rachel Weisz doing much more than she should have for this movie but the movie falls on the shoulders of Keanu Reeves and he rather be Neo than a real character.If you have nothing to see but I would wait for Video if I was you.,2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constantine,"We went to see the movie and loved it. The part I thought was funny was when John Constantine was going to heaven while giving Chaz a special goodbye. So if Chaz couldn't have him, heaven wouldn't either. That's why I guess he cleansed John's lungs and (John) was using gum to stop the craving. I say that if a person gives it bad reviews (because it's not their type of movie)to someone else, then I suggest the someone else to check out the movie themselves. They'll love it. It may be a bit confusing but it will be worth seeing. I love Keanu Reeves-great actor as well as Rachel Weisz. As to what I saw, I think there may be a sequel coming.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
An Entertaining 'Jumper' for the Religiously Inaccurate...,"Constantine is not what i thought it was going to be: And my assumptions of such a movie would be an action-packed, rapid-paced, 'thinker' movie. Well, if you are (or were) expecting the same kind of viewing experience, allow me to dispel a few of those thoughts.While watching this film, I was a bit surprised of how many horror techniques it used. Jump after jump of deafening noise, louder and more encompassing than the THX sound tests that blast through the start of some movies in and out of theaters. Reader, if you have not yet seen this movie and you DON'T like movies that make you jump, please do yourself a service and do not see Constantine.For those of you that can take a few jumps and blasting noise here and there, I think you may be pleasantly entertained by this flick--IF you are not somewhat knowledgeable of the Christian doctrine and Christian history. However, for these readers that do know quite about about Christianity and its ins and outs, then you might not be so pleased with this film. Constantine is more of a horror flick than a religious thought-provoking movie.If Christian historical inaccuracies lower your viewing pleasure, then I would think twice before seeing it. Then again, if you are looking for a movie that is visually rapid and rich at the expense of religious precision--Constantine is quite a find.Bottom line: Constantine is a good jumpy-thriller movie, but thats about all it really is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Nice images, good performance - stupid religious backdrop","This is exactly the kind of (pseudo-)christian dementia I find Baaaah - crosses and holy water again, and the common knowledge of the middle ages re-elevated to its deserved height as universal truth. Let's burn a few witches, folks! But if you want to appreciate the drama, you have to stuff the garbage at least once.Rachel Weisz and Keanu Reeves both deserve credit for their performances, but I can't help wondering why they signed on to this in the first place. The camera work is beautiful, so are the special effects, so once you manage to ignore half the religious crap, you can enjoy a good bit of light-weight horror show with a psycho-dramatic touch.I particularly like the character of Gabriel. Tilda Swinton plays her with glorious well-meaning arrogance, and her show of ignorance towards humanity is important to understand Constantine's self-pitying indifference and apparent cruelty. Weisz and Reeves make a nice pair. The plot isn't boring, though on second watch I would have wished for some real punches in the stomach that I was always waiting for, but that never came.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good,"This movie was excellent! I was raptured with it throughout the entire movie. Each scene grasped me and took hold and it was just amazing.

The graphics were just awesome. Once again, the graphics were awesome! The demons and other 'supernatural' beings just seemed to ""come alive"" on the screen and it literally stunned all my friends and I who went. Reeves didn't perform the way we wanted him to, however.

"Cool film, Keanu sucked though.","This was a beautifully filmed creep show. It reminded me of such thrillers as ""The Prophecy"" which also features rogue angels, the devil, and humans caught in the middle. The visuals had the right amount of noir decadence (the scenes in hell are especially trippy) and comic book kitsch (Constantine's holy cross shotgun). Not being a follower of the comic I found it to be entertaining and worth seeing.Even though Keanu's acting sucked I wouldn't blame it all on him. After all, Ifound his acting reasonable in the Matrix and a few other films. This director obviously has more experience with hip and flashy music video's than dramatic delivery. He had a good enough casting director to get a lot of good actors (Djimon Honsou for example)to fill supporting roles but he couldn't manage Keanu's canned expressions and inability to carry subtlety. Keanu can do OK if he's got a good coach, but he can't do crap w/o one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Either great or not.,"One of those films that you either like or don't. My guess is, that if you liked 'The Prophecy' (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114194/) you will probably like this one. The world depicted in the movie is reminiscent of the world in the RPG Kult, where another world lives in the shadows of our own.Keanu Reeves acting fits well in to the mindset of the character (at least what you would expect someone thats ""doomed anyway"" would act like). Most acting can be described as OK, but two actors stand out: Peter Stormare is probably the best Satan i have seen in a movie in quite some time and Tilda Swinton is excellent as Gabriel.I liked this one a lot, mostly because of the world described in it.

Constantine's plot line is amazingly fascinating, and while I'm a newcomer to the comics, I love the movie just as much as I love the Hellblazer comics. Keanu Reeves pulls Constantine off perfectly with a stoic, completely jerk-like character from the beginning, with enough biting wit that makes any girl swoon. (Constantine could exorcise me anytime. C'mon, who wouldn't like that black suit and loosened tie?) Rachel Weisz is also wonderful as Angela and Isabel, and she is a perfect compliment to Keanu's quiet, frustrated Constantine.

Had some promise but Keanu is miscast and the movie depends on the special effects way too much.,"The movie stars Keanu Reeves as a detective that deals with the supernatural who helps a female police officer fight against the forces of evil in order to save her twin sister's soul from the forces of evil. The story is OK but it lacks a bit of originality and some of the acting is not really that good. Keanu Reeves is miscast in his role and a better actor could have done more with it. Rachel Weisz does gives a very dark and wonderful performance that is really more complex than the film itself but the movie is more interested in special effects than to really focus on the other much better actors in the film and that's the movie's biggest mistake right there because the special effects are not that very good to begin with.

One of the coolest characters in the film is the devil; if only the horrid Blade Trinity could've been smarter in casting that character, it would've been a tiny bit better lol.I was entertained with this film; it's your basic popcorn film but it is definitely not one of those films I took with me when I left the theater.

Shelf your hatred of Canoe Reeves and give this underrated flick a chance.,"Over the years Canoe Reeves (Alright Keanu) has gotten a bad wrap. His problem is that he comes across as a bit of a dumb-ass - and perhaps he is - but where his films are concerned it seems that most critics see his name on the poster and immediately think ""rubbish flick"".In many cases they are spot on (ummm, The Lake House?), but I would argue that Constantine is a notable exception.Now instead of summarising the plot I'll touch on each of the main actors and how they went in the film. Not sure why I'm doing this, it just feels necessary here.Canoe – Pessimistic, even fatalistic. Canoe definitely ""puts in"" here and actually has a crack at making the film better.Rachel Weisz – Lends credibility to her role as the troubled Angie. Always gives the right degree of ""I can't believe this sh*t is happening"", and acts logically when needed.Tilda Swinton – Casting genius as Gabriel the androgenous Angel. I can't think of anyone that looks less like a male or female - but still appearing human - without surgery. She is also very effective in the role.Shia LeBouf – Should just f'n die. Why does Hollywood think he should be in every movie that they make when he has such an obvious personality deficiency? Gavin Rossdale – Mr Hollaback ""I was in Bush"" (the crappy British band kids!) himself is generally loathsome in reality, but he doesn't bring shame to the house Stefani built here as a demon.Peter Stormare – Hams it up to the hilt, but necessarily so.Djimon Hounsou – Lends a bit more credibility to a role that could have come out all Robin Williams-like.So why would I bother putting the above in when it has nothing to do with the film? Because without that I would just be describing a film in which the lead character is trapped in a battle between good and evil, with Keanu Reeves as the good guy, Shia LeBouf as his sidekick and the guy from Bush as one of the bad guys No way in hell that I would want to watch that based upon that info! But Constantine is actually quite good, it is dark as comic book heroes should be, (as Hollywood has finally learned with the Batman reboots and many others), it has the theological element that I am a sucker for, and it takes itself just seriously enough that you can fall for bits where they use a bucket of water and a normal housecat as necessary ingredients as a conduit to hell (!?!), and dress Satan in a nice white suit and have him literally spit his lines.(See that? I used the word literally correctly. Not like so many boneheads today who say things like ""Did you see that foul? He literally ripped his head off!"" as the guy who was fouled in this hypothetical rubs his bonce and walks away.No people. Literally means it actually happened.) So again rather than rehash stuff about paranormal fighting tools, exorcisms, the evils of smoking and how a club for the supernatural and occult has a bouncer who screens people with cards depicting things like ""A frog in a dress"", and ""Two rats on a bench"", I'll simply say this: Constantine has great visuals, the depictions of hell are particularly cool.I liked it.I'd actually welcome a sequel.I think everyone should at least watch it rather than seeing Canoe's mug on the poster and stepping to the right.(And I'll ignore the bit where the Mexican guy didn't hear the car coming. And why the driver didn't see him in the first place. The damn scene looked cool enough that I can set aside such logic.) Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. More than a 2 hour anti-smoking campaign, Constantine is one of the better comic book movies in recent years and in my view is underrated.Soapbox moment.I hated Shia Le-Boof from the first film I saw him in, I think it was I, Robot.

I'd rather go to hell than to see this movie again,"I didn't had a good feeling about this movie before i saw it. The trailer looked pretty good, but somehow it reminded me of Van Helsing. Trailers for this kind of movies show you all the good stuff and making you want more. The only problem is there isn't anything else. First of all, Keanu Reeves was miscast. After his Matrix sequels disasters he should have known this wasn't the right choice for him. He re-enacts his Matrix character on a level that you don't really see a difference between Neo and Constantine. The movie itself is boring, aside from maybe the first scene. The cgi, as seen in the trailer, is good but without a good story it is useless. The same problem happened with Van Helsing. No matter how good the effects are, if the story is uninteresting, people aren't going to like it. The only positive thing, and only reason to set through it is Rachel Weisz's performance.I would only recommend this to people who thought Van Helsing was great. If not stay away from this as far as possible",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"good, not brilliant but good","This is not as bad as other people have tried to make out. It has decent acting, decent special effects, decent story and is fairly decent. People say that Keanu Reeves is a crap actor but unless you are intent on looking for every little mistake, he isn't really. Maybe Americans are just too picky about their films but all of my friends, us all British, liked it. There was a group of pensioners, 70/80+ who seemed to be enjoying it. Seriously, it could have done with a bit more structure but, if you are looking for a good evening, this should do.Good points - Fun, (occasionally) funny, story is good, special effects are impressive.Bad points - Not very well held together, some characters are a little too left out of the story, some parts are hard to understand.Go and see it.

The battle between good and evil...again.,"The latest in a long line of religious apocalyptic films 'Constantine'stands apart from its predecessors through its often ambiguous portrayal of good and evil. John Constantine embodies the anti-hero as a chain smoking cynic who knows of rather than believes in the existence of God. Stylistically alone, 'Constantine' is a film worthy of high praise. Director Francis Lawrence creates an atmosphere appropriately dark for the content, using cgi effectively without overdoing it. The cast is of course great, most notably Peter Stormare's cameo in the role of Satan. Rachel Weisz's performance seemed a little flat in some areas to me but Keanu Reeves seemed to take the character in his stride. Great for fans of comic book movies and well worth watching more than once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Sinful dark comic indulgence,"Yes, another ""balance of good & evil, god & devil"" story. However, it's one that has what Gavin Rossdale's half-breed wicked character said ""finger licking good"" cosmic downfall feel.

Was worth waiting for....couldn't't have loved it more!,"For me this film was absolutely worth waiting for. I have been waiting for this film since forever. It was absolutely worth it's wait. I can tell you that this film couldn't't be magnificent,but while obvious factors from 'Hellblazer' were not there, Keanu Reeves, sans blond hair and a British accent, couldn't't mess this up even if he wanted to. His acting was not top of the line, but then it ever is. Wasn't bad though, despite what people think. I got advanced tickets to this movie. I couldn't't go. I go to see it the instant day after it came out. I loved it, therefore I saw it twice. Loved it both times. This film absolutely rules and merits a 10/10.

The Web of Spiderman, etc. etc. and now the Spider Man from India, is it so hard to place Constantine in California? I think not.

A Rather Pleasant Surprise,"I didn't know what to expect, but came out quite satisfied.I'd heard mixed reviews, some calling it a pointless special effects movie while others called it a very finely executed comic adaption with visual splendors. I'm also not familiar at all with the comic series or whatever that its based on, so I'm not going to be influenced at all in that aspect as it seems a lot have been. I actually rather don't care if it was a good adaption or not, on its on its a very entertaining movie.At first it seems like there's a lot of different random occurrences that don't seem to connect and just feel like their out of place and totally irrelevant and some of these scenes end up being so. But I find that them as a whole work together to sort of give you the crash course of entering into this Occult world. A little ways into the movie I was slightly put off by not really fully understanding some concepts, but by the end I felt things came together very nicely.Don't be put off by all those people saying this movie is terrible, its not perfect but it is still a worthwhile endeavor if you are in anyway fascinated by the concept/topic or 'fantasy movies', but if you're just looking for a pure non-committal action movie you might look else where.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Okay,"I SWORE I wasn't going to see it.See, I was a HUGE fan of John Constantine: Hellblazer in my comic days.I really don't mind Keanu, sometimes he can act.But just by watching the trailers I KNEW I was going to hate it.The biggest problem is that John Constantine is British, Blond and a HUGE a$$hole. Not to forget that in the books his name rhymes with ""valentine"" not ""Ovaltine"". I used to think that Sting was a perfect match (in his younger days). My modern choice would have been Jude Law, but they didn't ask me.But Mrs. Hob wanted to see it and well, I am the kinda guy that just HAS to sniff the spoilt milk.Well surprise surprise. I actually liked it.Sure they moved John to LA and changed his looks and nationality. Keanu does play him pretty good - though not as angry or as big an a$$hole, but I can honestly say I could accept it as a ""version"" or ""riff"" on the character.As for the story - straight out of the comic!!! Not literally but figuratively. I actually felt like I was watching the comic on screen (aside from the main character).I also liked that the director didn't necessarily fill in all the blanks or spoon-feed all the back story, and yet it was there.So in the end, I liked it. A bit slow in spots, but never afraid to take its time.WARNING: If you cannot reconcile the choices made in redefining John Constantine - avoid this.

Lousy horror film.,"Pretty bad special effects opus that insults more than entertains with a script that is full of clichés and inconsistencies. Keanu Reeves is a OK actor when he's not faced with something challenging but he's criminally miscast as the detective who has a hand on the pulse of the supernatural. His presence lacks credibility and the reading of his lines of painfully funny in the wrong kind of way. Rachel Weisz on the up side does more with her character than the movie does with itself, giving a haunting and powerful performance that is WAY too good for this movie. She almost does too much for this film, while the film really does not do anything for her at all, that's how good she is. Shia LaBeouf is alright but his overdoes his comedy stick way too much for his own good, making him more annoying than useful and Djimon Hounsou is criminally underused in a stereo type role and he's way more talented than Keanu himself. The special effects were decent and some of the cinematography was great in showing the aspects of hell but with out a good a script or a real leading man, the movie is only held together by Weisz's performance but she like the audience is let down by the climax, which really pulls the rest of the film apart and makes it into a three ring circus.Wait for DVD instead.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Pretty Good,"If you were only going to see one movie this year...it wouldn't be ""Constantine."" But, if you're normal and can see more than one movie (who would resign themselves to that, anyways?), I'd recommend this one. Keanu Reeves's character, John Constantine, seemed heavily Neo influenced. Not that this is a particularly bad thing, it just seemed like Reeves has now been cursed to only be cast in Neo-esque roles. This aside, the rest of the cast was amazing. Both Rachel Weisz and Tilda Swinton gave extraordinary performances. As for the special effects, they were really amazing. I'm not sure what some people were thinking when they said they were horrible. The special effects artists did an extremely good job at knowing when enough was enough. While the movie did have it's flaws (which I can't say here, since it would reveal too much of the movie), it was still enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Just like a diesel it only heats up in the end,"I'm not that familiar with the Hellblazer comic series, which this film is based on. I think this helped me keep an open mind free of any unrealistic expectations especially about the characters. One thing though that was surprised was the lack of many elaborate, gut-wrenching fight scenes.Also given that most movies adapted from comic books are fast paced this started at a snail's pace. A lot of talking and introduction of characters. However as the minutes came and went the pace picked up and the elements, which seemed insignificant at the start came into place to provide a good climax.Also given that this was adapted from a comic book I really was not expecting that a very deep storyline but surprisingly it was certainly above average and was quite intelligent for it's class.My major gripe about this film was the acting performance of the actors particularly of Keanu Reeves. I never really rated him as an actor and found him one-dimensional. This movie further reinforced that belief. Most of the lines he delivered were rather flat with little emotion shown. The others did well enough but I felt Reeves overshadowed all of them given his significant screen time.The effects I thought were fine. Nothing as extravagant perhaps as LOTR but nonetheless effective given the purpose. Cinematography I thought was ordinary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Adequate movie getting a bad wrap,"There are two things weighing this movie down for most everyone (everyone snobby anyway). there is a) the fact that it's based on a comic book to which it is disloyal, and b) the fact that keanu reeves is in it.to address a: i'm sure the comic ""hellblazer"" is terrific and don't let me be the one to tell you not to bother with comics, it's just that i'm a movie-oriented person, and the movie constantine was pretty good regardless of what might have been different, or even better in this comic i never read.to address b: ho ho he sounds like a surfer. ho ho he's an airhead. that was funny to say back in 1992, but he's had a long tenure acting and he's not bad at it. just lay off the man and enjoy the movies.the rest is all just a fairly good action movie. there are several real eye catchers like a guy getting hit by a car in the beginning, with unexpected results. the exorcism. some other stuff later.there's an appearance at the end by a character and actor you probably won't expect(unless you check the cast in advance). i was delighted by both.the action isn't all-out guns blaring brainless junk. it's more subdued and there's a lot of time between these scenes. sometimes there was a feeling of void where more action might go, just to balance out the deliberately slow pace. one more scene would have probably done it.and sometimes it does feel kind of silly, but hey that's what you're paying for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Constantine- So-So,"Well saw the film, wasn't expecting much cause of the fact Keanu is the most lifeless actor going at the minute, granted the Matrix was one of the best films ever created, but EVERY other film his acting has been lifeless, pointless like he doesn't care, and never guess what the same is with this. The main good point is Weisz, she is fantastic, shes so underrated and should be an A-List actress, she has a perfect voice she does over or under do her parts, The Mummy 1 & 2, Runaway Jury, Constantine you name it she pulled her parts of flawlessly.The actual story i found real interesting, i have ever read a comic luckily never realised till after i watched it, cause if i had known i would have started on a downer cause there's just so many comic to film movies i would have just passed by this film, but i didn't, and even though Keanu was terrible i did enjoy the film to a certain extent The plot was clever, i thought it was put together well, scenes were amazing, special effects are some of the best in this category of film I've ever seen. The demons, not what i expected yet thats what makes them so good, i never expected them to look that good, a very clever idea. The whole idea of the backstabbing angel, a great idea that not many would have thought of happening.All in all a perfect film, perfect that is except for the main character, he let the whole film down, he lost 4 points out of 10, thats right 4, i think for this kinda film the main character is a key part of the film (i know like most) but with Keanu acting it just ruined the film i think.I will watch it again but not soon, and not in a hurry 6/10 from ToonD",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

For some reason, I gave it a shot, namely because that the theme is always intriguing and tempting. The internal conflict that John Constantine has certainly linked both sides, Evil and Good, although it caused him being almost devastated from inside.Well, I guess, it would take an entire psychological study to find out what is inside the man when trying to find the way out...or in...

Much worse than I expected,Mind bending stupid horror film that lacks any form of common sense what so ever with a script that was looked like it was written by a ten year old with dialog only a child could understand and a leading man who is as bad an actor as they come. Keanu Reeves can't act if his life depended on it and his performance here proves that in spades. The special effects are not really good and the direction seems forced in some places. The only performance of merit that this film has is from Rachel Weisz who does much more with her character than she needed to and she does lift this film pass much of it's problems but a good actor can do only do so much with out the help of the director or the rest of the cast and she's basically by herself in this film in terms of good acting.Avoid.,1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The Matrixorcist,"Demon fighter John Constantine, who literally has been to hell and back, battles it out against various creatures of the night in an effort to ""buy"" his way into heaven.

Based upon a comic book, it suffers from an overload of exposition regarding characters and events. It never really evolves from being an introduction to a full fledged feature film. Still, I couldn't help liking it anyway.The film looks great, for starters. It's dark and moody, the settings are pretty much stripped down to the bare necessities, and ...well, I kind of like that. The camera work gives the film an edge that works very well and makes it interesting to watch. Style over substance can be quite disastrous, but here it works just fine.The acting is OK, I guess. Keanu is very uneven, though. Sometimes he really seems to be struggling, but from time to time, he's actually very good. I found Constantine's character pretty interesting, with a not always likable persona. I definitely wouldn't mind seeing more of him and the world he lives in. Of course, it would be nice if they could focus more on the script now that all the introductions are out of the way.

Effects hurt it,"A great idea and theme was hurt by over the top digital effects. Although the scenes in hell were quite effective and cool, getting attacked by cartoon demons looked really bad. It should have been a lot more subtle and metaphorical with the whole ""good vs. evil"" theme but I suppose in order to be a blockbuster it had to try to appeal to the masses and be as literal as possible. Aside from the obvious similarities to The Matrix, there is a lot of great ideas in this movie that really delve into theological history. I never really got absorbed into this movie though and it could have been a lot darker in tone and in presentation. This film has nothing to do with film noir, but for some reason that is how it is often being described. Also, the sidekick that Constantine has is utterly pointless and was obviously thrown in for comic relief. Tilda Swinton is awesome as Gabriel and Rachel Weisz is quite effective as a torn detective.

It's not the actors fault.......,"I don't really know where to start. To be honest I really had expected more from this movie. People here seem to blame it on Keanu, though I don't think that's fair. He did what was required , nothing less nothing more. And no one in the movie could have been much better then they were considering the lousy dialog they were given. And believe me when I say that Keanu can be good, everyone who has seen The Gift knows what I'm talking about. It's sad that Keanu doesn't get more parts like that, that brings out the best in him. This is not an original script at all, and i'ts a bit silly in many parts of the movie. I felt like they wanted to make Constantine to James Bond, only that he was an exorcist, which I didn't like. I wanted something more new and fresh from this movie that I didn't really get. But it is entertaining, and it can bring out a few laughs from you, and it's not like you're falling a sleep during the movie.

Scattered pieces of brilliance . . . but could have been better,"Constantine has all the great elements of an amazing film: a moving plot, a convincing and fallible hero, moments of creative dialogue, and a profound philosophical message. However, despite being able to point out all of these elements, the movie still comes across as being only marginally good and by no means amazing. Somewhere in the process of making this film, the instruction manual for good movies was lost, and all the pieces were thus thrown together haphazardly. And it almost works. Constantine almost achieves the amazing emotional fulfillment that great movies offer, but it somehow falls short. Numerous unrelated events deviate from the otherwise powerful storyline, and you feel like you are reading an essay about the meaning of life where entire paragraphs have been devoted to something completely unrelated. These distracting elements are not unforgivable, but they do take the focus away from the powerful themes of life, death, redemption, purpose, and justice.So, if you want a movie that deals with these themes in a less-than-perfect way while offering a few thrills and scares along the way, Constantine is for you.

The movie was terrible.,"Moronic and down right boring Keanu Reeves vehicle is an insult to your senses. The movie is shot way too dark in certain scenes of the film and the special effects are tepid at the very best. Keanu Reeves gives his all but regardless of his efforts, he's not right for the role. His performance borders on way too dark to unintentionally funny plus he looks bored with what is going on. You're supposed to believe in his character but you end up just annoyed with him and that not good if you're trying to buy the story of the film. The story itself is very shaky and it makes no sense in some parts of the film. Angles and demons can't cross over into this world but yet there are half-breeds all around the city and the angle Gabriel is walking around like nothing is happening. It makes no sense but that's some of the inconsistencies this movie has and it has too many of them. The only good thing of merit that the movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a complex, strong and moving performance that gives you a brief pause and makes you wonder on how this movie could have been much better off if they just centered it around her character alone, with out all the hoopla and special effects that it has now. That would have worked much better and been much more effective than the overblown special effects movie that it is now and probably would have been much scarier to boot.

Not quite the comic but a hell of a story,"Movies never come out as the comic book dictated (unless you've seen Sin City) so OK, Constantine isn't British anymore and things changed and blah blah... one previous reviewer commented that the devil didn't look 'scary' enough. i guess he forgot Lucifer used to be an Angel..?This is a really good movie and adaptation, i enjoy Constantine's view of the Devil's deal with God as utter hypocrisy, but the film also made me totally believe in confession and absolution (for a couple of hours anyway). The depiction of the half-breeds, angels, demons and the devil are spot on, in following the tale between heaven, hell and earth. This film is never preachy it doesn't tell us our path, it simply follows the poor bastard Constantine whose path has already been destined.I got some genuine hide-under-the-covers frights out of it, the music, the performances, the settings... to me it all said Hellblazer. But it also reminded me often of Devil's Advocate, i felt this film stood alongside that one well, climbed far above it in some cases, certainly the mythology of this film is far more in depth and ready to spawn many a sequel. Keanu Reeves is not my Constantine, but his previous dalliances with the Devil, make him well-placed to play this role and bring a bigger audience in.

If someone who's never read the comic it's based on can enjoy it as much as I have, then it definitely has something.The reason it made my top ten? A few reasons, in no particular order: #1. A quality supernatural element. It took itself seriously, had good 'rules', and the look to it was original; a hard thing to accomplish these days. #2. Great script. There were one or two moments of lacking dialogue (Balthazar just wasn't threatening and this showed it off), but the rest of it really shined. #3. Special effects. They were terrific. The look was unique, and the tricks they pulled off haven't been done a dozen times over. #4. Great characters. Keanu Reeves as a bitter anti-hero. Rachel Weisz as a woman thrown into the supernatural with unbelieving eyes. Shia LaBeouf as the plucky apprentice looking to prove himself, with GREAT comic timing. Shia has a gift, and he got to show it off. Well done, Shia. Peter Sormare as the Devil himself, who couldn't have done a better job. #5. The details. Keep your eyes open when you see this flick. So much heart and work went into the small work of detail that I was beside myself, I enjoyed it so much.Go see this movie. Go see it. Go. See. It. It won't win many Oscars, but it certainly won a place in my movie collection. Now to wait for the Director's Cut...",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Decent film, but still full of holes","To say the least, Constantine wasn't as bad as it could have been. Any film with Keanu Reeves attached to it seriously has a potential Razzie nomination waiting in the wings. But this time around, the film wasn't too bad.The obvious put downs will be Keanu's rather pitiful acting, which ranged from horrid to downright hilarious. But what proved to be even more annoying was the fact so many people talked in whispers. Speak Up!! Also, a couple of miscasts must be called out, especially with Shia (can't spell his last name) and Gavin Rossdale. Everyone else seemed to fit their roles all right, but those two could have been left on the cutting room floor.But then again, their are plenty of good things. The story was complicated and interesting, which kept you within the story as opposed to being lost in an array of explosions and big-breasted women. All of the occult stuff within the film was also quite engaging.I guess in the long run, this will be one of those films that will be okay to watch and pick at, just maybe not one you want to buy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Creative, thought provoking tale on good/evil, god/Satan, heaven/hell....you get the point","Saw this movie at a preview screening in Houston. I was extremely hyped up for the movie from all the trailers and TV spots. Read a few reviews that weren't very flattering, but I digress.The movie was pretty cool. It was more story than action, which was a bit of a let down for me because from all the promos i thought it was an action movie. But it didn't kill the whole me for me. It had a really good story, the comics seem interesting and i'd like to get into it. but other then reading on the net about it, i never heard of the hellblazer comics.bottomline: if you want a see a movie you'll have fun watching, check it out. Don't see this movie if your expecting Matrix 4, its a movie all on its own.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Well worth viewing,"Yes, yes...I know that there are a ton of people out there that will say that the film is not faithful to the original comic series. As is often the case with transferring printed works to screen, compromises must be made simply because they are of two different mediums. As a film, Constantine works. It has an engaging story, excellent visual effects, and fine performances from all the actors save the principal, Keanu Reeves. Unfortunately, Keanu should have never be given the lead in this film as, well there is no easy way to say this, he simply cannot act. If you can't make an audience believe you are coughing, then it's definitely time to go (back?) to acting class. Personally, I would have thought Clive Owen would have been a much better choice to play the lead, but such is life. It will be interesting to see what path the studio executives choose to take for the sequel, and of course there will be at least one sequel. Hopefully, they will take a lesson from the two pieces of tripe spawned from the Matrix and focus on story, character development and acting first. These elements, rather than star name branding, should ensure a successful movie franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Well done.,"A well done movie. It was exactly what I was expecting: a cool supernatural-hero movie with a film noir feel. Reeves did a good job at playing a character most don't seem to do right.The movie is based on a comic-book called Hellblazer I believe. I have not read the comic, but I have heard about it. As far as I can tell, this is a LOOSE translation (which would make sense why they changed the name) of the comic books, but a well done movie in it's own right. Unfortunately, with only a 2 hour running time, and a lot of material to cover, most of the supporting characters feel thin and placed for the convienience of the main characters. If you look closely however, those supporting character do have a good amount of depth in what little screen time they receive. A good year 2005 start in my humble opinion.P.S. Of course the movie is cheesy. Hell, Star Wars is cheesy, Indiana Jones is Cheesy, James Bond is cheesy, E.T. is super cheesy. Who cares if it's cheesy; this movie was well made, well acted, good looking, and cool (if a tad thin on plot details).",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
It was so so. see it for the heck of it.,"I must say that I was skeptical of a biblical based action film, but for a Hollywood representation of the battle of angles vs. demons I was impressed. This film wasn't the greatest thing to grace the big screen but I will give it the points for good ideas and a couple of really interesting camera shots. The acting was decent but probably could have been better. I'm not saying that Keanu Reeves is a terrible actor but this film felt like another Matrix style rehash. Of course this film had to have the plucky sidekick played by that dude from Even Stevens which I thought was completely unnecessary. Basically his character just didn't seem to fit. The presentation of both story and visuals was good. The use of creative camera shot and CG, and a semi-decent developing story line leave this film open for your own opinion. In conclusion this is more of a one-time theater experience to be shared with friends or family. Either check it out once in theaters or wait to be a rental because you are really not missing much. It's not a bad film, but it's certainly nothing special.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Yes, the movie is that bad.",Lousy and extremely moronic Keanu Reeves sinker is as dumb as they come. Keanu is awful in his role and his performance is a real joke and most of the movie is as bad as he is. The only actor who does give a good performance is Rachel Weisz and she is really giving her all to this film but she's let down by a script that is really badly written and a cast that does not rise above the horrible writing. I think the movie would have been better off like many suggested before with her as the lead and it would have worked better if that was the case but its not and we have this film. A special nod does go to Peter Stormare and Djimon Hounsou for at least trying to do their best with their lousy characters but nether of them are in the movie very much.Not much to celebrate now isn't it.,1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
more interesting is the vehemence of some of the reviews,"I'd seen this on DVD the other night and came here curious about its reviews. What's interesting to me is how vehement the hate is. Why? There are plenty of bad movies. This is one of them. But I don't see that this is really that much worse than the usual slop. But I suppose, not being familiar with the comic and so not feeling betrayed, I can't make myself rise to indignant righteousness over a supernatural-themed mindless shoot-em-up spectacle. And it's hard to get really incensed about the acting (de)merits of Mr. Cool Breeze. Yes, he looks far too sleek here to make believable any real pain or even that disheveled gumshoe cliché of world-weary see-you-in-hell antipathy. But the man is not a character actor. We all know this. Or should. So, doesn't it make all of this disgust over his expressionlessness just a little... gratuitous? As if one expected him to emote??! Actually, I enjoyed his deadpan style in this movie. It made me laugh several times. I don't know if it was his (or the director's) intention, but sometimes the studied deadpan delivery of standard noir gestures and lines made them almost ironic. He does not do either the heartfelt drama or the highbrow very well, but I think he's perfect for these slightly self-conscious and heavy-handed caricature-roles. Incidentally so does Tilda Swinton also seem well-suited to such roles. I thought she looked stunning. The only miscast, ironically, is Rachel Weisz whose lovely performance was altogether too human, touchable, real, and vulnerable for this sort of thing.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"The climax involves something similar to what Keanu Reeves experienced in ""Devil's Advocate.","The movie seems like it runs a lot longer than its two-hour duration, and depending on how engrossed you are into the story I imagine you might believe otherwise. The special effects are first-class, allowing us long glimpses of Hell and its demons. And while I still say the best visual description of Hell is found in the Robin William flick, ""What Dreams May Come,"" ""Constantine"" is a sweet-looking spectacle.The weakest part of the film is the detective character. Even though essential to ""Constantine's"" plot, I did not like Angela's story or believe she was a necessary character to tell John's tale. When you see the film, pay close attention to how Angela responds to what she learns early on about the war between Heaven and Hell and compare that to her big revelation near the climax and see if it makes much sense. It's a minor plot hole but sticks out if you too do not find yourself liking the female sidekick.But ""Constantine"" is unique in that the Heaven/Hell genre is so little explored and rarely does it delve into the controversial aspects of Catholicism. So few films care to talk about the place you ultimately end up at if you don't declare Christ as your Savior at any point in your life. But it's not preached so I'm sure nonbelievers and people of other faiths will find no problem getting into this story and sympathizing with a Catholic destined for eternal torture and suffering.One fear I had coming into the screening but was quickly put to bed was the fact that the movie was directed by one of those first-timers who's only experience is directing pop music videos. For a guy who's resume is limited to Britney Spears, Will Smith, Sarah McLachlan and Aerosmith, I'd say Francis Lawrence has a promising career ahead of him in film. He doesn't make that mistake so may MTV directors do when they hyper-drive the pace of their films by dissolving it into quick cuts and camera zooms.If anything, Lawrence keeps the pace slower than the norm, allowing the audience to absorb the brooding scenery and crisp special effects. Whether you appreciate the backdrop or not is the litmus test for how much moviegoers unfamiliar with the graphic novel will enjoy the movie.As you might expect the climax involves something similar to what Keanu Reeves experienced in ""Devil's Advocate,"" the first film he was in that brought his character face to face with Satan. Here the confrontation isn't nearly as long but gets the point across nicely.Because ""Constantine"" in print is a long series of graphic novels, there was no way all of it could be condensed into one film. Like the unbelievably bad Marvel screen adaptation of ""Hulk,"" the movie has to spend considerable time covering the basics, and perhaps that is why I believe it doesn't live up to its full potential. With the introductions out of the way (and to be sure. worthy of an entire film by itself) I would not be surprised if an even better sequel is on the way.Stay seated through the end credits to see what is really the last scene of film, showing what happens to the character I left out of this review.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good Movie,"Not knowing that Constantine is an adaption of a comic book, I can say I enjoyed watching the movie.It was scary but not to scary. It was funny but not to funny. The movie was dark, but again not too dark.The demons trying to get into the world, to get the balance between heaven and hell out of balance where realized well.The scene where the devil takes out the tar of John Constantine's lungs and tells him ""You will live"" was really good.Because I don't know the comic book an which the movie is based on I can't make a statement of how good, bad or neutral the movie is. But I can recommend the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Attention Joss Whedon!,"Reeves does a decent Constantine, although the original character was portrayed as Sting from Police days.

Its great for what it is,"This movie is great for the special effects, the comic based plot, the acting of many supporting characters, and the fact that the only character Keanu plays well (the sort of Neo-esque troubled bad-ass) is a great fit in this movie.Don't go to see this movie for drama or comedy, cuz that's just foolish.Those that have some knowledge of the comics I imagine would enjoy it more since limited background is given. Ultimately, I went in curious to see what people were calling ""an even more religious Matrix"" and came out glad I saw it and planning on buying it on DVD eventually.It is very Matrix-like in the sense of awesome special effects, Keanu playing a character who fights characters that are stronger than human, and some interesting fight scenes.

All he (Keanu Reaves is Joh Constantine) wants is a reprieve,"Born with a gift he didn't want, the ability to clearly recognize the half-breed angels and demons that walk the earth in human skin, Constantine (KEANU REEVES) was driven to take his own life to escape the tormenting clarity of his vision. But he failed. Resuscitated against his will, he found himself cast back into the land of the living. Now, marked as an attempted suicide with a temporary lease on life, he patrols the earthly border between heaven and hell, hoping in vain to earn his way to salvation by sending the devil's foot soldiers back to the depths. But Constantine is no saint. Disillusioned by the world around him and at odds with the one beyond, he's a hard-drinking, hard-living bitter hero who scorns the very idea of heroism.

"Better than Spawn, I guess.","I never found myself feeling involved by the film (it never seemed like a problem to stop to answer the phone / make a sandwich etc.). It's pretty, with some nice effects, but not amazing. More a collection of scenes & images, with a threadbare plot linking one to another.The visuals are (almost) arresting - a post-apocalyptic (almost Terminator 2) vision of Hell with 'Lord of the Rings' style demons. Exorcist/Zombie style possessions. One shot of demons in the night straight out of 'Pitch Black'. Lucifer played not as a fallen angel, as a fat, odious looking evangelist. Gabriel as a tall, strong, somewhat androgenous figure (but still with nice hair and funky laced-flares white jeans). Balthazar(?) as a Jude Law-ish yuppie. Transitions / visions / premonitions are all very slick, but ultimately lightweight. The bug demon screams CGI, as does the floor dragging at the end. It's all a bit too 'perfectly rendered' and might have had more weight - literally and figuratively - if the effects were more a mix of CGI, make-up, modelcraft and puppeteering. Rachel Weisz seems to be stuck with some bad lines, an under-developed character, and avoids a blatant opportunity to take her clothes off. But this is Hollywood, where sex is evil but violence is cool. Keanu is Keanu, which I don't have a problem with, but doesn't bring much in the way of characterisation.Although a comics fan (including Vertigo) I never read Hellraiser, and cannot comment on the translation - but I won't be holding my breath for a sequel. And maybe it was my DVD, but the dialogue seemed very muffled and quiet - I even watched sections with the subtitles on. 'End of Days', 'Devil's Advocate' and 'Dogma' are all better films than Constantine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Really pretty bad.,"Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish. The story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up.Maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Great angel and demon story!,"I really liked this movie. It is the classic battle of good versus evil at a very personal level for Constantine and those around him. Born with a gift for such matters, Constantine fights the half-breed demons who try to persuade us mere mortals into doing bad things. And there is a major plot afoot involving the spear of destiny and the promise of hellacious things to come. Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine in a cool but cynical way. Rachel Weisz is excellent as a cop who is investigating the death of her sister, and Constantine seems like just the guy who can help - so why won't he? Excellent supporting roles played by Pruitt Talor Vince, Tilda Swinton, and all the others. Also, great camera shots. If you like angels and demons, that sort of supernatural stuff, you will like this movie!",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Pretty good movie. Keanu Reeves rocks!,"Constantine is a pretty good horror/thriller flick with Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz, whom won a best actress award from The Mummy, 1999. What a pair! The whole movie is about a man named John Constantine (Reeves), who has literally been to hell and back. Because of the life he has chosen, he will never enter the gates of Heaven. The only way he will get into the Gates of St. Peter, is self-sacrifice. Instead he tries to bring so-called 'half-breed' demons that came into earth, back into hell.Shia LaBeouf, Djimon Hounsou, and Tilda Swinton also star in this movie. Shia was the only one who brought comedy to the movie, but also the worst acting. Djimon Hounsou was great, and so was Tilda.The special effects were awesome! And so was the editing. I guess this is a good movie to buy on DVD, and is passable to watch a few times, but then it gets boring. It's still a pretty fun movie.But this movie has the most mild R rating. It would've went well with a strong PG-13 rating. The demonic images weren't really all that demonic or scary, and the violence was as bad as Mission Impossible violence. In my opinion, it should be rated PG-13 for violence, disturbing images, and thematic material. That's it.Constantine is a definite 6 out of 10. Pretty good.

Don't expect this to be another A-quality comic book flick...,"Much like the halfbreeds of it's plot, Constantine treacherously treads a thin line between a divide. The film isn't dark or deep enough to be considered along the same lines as the likes of Batman Begins, and at the same time it's not camp or over the top enough to be considered a 'fun' comic book flick. This is one of the main pitfalls for the film, as with this strange placing of the film; it has cut out both of the comic book audiences, and left itself with a film that is as muddled as it's lead actor's acting is weak. The plot seems to jump from one happening to another, often without any kind of explanation or logic. This makes viewing this film a very turgid experience, and the fact that the plotting is so carelessly done has also left the movie a good twenty minutes overlong; which only serves in making the film more painful. It's a shame that this film isn't better, as it has a plot that could have lent itself to a very fun flick. The plot follows John Constantine; a man that can see the demons that live among us. When policewoman Angela Dodson's sister apparently commits suicide, the two team up and discover a conspiracy beneath the surface of their native Los Angeles.Keanu Reeves often gets criticised for his acting, and for good reason - he's rubbish. He slinks his way through the film, giving the very same nonchalant emotion to every scene and event that he comes across. The good thing is that a downtrodden character like John Constantine suits him, so it's not as bad as it could have been...but on the other hand, if a talented actor were given the role; the film would have been much better. Keanu's ""Chain Reaction"" co-star, Racheal Weisz joins him again here, and pretty much does the same thing that he does - i.e. just 'appear'. You don't go into a movie like this expecting good acting really; but this film doesn't have even have 'acting'! The only performance I really enjoyed was Peter Stormare in the role of Satan, and that only lasted about five minutes. The special effects are typically dazzling, and while it's not the best CGI of all time; it's imaginatively used and provides the movie with it's main asset. It's a shame that this film is a flop, as the film noir elements of the plot could really have delivered something interesting, the subject of devils and demons always makes for fun viewing; and the recent run of comic book films has been quite impressive...but impressive, this film is not, and on the whole I recommend giving it a miss.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Relatively Amusing,"Honestly, honestly, the movie is pretty much a throwaway. Don't see it if you want a fantastic demonic movie--that would be the Russian release Night Watch.As it is, I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed Constantine--I watch it a lot, in fact. Not because the acting is fantastic, or even mediocre. Keanu Reeves has only two faces, it seems: deadpan and angry. And those two are pretty much the same. The only real change comes when he's hacking up a lung.The other actors are passable, Tilda Swinson and Gavin Rossdale as the angel Gabriel and the demon Balthazar (respectively) standing out particularly. Their characters were also, by and large, the most amusing. The possibly gender-confused (and slightly insane?) Gabriel is an almost pitiable character, while Balthazar simply oozes so much sex appeal that it's almost not fair.Mostly it's the vibrancy and the actually rather interesting storyline (though, undoubtedly, the movie owes that to the comic series) that carries the movie. Every scene has several details to note--the bar scene instantly comes to mind--so even when the viewer tires of watching Keanu Reeves refuse to change expression, there's plenty else to look at.Also, in spite of all the failings, it's a very thematic movie. If you want something spectacular in all aspects, don't see Constantine. You'll be disappointed. But, if you simply want a dark- edged film with nice effects and good attention to detail, you'd probably like Constantine.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
See it if you like the genre.,"Depending on how you view the subject matter and films based on comic books, this is either a movie you will love or hate. I've seen it twice already so you know where I stand. I thought the special effects were well done and the dialog to be above par for this type of movie (comic book). As for the acting, there are some very good performances which have been mentioned in other comments. However, regarding Keanu Reeves, I think that there must be some sort of hate club out there that has no other goal in mind other than to denigrate his acting. Granted he is not of the Robert DeNiro school of acting. Keanu is Keanu much the same as John Wayne was always John Wayne, Eastwood is always Eastwood, etc etc. And that is fine if you like his screen persona. I do, and I think he plays the title role with the right amount of sarcasm, fatigue, and a world weariness that comes across just fine. For those who continue to hammer on his performances, well everyone to his or her own opinion. He is of the stoic acting school and that is just as legitimate as the over-the-top-emoting school that you see from most actors nowadays. As I said in the beginning, if you like the subject matter (hell, damnation, demons, angels, etc) and like movies that are based on comic books (impossible yet engaging) and aren't a Keanu hater, then you will probably enjoy this film.

Dark Vision of Heaven versus Hell doesn't quite measure up ...,"When i say 'doesn't quite measure up' I'd better explain.If your idea of the dark side is the kind of world we are given with the Gothic Hollywood brush of 'Underworld' - or perhaps the more urban street-samurai style of 'Blade' - then you won't be disappointed.Reeves does a surprisingly good job of the quintessential wise-cracking anti-hero positioned between the forces of Heaven & Hell - and yes the SFX are pretty spectacular. The vision of Hell is particularly well done and a climactic end-scene with 'time-slice' photography and plenty of smashed-flying glass will keep even 'Matrix' fans happy.So why doesn't it measure up? Well if your dark vision of hell isn't quite so glossy & SFX based as all the above, then you may not be quite so impressed.In fact one of the problems lies perhaps in disassociating Reeves from his 'Matrix' character - add the sunglasses and he's pretty much there! And also a touch too 'Dirty Harry' or 'Snake Plisken' at times.And what is the obsession with the current crop of sci-fi/horror genre with faux-techno weapons? Both 'Blade' & 'Underworld' had their 'vampire-vaporising' guns...now we have 'Demon-destructing' crucifix-shotguns.But i'm afraid my main gripe is that I was a fan of the comics (oh oh comic geek) Whereas I could just about deal with the fact that the chain-smoking, hard-living, British occultist - with the signature ash blonde hair and pale trench-coat - was now a dark-haired American with an almost Armani sharpness to his image; I couldn't deal with the lack of bitter sarcasm and the fact that you were never sure in the comic books whether John Constantine would save the world or watch it burn to make a point. Reeves is made out to be too much the hero and not enough anti-hero; seemingly this version of the Constantine character wants redemption from heaven!All this aside there were some highlights - Tilda Swinton as the androgynous Gabriel, Djimon Hounsou as the enigmatic Papa Midnight and last but by no means least Peter Stormare as Lucifer. Now that was some great casting - the denouément between Constantine and Lucifer is probably the highlight of the film.Most of the male audience will probably enjoy Rachel Weisz's performance; she's an attractive lady and brings a real sympathy to her performance (as well as being in a wet T- shirt for the latter half of the movie!) But acting and screen-presence aside I found her character a little flat. And the less said the better concerning Shia Le Boeuf's interpretation of Chas, the East End Cab driver from the comic books, into some kind of plucky side-kick.In summary i felt like I did with 'Judge Dredd' - to quote another film dramatisation of a comic-book classic. Hollywood has done a decent job of shoe-horning about 3 or 4 great story lines from the comic book into one average action-packed script, made the 'world' convincing enough to uphold said storyline, added an implausible but nonetheless impressive weapon and some other paraphernalia, and updated the image to make it more palatable to a mainstream audience.But that misses the point with John Constantine - he should be unpalatable!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

I'm a comic book geek and a comic book artist and writer and I had no problem with the film or any liberties taken in reference to the book. I thought it was a good interpretation and above all that, I thought it was a pretty cool flick. Very different. Not quite an action pick, not quite a thriller and not quite a horror film... but more like a good mesh of the three. The pacing could have been better, but overall I liked the style of the film, I liked the dialogue and I even think Keanu Reeves did a good job (in light of being miscast). Same kind of feel Michael Keaton gave us in Batman... He did a very good job, but he's NOT Batman, no matter what.

Reeves back in the devil business,"Keanu Reeves is back in a familiar place, playing in a movie that is centered around God, angels, the devil, heaven and hell. This movie is a not too distant cousin of the much better ""Devil's Advocate"". Keanu Reeves plays Constantine, an irreligious man with the ability to see angels and demons, and also the ability to exorcise people that have been possessed. Constantine is a man torn: he knows about God and the devil, Heaven and Hell, yet he doesn't believe. He is also a man trying frivolously to earn his way into Heaven though he has been condemned to Hell for trying to commit suicide.The theme in this movie is not foreign at all, that being demons plaguing the earth, or some sinister plot from the devil, or in this case, the devil's son. This movie gave you a closer glimpse of demon activity from both, on earth and in Hell. The movie was intriguing from the standpoint of: what creature(s) will appear next, or what eerie event will occur next, and can Constantine save his soul? It is a decent movie with some intense scenes and interesting characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"if not for the supporting cast, this movie tanks","First off, I must express my deep dislike of Keanu Reeves as an actor...However, he actually does well in this film. His John Constantine is a really cool character...a true bad-ass.Constantine is based off the awesome 'Hellblazer' comics, and I've been waiting for a movie about these comics for a long time. The movie does not disappoint, but it does not strike gold, either. It follows John Constantine's (Reeves) efforts to enter heaven, using the method of repenting for his sins by means of exorcism of demons.The supporting cast of Shia LaBeouf as the comedic relief that is John's assistant, Oscar Winner Rachel Weisz as a detective who lost her twin sister to the demons, Peter Stormare as Satan, Djimon Hounsou as Midnight, a club owner, Pruitt Taylor Vince as a minister, and Tilda Swinton as the angel Gabriel is excellent, especially LaBeouf and Stormare. They both make you want to watch them the entire time they're on screen.The special effects are. Awesome You'll see a real depiction of Hell, which is just plain awesome. The weapons that Constantine uses are so cool, including the ""Holy Brass Knuckles"". You'll come to love Shia LaBeouf's character, and you'll see that he's really grown as an actor from his days on Disney's 'Even Stevens'. The direction of Francis Lawrence is pretty well done. I also enjoyed the film even more because I saw it on an IMAX screen. It's a good rent for the weekend, and for the die hard action fan, it's a good buy. I recommend this to anyone between the ages of 15 to 25, and the action fan. Lovers of Hellblazer might not like it too much, but it is still good.7/10 --spy",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Walk away, other than the good performances of Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare, there is really nothing to see here.","Bad special effects superhero movie that has possibly the worst performance ever by Keanu Reeves, who almost makes the movie as bad as his performance.

Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to give good performance in this bad movie and they do it with style. Both Weisz and Stormare work miracles with their stock roles and bring a level of professionalism to this other wise unprofessional movie. For that, I will not totally thrash this movie but its still not very good and you should wait for DVD and Video instead.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
More Over-Cooked Comic-Book Mayhem,"Just when you thought comic-book movies couldn't get anymore crazy and over-cooked, along comes Constantine to raise the bar again. There appears no limit to the ability of comic book - excuse me, graphic novel - writers to concoct wacko scenarios out of random bits of pop culture flotsam (a little Exorcist here, a little Chandler there, a dash of Batman); and there also appears no limit to the willingness of movie studios to exploit the supposed built-in audience for this kind of dark, freakish crap. On the surface it would seem a good strategy, taking works from one graphic medium and translating them into another, but the problem is that there's more to making good movies than just morphing comic-book frames into film images. It takes more than graphic style to make good movies, a fact that becomes painfully clear when watching something like Constantine, a film that's as mind-numbing in the playing out of its story as it is impressive in its visual design.The story isn't told so much as pounded into your brain. The protagonist, John Constantine, is one of these messed-up comic book anti-heroes, a guy who, if he weren't saving the world, he'd be off paying shrinks hundreds of dollars an hour to help him get over whatever childhood traumas were responsible for his being a sullen, chain-smoking wreck. As if Constantine's life weren't bad enough, he discovers that the earth is about to be beset by the minions of Satan's Son, and wouldn't you know it, he's the only one who can rescue humanity from this supernatural scourge. Or almost the only one. There happens to be another supernaturally-gifted character, a female cop named Angela (played by the always-succulent Rachel Weisz), except that Angela is in denial about her psychic gifts, not to mention being aggrieved over the recent suicide of her twin sister. Around these two complex-ridden characters swirls a world of pat comic-book duality, a world where heaven's representatives seek to balance the mischief carried out by the spawn of Hell - the kind of morally black-and-white world beloved of our two favorite Georges, Bush and Lucas. Not that you would expect moral complexity in a comic-book movie - it's not that easy to sell ambiguity to the masses (House of Sand and Fog was not a hit, in case you didn't notice). And neither would you expect restraint from a movie whose purpose is to sell itself as hard as it can to an audience made-up mostly of jaded action-movie fans, the kind of people who find Spider Man a little slow.Constantine gives these graphic novel drones everything they could want and more: angels and devils, swarms of winged demons, visualizations of Hell where the world looks like Hiroshima at the point of the explosion. What distinguishes the film is the outrageous extent it goes to in exploiting people's enduring fascination with religious imagery, paraphernalia and ideas. The Exorcist was once the last word in religious porn, but Constantine has usurped it. John Constantine is trying to buy his way into heaven after being condemned to Hell for committing suicide; Angela's sister Isabel was a devout Catholic whose soul is damned because she jumped off a building; Constantine's buddies are a psychic-priest and some other squirrelly guy who lives in a bowling alley and deals in rare religious artifacts (he has a copy of the extended bible, the one normally only found in Hell). It's hard, seeing how insistent the film is in selling its rather pornographic version of religion, not to be a little unsettled (especially when you consider how well this kind of stuff tends to go over with people who consider themselves religious), but it's not really crassness that does the picture in, it's plain-old Hollywood shoddiness. For all its outward gall the movie is rather pedestrian, the storytelling rather flaccid. The surface may be brimming with imagination, but underneath is the same old save-the-world jive, the same old comic-book hokum.You might expect a little infusion of charm from Keanu Reeves, an actor who is normally at least watchable, but the sound and fury of Constantine so drowns-out his laid-back personality that he's reduced to a video game character, a dully enigmatic figure marching grimly through level after level of computer-generated carnage. This isn't the kind of movie that emphasizes the personality of an actor, and it isn't the kind that goes for much sex-appeal either, as evinced by the fact that Keanu and Rachel Weisz, two of the hotter people on the planet, manage to generate about zero sexual spark (which is about as much as Keanu had with Carrie-Anne Moss in The Matrix Trilogy). The producers of this kind of movie seem almost contemptuous of the idea of any spontaneous human quality, erotic or otherwise, breaking through the over-designed, over-sold surfaces of their commodity-films. To let actors fling off the kind of nervous, quirky energy that makes for good viewing would represent a threat to the machine-tooled product, so we end up with performances so two-dimensional, so styled to fit in with the overall visual scheme, that one wonders why actors are employed at all. Don't directors care about what people like Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz can bring to a film? I guess that's a silly question given the kind of money that's on the line with a movie like Constantine - the kind of money that precludes the possibility of any messy humanity being allowed to get in the way.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Unfairly trashed.This movie was a very fun ride.Well worth watching.,"I read allot of negative reviews on Constantine. I am here to say I disagree with them.This was a very cool movie.Good story, real good CG effects and actors I liked.Keanu Reeves is not a great actor. So What? he seems to choose rolls that work for him, this one does just that. He was perfect as the angst and bitter John Constantine.Rachel Weisz was fine in her roll and she is so sweet to watch.Tilda Swinton was perfect as Gabriel... only wants what is best for God and trys to bring out the best in man no matter what.I highly recommend this movie,lots of cool effects, a good story and enough action to keep you watching with a smile. Sadly underrated.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
We Get it: Angels are just as insecure and petty,"The fanbase for this latest attempt at summarizing chaotic existence dominated by God, his Angels and the Devil comes from readers of DC Comics Vertigo line, where-in sincere attempts at adult storytelling surfaced following in the footsteps of Alan Moore's groundbreaking work on the old ""Swamp Thing"" comic book series, which gave rise to the 'graphic novel' term, rather than the standard 'comic book' label. Moore developed his own take on theological discussion, creating intricate modern mythology using established comic book characters; his was the benefaction on the series this film is based on. Everything was there for the taking and just needed to be ably translated into film form.An immediate setback is the casting of the still boyish-looking Keanu as the self-destructive weary title character. Everything from his mannerisms to his forced approach to depression rings false; when he pounces on another in a long line of cigarettes, you just think 'fake.' Constantine should appear and behave even older than he actually is; instead, he seems younger. I don't have a problem with cute little jokes, as in the lettering on the taxi he exits near the beginning, but when he proceeds to struggle with some demon (imitating classic scenes from ""The Exorcist""), no sense of horror is conveyed, just a lapse into parody ('hey, dude, get outta that girl's body, OK?'). Unfair? Maybe. Or maybe I'm tired of excuses made for Keanu, who really needs another 30 years of life experience to project what's required here. But that's just a guess; probably nothing would help. Unfortunately, Rachel Weisz is another actor who just leaves me cold. As we're supposed to sympathize with her and root for her protection from dark forces, this creates another serious drawback to the story. The two main characters are the weakest links in the picture.So where does that leave us? The finale. Most of the picture is forgettable, a plodding by the motions until the revelations of the final 20 minutes. As mentioned elsewhere, some elements of this story bear an uncanny resemblance to the more eclectic ""The Prophecy"" from 1995 (not ""Prophecy"" from '79, a whole other monster story). By chance or design, the angel Gabriel here (Swinton) actually adheres more to the description of popular lore, being essentially female. But Swinton scores another coup, projecting an otherworldly persona (she's now the 'go to' actor for inhuman beings, as in the Narnia movie later in the year), as easily as Keanu fumbled his attempt at gravitas. It's the plot of ""The Prophecy"" transposed to the final revelatory minutes of ""Constantine"" which at least makes for interesting, even repeat, viewing. And why stop with one petty, misguided angel? May as well throw in the latest interpretation of Satan (Stormare), here a somewhat immature sourpuss, into the mix. Stir. Result? Constantine outsmarts them all? Tell me another one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
lackluster and mindless,"Lackluster and mindless Keanu Reeves film not only lacks a story for most of the stuff that happens in this film to make any sense but has some of the worst dialog known to man. Keanu is Keanu, don't expect much more than that and the special effects are decent but not superb. The script is a huge disservice to most of the cast and the climax of the film has no rhythm to it. The only actor in the film that manages to transcend the lackluster material given is Rachel Weisz, who gives a deep and rich performance that the film is not mature enough to handle and does far more for this film than Keanu Reeves and the special effects combined.Other than her great performance, you can skip the entire movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
So who are the idiots here? Keanu? I think not.,"So let me ask you who is smartest - a) Keanu Reeves who consistently gets paid millions to make movies that people want to go and see or b) people who obviously loathe and detest Keanu Reeves with an almost rabid irrational passion and yet who keep forking over their hard earned cash to watch his movies in the theatres so they can then spend an inordinate amount of time on the internet composing what is basically a ""Keanu can't act and has never been able to act"" diatribe completely ignoring the movie itself. Hmmmm, I am a little stumped here, I don't understand it personally, if you hate the guy so much why do you keep going to see his movies, or are you all just closet masochists? That having been said Constantine both intrigued and disappointed me. I was perhaps expecting a little more action dare I say. I think that it will need a second watching before I catch the nuances of the film and begin to really appreciate its quality. I thought Keanu was excellent as Constantine, sullen, miserable, couldn't really give a toss about the world or what is going on it in other than his quest NOT to go to hell. Rachael was as always perfect in her portrayal of the tortured detective. I must have blinked and missed Shia LaBoef (spelling sorry) in I Robot but here he was an amiable and amusing side kick a/k/a apprentice. I loved the ""Q"" character living in the back of the bowling alley, right down to his grimy fingers which had obviously been poked into too many grimy places in his quest for unusual objects. Tilda Swinton was as usual wonderful as the asexual Gabriel, with the perfect touch of angelic and demonic (not sure I ever knew that Gabriel was a half breed though or did he/she become one after being de-angelified? - thereby hangs a question). Both Bathazar and the Devil had more than a little longing for Constantine and that was portrayed beautifully by both of the actors. The FX were top notch, and beautifully done. There were some slow spots, which I wondered with a more skillful editor might not have ended up on the cutting room floor but all in all an enjoyable movie that I will enjoy seeing again to fully appreciate. One has to admit though, it was Keanu's movie, and I believe he will gain many more fans as a result of it. You don't have to eat the scenery to be considered a good actor, you have to embrace the character and be unselfish with your fellow actors. In all respects Keanu fit the bill. And for those who are so rabidly Keanu haters please do me, the world and yourselves a favour, stop going to see his movies, it really is not healthy. And by the way, if you want to really know what a truly gifted actor and wonderful person he is just check out the comments from his fellow actors, to a man (or woman) they praise him to the skies. Watch Constantine it will have you thinking and wanting to see more.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Decent entertainment,"Heaven and Hell are in eternal battle for souls, but angels and demons are prevented from staying on Earth. ""Half-breeds"" are living among humans, and by them Heaven and Hell affect people, but they are also prohibited from direct influence. They can only direct people to good and evil and provoke situations in which the real human nature of nature will show itself. If they violate the rules and thus disturb the balance of good and evil, John Constantine, a man with a gift to see the world of angels and demons, is there to stop them and ""send them home."" Keanu Reeves is satisfying as Constantine, but in my opinion he is lousy actor who reduces quality of any movie he's in. I do not like Rachel Weisz in the main female role neither, and there is no chemistry between them. Tilda Swinton is also lousy and the only actor who really leaves positive impression in this flick is Peter Stormare in the role of Lu(cifer). Story is interesting, directing and special effects are good and movie holds attention. It's worth watching, but don't expect too much.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Constantine will Blow You Away...,"Keanu Reeves has found his look in his new movie Constantine as John Constantine, a man wanted by the devil and rejected by God, trying to buy his way into heaven by sending demons back to where they came from.Along with Reeves (The Matrix trilogy) is Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, Enemy at the Gates) as Angela Dodson, a young detective who mourns the loss of her twin sister Isabel, also played by Weisz. The two cross paths when Isabel commits suicide, which Angela can't conceive as possible, for her sister is a devout Catholic.Reeves with his ability to see demons and angels will help Angela find out what happens to her sister after her death and essentially save the world from being taken over by the spawn of Satan.Reeves gives a performance that will satisfy audiences, with witty remarks and a will to do anything. Constantine's smoking makes him not a superhero, but just another person with lung trouble. A character some folks can relate to makes him likable and not appalling.The character John Constantine first appeared in the DC comic series Swamp Thing as a background character developed to look like the artist Sting, and evolved into a mentor to Swamp Thing. In 1987, the series Hellblazer was introduced and would be passed onto British writer Jamie Delano, bringing Constantine to life. The series attracted a cult following.The first time director Francis Lawrence changes the pace from directing music videos for Brittany Spears and Aerosmith to making movies. This attempt at recreating DC Comics Hellblazer comic series is one that fans will love, but others might be turned off.Lawrence's attempt at bringing Constantine to life works. The edgy and mysterious Constantine has a presence that is quite powerful, much like Batman. His reckless attitude are fueled by his unknown origins and interesting barrage of weapons used to drag demons out of people and ""deport"" them back to hell.Lawrence uses the eyes of the characters very well, giving demons a red hue, and angels a gold coloration. This minor detail gives them more of an evil and menacing look to them. The special effects department did its job very nicely. Whether it be heaven, earth, or hell, the effects will please everyone.The movie uses religious symbolism a lot. The movie takes place in Los Angeles or ""The City of Angels"" if translated into Spanish. The characters Angela, which sounds a lot like angel, and Constantine, who was the first catholic Holy Roman Emperor, also have religious connections.The movie isn't completely well done. The beginning of the movie leaves you confused and unsure of what's going on. The action is present way too early. After the opening scene of a man being crushed by a car and walking away, Reeves casts a demon out of a little girl. Why or how he did this is a mystery until later on in the movie when his identity is made known. Not everything should be explained, but there are certain aspects that need to be explained.Overall the movie was very good. This isn't a movie for everyone, though. Only people who enjoy comic book movies or are looking for a more involved action movie would want to see this. The action is great, a story line that goes well with the comic book series, but the subject matter is not intended for all audiences. This movie is worth the money.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
better than expected,"I finally saw Constantine and have to say it was much better than I expected. Keanu reeves actually did a decent job of the role, not great, but decent. The mood of the comics was well preserved. It would have been better set in England with and English actor (Paul Bettany for instance), but for an americanized version it was good. I disagree with a lot of the comments I have read. The plot was well thought out, based on some of the comic stories, and the characters (except Chas) were well done. For the complainers, Constantine is supposed to be an jerk. If anything he was much mellower in the movie. I hope it does well.

This film is filled with demons who try to give birth to other humans and you even see angels who are really not angles but real devilish creatures which roam around looking for souls that they can occupy. There are people cutting their wrists and a young woman jumping off a tall building to her death and this film goes on and on even with quotes from the Bible and the Book of Corinthians.

"Disturbing, dark and ultimately rewarding","This is an extremely disturbing movie....and I can understand why many people don't like it. It's not crowd-pleasing and it contains some topics that would make a Catholic blush. But it is a movie that will stay long in your mind.I won't go into what the story is all about, there are going to be plenty of people who will be doing that.But I'll list what I like (spoilers ahead): 1. Keanu Reeves is great here. I've read some issues of the comic Constantine, and Reeves does make the character come across. Note that Constantine is indeed a cynical, arrogant, jaded, mostly unlikeable character with a spark of humanity hovering just below the surface. This last is most apparent in his later dealings with Angela.I have to say this is Keanu's best performance to date.2. Rachel Weisz - she's absolutely great. It's a very human performance - the everyman foil to the brooding Constantine.3. The CGI - fantabulous. The images you see here will be seared in your brain long after. I found myself wishing for prolonged scenes of hell.4. The soldier demons and the bee-demon - marvelous creations.5. The angel Gabriel - Tilda Swinton in a completely scene-stealing role, as the angel who decides to take matters in his own hands.Things I thought could have been done better: 1. The storyline. A little confusing at first. Then more and more is revealed, and it all comes together.2. The climax - it's a dogma climax, of discussion and theology, not a shoot-em-up explosion climax.3. The supporting characters have too little screen time - Chaz, Papa Midnight, Beeman.All in all, it's a very unusual and disturbing movie. Well worth your time, to challenge your dogma, if nothing else. It's steeped in Christian lore about redemption, suicide, heaven and hell. I've personally never seen anything like it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Nothing left...,"OK, do it like this: Take one blond ex-punk rocker Englishman who's a magician, usually spending his time in a comic where critique against current society and ""realistic"" portrayal of occultism is the norm, and who is of the opinion that heaven and hell are just as bad - a bunch of w*nkers. Do well past ten years of dissecting the mind of said Englishman, creating a wonderful plethora of great stories, characters and depth.Then, make this Englishman an American, dark-haired yuppie, played by what might be considered the worst actor ever (whose only real claim to fame was to star in one of the most overrated wannabe-deep action flick trilogies of all time). Place him in New York, and remove all elements of social critique, make sure all occultism is portrayed in as daft a light as possible. Make him WANT to go to heaven. remove all interesting characters, and transform the remaining ones beyond all recognition. Oh, and rewrite his entire personal history, since someone didn't like the years of hard work done by the original authors.This is what you will end up with. A mindless, mind-numbing kinda-action-flick, incapable of stirring even the least bit of intelligent thought. The most profound thought I had during the entire film can be summed up like this: ""Whoa. Nice effects, dude"".Not that it's a bad thought. I just expected more from the movie version of one of my absolute favorite comics.Anyways, if one completely disregard any connections to an actual comic book, ignoring the title and the names of some characters - well, then one might think of this as ""kind of a decent action-flick"". Not great, not really mediocre (compare with the complete drivel that is ""Daredvil"").In short summary - This is not Hellblazer. This is not John Constantine. This is an action flick who needed the popularity boost of the comic-book readers. No more, no less. See it for what it is, and you might just enjoy it.

Entertaining occult no-brainer,"Damned P.I. John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) helps cop Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz ) solve the mystery of her sister's suicide only to discover a hellish plot to install the Son of Satan as Lord of our mundane plane. This kind of mystic-mercenary battling Evil shtick has been around the block a few times, so don't expect anything new as the conflicted hero battles hordes of CGIs with theologically-inspired (and silly-looking) weapons (such as a drum-fed holy-water firing cruciform hand-cannon). As usual Reeves is as wooden as a piece of the True Cross, but (again as usual) still manages to make his gloomy, cancer-ridden, Hell-bound character entertaining, Weisz is routine as the skeptic cop who is forced to accept unreality, the ever-malleable Tilda Swinton makes an intriguing androgynous Gabriel, but if you are expecting some awesome manifestation of the Lord of the Flies himself, you may find Peter Stormare's arrival a bit of a letdown. The film is full of images that aren't really explained (apparently sometimes due to expository scenes being removed in editing) and the plot dances around the concept of redemption, which plays a role yet generates a massive plot-hole. Typical for the graphic-novel inspired genre, 'Constantine' is long on imagery and short on pretty much everything else, but remains fast-moving entertainment (but more for the soul than the brain).",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Liked it but flawed,"For some reason i was actually quite excited about Constantine. I go to the cinema a lot anyway but i hadn't actually been excited about a film for a while. Constantine pretty much lived up to my expectations but it had a couple of problems that stopped it from getting a higher vote.The cast was generally pretty good, I'm still confused as to why Keanu keeps getting roles in big movies considering his limited acting ability but he's saved by a quite able supporting cast. Keanu's dead pan demeanour does fit his characters permanently miserable outlook however. The special effects are all fairly good and the action scenes are well executed but what lets the film down is it's script and the general pace of the film.The script isn't a huge problem the dialogue just seems a little clunky in places but the film feels quite slow. When the philosophy starts to take over the film looses all momentum and then has a hard time building it up again. A couple more set pieces may have stopped this from happening but if the people behind this film are considering making a franchise out of it then this problem may disappear like in the first x-men film when a little too much time is spent in setting the scene.Overall Constantine is a bit stupid in places and a little slow but this doesn't stop it from being one of the more enjoyable films to have been released in a while.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

A Nutshell Review: Constantine,"I haven't read the Hellblazer comic books by DC/Vertigo, so I do not know much about the John Constantine character, or how the show deviates from the comic books.However, without background knowledge, this is one excellent movie, with great characterization of biblical characters like Archangel Gabriel, Balthazar and even Lucifer himself, plot and subplots, special effects and music. The movie starts literally with a bang, and it never lets up after that with its even pacing.Keanu Reeves has proved that once again he is master. To his detractors, I'd say hold your horses, watch this show, and chances are you'll be a fan convert. Rachel Weisz, wow.Hell has never looked as good (!) as what's shown in this movie. The effects are world class, and brings forth to glory and life, the demons and damned creatures from hell.The Constantine Theme provides the noir, a dash of suave and attitude to the movie and when it's on, you just know something awesome's about to happen.Stay till the end of the movie, it'll show you the aftermath of one of the characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Who is this guy,"Normally, with time you get better at your job. Considering K. has been playing more or less the exact same roles since years this should not be difficult, even for him. All I saw from him was Top-model poses and stares and corny line deliveries where he desperately tries to imitate Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry style without having any. Some good technical work (sound, special effects and filming) and a good story (most of it fits together) but the actors and script make it hard to appreciate. Still considering it's a Hollywood production at least they tried to break away from the fixed formula film - no real kiss or love-affair (walking away from a kiss at the end of a film must be a first for them).

A decent premise let down by Reeves' typically wooden acting,"Adapted from the DC/Vertigo comic book ""Hellblazer"", Constantine details the life of John Constantine, (Keanu Reeves) a detective of the paranormal who spends his life saving people from supernatural occurrences in an attempt to commit enough good deeds to buy his way into heaven after trying to commit suicide at a young age.Sounds interesting enough - but Constantine really lets itself down by taking a decent premise and trying to pass it off as just another Sci-Fi Keanu Reeves vehicle. Because of this, the script underwrites and confuses all the more interesting parts focusing on the supernatural and the dirty dealings done by those from and/or associated with Hell, and puts more of the focus on Reeves' cynical detective. Unfortunately, Reeves doesn't seem up to carrying the picture, playing the same wooden action character as always. (I believe he changed his facial expression once throughout the entire film, and it was during his ""death"" scene) It's obvious that there was an attempt to break the mold - John Constantine is a thoroughly despicable man, being the chain smoking, reclusive, sarcastic cynic that he is, but in the less than capable hands of Keanu, who seems to think he is still playing Neo, it doesn't come across truthfully. When we, the audience, try to ignore the film's star and concentrate more on the dark, moody visuals and excellent supernatural CGI effects, we get Keanu Reeves' (never changing) face plastered on-screen again, and we are barely allowed to get a glimpse of the more appealing aspects of the story.As one would come to expect, most of the actual acting talent comes from the far more interesting array of supporting characters. Rachel Weisz struggles hard to actually bring some emotion into the story, as a homicide detective investigating the apparent suicide of her twin sister, and she succeeds for the most part, but it couldn't have been easy given her co-star. Djimon Hounsou is great as Midnite, a mysterious fellow demon hunter who refuses to take the side of either light or dark, but remains neutral between them, sharing his talents with the highest bidder. He proves a far more interesting, if equally undeveloped character as Constantine, but his lack of character development actually works to an extent, adding to the mysterious mood of his character. Underrated Swedish character actor Peter Stormare plays a wonderfully sinister Satan, practically dripping malice while still only flirting with hamminess. And then we have the necessary ""annoying sidekick who acts as comedic relief and serves only to further introduce the main character"" character, played by Shia LaBeouf. If there was ever one of these such characters who you would gladly watch suffer a gruesome death, there has never been one more so than here. Constantine's 'intern' Chas is one of the most irritating and patronizing characters ever to grace film, and it's a sound pity that he fails to suffer the 'death by killer bees' schtick that one of Constantine's other associates is dealt.With a different lead, the dark imagery and supernatural conspiracies might have proved to produce a decent film. As is, the gritty visuals and sweeping, moody CGI supernatural effects set the mood correctly. But every time Keanu Reeves walks on screen, with his single facial expression, we start to find looking down at our watches is much more interesting than staring at another grimace which was undoubtedly meant to convey emotion. When we can, we take refuge in the much more appealing performances of the supporting characters, especially Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou, but they aren't given nearly enough development to retain our interest. Picture Constantine with a different star, and you can imagine yourself having an enjoyable, if still, not all too profound time. As it is... you may want to pass up Constantine for something more interesting.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
It's no catwoman but...,"I'm the first to admit I don't like Keanu Reeves, & when I found out he was playing one coolest comic book characters ever, it was more horrifying than the Justin Timberlake as Ironman rumors. But then last night I went to see it, & now tonight I'm going again. Trust me this movie was good, I AM the pricky fanboy, that tears apart everything, but as far as comic movies go ""Constantine"" was perfect. Great special effects, great story, great look, it's worth going to just to see Hell. Keanu absolutely nailed the part, he is John Constantine, the slimy, chain-smoking, foul-mouthed, con-man. This movie is based, I think, off the Dangerous Habits, story arc, issues 41 - 46. As for the weird looking cross gun, he uses that somewhere in the Garth Ennis run.

If Hell has cars...,"If Hell has cars, then I'd hate to be there to see what's occupying the hot country. Probably '77-'78 Mustang II's, Pontiac Azteks, and newer Fords. Let's clear this once and for all: Reeves is NOT an actor. He's a celebrity. Besides Bill and Ted, I thought he was offensively appalling. If you've seen Point Break, you can observe that Reeves was still nursing that Valley boy drawl. If he's such an actor, why can't he play anyone besides an apathetic savior in The Matrix or pompous Jonathan Harker in Dracula ? I hear Reeves is a perfectionist and pretty unforgiving of his ""performances"". Well did Lawrence bother to screen the dailies of Constantine in front of him to rectify that ? Or is Lawrence fond of printing EVERY take ? Reeves doesn't convey the range of emotions like his peers. The same stoic, introverted character who guzzles whiskey and chain-smokes. It seems Reeves had struggled to eek out a comic character who's pretty self-destructive. The movie doesn't fail completely, it's just the weight of it, is on Reeves who's grossly miscast. The frivolous responses just seem to evade any semblance of capability. There's no over-acting here. That would impugn Reeves knows how to act. Otherwise, he just seems to go through the motions and gave Lawrence a plethora of apathetic takes where he just doesn't cut it. Did the requisites for the role say: ""No enthusiasm needed"" ? I deduce...Yes. I mean Reeves can probably relate on some level and click with Constantine's moral constituition if not his over-indulgent tendencies. It's not like asking him to portray Vo Nguyen Giap. Reeves has no range. I don't mean he has unlimited range. I mean no diversity. Stormare and Swinton had fun and it shows. Cam't say that for Reeves. Unless he wasn't in character the whole shoot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Gotta love Keanu,"I watch everything with Reeves and also Weisz is excellent.

Very Good,"I thought the film was very good as it left me on the edge of my seat throughout.

I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys supernatural films and a bit of tongue in cheek scripting.

There lies the magic of the well-crafted plot. How does the ambivalent relationship between two identical twins - one embracing her role in the nature of things, and the other, suppressing her true self just to be like one of the masses - resolve? How does God, the Devil, and their spawns, and the Gabriel, and Balthazar play the game of quick-thinking-bluff-on-your-feet of poker chess such that the end is like a symphony in reverie - all aspects making sense and leaving the very questions that are asked resonating in you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Great movie! Well made!!,"I thought this movie was wonderful. My only complaint is that the climax got a little funky. I definitely recommend it. If you are catholic you might want to pass though, I went with my catholic friend and she was insulted, but it's all in good fun and I didn't see why. The cinematography was impeccable. The way Keanu is introduced at the beginning is ingenious with the top angle. I also like the demons, they are pretty cool spectacles. For being a first time movie direct Lawrence shows some great potential. I think it is unfortunate that the movie came out so early in the year, because now it will never get any award recognition, and being the type of film it is it probably wouldn't have gotten any recognition anyway, oh well. GO SEE IT!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Not quite 'Hellblazer,' but still quite good fun","In case you don't know 'Constantine' is actually based on quite a famous cult comic called 'Hellblazer,' but had its name changed when 'Hellboy' came out the year before and the film-makers were concerned with non comic book fans getting the two confused. So, Step 1 of how to alienate your core fanbase is change the name! The fan boys were not amused. They were even less amused when other changes were made to the script and story in general. It was fair to say that 'Constantine' was off to a bad start.But it's certainly not that bad. Keanu Reeves plays the titular (John) 'Constantine' – a man who's soul is damned to hell for all eternity, but hopes he can get out of the inevitable afterlife in hell by doing God's work and sending as many Earth-dwelling demons back to their fiery origins. So it's a kind of action/horror/demon/supernatural affair. It certainly has elements of all of those genres, just don't go expecting much 'horror' in this horror movie.Perhaps producers were aware that many people wouldn't recognise the franchise from its comic-based roots and decided that one way to get bums on seats would be to make it pretty tame. Yes, if you're really afraid of possessions and general monsters you may find this scary. It's hardly a kids' film, but its primary market is probably fully-grown men, many of which expect a little more gore and darkness from the big screen.Keanu Reeves is hardly known for his acting, but he does his best and for whatever he lacks in dramatic ability, he makes up for by simply being Keanu Reeves. He's instantly able to be rooted for and you don't have to be a genius to recognise that he's going to fall for Rachel Weiss' character (sporting a not-so-great American accent).So Keanu generally goes about the place, despatching one demon after another. If you squint at the screen you'll probably help yourself fail to notice how much CGI is used with each baddie he slaughters.Constantine isn't a classic. It won't be remembered in cinema's history books. However, if you're generally in the mood for a little monster-bashing (and not a die-hard fan of the comic books it's based on) then put this on. You probably also check your phone a couple of times during the run-time and still known what's going on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"""Constantine""","In the tradition of comic book-to-film translations, ""Constantine"" (no, not THAT Constantine) offers very little in the way of plot and just focuses squarely on special effects and such. Also in line with such tradition, it all but completely discards the source material, which in this case are the DC/Vertigo ""Hellblazer"" comics. Though I'm not big on the ""Hellblazer"" series, which have seen their most popular arcs through comic book artist Garth Ennis, I do realize that much is different from the source material, including the fact that morose hard-a** anti-hero John Constantine is British and most of the action of the comics takes place in Liverpool, England.But I'm not here to make comparisons; I'm here to judge a movie. The best thing to be said about ""Constantine"" is that it keeps you watching, not just for the effects and strong visual delight but because it's fantasy - interesting fantasy.In ""Constantine,"" we learn that John Constantine (the effectively wooden Keanu Reeves), is dying of cancer, forbidden from entering Heaven as a result of an attempted suicide (he was clinically dead for two minutes), has a bad attitude, and can see demons yet no one else can. To think that a normal person could see demons you'd have no choice but to declare that person insane, right? Demons and angels, we learn, cannot enter into the human plane of existence but strange occurrences in Los Angeles force Constantine to search for answers after he's attacked in public view by a demon.The plot to ""Constantine"" bears more than a passing resemblance to a past Reeves vehicle (""The Matrix,"" anyone?), in that as human beings, we are completely oblivious to the truth about our reality. As the film opens, two scavengers in Mexico discover the Spear of Destiny, the weapon rumored to have been used to kill Jesus Christ during the Crucifixion.One of them high-tails it to Los Angeles where the main plot of the film is revealed. Isabel Dodson, the twin sister of Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), commits suicide. Angela, the dogged detective she is, disbelieves the official story because she knows her sister was a devout Catholic and would never commit suicide, as such an act would require eternal damnation in Hell.The special effects are nonstop, and there is one effective and horrific sequence where Constantine ventures to Hell, which is in all respects, a darker vision of Los Angeles except it's a place where demons and the damned roam. With the help of his legion of otherworldly allies, who include normal human Chas (Shia LaBeouf), a half-breed named Midnite (Djimon Hounsou), appropriately named Father Hennessey (Pruitt Taylor Vince) and the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton), Constantine and Angela race against time to stop a nefarious plot waged by the forces of Hell that could bring about the apocalypse.The plot, if you want to call it that, is pretty non-existent and Reeves is pretty wooden as usual but let's face it, nobody in this cast is going to get Oscars come next spring. The film drags for about the first 20 minutes or so but becomes more engaging as it goes through its motions. Director Francis Lawrence (of music video infamy, which accounts for the dizzying camera-work) does his best, but somehow or another the film can't really seem to get it together when it comes to certain parts of the script.For example, it's not really sure what it wants to be: a horror movie, fantasy, thriller, what? It's not really sure and I'm not really sure of what it wants to do. Such items shouldn't plague the viewer but it does, to me, play out a lot like a mish-mash of all three.As the anti-hero chain smoker John Constantine, Reeves' wooden acting is effective (is there any other way to play such a character?) and as the film progresses you can tell he's really suffering inside, as he grows sicker and sicker from cancer. And we also believe his desperation as he tries to send half-breeds to Hell in order to get back on God's good side so he can enter Heaven when he dies. In his character, we also get our fair share of Pentagrams and demonic spells and chanting and such. The opening sequence alone brings back uncomfortable memories of ""The Exorcist"" (1973).""Constantine"" may win over die-hards of the ""Hellblazer"" and people may or may not get a kick out of Peter Stormare as an Armani-wearing Satan. Like Neo says, ""Whoa.""6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
way impressed!,"I got to see a preview of Constantine, and I thought it was so cool! It was way better than I expected. It wasn't as dark as I was afraid it was going to be, but still managed to have a smoky, behind the scenes of LA, private eye type feel.The plot was awesome, the special effects were super sweet, and Keanu was great- a lot better than I expected. He fit the role really well, or maybe he made the role fit him, since I know that the comic book character is a little different (eg- the comic book Constantine is British).Anyway, overall I thought the movie was pretty great, and I'll probably head out to see it again with friends when it comes out in theaters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good possibilities but dense,"Chain smoking John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is doom to go to Hell. He tries to redeem himself by exorcising demons. However the demons seem to be breaking into our world. Meanwhile, police Det. Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz)'s twin sister Isabel's supposed suicide leaves her struggling to prove otherwise. She tries to get help from Constantine, but he refuses at first. Then he notices the demons that seems to be following her. And there is also a Spear of Destiny.There is some good possibilities in this franchise. However it's way too complicated, and it needs to be explained earlier. It's probably one of those movies that need some text at the beginning explaining the world. Keanu and Rachel are good for these roles. Although they both do the same reserved intensity acting. It leaves the movie with only one tone. There are some cool visual styles in this movie. However there are just too many strange things that pops up. The one casting mistake is Gavin Rossdale as Balthazar. He doesn't have the screen presence for such an important role. There are some interesting aspects to this movie, but it's Hell to follow.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Rachel Weisz is great but the movie just does not live up to it.,"Horribly written and poorly directed horror movie that takes the source material of the comic book that it's based on (The excellent Hellblazer) and literally destroys it with a script that is so badly written that some of the dialog will make you grunt when you hear it and plot points that has nothing to do with the story at all. The story itself make absolutely no sense because it says one thing and contradicts itself latter with another, so you really have no idea on what is going on from time to time. Some characters serve no purpose what so ever like Constantine's kid sidekick who is as annoying as they come and the angel Gabriel, who is involved in one of the stupidest plot revelations to come out in recent cinema. A revelation that turns this movie's second half into a bad joke. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence is pretty bad because instead of trying to help the story along, he just resorts to copying what was done before in order to get an effect and relying too heavily on the special effects to tell its story. You can see the influence the movie ""Seven"" had on him because of the way the lighting is done in some scenes but what he forgets is the fact that ""Seven"" had a compelling story that scared and held you in your seat until it's shocking climax while this movie will have you thinking on why so much had gone wrong with it in the first place. Acting wise, I will have to join the majority in praising Rachel Weisz for her performance because with out it, the movie would have been a bigger disaster than it is. Rachel Weisz give too much to this film with her performance and gets too little from it. Her performance literally keeps this movie from going under its own stupidly and she does make you think about her character as a real human being who is going though a crises of faith and a corrosion of the soul. She's so good in fact that she makes you almost forgive this movie but unfortunately for her and the people paying to see it, she is the only actor who is able to rise above the bad script and lousy direction to give a compelling performance. Keanu Reeves, who plays the title character of John Constantine is a decent actor when he is motivated but he looks like he's on some kind of drug in this film and does not come a cross well in his role. You don't really believe his character at all by the way Keanu plays him and the movie loses credibility because of it. You can't blame him for his lack of interest because of how bad the script is but he could have done better or they could have gotten a better actor to play the character instead.I suggest you see this film for Rachel Weisz's better what this film deserved performance only because the only good thing this film really has.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
The Devil DOES exist and so Kenau's acting ability!,"Hey I want John Constantine's day job, it sure makes my job of writing marketing copy for IT companies seem so boring now! Gifted demon-seer, Constantine (played by Kenau Reeves) gets to see Angels and Demons wherever he goes, which means even the most boring of activities - such as riding a bus - like a day at the freak show. A well constructed plot and fast moving story line, I loved this movie. Our eyes were filled with rich imagery of heaven and hell and demonic onslaught within the 'earth plane'. But wait there's more! Some hilarious dialogue is thrown in along the way; at one point in the movie, Constantine announces, ""I just pulled a demon soldier out of a little girl!"" and tells us more than once - ""I've been seeing some unusual soul traffic lately."" Tilda Swinton plays, the archangel Gabriel (although looking a lot like Mick Hucknall, lead singer of Simply Red) and Satan's henchman Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale, the lead singer of the band Bush, which I thought was kinda cool) put in appearances. Satan (played by Peter Stormare) is brilliant as the diabolical Lord of The Demons himself, Satan and puts in a a very casual appearance bohmenian in style sporting a brilliant white suit and sooty bare feet. Satan is cool, crazy and a crack up! When Constantine asks if he can have a cigarette, the original Lord of Hell sneers that it's fine with him, and says ""I've got stock."" Lo and behold! What would an action packed movie be without a ridiculous looking firearm. Constantine is given a solid gold gun, that fires real gold bullets and of course its accessorised so that it looks just like a small crucifix(no Jesus), very cheesy but fun! The only real let-down in the movie is, Rachel Weisz (from The Mummy series) plays Angela Dodson, a police woman who's trying to prove that her sister's recent death was not suicide. She was absolute rubbish in this role unfortunately.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Flawed yes but still brilliant,"Reeves is a perfect choice for the eponymous hero of the film. It is hard to follow at times and the TV version I watched seemed to have a low and at times indistinct sound track, which made it hard to follow in places. Its an interesting concept and has certain parallels to the Matrix: What is reality, who are we? Is God and Religion all BS? I thought the entrance of Lucifer ( The bringer of light) was a clever idea and initially I thought he was God, The white suit was a red herring in this respect as he exuded evil in a very understated way! What was Gabriel? AC/DC? there certainly was a question left unanswered here and having a woman play the part but with no makeup and her breasts bound tight so as to have the appearance of a man was a stroke of genius!

Good start then truly comic book.,"The film is OK, managed to watch it all. But it started so well I was disappointed towards the end. It did become U.S. comic book stuff, take on demons, forget exorcism you need assault shotguns and dragons breath flame throwers. As to why the archangel Gabriel would wish to punish mankind by unleashing the son of Satan is beyond comprehension. I wouldn't recommend this, but can't trash it.

Had potential to be better,"This film definitely could've been better, i'm not saying it was awful, but I'm just saying that it could have been better that what it turned out to be.

Rachel Weisz was pretty good in her co- starring role, she was dramatic and had depth in her performance. I also quite enjoyed Tilda Swinton as Gabriel the angel, I think Swinton brought a lot of depth and a lot of interesting layers to her role. The special effects were all around all right, I've of course seen much better, and a few times they looked slightly hokey, but most of the time they were alright. Shia Lebough is alright too, it's of course one of his younger and first feature film roles, he sufficed in the screen time given to him. As far action goes, there is definitive action sequences that are full of shooting, like punching, and throwing people across rooms, so the action will for sure satisfy. The middle part of the film does in fact drag a bit, so I definitely had to complain about that, the middle was a little bit of a chore to sit through, which is why the rating is not higher than a 6/10 on my movie rating scale.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"'Constantine' contains a smörgåsbord of characters and ideas, but music video director Francis Lawrence, in his first film, holds it all together...","ConstantineJohn Constantine (Keanu Reeves) has been seeing terrifying demonic visions all his life, but has mostly kept them to himself. In his adulthood, he uses his ""gift"" to send ""half-breeds"" back to where they came from, using whatever means necessary to do so. When Isabel Dodson (Rachel Weisz), a mental patient who has also suffered from similar visions, kills herself, her twin sister Angela (also played by Weisz), a police officer with an uncanny ability to distinguish friend from foe, as well as a devout Catholic, refuses to believe that Isabel was responsible for her actions, and seeks out Constantine for a more supernatural investigation. Constantine is at first reluctant to help, but then realises that there may be more to Isabel's suicide than meets the eye.While 'Constantine' is a highly successful comic book film, it's interesting how this is very similar to the Wachowski Brothers' 'Matrix' trilogy. For starters, both are produced through a continuing collaboration between Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow in Australia, both tinker with the opening studio logos, both star Keanu Reeves, both have a slightly green tinted colour scheme, both have dazzling special effects, and both are very enjoyable. The film contains a smörgåsbord of characters and ideas, but music video director Francis Lawrence, in his first film, holds it all together, and also makes the film quite chilling at times (take for example a scene where Angela's phones start ringing all around her apartment). Keanu Reeves is his usual stony self here, but he is aided by memorable supporting performances from the likes of Tilda Swinton as the Angel Gabriel, Djimon Hounsou as witch doctor Papa Midnite, and Peter Stormare as none other thanwell, I'll let you find out.

"Not exactly faithful, but I'll be damned","Constantine is a curious little creation. Prior to release, odds were definitely stacked up against it. Sworn followers of the graphic source material were slitting their wrists over character and location changes, Keanu was seemingly pulling a hat trick of duds following the Matrix sequels; and the last time Akiva Goldsman was let anywhere near a comic book movie the results were too dire to even contemplate (file under: Batman & Robin).Then praise be the gods the final product delivered and then some. Constantine is a rugged, bumpy ride, an entirely different breed of blockbuster that hits you like facer's to a fan. Commercial films like this don't come along very often. Just the fact the main character smokes incessantly is a breath of fresh air. It's this undemanding, all-demanding, irony that elevates Constantine above the crowd, a gnarly marrying of ideas that somehow manages to pull together into a comprehensible chain of events.John Constantine has been through hell and back. A cynical exorcist who only does his job to reach heaven by banishing half-breed demons that walk the Earth back to the fiery chasms from whence they came. When he is summonsed upon by a LAPD detective investigating the 'suicide' of her twin sister, the two stray between this world and the next, realising the balance between good and evil we've enjoyed is coming to an end.As flimsy as that premise sounds -and with no apparent villain until the third act- Constantine still barrages across the screen, director Francis Lawrence unafraid to get his hands dirty and put the camera in the middle of the action. Some scenes are simply beautifully done. The opening scene springs to mind, or the slo-mo job in the bathtub, challenging the realm of acceptability in what's essentially an 'action movie with supernatural overtones'. Of course this means some things get lost: we could without a few needless special effects, for example, or lose a silly voice now and again.But let's just say John Constantine is one, ahem, hell of an anti-hero. Exorcising demons is one thing, sticking your feet in cold water and staring at a cat to go to Hades for a casual acquaintance is something else entirely. Think what you like about Keanu Reeves' acting abilities, he's always there to make your time enjoyable, and here he makes the unlikeable relatable, despite pronouncing every syllable he's given. His tone is offhand and bleakly hilarious (not a far cry from Neo) and keeps us distanced enough to stay rapt for the duration. Rachel Weisz however is something of a revelation, her quiet, introspective role is the best in the film and she really keeps us anchored throughout.The hard sell of switching former blond Liverpuddlian John Constantine into a well-toned Los Angelian is no biggy; the vast backdrop adding much-needed depth to a thin story which needs to be layered with caricatured priests, sidekicks, and wacky side characters to maintain any form of lucidity. Still Constantine is very much a love/hate movie, and even those on the negative side of the camp cannot fault it for trying.In fact, I enjoy the roughness of the movie. Its black, bleached, dare I type Gothic, creations are something you wouldn't expect from a studio system that is becoming increasingly reliant on the cheap sell or Jessica Alba in a bikini. Through all of its detouring and fantastical set design, the film is about people. One man trying to find some form of redemption. The ending is just so brilliantly done, everything left unsaid, and if something this blustering doesn't get a sequel when the likes of Anaconda and Agent Cody Banks do, it makes me want to cry.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"Rachel Weisz makes the movie better than it is but other than her great and wasted effort, the movie is still pretty bad.","Horrible Keanu Reeves's movie is a real disaster of epic proportion with Reeves perhaps giving the worst performance of his career with a character that is as one-dimensional as they come. I don't know if he was trying to copy Clint Eastwood's delivery from Dirty Harry but he's comes across as a parody of that character and he makes the film into a mockery with it. The special effects are lackluster and the screenplay is a joke with atrocious dialog that almost painful to the ears. Some characters and subplots don't really coincide with the overall story and the last fifteen minutes of the film makes absolutely no sense at all. Rachel Weisz does give too much to this movie with a complicate and deep performance that is way too mature and complex for this film. She almost single handedly redeems the movie but while she is doing her part in covering up the many flaws this movie has, the movie itself has way too many for even her great talent to forgive.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Confusing mess. See it for the theological questions it raises.,"By the end of the movie, I was thoroughly confused and I don't want anyone to bother to unconfuse me, especially fans of the graphic novels it was based on. I have no problem with a movie that has twists, scenes and dialogues that you have to pay close attention to. I have no problem with a movie that makes you think but this one merely gave me a headache. And not to mention Mr. Reeves' acting that reminded me about what a critic said about another actor's performance: ""So wooden, you can dust it off with Pledge."" Most of his lines were delivered like he took a sip of water between words. He delivered his lines like the kid you have to suffer through in first grade when the teacher asks the class to each read a passage out loud. And isn't this the second movie that Shia LeBouf plays the wisecracking, annoying sidekick who wants a piece of the action? The only performances worth noting are Gabrielle/Gabriel played androgynous and Angela because she's performed well in better movies. The only time Reeves' deadpan delivery worked are for the few one-line zingers. Not to mention that is the second movie I've seen where I didn't agree with the MPAA rating. I usually don't watch R-rated horror/thriller movies because the violence is usually over-the-top. The House of Flying Daggers portrayed blood spurting, and people getting sliced and stabbed yet it got a PG-13 but the violence in this movie was no worse than ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" or the first ""Indiana Jones"". And I'm kind of tired of the dark side character- Midnight- being cast as a dark actor- played by an African actor ala Judas in ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", Pam Grier in ""Something Wicked..."" and even Darth Vader wearing a dark outfit and voiced by black actor, James Earl Jones but the supposed Savior of the world is a white actor in Reeves' second role of the type after playing Neo (an amalgram of ""One"") in the Matrix (pretty much employing the same acting style).I really watched this movie for the theological questions it raises. Where do suicide ""victims"" go after they die? Are demons and angels amongst us or are they safely in their domains letting only their half human spawn live amongst us? Have we misdiagnosed some mentally ill people who instead of being crazy are merely able to see the spirit world? Are some of the evil or helpful people in the world really half-demon or half-angels? Can you bargain for your soul's outcome? Are God and Satan like Yin and Yang, two equal superpowers? And does this movie answer those questions? No. It merely raises them. For a movie with a similar theme, albeit less gruesome, see, ""What Dreams May Come."" with Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra in a role that finally does something with her fragility/vulnerability. What did intrigue me is that film is unabashedly dependent on Catholic beliefs and delves into areas of theology that Protestantism doesn't even address. Would love to ask the typical Baptist or COGIC preacher what he thinks about the above questions.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A vision of Hell - but not quite up to it.,"Starting with a scene that would do justice to ""The Exorcist"" the remaining film falls short of promise. The plot has all the logic of the comic strip, and heaps of Biblical babble that is mainly nonsense. The crux of the story is summed up in an old Chris de Burgh song ""Spanish Train"" wherein God and the Devil gamble for souls. Keanu Reeves is Po faced, certainly not Mr. Congeniality, but is cement set in his old Matrix role. However in fairness he does what he can in his limited range as the Metaphysical Detective of the Woeful Countenance. The female lead Rachael Weisz acts her heart out, and seems up to the task of ridding the world of unspeakables. Yet more impressive are the cameo performances of delightful Tilda Swinton as very oddball Angel Gabriel and Peter Stormare as a particularly repulsive Devil.Constantine is a chain-smoking demon catcher, enlisted to investigate the suicide of Weisz's sister, and finds instead the eternal struggle between the forces of good and evil. He can see both angels and demons when they appear on earth which helps him sort things out no end.The director manages to create a dark Gothic look to the visuals, and some very creepy moments, and the picture is at its best when the effects are played down, and the actors are played up. Visions of Hell are right out of Hieronymus Bosch, and a nice gritty feeling pervades. Things fall apart when absurd props are introduced like the Demon Demolishing Gun that appears to be left over from Van Hesling (which was a send up anyhow.)It's a pity more adult concepts weren't permitted to lift the picture into a higher class of Gothic horror, and one feels a good movie lurking in the background. And is there a quit smoking message in there - yes there is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Totally acceptable but miscast.,This is a fun popcorn movie. But it so probably annoy you if you are a die hard Constantine comics fan.John Constantine was modeled on an older version of Billy Idol.

Loved Constantine,"Just because Constantine was based on a comic book, doesn't mean you have to be a comic book fanatic to enjoy it. I don't read comics, have never read THAT comic, and I LOVED the movie. Everything you EVER see, remake or not, is going to be ONE PERSON'S version of those events or story, that is what makes it interesting. I really hope for a sequel and can't wait to buy the first when it hits DVD. I thought the effects were great, the story was just like jumping into their lives, if you could do that, you wouldn't always know every detail of their life going in, as in this film, some things about them would remain a mystery. Anyway, loved it, hope you'll see it. Thanks for your interest FTA2004-",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Patience might be a handy tool for this movie!,"First half of this movie might push you to press the stop button. However, the second half picks the movie up to a level where you might think - ""Okay!!

Watch it before you judge,"I read a comment on this movie that made sad. It said that Keanu Reeves's performance was horrible and that it ruined the movie. I watched this movie simply because Keanu Reeves was in it. I though the trailer made look like another stupid/plot less horror film. NOT TRUE. I judge movies very harshly and found this to be a great movie of blockbuster quality. So it didn't have the super effects Peter Jackson films do, but its effects were just as good as I expected them to be.Of course if you are religious, it may be a little strange seeing the story told the way it is. But you have to remember ""it's just a movie"". So watch it, don't have any opinions until the credits roll.

Spiritually Dark Horror that gives a glimpse into the darkness of the spiritual realm,"What a mysterious and creepy piece of horror, aided with Keanu Reeve's stunning acting skills as usual. The scare tactics in this film are spiritually dark, giving a taste of heaven, hell, and everything in between. The visual and audible aspects of this movie combined make for a spine-shivering sense of fear; I love it. With all of this said, CG effects are okay, which is well expected from the year of its release. Character development doesn't play a key role here, which has the critics up in a riot.

Flimsy and Incoherent.,"Incoherent thriller that has Keanu Reeves in full matrix mold and making a complete fool out of himself with a pretty bad script. His performance is not very good and he's miscast for the role he is in. The other actors in the film, most noticeable Rachel Weisz ( She does give the best performance in this movie, she is that good), Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton all do better than poor Keanu in there roles and manages to rise above some of the clichés and the flimsy plot to give solid performances but not even they can get pass the fact of how badly this film was made and how incoherent it really is.

why don't you guys like it?,"God and devil, hell and heaven----We don't believe they exist, we are atheists.

The story is so substantial and reasonable that guys should be aware of that all the damn conceptions are not only stupid imaginations, but also something deeply in our mind, our soul.

A True Work of Art,I enjoyed this film throughly from start to finish. Though at times the dialog was difficult to follow the action spoke all that was needed to be said. Excellent special effects bringing such to the forefront of dramatic expression and in such an incredible and believable way.

awesome,"I don't know if someone would not like Keanu Reeves and his outstanding acting. Before gettimg into the comment of the movie I would like to talk a bit about him and his life first of all he is all about donating he donated millions of dollars to different charities he nearly always uses the subway because it is never about money for him. You can easily understand that this is true as he has declined the offer for Constantine the series without even lokking at it nor accepted a sequel for a second movie. One of the things I personally love about him is that he shares his food with homeless people and eats, speaks with them. It must be good to be listened to when you are homeless. Still what I love about him is that he came from a humble background as a farmer and his shyness. Well lets begin talking about the movie. Constantine is by far one of my favorites of its genre the acting of Keanu Reeves is so natural that you begin believing that the world he is living in is real you see angels, demons, people with unnatural power and the line between hell and the world getting thinner and thinner although this fantasy world is something hard to believe you find yourself inside the story identifying with the character and its flaws somehow your childself begins doubting and asking if it the fear you once had was real and all thanks to Keanu .

I actually enjoyed Constantine. . .,"When the movie came out, I hadn't even heard of it. I didn't remember seeing it on TV from before. I was told it was a good movie, but I really didn't have any intention of watching it. Then, last night my friend told me to watch Constantine if you want to quit smoking. Since I am trying, I figured 'What the hell?'. So, I watched it, and I was actually impressed by it. I mean, it wasn't the best movie of it's time, but it's good. I love how they mixed reality with fantasy. The realism of him getting lung cancer and dying, and the fact that there are demons and angels, and that he will be going to hell. I have read that a lot of people don't like Keanu Reeves, and think his acting sucks. But, I have always enjoyed his acting, even as a little girl. I never really watched the 'Matrix' movies, I had no interest in them. But, this has to be one of the best movies I have since Keanu in. Great job!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Still the best version of Constantine.,"Pretty sure I already had a review of this movie a while back but I just re-watched it again and it still is as entertaining to watch as it had been on my first day watching it in the theaters with a college friend. Although, I must admit, not really knowing much about the DC universe beyond the JLA, Keanu Reeves was my first introduction to Constantine, at the time and is still is the best portrayal of the character despite being the most inaccurate. To date I have yet to find someone else play the character with the same level of cynical charm although the actress that played Joanna Constantine in The Sandman wasn't bad at all.Matt Ryan's version was ironically the worst despite being the most accurate to the comic in terms of looks but his persona was really annoying. Its like that kid in school trying his hard to pretend he is British and gets picked on for it. Everytime I saw Ryan in the scene I felt an urge to smack him at the back of the head and tell him to stop pretending. There is a good reason that show failed.Its a pity Keanu Reeves feels like an entirely different person today and I am not sure he would be able to play this role again today. The story felt like a Constantine well past his glory days, trying his best to buy his way into heaven before the cancer gets to him. I would have loved to seen a sequel but its too late now and I doubt it would be quite as entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Not so great....,"Costantine is based on a comic book and I think adaptation was not that good.The acting of each actor in this movie was just okay.

The plot is confusing for those who don't pay attention to details.Overall, It is entertaining but you may not want to watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Good consistent story for a movie of this kind,Normally I have the trouble in following these heaven hell movies because the demons despite being almighty lose always by committing critical mistakes. Say a vampire's house has glass windows etc. Another major problem is the constant shifting of constraints. Say if the demons have to get one amulet and they succeed then we hear that there is another way for our hero to succeed. And because of all the options we see to be open to the villains (after watching the movie) there is always the problem of why did the almighty villain had to follow that plan why not use a different more efficient plan etc.None of these problems are present here. The problem we see at the beginning is what gets solved at the end. The constraints laid out at the beginning are followed till the end. No hirtho undiscovered(unmentioned) magical amulets to the rescue at the last minute. The story is pretty solid and entertaining. And it does not get boring. Better than a average heaven hell story because its more believable. More like a thriller. Rachel Weisz is the reason this movie looks like a exorcist movie. That maybe why people are praising her and blaming keanu reeves. keanu reeves's acting is quite OK for a thriller or an action movie.last 30 minutes was a pleasant surprise,8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Too bad...,"If ever a film needed a clear mind and a firm hand this was it. Constantine was always going to find it hard to win the approval of the multiplex crowd due to the dark nature and bleak outlook of both its story and title character. Lacking the kind of built-in mass-market appeal of the likes of Batman, it would have to rely on stunning visuals and spectacular special effects as well as a riveting storyline to stand any chance of real success. As we all now know, it was a relative failure at the box-office, failing to even recoup its estimated budget in the US, and found few champions amongst the critics, gaining mixed reviews at best.The film itself attempts to fuse the noir ambiance of those shadowy PI tales of the 40s with the more contemporary spectacle of fantasy/horror which, on paper at least, should provide an intriguing and engrossing fable. And there is an epic aspect to the story, with its focus on demons and angels roaming a world that is the subject of a wager between their masters. But it is this ambitious sub-plot that derails what should be a potent concoction by providing an abundance of religious iconography that influences the direction of the tale in ways that damage the film as entertainment, despite presenting some tantalising glimpses of what could have been a fascinating exploration of good and evil and the grey in-between.Constantine is an exorcist of demons trying to step over into our world whose motivation is entirely personal  even though he is at first unable to see it. A suicide at an early age, he died for two minutes and sampled, as an appropriately punished Catholic, the damnations of hell before being resurrected. Doomed to return upon his final demise, he sends demons back to hell in the hope of buying his way into heaven. To make matters worse, he's running out of time: his lungs are black with cancer and he has a year left at best. Now this is the sort of subject matter that should either draw you in or repel you, depending on what floats your boat. Personally, I can't get enough of this dark stuff, so it's surprising that the film Constantine almost completely fails to convince you of the verisimilitude of its world. The effects look spectacular, but too often they get in the way of the plot rather than advancing it, and seem to serve too often as an inadequate substitute for atmosphere. This over-reliance on the fantastical also tends to leave the story so unfocused at times that the plot strays close to incoherence as it begins to spread in uncoordinated directions like an unattended stain. It's a shame, because the first half-hour or so looked promising.Keanu Reeves performs with all the integrity of a bloated movie star with a guaranteed pay packet. After twenty years in the business he still can't act, and seems to be attempting a kind of moody Clint Eastwood impersonation here. Needless to say, it doesn't work and Rachel Weisz, an appealing actress with only marginally more talent than her co-star, finds it tough to play off him with any success. Neither are helped by a script that stubbornly refuses to attempt anything more than a cursory study of their characters, leaving the audience dangerously adrift with no-one to care or root for. Tilda Swinton is a highlight as an angel called Gabriel, but her role is too small for her to make more than a passing impression, as is that of Peter Stormare's Satan.Despite its bad points, Constantine possesses some great ideas and it would be interesting to see a sequel that expands a little on the characters in the story while taking a step back from the special effects. After this first film's dismal performance, however, the chances of one turning up in the next few years appear decidedly small.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
I don't get this lynch mob mentality,"1) I have not read the Hellraiser Comics2) I do not think Keanu Reeves is the worst actor in existence3) (Some odd reason I think people will find it significant... I also didn't think Judge Dredd was such a horrible movie either)I could see why people who loved the comic would hate this movie for ""screwing"" up the execution. But I kinda liked the movie. It had and easy to follow supernatural plot, it had action, it had damn good special effects.A bad movie is one where either I feel the need to flee from the theatre, or generally feel enraged about being robbed of my $10 to watch the piece of excrement called a movie. I felt none of these.Execution of acting & dialogue could have been better. I don't understand why Weitz is so beloved. She was easy on the eyes, so yeah, you did feel for the character. But face it, one-dimensional goody-two-shoes are hardly fascinating, and her acting didn't rise above that point. Was Constantine a compelling character? No, but I think dialogue, scene construction, and the fact the protagonist wasn't supposed to be a likable guy pretty much constricted what Reeves could do. Nevertheless, Midnite (Hounsou) was pretty compelling in his small part, as was Balthazar (Rossdale), so that may be an indicator there was a problem with the leads' performance. I like Swinton's small role too, but I think it has more to do with her looks, and my general fascination with ethical perspective.They do rip off The Prophecy movie themes, but its not like its horribly distasteful. In fact, I liked Constantine better than the Prophecy sequels. Its flawed in its lackluster execution, but I blame the scriptwriter & director for that.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Ultracool with no energy...,For people with low expectation I feel Constatine will deliver the goods. it's not a bad flick it has some ultra cool visuals an interesting storyline and some satisfying twists.

But with all the intense subject matter fails to create even a smidge of tension or geuine suspense. The performances are of course lackluster with a big disappointment coming from Rachael Weisz.

Good Film with Clear Directing and Good Performances,"6 of 10 stars. As most Film Historians suggest, this is a good Film, I agree. The Directing by Francis Lawrence is extremely good with clear and envisioned Direction. Lawrence has quietly Directed a lot of good and great Films thus far during his career, and this is a good one to add to his list.It Stars Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz alongside a young Shia LaBeouf, and all 3 of the Stars deliver good Performances. When I think back to how many good and great Films that Reeves has Starred in to this point in his career, it's almost mind-boggling; and he's really good in this Film, unquestionably believable with a subtle intensity that he is so good at Delivering. Rachel Weisz also has been in a lot of good Films and she is such a good and capable Performer, and she flat out delivers in this Film.LaBeouf was still a Teenager when this Film was released in 2005, and he puts on a good Performance also. It's amazing to remember that LaBeouf is still only in his Mid-30s right now. Most Film Historians consider this Movie to be good, as I do; but most Film Historians would not consider this Film to be 1 of the 10 best Films that LaBeouf has starred in during his Career to this point, I disagree as it is 1 of the 10 best Films he has Starred in to this point in his career.LaBeouf has often been a mess off the screen as we all know, but he's a very complex Actor; and many suggest that part of the reason he is able to peel the onion of the craft of Acting so deep on screen is because he's a mess off the screen, and there very well and likely may be some truth to that.What would Film Historians consider to be the 10 best Films that LaBeouf has starred in to this point of his career? I believe if I asked 100 of the most respected Film Historians around the World, there would naturally be different orders, but this would be their consensus; and they would consider the top 4 to be Masterpieces:1. The Peanut Butter Falcon (2019) 2. Honey Boy (2019) 3. Tru Confessions (2002) 4. Fury (2014) 5. Pieces Of A Woman (2020) 6. American Honey (2016) 7. Borg Vs. McEnroe (2017) 8.

Constantine is a decent action film.,"Constantine stars Keanu Reeves as the title character. He's a man with the ability to see half-demons, half-humans, and all other strange supernatural doings, fighting them with screeching beetle boxes and a holy-cross shaped shotgun. Rachel Weisz is a detective who needs Constantine to find out if her half-sister really committed suicide, or if the devil made her do it.Now, the previews led me to believe that they were going to take the premise and run with it, making every attempt to mine the suspense, fun, fright, and cool special effects out of it as much as they can. However, trailers always make you think that way, because they always include the best parts, edited for maximum impact.The movie itself is decent. It creates a somewhat-complex character out of the two-note Keanu Reeves (which isn't an insult, he can play two notes very well), where his chain- smoking not only represents his way of not dealing with his fate, but also his subconscious desire to bring his life to an end. The special effects are good, especially with the car crash in the beginning. The story gets muddled toward the end, but it still kept my attention. I recommend it as a modest time-passer.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A good thriller that takes the audience from the urban jungle to the real Hell.,"Based on a comic book, the kind we only heard about after seeing the film, it brings us the story of John Constantine, an unusual hero who lives with one foot in our world and the other foot in Hell.The script weaves a simple story: the fight between Good and Evil is turned into a kind of bet between God and the Devil, in which the souls of Humanity are played and in which they maintain a kind of ""balance"" in that neither is really beating the other. John Constantine, a man who attempted suicide and survived, unintentionally becomes one of the ""referees"" of that balance, going able to send back to Hell all the demons who came to our world in order to cause trouble. However, and precisely because he tried to kill himself, it is Hell that awaits Constantine when he dies, an idea that terrifies him and that he describes as ""going to a prison where you sent most of the prisoners before"". Thus, when he discovers that the Devil's son is trying to use a medium girl to reach our world and provoke the Armageddon, he realizes that if he is able to prevent it, he can acquire divine forgiveness and the desired passport to Paradise.Personally, I like movies with themes like this. They're appealing, although the film quite subverts the religious and spiritual themes it addresses. Without really being a horror movie, it works well as a techno-thriller with a dark background and urban Gothic atmosphere, which is occasionally dotted with intense and disturbing scenes. Unfortunately, I felt that the film fell apart in the last third part and the ending turns out to be disappointing and much weaker than the rest. The film, in some specific moments, seems to make small nods to other cinema works such as ""Exorcist"", which we can see as homage or, on the other hand, as influences that it received. Perhaps the truth is more or less halfway between one thing and another.After ""Matrix"" and ""Devils Advocate"", Keanu Reeves' choice for the protagonist seems quite natural. To some extent, he picked up and mixed elements and mannerisms that he used when he brought Neo and Kevin Lomax to life in the films I mentioned. But that was not a bad idea: Reeves shone in these works and manages to dominate this film very well and to live up to what is proposed by his character. Reeves gave Constantine a sullen, melancholy, pessimistic and misanthropic personality, which gradually humanizes as he helps and cares about Angela, a character effectively executed by Rachel Weisz, in one of the most interesting works of this actress, who became famous for her appearance in ""The Mummy"" trilogy and for her work in ""Constant Gardener"". Alongside these actors, we also have the good performances of Djimon Hounsou and Peter Stormare. Who really shouldn't keep good memories of the film is Shia LaBeouf, extremely boring and uninteresting, and Tilda Swinton, who transformed an archangel full of celestial authority into a kind of androgynous and morally twisted creature, unpleasant from all points of view.Technically, the film bets heavily on CGI and visual effects, with very good results considering the time it was made and the available budget. The look of the demons in this film is something impressive, repulsive and grotesque, as also the way Hell is portrayed, in an eternal storm of fire and pain. Also notable for its realism and majesty is the brief glimpse of Paradise. Struggle or exorcism scenes have been thought out in detail and the effects collaborate widely. Cinematography is good and puts us in a nocturnal, dark and decadent neo-noir universe, where darkness combines well with a scenario full of cheap furniture, kitsch decoration and neon signs, and with urban sound effects like screams, ambulance sirens, car sounds. The soundtrack, signed by Brian Tyler and Klaus Badelt, is deep and excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"OK movie, no more, no less","Constantine is an exorcist, damned to hell, and dying too. In an attempt to gain a ticket to heaven, he expels demons and casts them back in hell. Normally only half demons are to be found in this mortal world, but lately, full demons are trying to cross over too. A series of strange events makes Constantine weary that something bigger is about to happen. Step by step a devilish plan is revealed, and in the end it is up to Constantine to prevent hell on earth.I thought this movie began very promising: very dark and mysterious. But it looses it's darkness and mystery, sadly enough, to become a more ordinary comic book movie: the tormented, swearing, drinking and smoking anti-hero Constantine becomes a real hero, too good to be true, with a heart and big guns, shooting around, saving the day. Of course he has to save the world, what kind of movie would it be otherwise. But his sharp edge gets lost and I started missing it. It comes back by moments, but in general he is to nice and friendly towards good people. A lot of this might have to do with Rachel Weisz, as Angela investigating the strange suicide of her twin sister, being to shiny and sweet to be a good companion for Constantine. The character of Angela (and her twin sister) might have good potential, but Rachel Weisz misses something to make those potentials reality.But there are other things in the movie to make up for that: the angel Gabriel takes over from Constantine to becoming a more interesting character. Tilda Swinton is very well casted to play this character. I was quite surprised when Gavin Rossdale suddenly appeared on the screen, as half-breed demon Balthazar. Later Sithboy told me that the director, Francis Lawrence, is also a video clip director, and probably picked up Rossdale that way. Anyway, I must say Gavin Rossdale is not too bad as a demon. The thematic of heaven and hell, demons, angels, exorcism, etc. is attractive and keeps a bit of mystery alive in the movie and makes it amusing to watch.In short: the movie was amusing, good entertainment, but it didn't make me go up in it's world, it didn't stick with me and it didn't make me really enthusiastic. It didn't make me feel, like I think a real good movie should.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Constantine's Hellish Vision,"""Constantine"" is the movie adaptation of Alan Moore's popular ""Hellblazer"" graphic novels. Keanu Reeves stars in the title role, a Los Angeles detective who specializes in the supernatural. John Constantine is dying of lung cancer, and tries to secure his place in Heaven by dispatching demons to Hell. The story is fascinating with its discussion of angels, demons and their half-human spawn on Earth. The visuals are striking with its bleak depiction of Hell. But some of the sights aren't so pretty, such as the half-decapitated demons. Some fans of the comic might bristle at the differences in the movie from the original material, such as Constantine being American instead of British. But however you feel about the comic, the movie is worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
"Interesting story, cool action and rich lore with lots of details","I finally got around to watch Constantine, and glad I did. It felt so refreshing to watch a ""superhero movie"" that didn't use all it's runtime to tell the protagonist's backstory. Here we are thrust straight into John Constantine's daily life with deep, deep lore behind every detail and character.Constantine himself is portrayed as chain smoking demo-specialist with dry humour, who is not too nice about new people (even if they are hot like Rachel Weisz's character). He has some very intersting allies, like the alcoholic priest, nerdy tech-wizard and ""morpheus"" in the club basement. The antagonist's are all well presented and interesting, each have scenes to shine.Second thing I liked was the plot. So much story and details and twists. A murder-mystery with saving the world. In the era of run-off-the-mill superhero movies, Constantine had so much going on in each scene both in front of the camera and in the background.The details and lore behind every object and character also kept each scene interesting. Why does John have tons of water canisters in his apartment. Why there are windows each direction? What is the library where they visited Gabriel, the techno-club with more hidden secrets or the cool gadgets John gets to use? After the movie I really want to read the original comics to learn more about the world of John Constantine.John Constantine himself was cool as hell (pun intended), with John Wick style costume (although a very loose tie), witty oneliners and the ability to solve problems without using (traditional) guns.Considering the movie was made in 2005, the CGI and practical effects hold up very well. The movie also looks good all the time, and even if they live in sunny California LA, each scene looks gritty and dark and rainy. That suits the story.Highly recommended for any fantasy/scifi/action/adventure/Keanu fan out there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A surprisingly decent film.,"Given that this film stars Keanu Reeves I wasn't expecting much but it is entertaining stuff.One point to make is that this film was billed as an adaptation of the comic Hellblazer, it isn't. The only connection between this and Hellblazer is the name of Constantine and the fact that he smokes. Hellblazer is, generally, a dark, cynical and intelligent comic with lots of twisted characters and ambiguous plot lines, Constantine is a straight forward action film with some dark elements.For once Reeves wooden acting suits a role, Constantine is moody and uncommunicative allowing Reeves to be brooding without having to stretch any acting muscles, Weisz is OK as the romantic interest and the rest of the cast have almost nothing to do. Stormare is quite bad as the devil but that has more to do with the direction than the acting.The plot runs along at a good pace with a few surprises and plenty of action and although the ending is overplayed and almost farcical in some parts it is still done quite well.This is a simple and enjoyable film, nothing to get excited about but a pleasant enough way to spend some time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

I'm torn ....,"I watched it recently for the first time and I don't know the Hellblazers comics very well but I expected a dark but funny movie - similar to Hellboy, a bit edgier and more subtle humor. It was dark and overall a good, also the lines weren't bad, but dead pan delivery is not something Reeves can do and thus the whole thing suffered. Weisz performance was great and I liked the story and the visuals, but again you only see a lot of wasted potential when it comes to the lead performance. His tick with the Zippo is getting annoying really fast and his lines come off as something a juvenile brat would say. Which is again a lot of wasted potential considering the intriguing premise for Constantine's character, with a Machiavellian approach to find redemption and ultimately salvation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A Muddled Mess,"Muddled horror film that lacks not only credibility in its convictions but lacks a leading man that could make you believe in what is going on. Keanu Reeves is miscast to the point of it being a crime against cinema itself and he's so bad in this role that you wish he was playing in those Bill and Ted's films instead of being here in this film. His presence in this film makes it a cruel joke and that's pretty bad considering the fact that it did have potential but with a director who does not seem to know on what he is doing and a screenplay that is so horrible that you do end up cringing at some of the dialog spoken, the movie was destine to fail. The other actors in this film are just as bad Keanu himself with the exception of Rachel Weisz, whose great performance goes way above and beyond on what this movie really deserved and to Tilda Swinton, who does do wonders with her very badly written role. Other than Weisz and Swinton, the movie is more juvenile than compelling and that really the fault of the people in charge because they wanted to have their cake and eat it too with out taking account that the subject matter deserved better than this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A fair mainstream adaptation of a very dark graphic  novel series,"Keanu would never have been my first choice even for a young John Constantine, though he did a decent enough job of it. That matter aside this was a fairly decent film version of the graphic novel.The inclusion of Garth Ennis as a writer on the project may have been its only saving grace for all this reviewer can see. Ennis is a well known writer among the whiskey and cigarettes comics crowd. His work on the Hellblazer series was excellent and one only hopes that we can see some work done toward making ""Preacher"" into a series of Motion Pictures or perhaps a cable series.Without any fore-knowledge of the comics the movie works as one in a long series of what used to be called B movies. Personally I am a big fan of the B movie.Rachel Weisz makes a welcome addition to any movie and this was no exception. Coincidently she also played in a classic pair of B's, ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"".If you think you might enjoy a modern remake of a classic theme, i.e. ""what to do when the Devil owns your marker"" with an attractive cast and some cool special effects I would recommend this film.

Keanu Reeves in a successful Dark Comedy !,"Some of the scathing comments for Constantine are laughably imperceptive, much worse than the movie.People should take a step back and compare this to the likes of Van Helsing, and it will be apparent how much better it is. The plot is *much* richer, the special effects are equal, and the acting is certainly better.Keanu in particular does an excellent job. His down-beat portrayal of the depressed, chain-smoking, wise-cracking, cynical tool-of-god character is spot on. This is meant to be tongue-in-cheek, people! Almost every scene has a touch of dark humor that makes it clear the movie (and Keanu) are not taking themselves too seriously. It appears reviewers have completely ignored this, and want to see it as a standard horror film, which it is not.I was very pleasantly surprised at how watchable the film (DVD) was, chuckled many times at the dark Catholic humor, and enjoyed Keanu's performance.

If you are not a comic book fan, it's not gonna make much sense, even if you are familiar with the Christian mythos. Actors are doing a good job most of the time. Keanu is decent, and Stormare does an excellent job! Consider it more as a more serious Dr. Who, which deals with Christian mythos instead of sci-fi. There isn't a lot of action, and when there is, it's nothing to write home about. As I mentioned, first half of the movie is boring, but it picks up after that. It's nothing glorious and majestic, but it can be fun, if you have the patience and you will probably like it more if you read the comic book. Give it a try :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

"Constantine. Thats it, this movie is what it is.","The acting in Constantine wasn't great but it didn't make me upset or go write a nasty review.

It didn't let me down but it failed to satisfy me plot wise. For it's genre, well... I don't believe there is a better movie. In my opinion Constantine is the best of its kind and the actors were mostly believable. I like the comedy in this movie, but it doesn't revive it from the movie as a whole. Hey, the characters were pretty cool. Constantine didn't blow me away and I wouldn't say any other characters were bad ass. See it for yourself and judge it.

Could have been better,"Well,I don't like Keanu Reeves that much he just happens to be in a few of the movies i happen to like.

He meets the Angel Gabriel and Satan. He visits Hell several times during the movie. The acting, considering i don't like Keanu Reeves could have been better, and maybe he could have redeemed himself to me. The violence in this movie is fairly tame, but has a few intense scenes of action. The language is no bad at all, only 2 uses of the F-word through the whole movie. I don't recall any sexual content.

A surprisingly good ride.,"Honestly, after the last two Matrix movies, I never thought I'd be able to see Keanu Reeves' face without crying. My heart had been pulled out and stomped on. To say I had reservations going in to see this movie would be putting it *rather* lightly.I was very pleasantly surprised. Knowing a little bit about the comics, I had some idea of what to expect from Reeve's character, John Constantine. No, of course he doesn't do the character complete justice, what movie based on an incredible literature ever lives up to the expectations of the fans? However, Reeves manages to pick up on quite a few of Constatntine's more endearing traits, making his performance more than stomach-able (shocking, I know).A surprising show of talent in support, from fellow actors Rachel Weisz (Constantine's female cop sidekick), Tilda Swinton (the archangel Gabriel), Pruitt Taylor Vince (the priestly sidekick), and even Shia LaBeouf (the cabby sidekick), Djimon Hounsou (bartender extraordinary), and Peter Stormare (good 'ole Satan), ties this tale together in a weirdly haunting occult mirror world which dominates the mood of the movie, hovering over the presence of reality with a very thin vale.Visually, this movie was a treat. Visual effects, yes, but not obtrusive (well, most of the time) or garish. Supprising cinematographic choices that helped the mood of the movie, keeping up it's sweeping, fast-paced story. Just when you think you know how the movie ends, you don't. And then you still don't. And- oh, wait, guess again.As for sexual themes, well, while they don't dominate the movie, the tension runs a fine line just this side of corny, and plays into the movie's theme, actually, quite appropriately.A definite see for any horror movie fans, action movie fans, or just plain 'ole weird crap movie fans. It tries to be all, and winds up somewhere in the middle- but in a very good way. A unique movie in many ways.

Much more interesting movie than the trailer,"If like me you saw the trailer a number of times and thought this film was going to be another ""Exorcist"" or ""Omen"" wannabee with Keanu Reeves sleepwalking through the part, you might want to reconsider.

(I've had no exposure to the underlying comic books, so I have no idea what the ""true"" John Constantine is supposed to be.)In particular, I enjoyed the way the film blurred the typical good/evil distinctions even when describing an epic battle between the two forces. The ""good"" characters do things we question, while the ""bad"" ones occasionally do good (or at least are seen as more honest about their intentions.) This highlights Constantine as a man caught between two worlds who must sometimes visit the dark side in his attempts to do good.Because the film raises interesting questions about good/evil, theology, and even psychiatry in dealing with people of visions, this is one of the few movies of its type where I walked away looking forward to the sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
A solid genre picture for a mainstream audience,"CONSTANTINE (2005) Dir. Francis Lawrence 'Hell wants him. Heaven won't take him. Earth needs him.' Starring: Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weiz, Djimon Honsou, Tilda Swinton, Shia La Beouf.In a world, split into three parallel universes; heaven, hell and earth, John Constantine (Reeves) is a bad-ass, chain smoking, exorcist ridding the world of half-breeds (half human, half angel or demon) in order to assure safe passage into heaven.There is no denying that like much of Hollywood's recent output, the film is a visual feast, including mouth-watering set-pieces involving Constantines trip to hell and numerous face-offs with a wide range of strange and interesting creatures. Reeves goes about the film without ever moving out of second gear in a performance suggesting he has the emotional range of a pea. Weiz is steady and assured but never sparkling as the sister of a suicide victim, unsure of whether she is in hell or not.The plot, while interesting gets too tangled up in itself over the 122 minutes, heaping complication on complication as Constantine and Detective Dodson (Weiz) help prevent the world from falling into the hands of an exceedingly camp devil (Peter Stormare). Certain points are not concluded such as the apparent disappearance of the devil's son and the fact that the devil has brown sticky tar on his feet.Though, the script could do with some work to flesh out the paper-thin characters, the premise is intriguing enough, helped by dazzling visuals and Keanu's star-power, to give a genre picture a chance with a mainstream audience.VERDICT: 3/5",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"

Sometimes bigger isn't necessary better,"""Constantine"" is, in no uncertain terms, a wasted opportunity. What always puzzles me is how film-makers can take perfectly good source material and transform it into something less effective, less gripping, less fun. The tales of ""Hellblazer"" comic's John Constantine could have made the perfect viewing experience with very little tampering. Shot in the UK, with a medium-sized or even small budget and a no-star cast, this could have been a cult classic. Instead, Hollywood have gone down the usual route, outdoing themselves this time with the worst example of miscasting in recent times.Let's get this straight - Keanu Reeves was never going to play a memorable John Constantine...it's a bridge-too-far for this actor. In the right movie, Reeves shines (take the superb ""Point Break"" as an example). Here, though, Reeves is a drowning man, having bit off more than he can chew, and then some.The film scrapes a 7 as it's visually impressive, the scenes of Hell are memorable and nightmarish and the production does display more intelligence than many other blockbuster affairs. Rachel Weisz delivers an understated and realistic performance but her heart doesn't seem in this production.I would have dearly loved a faithful adaptation of the comic books...fans should perhaps avoid ""Constantine"" as it's a painful viewing for those craving the raw and uncompromising thrills of ""Hellblazer"". Non-fans will take this as it stands, a big-budget, Hollywood production with an imaginative plot but no soul.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
overall very good action movie in the Gothic category,"I have to say i've never read much of hellblazer, but the movie in itself was rather entertaining. demons, exorcisms, Satan, angels..cool. one of the only movies i actually liked a lot with keanu reeves in it, could've been better cast, but when is he in something that could NOT have been better cast... the only fear i have is that fans of hellblazer were as disappointed with him as constantine as i was when they stuck him playing john harker in Dracula, utterly gut-wrenching to someone as big of a fan of the classic novel as i am. tho i do hate him i thought he played the role fairly well (even tho i kept waiting for him to say ""dude, it's Satan"") i know i've been let down by movies destroying some of my most beloved comics, books, and video games (resident evil..Christ)so i do apologize to those hellblazer fans, but for a layman to the comics such as me, i thought this movie was a very good watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Where's the respect for the book?!,"As usual here's another comic book movie made with absolutely no respect for the creators who thought it all up. Granted Hellblazer isn't the most popular of comic books not garnering the kind of fan-base as Batman, Spiderman, or the Punisher and as a result hasn't instilled any real disgust toward the film. But really, how would you feel as an artist to see your creation butchered by someone else in such a way? Don't believe me. The creators of the book fought hard to have their names removed from the film. Sound like someone who's happy with the representation of their work? Not at all. Constantine is an over blown action flick without the intelligence and depth of the actual book.When are we going to stop putting up with such crap that has such disdain for the original material like the Punisher movies, Constantine, Spawn, Catwoman, and the last few Joel Schumacher Batman disasters before we actually stop going to see these movies? Am I crazy or aren't movies like Spiderman and Hellboy better films because they respect the original material and their creators. After all, their has to be a reason they're making a movie after the comic book. The original had to be good enough for them to want to make the movie. And it's usually because of the writing and the detail the creators pour into their creations.I never saw Constantine in the theatre. Instead I saw a bootlegged copy my friend got to compare to the book. I didn't even want to watch it with him except he talked me into it. I couldn't in good conscious, and with respect to it's creators, line the pockets of people who would butcher someone else's work so easily and without regard.I of course will be first in line to see Sin City when it comes out. Frank Miller himself was in charge and the comic used as story boards. I bet my life it'll be much better, make more money, and garner better reviews than Constantine will on it's best day. It's about time a comic book movie was made right. Hopefully it'll be contagious.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
Interesting but flawed Gothic comic book tale,"Apparently God and the Devil made a bet. Not the one involving Job, but you'd think that after that debacle Satan would have learned his lesson. In any case, they both promised to stay in the background and simply influence people's actions, with the fate of mankind's souls being in a cosmic toss up. But every now and then, a demon decides to sneak around the rules.Within this neutrality agreement lie certain people with the ability to see what's really happening behind the scenes. One of these gifted few is John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), a chain-smoking world-weary rogue who uses his powers as a mercenary exorcist in Los Angeles. Constantine himself has been to Hell briefly, having committed the mortal sin of suicide before being saved by doctors, and now is trying to redeem himself by sending demons back where they came from. Recently diagnosed with lung cancer, it seems that time is running out for him to get back in the good graces of the Almighty.His life becomes complicated with the arrival of Detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), a police officer whose twin sister recently committed suicide. Dodson suspects some sort of foul play is involved, and Constantine reluctantly is forced to agree when he notices a high amount supernatural activity in effect.Realizing the balance is starting to shift toward the dark side, Constantine must decide if he can earn his way out of Hell on actions alone, or if there is something more to it then that.""Constantine"" is a movie that almost gets it right in terms of storytelling. Based on the DC Comic ""Hellblazer,"" the film has all the prerequisites for a good fantasy-action tale. But it only scratches the surface in showcasing this world that the characters inhabit, instead relying on Gothic, moody film noir atmosphere.First time director Francis Lawrence cranks up the action nicely, but is betrayed by a screenplay that assumes the audience is already familiar with the universe in which the story takes place. While it's nice to let the crowd fill in their own blanks in some cases, giving some meaning to the rules wouldn't hurt, either.Also strange is the weird mix of Christianity with Eastern principles such as dualism, that is that evil and good have equal powers in the universe and both are necessary to balance each other out. The two religious views just don't mesh with each other, and as a result the story doesn't really capture either very well.Reeves plays his role quite convincingly, perhaps because he already honed his ""outcast Chosen One"" skills during ""The Matrix"" trilogy. Burnt-out and perpetually throwing another cigarette in his mouth, at least when he's not coughing up lung tissue, Reeves manages to take a selfish, disreputable jerk and make him quite sympathetic. In the ten years since ""Speed"" was released, he has grown into the role of action star quite nicely.Weisz basically does here what she did for Brendan Fraser in ""The Mummy"" movies  play second fiddle. While she does give Dodson some much needed angst, Weisz is trapped in stock character, and can't bring her to life. Far more interesting but sadly underused are Tilda Swinton as very androgynous angel Gabriel, and Peter Stormare who camps things up nicely as Satan. While more time with the former may have fleshed out the angel's motivations, too much more time with the latter may have worn out his welcome.""Constantine"" beckons for a greater story to be told with these characters, and with any luck there will be. Just a personal nitpick, however. How come movies such as these have to be engulfed in Catholic imagery? Are there no Methodists ready to kick demon butt? Just asking.7 out of 10 stars. Reeves acquits himself nicely and the movie is still good despite a lackluster plot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror"
