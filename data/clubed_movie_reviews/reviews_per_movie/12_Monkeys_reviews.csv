One of Gilliam's better films.,"Twelve Monkeys is typically Terry Gilliam, loaded with the director's trademark quirky visuals, and, as such, should get right up my nose (I'm not a huge fan of his hallucinatory, surreal style, to say the least). And yet I still love this unusual time travel tale: it's got great performances, with a particularly strong turn from the then up-and-coming Brad Pitt, and Gilliam's chaotic storytelling actually suits the inherent madness of the whole movie. The twisty-turny plot keeps the viewer on their toes throughout, and Gilliam pulls all the threads together neatly for the finale. The occasional moment of visual excess still niggles (the steampunk/trash-heap aesthetic of the future isn't my cup of tea), but on the whole this is definitely one of the director's best films.Bruce Willis stars as James Cole, a convict from the future who is sent to the past to try and discover the origins of the virus that wiped out most of the world's human population. After a violent altercation with the police of 1990, Cole is sent to an asylum where he meets patient Jeffrey Goines (Pitt), son of a wealthy scientist (played by Christopher Plummer), and quite possibly plants the seeds of mankind's destruction in the lunatic's mind. Together with his psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), Cole tries to prevent the disaster from occurring.At times, it seems as though Gilliam has only the slightest command of proceedings, and the film demands that the viewer puts in 100% concentration to avoid becoming as lost and confused as Cole himself, who becomes more and more unsure about what is reality and what isn't as the film progresses. Characters ramble, often seemingly incoherently, but what they are saying is, for the most part, intrinsic to the outcome, so pay attention (or have your finger on the rewind button). Those who make the effort will be rewarded by a film that is constantly inventive and frequently clever, and worth at least a few viewings to appreciate it to the fullest.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Absolute Top Tier Sci-Fi,"I know ""12 Monkeys"" gets its respects in being a highly respectable science fiction motion picture, but it deserves a whole lot more then just that. I believe this is one of the greatest Sci-Fi flicks ever created. It's imaginative, visionary, and masterfully conceptualized; all imperative elements in the orchestration of profound science fiction. Brad Pitt delivered one of the most entertaining and fun performances I've ever witnessed as a crazed looney bird who's the son of a eminent virologist, and to a less profound degree in the art of acting, Bruce Willis displayed one of his greater performances as well. 12 monkeys hits on all cylinders and makes it one of the great Terry Gilliam's most profound achievements.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Imaginative, clever, engaging and very enjoyable  one of the best sci-fi's I've seen","In the future humans exist underground, the surface having become uninhabitable due to the release of a virus years before in 1996. The ruling classes are scientists and large sections of the population are held as prisoners in tiny cells; prisoners who ""volunteer"" to help work out what happened back in 1996 that killed off 99% of the population. Requiring information about the visit, James Cole is sent back to 1996 to gather what information he can. However, sent to 1990 by accident, Cole finds himself in a mental hospital where he meets From the very start this film marks itself out as being very much a Terry Gilliam product and those who hate his work will probably dislike this film for the same reason. However, pleasing people like that is not my concern and 12 Monkeys is actually one of Gilliam's most accessible films as it sets his imaginative style within a narrative that is satisfyingly complex and thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. The story is not perfect though, the connection to the start is nice but the ultimate twist behind the virus just seems to have been thrown in to keep the film tidy; a minor complaint though because even then the main thrust of the story (Cole) keeps it together. The twisting plot plays with both Cole's and our sense of reality and it is genuinely gripping from start to finish Gilliam's direction is superb, whether it be the realistic world of the 1990's filmed with clever angles and shots or the wonderfully twisted world of the future, it is all excellent and was such a pleasant find in my local cinema at the time.The film benefits from great turns from the cast. Willis was having a bit of a career resurrection in the mid-90's when several films showed us that he could actually act  for me, 12 Monkeys was one of them. Willis is superb as he spins from madness to sanity and back again; he underplays all the way and is so much better than the wise-cracking everyman that he is better known for. Pitt is just as good but in a different way. Getting an Oscar nomination that he deserved, Pitt risks overdoing it but pushes his crazy performance as far as he can without being indulgent  I'm not saying he is perfect but I would could this as one of his best performances to date. Stowe is very much in the shadow of these two but she holds her own well. Morse, Seda, Meloni and Plummer are all good in minor roles but really the film belongs to the lead three  Willis in particular and Pitt in a great supporting role.Overall this is a great sci-fi; the story is great and is only helped by Gilliam's imaginative direction and awareness of the fantastic. Meanwhile the cast are very strong, with the famous leads giving some of their best performances to date. Downbeat, imaginative, engaging and one of the more accessible of Gilliam's films, it stands out as one of the best American sci-fi's of the past few decades.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Mind-Bending and Heart-Breaking,"Terry Gilliam's stunning feature-length adaptation of Chris Marker's short film LA JETEE is full of mind-bending surprises, yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast.  Gilliam's flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by David and Janet Peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor James Cole (Willis at his most Steve McQueen-like -- better than McQueen, even!), a time-traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals.  Willis, the justifiably Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers.  Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is haunting.  This one's a don't-miss!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
these monkeys will go to heaven...,"""Twelve monkeys""'s got all the elements to become Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. An outstanding screenplay, a sustained rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogs. Moreover, he had a good nose about the cast. ""Twelve monkeys"" is also the first movie where Bruce Willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies. Here, a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero (as it was the case in ""Die hard""). No matter how he tries, he's a prisoner of the time. The movie contains a very thrilling end too. It's got a real dramatic power. But this terrific movie is also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the ones that could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that can create illnesses). No matter how long it will take, ""twelve monkeys"" will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

However, he is mistakenly sent to 1990 and locked up in a mental institution, where he meets the lunatic Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt).

This is amazing stuff,"Normally I try to avoid Sci-Fi movies as much as I can, because this just isn't a genre that really appeals to me. Light sabers, UFO's, aliens, time traveling... most of the time it's nothing for me. However, there is one movie in the genre that I'll always give a place in my list of top movies and that's this ""Twelve Monkeys"" I remember to be completely blown away by it the first time, but even now, after having it seen several times already, I'm still one of its biggest fans. Every time I see it, this movie seems to get better and better.Somewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996, leaving only 1 percent of the population alive. James Cole is one of them. He's a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a 'volunteer' to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. They believe it was spread by a mysterious group called 'The Twelve Monkeys' and need the virus before it mutated, so that scientists can study it. But their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert...What I like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not. Is this just an illusion, created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real? Does he really come from the future and can he really travel through time? Was the population really wiped out by a virus, released by the army of The Twelve Monkeys? Those are all questions that will leave you wondering from the beginning until the end. If the makers of this movie had chosen to make it all more obvious, I'm sure that I would never have liked it as much as I did now. It's just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time. But that's not the only good thing about this movie of course. The acting is amazing too. Normally I'm not too much a fan of Bruce Willis, but what he did in this movie was just astonishing. Together with Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt he should have won several awards for it, because together with the amazing story, they made this movie work so incredibly well.Even after several viewings, I'm still a huge fan of this movie. Except for this movie, I have only seen one other Terry Gilliam movie and that's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", which wasn't bad, but didn't really convince me either. However, it's this movie that really makes me look forward to his other work. I give it a 9/10, maybe even a 9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"great potential, but big flaws","Now, I thought this movie was good and I suggest seeing it.  It is very entertaining.  However, several things detracted from my ability to really get into the story (which was very good).  I'll see anything by Gilliam... you know its going to be something interesting.1)Brad Pitt's acting.  Come on, Brad... your character can't be THAT crazy? I would have appreciated a little more subtlety to his insanity.  This led the viewer not to take his character seriously (let alone a global threat). His acting was very over the top and ineffective.  Four years later he figured it out in Fight Club... in which he was superb.  Unless he makes some horrible career moves, Pitt will be remembered as one of the premier/bad-boy actors of this period in film.2) The ending... just flat out bad and melodramatic.With some fine tuning, I believe 12 Monkeys could have been right up there with Seven or Silence of the Lambs as a great film of the 90's.  However, it just isn't.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Intriguing story, lackluster execution","In 2027 James Cole is a prisoner living beneath the streets of Philadelphia with some of the very few survivors of a virus which wiped out most of humankind back in 1996. Somehow these people living under the streets have invented time travel. OK then. The scientists in charge send Cole back to 1996 to collect information on the virus in order to develop a cure. Why, if you have time travel capabilities, the focus is on finding a cure for the few people alive in 2027 rather than stopping the virus from wiping out the species in the first place is not particularly clear. Anyhow Cole's mission gets off to a bad start when he ends up in 1990 rather than 1996 and immediately finds himself placed in a mental institution. This is all very weird. It's about to get much weirder.Cole ends up jumping back and forth in time, quite befuddled by the whole experience. Anyone watching this film will also feel that sense of befuddlement. It's certainly an intriguing story but one which director Terry Gilliam never really got a firm grasp on. The film ends up being a bit of a disjointed mess. You're drawn into the story but ultimately end up lost in this movie's complex maze. Bruce Willis turns in a solid performance as Cole. He's solid and reliable, giving this film which threatens to veer out of control some desperately needed grounding. Brad Pitt is the other big star. He plays Jeffrey Goines who is one of the craziest crazies in the institution. Pitt plays the part with wild-eyed manic enthusiasm. The effect is quite jarring. Yes, Jeffrey is supposed to be crazy but this is some serious overacting on Pitt's part. Madeleine Stowe plays the female lead, Kathryn Railly, Cole's doctor at the institution. Cole pops in and out of her life. Initially she thinks he's nuts but as she processes new information she may have to re-evaluate that position. Unfortunately the chemistry between Willis and Stowe is lacking, the relationship between their characters falls rather flat. And as their relationship becomes more important in the story that becomes a big problem for the movie.Ultimately 12 Monkeys is a rather frustrating film. It has an intriguing premise but the story does not play itself out in a very satisfying way. Things get muddled pretty quickly and the story twists itself into some confusing knots. The film tries to spring some surprises but telegraphs some of its twists way too soon, which is part of the reason the ending is not nearly as powerful as Gilliam would hope. Meanwhile Gilliam's assortment of visual tricks throughout serve no purpose other than to distract and annoy. Stowe's performance lacks energy, Pitt's has too much energy. Christopher Plummer is underused. Willis does a fine job but too much of what surrounds him disappoints. For all the jumping back and forth in time the film is rather slowly paced. The story may interest you but there really is not much in the way of entertainment. You would imagine a story such as this would be full of exciting moments but excitement is in very short supply. 12 Monkeys held great promise but in the end that promise is not fulfilled.",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Pure Mad Genius Filmmaking,"It is unfortunate that all big budget films cannot be as good as 12 MONKEYS. But alas is that not what makes these once in a while films so special? Obviously director Gilliam is a rare talent, a treasure. But even for him 12 Monkeys outshines nearly everything else he's ever done. (And that says a lot. Brazil after all is another incredible film.) But this movie has two things going for it that ale it rise to the very top of the top. #1 it features a stellar cast who all equally deliver fantastic performances. This is Bruce Willis at his peak -- before he sold out and went all Die Hard, when e still cared about being taken seriously as an actor. Same with Brad Pitt. Many attribute this film as the first time Pitt showed the world that he truly was an actor and not just another pretty face. (He further proved that point in Fight Club and many others through the years -- Money Ball, Tree of Life, et al.) and then there's Madeline Stowe. Besides the stellar acting though 12 Monkeys accomplished something even more important: it gave us the opportunity for future films such as Memento and Inception. 12 Monkeys not only featured a non-linear approach to time travel, it did so erratically boldly dynamically and unapologetically so, allowing future filmmakers, like the aforementioned referenced Nolan brothers, to feel safe stepping even further out on those limbs. 12 Monkeys opened that door and so many others. This is a film you can see over and over and still see something new in it AND be moved by. A classic by all standards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Full of Gillian-isms, Empty of Willis-isms - in a good way...","There is a story (possibly apocryphal) about an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the start of Twelve Monkeys. Gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think about the aircraft one from the Fifth Element) and handed it to Butch Bruce. It was entitled ""Things Bruce Willis Does When He Acts"". It ended with a simple message saying: ""please don't do any of the above in my movie"".There is a fact about this movie (definitely true). Gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing.I would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that is The Twelve Monkeys.Visually, the Twelve Monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a Gilliam film. It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness. Gilliam delights in wrong-footing his audience. Although the ending of the Twelve Monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real, Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka in the clockwork, bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate. It is this journey, and the character developments they undergo, which unsettles.I love Gilliam films (Brazil, in particular). But they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas, and so much enthusiasm, that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess (Brazil, in particular). I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but there's no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight-plotting department. Style, substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex-Python.Whatever the truth of the rumour above, Gilliam also manages to get a first rate (and very atypical) performance out of the bald one. Bruce is excellent in this film, as are all the cast, particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt.It's been over a decade since this film was released. When I watched it again, I realised that it hadn't really aged. I had changed, of course. And this made me look at the film with fresh eyes. This seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that, partly at least, is about reflections in mirrors, altered perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through time that we all make. A first rate film. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A brilliant movie. One of the very best science fiction movies of the 1990s, and one or Terry Gilliam's greatest achievements.","I grew up on Python and have followed Terry Gilliam's subsequent directorial career for more years than I care to remember. Half his output leaves me cold, the other half dazzle me beyond belief. 'Brazil' is his movie that I would rate the highest, but I've come to think that I have unfairly underrated 'Twelve Monkeys'. I have always enjoyed it, but I've only come to realize just how good a movie it really is. Sometimes I think it is even better than 'Brazil'. It's a close pick. Unlike 'Brazil' Gilliam didn't come up with the script. He basically was initially involved as a director for hire. Thankfully the script itself (by David and Janet Peoples) is first rate. On top of that Gilliam manages to stamp his own style and approach on to the material without sliding into complete self-indulgence as he sometimes does. The budget of this movie wasn't anywhere near as large as you would imagine from the impressive results on screen. It looks superb. Gilliam coaxes  first rate performances out of Bruce Willis (quite a surprise) and Brad Pitt (not such a surprise, see also 'Johnny Suede' and 'Kalifornia'). Madeline Stowe is also very good, as is Christopher Plummer, and in a small but important role, David Morse. It's difficult to fault this movie. It is a joy to watch, and improves with each viewing. I also highly recommend Chris Marker's 'La Jetee', the short experimental film which inspired 'Twelve Monkeys'. It is also brilliant.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Terry Gilliam: Visionary - 12 Monkeys: Vision,"I had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago, and outside the theater I was confronted by a camera crew from a local TV station looking for comments on the film. At the time, the only words that escaped my mouth were ""Awesome. Just awesome."" I like to think I can articulate myself a little better than that, but at the time I was somewhat incapable of doing so.The story is intriguing and thought provoking, and the acting is first rate from all the principals. This film was the first one that Terry Gilliam directed that he didn't have a hand in the writing credit for. Back with Universal after his long, arduous battle with them over ""Brazil"", Terry had achieved what he wanted most; the ""final cut"". Terry is a master craftsman, and each shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been constructed carefully with determination and conviction. It is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept. Unfortunately, limitations still exist in such arrangements.The Universal Collector's Edition DVD of this film is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features aren't listed on the box. It contains among other things, a director/producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on the making of the film called ""The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys"". It tells of some of the creative pitfalls in filmmaking, including a test of mettle when preview screenings tested poorly, striking the team with feelings of self-doubt and despair.

Superior sci-fi,"A convict from the year 2035 is assigned a mission in order to win parole. He is sent back in time by a group of scientists to try and discover the source of a fatal plague that wiped out most of the human race. A plague which did not kill animals. In his travels he discovers mysterious graffiti announcing the arrival of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.Terry Gilliam has always been an interesting film director and visual stylist even when some of his movies are uneven. With 12 Monkeys he perhaps produces his most wholly satisfying work. It's a consistently compelling mystery within the framework of a time-travelling sci-fi narrative. It's a fairly complex story, so attention is demanded of the viewer. This is perhaps the chief strength of the film, however, as the labyrinthine narrative is one that benefits from multiple viewings. There are still some elements of ambiguity even at the end, so it's a film that actively encourages discussion.There's a good cast too. Bruce Willis was on a bit of a run in the mid 90's and this is one of the great films he appeared in at the height of his powers. On the other hand, it's one of the first films where Brad Pitt was allowed to display his acting chops and show that he was a lot more than just a pretty face. While in visual terms, it's as interesting as you would expect from a Gilliam movie; although not as phantasmagorical as some of his more personal fantasy features. In 12 Monkeys he was a director for hire but it's not immediately obvious. Perhaps the distance this gave him actually helped instill some discipline that made the whole more cohesive on the whole.

The effects launched by travel into the past are so fundamentally unpredictable, they can't stand up. He says he can't change things and then goes about changing things. I can sense the frustration in Bruce Willis's character. He is trying to buy favor with his own time. But how can he even have his own time if he changes the past, even in the smallest way. We could go on. Once we just choose to ignore these questions, we have a basic chase movie where the kidnap victim does begin to relate to her captor and his cause.

Well constructed and deliciously unique film of visionair Gilliam,"Terry Gilliam is an unique filmmaker and Twelve Monkeys just might be his masterpiece.

"Bringing suspense, philosophy and romance, and also interesting from a visual and with a thought-provoking plot, ""Twelve Monkeys"" is one of those films worth discussing","Carrying in each frame the chaotic and striking visual style of its director, ""Twelve Monkeys"" is an interesting science fiction, which also has inspired performances by its cast and a narrative that is at the same time complex and fascinating to conquer the viewer. Featuring a depressing environment in the future and another about to collapse in the past, Terry Gilliam's feature looks more like a nightmare, holding the viewer's attention not only for its look, but also for the clever way that its great premise is developed. Exploring time travel and temporal paradoxes, you are abducted into a confusing plot full of twists and turns. The most fascinating thing about this fantastic script is that, even with a huge knot in the head, it manages to close in a solid and at the same time questioning conclusion. At the end of the film, we come to an issue (no, I'll give spoilers here), something completely acceptable, and that doesn't leave us with the feeling of having been tricked by a script that didn't know how to close. Quite the contrary, the entire text was developed exactly to its conclusion.Inspired by Chris Marker's film ""La Jetée"", David and Janet Peoples' intricate screenplay begins in 2035, when James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to the past to gather information about a lethal virus that has decimated human beings. In 1996, killing an estimated five billion people. However, due to a mistake by the scientists, James returns to 1990 and ends up in a mental institution, where he meets the psychiatrist Kathryn (Madeleine Stowe) and the young Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), son of Dr. Goines (Christopher Plummer) is likely responsible for the birth of the group known as the ""army of Twelve Monkeys"", which theoretically would have spread the lethal virus around the world.Right in its first minutes, ""Twelve Monkeys"" demonstrates its dreamlike facet through the mysterious dream of its protagonist in an airport that, in fact, seems more like a tormenting and recurrent nightmare, appearing in several moments to terrify him. Then, James appears in a rather uncomfortable cell, talking to another prisoner in the underground world (where the few survivors of the virus try to survive) moments before being summoned for a mysterious mission. In this way, the director seeks to facilitate the spectator's identification with his protagonist, who appears vulnerable, in precarious conditions and about to be sent on an uncertain mission. With the help of editor Mick Audsley, Gilliam adds dynamism to the narrative, keeping it always intriguing precisely because he conducts it from the perspective of James, thus placing us in the same position as the protagonist, also succeeding in inserting time travel in an organic way. - with the exception of the first sharp jump from the present to 1990 in Baltimore.Creating a dirty and abandoned world in the present and an unattractive one in the past, the director reflects on screen his protagonist's mental confusion. The chaotic place where James meets the scientists, for example, helps to create the troubled and anarchic atmosphere intended by the director. By the way, the scenes that take place in the present have such an exaggerated caricature tone that, sometimes, they end up making the audience laugh - which serves as comic relief in a narrative that demands a lot of attention. Already in the past, the peeling walls of the asylum make the environment quite realistic and help to illustrate the protagonist's disgust in that place. And if William Ladd Skinner's art direction is essential in this process, the interesting costumes by Julie Weiss not only reinforce this look but also distinguish each era well, such as the Second World War and the 90s.The film's script, written by David Webb and Janet Peoples, manages to create an intriguing dubious perception in the viewer, who at a given moment in the work wonders if the character was hallucinating or if all that had really happened. For those who know La Jetée, this perception may be just a shadow or not even exist, but it is clear to identify the game of realities on the screen, questioning and playing with memory and even with History that can come literally (at this point, more subtly) or aesthetically (very strongly), with very special references to the films ""Monkey Business"" (1931), ""Vertigo"" (1958), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Escape from New York (1981), cinematographic plurality which shows Terry Gilliam's predilection for great excesses and also his ability to work with them organically.Even though the beginning of the film has a slower pace than it should and the first trip is abrupt and uninteresting, the audience quickly forgets about these flaws and focuses on the journey of Cole, who tries to fulfill a complex mission while having the ""misfortune"" of falling in love with a woman from his past, which will lead to more aggressive surveillance by the scientists who sent him and seal his fate at the airport. Gilliam's direction is realistic, even when the production design reaches baroque peaks in the mixture of technologies and inventions throughout the 2035 scenario, which bears many similarities with the environment of ""Brazil"" and ""The Zero Theorem"", similarities that ended up making some cinephiles consider the works part of a trilogy, although this has not been stated or thought by Gilliam. The public is thrown into two worlds that believe themselves, in some way, victorious, but are, each in their own way, decadent and share the same behavioral deviations, manipulation structures maintained by those who hold any kind of power (scientific, war , financial, etc.) and the struggle of some individuals to free themselves from the yoke of this manipulation and control, almost literally reintroducing to us the struggle of the characters in They Live, by John Carpenter: buy, watch TV, obey.In the cast we have the always charismatic, Bruce Willis conquering the viewer with his vulnerable James Cole, taking the audience with him on that journey and convincing even when he begins to question his own sanity - special emphasis on two scenes, one in a hospital bed in front of the scientists and another in a hotel room with Kathryn. Exhibiting the anguish of someone who feels out of place and confused and the determination of someone who has a mission to accomplish, Willis creates a captivating and very human character. Brad Pitt, on the other hand, is sensational as the crazy Jeffrey Goines, with his tics, fast speech, the oscillation in the tone of voice and the constant movement in the eyes, which very well characterize a character that is simultaneously dangerous and fascinating. Together, they are responsible for the best moments of ""Twelve Monkeys"". However, there are other interesting moments, especially when they involve Madeleine Stowe's Kathryn, which conveys well the distress and confusion in the character's mind in the face of James and her statements. And we cannot fail to mention Christopher Plummer, who efficiently embodies Jeffrey's famous father, even though he appears rarely on the scene.At a certain point in the plot, the viewer starts to share James' doubt and asks if all that doesn't really exist only in the protagonist's mind. But the complete turnaround happens when a boy is found in the barn (as he had said it would happen) and, added to a photograph of the first world war and the bullet removed from his leg, proves to Kathryn and the viewer that James was speaking the truth. And then the reference to the classic ""A Falling Body"" appears in Kathryn's disguise, in the images of Hitchcock's film inside a movie theater and even in the soundtrack, thematically tying the narrative and opening up the film's message: we will never be able to change the past. This message is confirmed in the emblematic final scene, where the ""dream"" is repeated. Kathryn's gaze at young James, accompanied by a slight smile, turns this painful scene into a beautiful moment, illustrating the moment in which she realizes that James would live forever in this cycle.Mick Audsley's montage is also efficient and interesting rhymes are created: Cole being scared by a bear in the future to, later in the present, being scared by a stuffed bear are examples of this. And Gilliam, with Roger Pratt's photography, still creates visual anecdotes, such as when the protagonist tries to hide from the police by turning to a shop window only to realize he is on the same television, as it is one of those stores with TVs and cameras turned to the street. The incidental soundtrack is excellent and the imposing tango ""Suite Punta Del Este"" composed by Ástor Piazzolla, brings an unforgettable tone to the plot and has become his trademark, as well as the tracks What a Wonderful World, Blueberry Hill and Sleep Walk, that manage to illustrate the emotional charge of the various journeys throughout the film.Time travel is nothing new in fiction, non-linear scripts too. Apocalyptic future even less. Still, ""Twelve Monkeys"" has an air of innovation. It adds to our lives. It has drama, humor, suspense, philosophy, romance, all wrapped up in a genius idea from a Frenchman who the American knew how to reconstruct with mastery. Interesting from a visual and technical point of view and with a thought-provoking plot, ""Twelve Monkeys"" is one of those films worth discussing in the midst of the current pandemic. Since it is a temporal paradox, if it depends on your characters and history, there is nothing we can do. Regardless of our actions, we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good sci fi,Pretty good film with great twists and turns that keep you engaged. All the acting is wonderful from Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. The plot is very interesting and felt unique.

Interesting!!,Twelve Monkeys is a film that is a nice Science fiction treat for the fans of this genre.It's truly compelling and keeps viewers move in circles around it.The performances were the best I've seen in a long time.Brad Pitt was exceptional. He is one of those actors whom you can rely upon for performance purposes.Bruce Willis was also really a great attraction.

Twelve Monkeys — Ready for a slow crude take on a fatal pandemic?,"Twelve Monkeys is the kind of movie that gets much better with time. With each subsequent viewing, you start appreciating something new, understanding the story a little bit more, and linking new plots elements. I'm saying this because the settings and scenes are rather crude and unpleasant to assimilate, even though the final product is incredible.The good. Tight logical story. Engrossing scenario that gets better with time. Excellent acting. Interesting treatment of a fairly common theme. Great details. Nice conception of the future.The actors. Bruce Willis plays the dislocated and slightly unhinged hero to perfection. Great acting. Madeleine Stowe is just right as the unwilling but open-minded participant. Brad Pitt's mad interpretation is pure genius and an obvious precursor of his role in Fight Club (review still to come).The bad. The whole flick will not please everybody for its gruesome take, the slow development, and the logical conclusion, which I must admit is as it should be.

Monkey dung,"Onetime cartoonist Terry Gillian has a vivid Gothic imagination, but also a long track record of proving that this alone is not enough to define a good film-maker. Unfortunately for Gilliam, his films are not just bad, but unusual and bad as well, and so while many bad film-makers have made fortunes, Gilliam has repeatedly lost Hollywood millions. 'Twelve Monkeys', a science-fiction thriller starring human ape Bruce Willis, isn't quite as bad as it initially promises to be, but features characteristically wacky editing and a self-consciously confused plot, as well as what must be Brad Pitt's most annoying role ever. Its visual richness can't hide the simple truth that it's insufficiently funny or clever; and what's sad is that the same can be said of most of Gilliam's other movies.

Most relevent film of this critical time..,"A deadly virus, released in the year 1996, wipes out almost all of humanity; forcing survivors to live underground. A group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to have released the virus.In 2035, James Cole ,a prisoner living in a subterranean compound beneath the ruins of philadelphia.Cole is selected to be trained and sent back in time to find the original virus, in order to help scientists develop a cure,and he gets stuck inside the time loop,which is unchangable(Predestination Paradox)though this post apocalyptic movie is based on a deadly virus but which i like the most in this film is the concept of time travel..
moreover the strong acting skill of Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt and other actors makes it that kind of movie you wanna watch again and again..
Terry Gilliam,really a underrated director,managed to execute the complicated plot (it is not very easy to create a plot with predestination paradox and moreover making the plot understandable to each viewer is the toughest part)really well
He also succeeded to make a sci-fi movie realistic,which is more appreciable..

"""A Mind-Bending and Breathtaking Journey""","""12 Monkeys,"" directed by Terry Gilliam, is a captivating blend of science fiction, psychological thriller, and mystery that questions the nature of time, sanity, and the human experience. Released in 1995, this cult classic stars Bruce Willis as James Cole, a convict sent back in time to gather information about a devastating virus that has wiped out most of humanity and forced the survivors to live underground.From the outset, the film immerses viewers in a dystopian future marked by chaos and despair. The narrative is intricately constructed, jumping between timelines and perspectives as Cole navigates both the bleak present and the disorienting past. Willis delivers a compelling performance as a troubled yet determined protagonist, grappling with the memories of his troubled upbringing and the uncertainties of time travel.The film's supporting cast, featuring standout performances from Madeleine Stowe as Dr. Kathryn Railly and Samuel L. Jackson as the enigmatic Jeffrey Goines, adds depth to the narrative. Each character's motivations and complexities unfold gradually, enriching the story and enhancing the viewer's emotional investment.Gilliam's unique directorial style is evident in the film's striking visuals and surreal imagery, alongside a haunting score that complements the atmospheric tension. The cinematography effectively captures the sense of dislocation and confusion that permeates Cole's journey, further enhancing the film's psychological depth.What truly makes ""12 Monkeys"" memorable is its thought-provoking themes. It raises profound questions about fate, free will, and the cyclical nature of time, compelling audiences to analyze each twist and turn in its narrative. The storyline keeps viewers on the edge of their seats as layers of the plot unfold, leading to a conclusion that challenges perceptions and invites reflection.In summary, ""12 Monkeys"" is a masterful exploration of time travel and its implications, blending elements of suspense with philosophical inquiries. Terry Gilliam's visionary direction, combined with strong performances and a gripping plot, cements this film as a timeless piece that resonates with audiences on multiple levels. Whether you're a fan of science fiction or simply in search of a thought-provoking cinematic experience, ""12 Monkeys"" is a must-watch that lingers long after the credits roll.8.5/10💥",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
TWELVE MONKEYS (DIDIER BECU),"The big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the forthcoming two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you can't follow. But good there is also a pause-button. Bruce Willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996. Thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in 1990, then in the First World War and how messed up it all might look like, Terry Gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever. This ex-Monty Phyton man knows exactly how genius SF-stories has to be told like and his choice of cast couldn't have been any better, there is the lunatic Brad Pitt (his performance in the asylum is memorable) and a superb Bruce Willis who proves he is more than some Schwarzenegger-wanna be. It's a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated (and yet you can follow) that every view gives you other surprises. One of my big favourites.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Give it a chance,"'Twelve Monkeys' is a film which has a certain audience. It's a shame Terry Gilliam's films don't have as big a fan-base as other types of film and director but his fans are loyal.The film starts off with Bruce Willis' flashback and him waking up in this strange prison-like place which automatically frightens you, the first half hour of the film is like this. One particular part is when Willis is walking through the abandoned shopping centre, it's a very atmospheric film.The plot is very interesting, it can become quite confusing at some points but, as with a lot of Gilliam's films, it all ties together at the end. The camera-work in this film works really well and provides a lot of the atmosphere and tension in the film's plot.The acting in this film is pretty good. The two main strengths in this film are of course Willis and Brad Pitt. Bruce Willis is an actors who has been type-cast unfortunately but this film broke the mould. He does not do any typical Willis-like actions and although he is the film's protagonist, he doesn't seem that way at all in this, he portrays a muddled, odd person who eventually tries to save the day. Brad Pitt is astonishing, it's the best I have ever seen him perform. It shows how great he really is as an actor and he's not just a pretty face.Overall, I would recommend this film if you have seen a Gilliam film before and enjoyed it. If you have never liked any of his films you will probably not like this one. If you've never seen any then at least give this film a chance, it deserves a lot more credit than it received.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Simply Great,Great story keeps you glued to your seat. Representation is extraordinary. There are so many layers in this film and they have been coordinated masterfully so that their is not a single boring moment in this film. Bruce and Brad are fantastic as always. Put all this together it's a feast for a film buff. I never imagined Brad Pitt could pull a role like this one. I know he is a great actor and all that but his portrayal of that insane Jeffrey is a real powerhouse performance. The costumes could have been a little better though. All the scientist from the future world looks a bit of old fashioned. But the overall performance makes for that. Bruce Willis has always impressed me with his acting and this one is no different. He should get 10 out of 10 for this performance.,9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Overrated,"I am convinced that most people here who rated this movie as ""masterpiece"" or excellent did it so because it was directed by a member of the Monty Python, which they, like me, love.

Could this really happen?,"Usually, we expect Bruce Willis to only act in the stupidest kinds of movies, but he does a different kind of role here in ""Twelve Monkeys"".

Cole is hired to go back in time to find the cause of the virus. But several unexpected things happen in the course of his adventure back in time. Things which may or may not bring him closer to the truth than he realizes.Terry Gilliam, always one for the bizarre, created something really interesting here. More than simply a ""disease story"", ""Twelve Monkeys"" looks at the virus from the future, giving one a tingly feeling. Good support from Madeleine Stowe as Kathryn Railly, trying to help Cole find out what caused the virus, and Brad Pitt as Jeffrey Goines, who may or may not be associated with the virus.

I'm honestly blown away by how ingenious the story is every time I see it. It's surely a science-fiction but it's almost like a thriller in the many twists and turns that the plot takes and every time I see it, I'm still amazed. The complexity and detail that Peoples and Gilliam put into this film is breathtaking. Truly one of the marvels of cinematic history.

So much Terry Gilliam originality and great Brad Pitt,"This movie opens with ""... 5 Billion People Will Die From A Deadly Virus in 1997 ... The Survivors Will Abandon The Surface of The Planet ... Once Again The Animals Will Rule The World ..."" - Excerpts from Interview with clinically diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, April 12, 1990 Baltimore County Hospital.In a dystopic near-future, criminal James Cole (Bruce Willis) is forced to volunteer to go up to the surface and collect samples. He is given the opportunity to reduce his 25 to life sentence by time-traveling to 1996 and gather information on the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. Back in 1990 Baltimore, county psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) is brought in to examine James Cole after a fight with 2 cops. He is locked up in the county sanatorium where he meets manic babbling Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt). He pleads to make a telephone call but the time hasn't come yet. He's suppose to be in 1996. Meanwhile he keeps having flashbacks of an incident as a kid. The future pulls him back but he's thrown back into the wrong time period again. When he finally arrives in the right time, he kidnaps Kathryn Railly.This is chalk full of Terry Gilliam goodness originality. I love the craziness. I love his style. This is the closest to portraying madness coherently on the big screen. Bruce Willis inhabits the regular guy under stress and then there is the wild madness coming from Brad Pitt. Madeleine Stowe is also terrific. I love the various settings. I love the crazy future. I love the decaying present. I love the asylum. I love it all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Swings for the seats,"Terry Gilliam has made a career of trying to make films markedly different from the mainstream. That's a riskier career path than following the trails everyone else is using. It's neither more nor less commendable, although there are those who worship distinction for it's own stake.A good movie is worth watching whether it's original or derivative and a bad movie is still a bad movie even if it's uniquely bad.Gilliams record, apart from his Monty Python related work, includes the enjoyable TIME BANDITS, and BRAZIL, a masterpiece, IMO. BARON MUNCHHAUSEN is, perhaps, better left in the bin along with the careers of the executives who green-lighted the project.TWELVE MONKEYS is, like BRAZIL, an essay in dystopia. Both movies revolve around malfunctioning societies. In the world of BRAZIL, we have a parallel universe which crosses 1930s-style fascism with an unmistakable Monty Pythonesque sensibility. In TWELVE MONKEYS, it's a future in which humanity is driven into a quasi-police state in a world dying from the results of bioterrorism.Also like BRAZIL, TWELVE MONKEYS focuses on the efforts of an inhabitant of the dystopia to escape. In BRAZIL, the escape is retreat into a fantasy world. In TWELVE MONKEYS, a literal escape into the past is paralleled by an attempt by the protagonist, played by Bruce Willis, to destroy the dystopian future by preventing the event which causes it's creation.In both films, the theme is that escape is impossible. But, TWELVE MONKEYS takes a very different tone from BRAZIL, where the fantasy interludes were at least partly light, if always ending in frustration. And, even though the world of BRAZIL was ugly, the film took such an offbeat look at it that there was humor relieving what ought, when all the decorations are stripped away, have been a depressing reaction. TWELVE MONKEYS is not funny. It's dystopia is offered up more or less straight, so the future world scenes set an ugly tone.The present world scenes do not copy the light tone of the fantasy scenes of BRAZIL, either. They are more ""realistic"" then their future world counterparts, but not really lighter in feel.As a result, whatever other merits TWELVE MONKEYS has, it tends to be a dark, dissonant piece.As others have written, it attempts, in part, at least, to be an art film. And, it takes a relatively difficult plot concept, which is bound to alienate and lose some of the people who watch it. Essentially, it's a - fairly trivial - argument about predestination, and the absence of free will. The end is inevitable, despite the protagonist's best efforts to change it.Alternatively, one might view the whole film as an exercise in solipsism, if the Bruce Willis character is seen as insane and hallucinating the entire plot.Either way, frankly, there a bit of the air of a freshman dormitory in a liberal arts college to the piece. An impassioned argument over a philosophical issue by people who feel more deeply than they think.However, the plot is well thought out and consistent.The outcome follows from the premises and the internal logic of the plot is, well, logical. The ending is not just grafted on. It's a - if not necessarily ""the"" - natural outcome of all which went before it. If one is attracted to the ""coming full circle"" aesthetic of story telling, there's not much to complain about.The acting is good, especially both Bruce Willis, as the put-upon everyman, and Brad Pitt, in one of the most odd, yet compelling, roles of his career.All in all, an interesting movie. Not one to come to looking for laughs. It requires some effort, and it's depressing. But, entertaining, to a degree.The Winona Ryder character, from BEETLEJUICE, would love it.bsl",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
12 Monkeys is the best modern sci-fi classic!,"12 Monkeys (1995) is the best modern sci-fi classic flick! This is the finest sci-fi movie of all time and I love this film to death! It is my favorite best Bruce Willis flick alongside with Die Hard, Sin City, The Fifth Elemen and The Jackal, 12 Monkeys Delivers! The movie it self is a modern sci- fi classic that does involve travel into the past, so it immediately presents a time-travel paradox which can't really be resolved. In order to even try watching this movie, you MUST LOOK PAST THE PARADOX. If you don't, this movie has zero credibility, and is not worth your time.This movie is about Bruce Willis who stars as a prison inmate from the future who is sent back in time to stop a deadly virus from decimating the world's population. Brad Pitt delivers an Academy Award-nominated performance as a lunatic in an asylum. Directed by Terry Gilliam. An unknown and lethal virus has wiped out five billion people in 1996. Only 1% of the population has survived by the year 2035, so now the Year is 2035. A prison inmate gets a chance to travel back in time to gathering information about an army 12 monkeys and stop them at all cost. But something goes terrible wrong and he is sent back in the year 1990, 6.years earlier and he is now shipped off in to mental institution asylum where there he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) a lunatic in an asylum. The movie has two parts in here. The first part is set in 1990 Asylum and the second part is set 1996 on the airport before the deadly virus is released out. The movie explains the army of 12 monkeys were not responsible for deadly virus but was someone else. I will not tell you who it was you will have to find out for your self who it was.I found this to be one of the more enjoyable movies I have seen in quite a bit. The acting is excellent and I must say that Brad Pitt plays his part brilliantly. The story is good and keep you guessing all the way through. All in all, this is a movie that takes you for an intriguing ride and leaves you with a bit to think about. This was Brad Pitt's second famous role after he finished Se7en another mystery thriller flick. The film has a mystery in it, it keeps guessing you what will happened next what will Cole (Bruce Willis) do to stop Jeffrey (Brad Pitt) and his army of 12 monkeys. This is a movie you have to watch repeatedly to get the full scale of what is going on and who's what when and where. That requires some level of patience and understanding so be prepared. Madeleine Stowe did a perfect outstanding job of acting in this movie.The main actors set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. This movie is what is a perfect 10 and it will always be a solid Sci-Fi flick even the series of 12 Monkeys was released out this year and the first season is already completed!"" I wish Sci-Fi movies like this one would be made today. Btw Director Terry Gilliam was brilliant and imaginative who directed the most perfectly movie field with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, CGI effects and the story with script that delivers. It is mind blowing, entertaining, and just plain crazy! Plus it has monkeys in it! It is really funny to see Pitt before his TROY/MR. SMITH days. If you really want a shocker look up Pitt in ""The Wrong Side of the Tracks"" with Rick Schroeder. Anyway, this movie rocks. Willis puts in a good performance, and all the characters give this movie a creepy feel. It is kind of like Mad Max, except a city landscape and weird scientists instead of Tina Turner.

"Good, but not ""Top 250"" good.","I mean really, is ""12 Monkeys"" one of the top 200 movies ever? I do agree that Terry Gilliam is one of the greatest directors, of the last 30 years, at giving the viewer wonderful things to look at on the screen. I think, however, that this film proves that he has some trouble connecting these fantastic images with a truly gripping narrative. ""12 Monkeys"" has some moments, mainly where the plot twists appear, that are riveting. These moments, combined with the magnificent scenes which take place in the future, almost make the police chase scenes and the seemingly endless scenes where Bruce Willis' character beats people up, fly out of all memory. But they don't. Throughout the film, just as Gilliam gives us something mindblowing, he stoops to the level of a dopey scene where a detective lectures ""Dr. Railly"" on the dangers of defending her kidnapper, or a scene where the pimp accuses the lady of ""working his turf"" and then gets beaten up. I do like this movie, I just feel that to be one of the top 250 films out of the thousands and thousands of films ever made, it better be close to perfect. ""12 Monkeys"" is a very entertaining film and the cinematography deserved at least an Oscar nomination, but it is not even Gilliam's best film, much less ""Top 250"" material.7 out 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Annoying Pitt!!,"Terry Gilliam traveled again to the future (he had already done it in ""Brazil"") to tell this story about a virus that's destroying the human race.The script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but it's quite entertaining and Gilliam proves that he's got imagination (the futuristic scenes are just great). As for the cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (whatever happened to her??) are just OK, but Brad Pitt is so annoying, whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he's not credible at all. He should just play good-looking successful young men.*My rate: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A thought-provoking and bizarre piece of sci-fi,"Terry Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys came at a time where science fiction was always among the year's top blockbusters. Back then, one would have to be extremely innovative within the genre to create something new, as many thought it had all been done before.Terry Gilliam brings a twisted sense of charisma and fun to a film that is also depressingly somber at times. This mix of bizarre visuals, strange character interactions and chillingly effective time-travel novelties makes Twelve Monkeys one of the most unique and memorable Sci- Fi movies of the 90's.Twelve Monkeys has a few incredibly talented front-runners including Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Bruce Willis at the time was one of Hollywood's most recognizable actors, mostly for his roles as John McClane in the vastly popular Die Hard franchise. Here though, we see Willis not as a gritty action hero, but a desperate an emotionally panicked prisoner. His character is tasked the mission to save most of humanity from a deadly virus, but little does he know, completing this task is literally impossible. In this universe, you cannot change the future and we are well aware of this as the audience, but watching Willis' persistence and desperation in his attempt to solve an impossible mystery is frustrating and heart wrenching to watch. He does an excellent job displaying his emotional confusion as even he begins to doubt his own sanity. We know that the story doesn't have a happy ending but Willis' performance makes us desperately want one.Despite Willis' excellent performance, Brad Pitt undoubtedly steals every scene he is in. While he sadly doesn't have too much screen time, every single scene with his character becomes some of the films best and most memorable moments. His portrayal as a patient from a mental institution is so perfectly goofy and hilariously exaggerated, yet he does give some interesting philosophies and insights throughout the movie as we find out how important his character really is to the story. He is easily one of the most memorable sci-fi characters ever.The story, while never simple, is written in such a way where it is understandable to the casual viewer but also a deeply layered and perplexing narrative for the more attentive viewers to try and uncover. There are many mind-bending little details as the story progresses but by the end Gilliam does a great job of making sure all these smaller details fit in with the rest of the film.I only had a few issues with the film and the main issue I had was with the pacing. There were some moments in Twelve Monkeys that felt like they were dragging a bit. The movie was entertaining for the most part, but there were times between the gripping narrative where the scenes felt extremely subdued and frankly quite boring. Some portions of the film felt somewhat uneven due to this rapid change of pace. I also think that the love story could have been a little more developed. I wanted the movie's couple to succeed in their mission and live happily ever after, but that was mainly due to their acting abilities as individuals. While the characters were great on their own, I never really felt too much emotional connection between the two characters that end up falling for each other. Their love story feels kind of rushed as it really comes out of nowhere. There was one particular scene that was excellently done and that was when Willis' character first realizes that the woman from his ""dreams"" is the woman he has been working with the whole time. The scene shared between the two characters here was incredibly impactful, but I never felt that same level of emotional connection to the couple after this short sequence.Twelve Monkeys is a strange yet thought-provoking work of science fiction from an undoubtedly talented director. A gripping and intriguingly original story is paired with a cast of excellently developed characters. The film overall is very easy to love as the bizarre imagery and the sometimes wacky/dark humor makes Twelve Monkeys a blast to watch. While the pacing could've been better and the love story could've felt more natural, Twelve Monkeys is certainly one of the best sci-fi films of the 90's and it still holds up considerably well by today's standards. Just be sure to go into it with an unbiased mind as things are never quite as they appear.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Great Sci-Fi Terry Gilliam Flick,"This is the only Terry Gilliam film I have seen so far (besides Monty Python), and I already have a feel for his style. My favourite scenes in the film were the ones with the scientists that were wacky, yet mysterious and seemingly all-knowing. Bruce Willis did a great job as Cole, making me question if Cole really was mentally insane. Brad Pitt's character Jeffery Goines, was my favourite character in the film. Brad Pitt even went to a mental institution to act like a mental person. And he did a great job doing it. Overall, I liked the film a lot, the ending put the film in full circle and the payoff was great. If you like sci-fi films that make you think, I would highly recommend this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good classic film,"Good classic film. I've re-watched this movie a few days ago on DVD and it's better than I remembered it. Brad Pitt still steals all the scenes he's in, playing Jeffrey Goines - almost a prelude to his Tyler Durden character in Fight Club - a rich kid with some anarchist/non-conformist ideas who's also crazy and, according to Cole, perhaps responsible for the virus. The scenes between Jeffrey and Cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie, Pitt's eyes, voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands. Pitt's Oscar nomination was well deserved! Surprising was also Bruce Willis' performance: his I didn't remember very well, but it's beautiful and full of sensibility; he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground, and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up. Cole is a rather ambiguous character, Peoples' tried to imbue some darkness in him, and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself: the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked. Ironically Cole didn't start as a crazy character, but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world, he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind, until he arrives at a point when he can't distinguish past from future, reality from fiction. Willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure, and it works perfectly. One of the fun twists in the narrative is when Cole's shrink, Dr. Kathryn Railly, finds undeniable proof he's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world. The screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys,"""I am mentally divergent, in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I will be well. Are you also divergent, friend?""That is the question that the audience has to ask itself during this sci-fi mentally ill time traveling futuristic movie. Is the lead character mentally ill or is he really on a mission traveling through time in order to find a cure to a deadly virus that has wiped off nearly all the population and forced the few survivors to live underground? Director Terry Gilliam has created a memorable sci-fi flick that like all time traveling films has a few in-congruencies but still manages to hold the audience's attention. Gilliam is better known for his work in Monty Python, but he's also directed different types of genre films like The Fisher King (dramedy), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (adventure), and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (Fantasy). He has a pretty respectable filmography as a director, although I still think he did his best work in the 90's. This film has a strong screenplay, but it will be remembered for the strong performances from Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. Twelve Monkeys is a dark futuristic film similar in some ways to Blade Runner although it kind of diverges all over the place with so many ideas. This is an inventive film but I don't know how many ideas were taken from Chris Marker's 1962 short film, La jetee, which inspired this movie. The screenplay was adapted by David Webb Peoples (Blade Runner, Unforgiven) and Janet Peoples. His influence from Blade Runner seems to be mixed in the screenplay here as well. This is a very fun sci-fi film although full of really weird moments.The film takes place sometime in the future after a deadly virus wiped out over 5 billion people and the few survivors were forced to live underground. James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a convict who is sent by a group of scientists to the past in order to gather information about the virus. The scientists want to study the virus so they can create a cure and live in the outside world once again. Cole is mistakenly sent to 1990 instead of 1996 which was the year in which the virus began spreading, and he ends up in a mental hospital after attacking several police officers. At the mental hospital he is treated by Dr. Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and he also meets another patient named Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) who happens to be the son of a famous scientist (Christopher Plummer). Cole at first begins to search desperately for the ""Army of the Twelve Monkeys"" because they are believed to be the group responsible for spreading the virus, but later he begins to question himself and believe that he might actually be insane himself. This is a puzzle that he will have to piece together with the help of Railly.This is the puzzle that Gilliam invites the audience to solve along the way and keeps us guessing as the plot unfolds before our eyes. I'm not a huge fan of futuristic films, but Gilliam's vision here is pretty hypnotic and poetic. Most of the film actually takes place in the past, but there are several elements introduced that keep us guessing what will happen next. There were a few stand out scenes like the one in which Cole and Railly are at a movie theater and begin commenting on how despite having seen the movie before the perception of it changes every time, similar to what is happening with Cole through his time traveling. Does his presence in the past change things in the future? Can he find the virus on time in order to save the people in the future? These are a few questions that the film raises. The more you think about things the more flaws you will find, but that doesn't take away anything from this sci-fi film. I really liked Brad Pitt's performance here for which he received an Academy nomination, although he lost to Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects). The film runs a bit long, but it never ceases to entertain.Rating: 7,1/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"What could have been a bizarre neo-""Brazil"" mess of a plot turns out to be a spellbinding and intelligent Sci-fi thriller, maybe Gilliam's masterpiece...","""Twelve Monkeys"" is a Terry Gilliam movie, so you know you'll feel lucky if you gather half of the plot at the end of the film.It is also a film whose story-line relies on time travels, swinging back and forth between the 90s urban hell and a dystopian future where humanity has been almost wiped from the surface of the Earth. The cinematography is so bleak and gritty that the future and the present (the past too) are like blue and red M&M's. But ever since ""Brazil"", we know Gilliam has an inclination toward urban nightmares and dehumanizing technology.""Twelve Monkeys"" also centers on a protagonist named James Cole, played by Bruce Willis, a man who is so tormented that he can't even tell if he's really living his own reality. And in this exhausting ride, he meets a young fanatic poor man's prophet, played by Brad Pitt, and in his disjointed mambo jumbo, tries to grab some bits of truths that can help him to find shadows of truth in this existential mess.So, basically, we have a movie made by the most anarchic and extravagant movie director (and he's quite polarizing on that level), playing on different time-lines and operating a real ping pong game of a narrative, and with psychological confusion to spice up an already complex plot. Yet, despite all these elements, this is perhaps the closest to a coherent and consistent plot I ever encountered in a Gilliam film. This is the film that could have been a bizarre nonsense, but it works, and the reason is quite simple: the film had a story, and much more, a compelling one.I'm not trying to make a lecture about screen writing, but for all its complexity, the film makes no secret about the set-up and the primal mission: humanity has been wiped out by a mysterious plague (five billions is quite a death toll) and people have been forced to live under the ground while animals have taken over the Earth. And as a way to emphasize the cataclysmic aspect of humanity's future, even time travels won't prevent the plague from happening, this is no ""Back to the Future"", the film is set in a frozen time-line and what Cole can only do is bring samples or information about the original form of the virus so the scientists who sent him can study it in his present.This is crucial because the film cleverly toys with its own premise: things are meant to happen and all humans can do is minimize the consequences. But there's a feeling of impending doom governing the script and while we try to believe in the 'happy ending', we know that whatever Cole will try to do, he'll only lead himself to what is meant to happen. The movie mentions the Cassandra's syndrome inherent to people who knows about the tragedy bound to happen but can't do anything to prevent it because no one would listen, this is Cole's tragedy, something in the same vein than Oedipus. There's a flashback memory scene repeating itself as some muddy leitmotif, it involves a young kid witnessing a murder in an airport, a blonde woman and man with a ponytail. Although we suspect what is going on, the climax doesn't lose any of its impact.We're prepared to the finale, there's even a scene where the film ""Vertigo"" is screened on the theater and Cole knows this is his story in a nutshell, some dreamy vision and obsession with a girl, and a story that will keep repeating itself. That's the core of ""Twelve Monkeys"", it's a nightmarish time loop where a man is entrapped and where, during this short entrapment, he'll escape from his condition with a scientist played by Madeleine Stowe. And you've got to love the irony: just when he feels he might be wrong about himself, she's the one believing him. This is the soul of the film, a relationship between a man who couldn't even believe himself, and a woman who could but not to the point that she was able to stop the inevitable.This is a formidable twist on the eternal obsession of Sci-fi geeks and their ""what if"" scenarios, you know: what if someone could go back in the past and kill Hitler or prevent September 11 from happening. ""Twelve Monkeys"", although relying on an improbable premise, perhaps features the most realistic take on time travels.This is a jigsaw puzzle as a plot with great acting, including Brad Pitt's Oscar-nominated performance that launched his career, proving that he wasn't just some Tom Cruise wannabe, and it all takes a second viewing to reassemble all the pieces and even get some hints of subtle brilliance. This is a real triumph from Gilliam who, for once, didn't indulge to some of his annoying trademarks and didn't punctuate the film with some crazy fights, and for a movie that deals with madness and a hero who suspects some things are made out of his mind, any spectacular intrusion of a dragon or a samurai wouldn't have surprised me.But the British director restrained himself; he knew he got one hell of a story at hands, so there was no need to wrap it up in another extravagant fantasy. This lucidity made the film, as it is basically ""Brazil"" with a plot. And whenever someone will tell me that I have no reason to be skeptical over ""Brazil""'s reputation, I'll lay the ""Twelve Monkeys"" card and say that this is at least a film that features the same dystopian future, the same 'world is hell' message, the same maddening confusion, but it makes sense and not just on a psychological level. I was surprised of how emotionally involving it was.I used to consider ""The Fisher King"" very highly but I might regard ""Twelve Monkeys"" as Terry Gilliam's masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Who do these brilliant folks pick for this all-important mission? This being a Hollywood movie, the choice falls upon an inarticulate sociopath who can barely string two sentences together. Great choice, guys...and the movie goes downhill from then on as Bruce Willis rambles on to anyone who'll listen about his mission, as if he expects to be believed and can't understand why these idiots don't believe that he's a time-traveler on a mission to save them. He also acts like he's heavily into barbiturates. In a supporting role as the hyped-up wacko who ends up helping to destroy the human race, Brad Pitt won a Golden Globe Award which, in this case, tells more about the Golden Globe Awards than it does about Brad Pitt, whose performance resembles a high school kid's idea of an insane person.

different but still intriguing,"twelve monkeys is very different and but still very intriguing. The director has carefully thought of the surroundings and delicately chosen the personality of the actors. The story is different yet it's with twists and turns to have your eyes glued to the screen and with flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past and more. The writer has performed a brilliant yet odd story in many different ways. twelve monkeys is very different to all the other big Hollywood film, it is a lot more clever and mystifies, it's something that must be watched with such delicacy and you must listen in to every word.An unknown lethal virus has wiped out 99% of the populations in 1996, the 1% of the population is hanging on just by a thread, they manage to live to the year 2035, but must live underground. Eventually a convict volunteers to go back to the year 1996 to study how the killer virus occurred and to see if it could be stopped, it was apparent that it began from a mysterious army of twelve monkeys. It seems that everything will go well when the convict is mistakenly sent back to the year 1990, because of the dilemma the convict not knowing that it's the year 1990 and not the year 1996 is arrested and put in to a mental institution. In the mental institution he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist and Jeffrey Goins, the insane son of a scientist and virus expert.The story is different yet it's with twists and turns to have your eyes glued to the screen and with flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past and more.Now thinking of the performances Brad Pitt is the takes the cake acting as a complete insane loony which were brilliant that should have earned him an Oscar. Bruce Willis also has an outstanding shy performance (completely to die hard, it shows as that he can act many different ways).twelve monkeys is a very well thought of film that is completely different to the average action/Sci-Fi routine.

Classic Terry Gilliam.,"Part 2 of Gilliams Trilogy of Americana follows Bruce Willis (in the greatest state of all, Pennsylvania) as he travels back and forth through time trying to find the cause of a virus that wiped out most of the human race. Before I begin, I have to say that I have a weakness for post-apocalyptic movies and time travel. Now to put them both in the same movie!? My head's gonna a'splode! This movie wasn't your typical go-back-in-time-and-save-the-girl type time travel movie. Bruce Willis' character, James Cole, isn't going back because he wants to but because he is forced to since he is a prisoner in post-apocalyptic Philadelphia. I, again, have to comment on Gilliam's directing style. He has a way of capturing craziness like no one else. Not only do we see his eccentric and outrageous characters blowing up and acting insane, but we also kind of feel it. Gilliam is a fan of epic close-ups and steady cam. Both give us a better feel of what's going on inside a character's head. I felt that a lot whenever Brad Pitt was having a schizophrenic moment in the movie. Side note, this movie promptly reminded me that Brad Pitt is an awesome actor. Brad Pitts frantic eyes and birdlike jerkiness made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Not uncomfortable like I don't want to be around retards but, more like I wanted to reach out to him and say ""Are you OK? Do you need some water?""

Deliciously intelligent and apocalyptic sci-fi thriller...,"I have a certain amount of respect for film-makers who venture to create a time-travel movie, simply because of the risk and complexity involved; it is no secret that many of these films are flops due in part to the uncertainties of the science, and the confusion they cause many viewers as the events unfold on-screen. As such, it is difficult to convey the paradox(es) established in these stories in a single Motion Picture as opposed to say, a novel. That being said, TWELVE MONKEYS works because it manages to overcome these flaws (for the most part) and provide viewers with a fresh, intelligent, and logical movie-going experience that is bound to stay with them for a while. My initial impression of TWELVE MONKEYS was that it appeared to be a combination of DONNIE DARKO and ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, with a hint of the deep-lying anti-societal messages (and the Brad Pitt) contained in FIGHT CLUB. I loved these movies, and needless to say, I loved TWELVE MONKEYS.The storyline is a very good one, spanning as many as four different time zones in order to tell the story. This is simply a wonderful science-fiction movie, with an underlying dark, brooding psychological thriller aspect, reminiscent of course, of DONNIE DARKO (though the latter was released six years after the former; it's just that I SAW DONNIE DARKO first).The direction by MONTY PYTHON's Terry Gilliam is superb, as are the cinematography and set design, with one of the opening shots of Philadelphia's City Hall overrun by animals setting the dark mood for the rest of the film. The acting by Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe is sufficient, but Brad Pitt was the stand-out for me, though his portrayal was admittedly over-the-top. It's just that every time the movie shifted from his character, there was an appreciable drop in energy. I guess even the Academy thought likewise, enough so that they saw it fit to nominate him for Best Supporting Actor.TWELVE MONKEYS is a unique, intelligent, logical, and edgy Motion Picture that will challenge viewers and keep them involved throughout. The main character in the movie doesn't set about to change time (as is the case in most of these sci-fi time-travel movies) thereby creating another paradox; instead he sets about to study the events of the past in an effort to better the future. The screenwriters, David and Janet Peoples, set the movie in such a way that the viewer gets to decide what happens/happened, and as such TWELVE MONKEYS has sparked numerous intellectual debates, and will continue to do so for some time.9/10. 3.5. stars (out of 4).

Inspired Insanity,"12 Monkeys is a rare treat that diverts from the traditional Hollywood fare one might expect from the film, being directed by Terry Gilliam (of Monty Python fame) and starring big-name Hollywood stars Willis and Pitt. However, rather than tell a 'time travel' story that deals with consequence and effect, 12 Monkeys instead tells an ambiguous tale of a central character walking a fine line between reality and insanity.  The viewer can easily make a conscious decision while watching the film to buy into the time-travel story and Cole's plight, or they can interpret the film as the delusional visions of a clinically insane man.  Gilliam's fantastic work offers evidence to support both interpretations, and the film can be enjoyed many times as the viewer picks up the many clues to determine their own interpretation of the events.The acting is fantastic; Willis plays Cole with both alarming savagery and arresting sincerity.  Stowe is as talented as she is hauntingly beautiful, and her role as the non-believer gradually accepting an unbelievable reality becomes increasingly compelling, as we see her own grip on reality crumble as Cole's does.  Pitt is outstanding; his delivery of complicated machine-gun dialogue is both funny and disturbing, and although his character takes a back seat for a large portion of the film, he nonetheless greatly enhances the film with his presence.12 Monkeys isn't a film that has broad appeal.  Its imagery is largely very gritty and dirty - a stark contrast to the early scenes that are exceptionally stale - its story ambiguous, and there are plenty of simply bizarre scenes and characters.  Still, it is a film that will reward the patient viewer with a clever and moving vision of a tortured soul and his heartbreaking struggle.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The movie was OK, but it fell into a weird little crevice where there's not enough action for it to be considered an action movie, and not enough drama/suspense for it to be considered a full drama either. The movie deals with time-travel AND teleportation, so you'll be left thinking ""WTF just happened?"" multiple times in the movie because of it.Brad Pitt's performance in the movie however, out-shines everyone else in the movie... it's so good, his performance is damn near blinding!",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Strong performance from Bruce Willis,Willis' performance elevates what would otherwise be a clever film marred a little by over length. The mechanics of the time travel segments look dated and amateurish even for the 1990's but Willis is convincing in the lead role and keeps you watching. There's also an entertaining performance from a young Brad Pitt to throw into the mix. I don't rate it as the classic that many others do but it's worth a viewing if you are a science fiction fan.,7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Plot Description Sounds Great, But The Movie is Godawful","One of my video books gave this 4 and a half stars out of 5, and another 3 bones out of 4. They must have watched a different version of this mess. The plot description sounded intriguing and made me want to see the film. So I wasted 2 hours and 10 minutes on this pretentious, overacted, convoluted film which ultimately went nowhere. It amazes me that so many people can watch something like this and think it is a masterpiece. I like some time travel movies, and absolutely loved ""The Butterfly Effect"" (director's cut). It seems all you have to do is have a big budget for effects and a couple of big stars like Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis, and if it's a complicated sci-fi story, fans of the genre will fall all over themselves to praise the result. This one was laughably bad, and the two leads had no chemistry whatsoever. I thought ""Inception"" was over-complicated and overrated, but compared to this it was superb. I wish I could go back in time and not have watched this, thus getting my 2+ hours back.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly deep and on point,"This is one of the best dystopian movies ever made. But it also has another perspective, which is exploring the nature of reality.

Multiple viewings required,"This film remains one of my all time favourite's, and every time I see it I find something new that adds to the meaning of the story.

It is a masterpiece that requires serious concentration and more than one viewing to make sense of it all. Brad Pitt's character is brilliantly acted and shows his ability as an actor in a role far from the Hollywood hunk style roles he is used to. The fact that time shifts without warning back and forward throughout the film makes events sometimes unexpected, but I prefer this type of film to the simple A to B type predictable films that Hollywood pumps out. I could watch Twelve Monkeys over and over without ever getting bored of it and highly recommend it to others.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Anybody who has read more than two science fiction books in his lifetime will see the ending coming in the first 10 minutes of the film. And the plot has the same obvious holes that so many time traveling movies have. That is to say, they have an unlimited amount of time to plan how to change past history, yet for some unexplicable reason they choose a particularly unfavorable scenario.I tried really hard to suspend disbelief and be entertained, but the gaping holes in this film exceeded the limits of my credibility.

It's one of the only movies I know which actually considers what's involved in time travel and time paradoxes; and a much-too-rare example of genuine science fiction in film, where the designation ""science fiction"" usually means monsters-from-space or shoot-em-up-with-special-effects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Weirded out freak fest,"On the upside, ""Twelve Monkeys"" pulls together a solid cast, a sort of Mad Max extrapolation milieu with lots of Rube Goldberg contraptions, a story which kinda/sorta makes sense, and weirdness heaped upon weirdness not to mention glowing reviews from critics and the public alike. On the downside, the flick tries too hard to be weird with tweaked color, tilts and angles, short lens closeups, fog, etc. and bunches of bizarre characters.

What was the point of that?,"I love weird sci-fi movies. I love plot lines that make no sense, and scenes that take insane amounts of imagination to even comprehend. Unfortunately, being someone born and raised on Twilight Zone episodes and old 50's and 60's sci-fi movies, I think I've seen every sci-fi plot that has ever been used. Maybe that's why I found 12 Monkeys just downright predictable in every way. And I'm sure if you're like me, and you've seen most of what the genre has to offer, this isn't going to thrill you or make you think any more than a children's cartoon with a space ship episode.Good:12 Monkeys had quality. It took it's time to make everything it did and said believable to watch. That is something that is missing in a lot of newer sci-fi movies, and it's refreshing to see it here.Some neat images. Nothing groundbreaking or genre-defining, but there is a lot of sci-fi imagery that is pretty cool to see on film.Bad:The acting isn't completely horrid, but it's so over-the-top and sometimes and sometimes downright cliché that I couldn't help but smirk at most of it. Bruce Wills acts like a complete retard in some scenes, and a macho action hero in others. Brad Pit is ridicules.Cheese. I'm sorry, but the camera angles are pure and utter cheese. I assume it's meant to be childish purposely, but with a movie like this, it just takes away the ability to even care about anything. Likewise, the music is horrible. I can understand the monkey theme song, fine. But was it really necessary to have cartoony classical music to boot it? Come on now. Also, there is an unnecessary amount of male rear nudity that, once again, takes away any seriousness. You put a guy's butt in a serious movie and it's always a way for the audience to ask: ""Wait, is this American Pie?""Typical:The story has been used so many times in so many different movies/books, what was the point? I guess this is the first time the screwed-up-time-travel plot hit the mainstream big-screen, but it has been used in so much more things before it, it's almost like a slap in the face when you get to the heavily clichéd and predictable ending. There are a few points of semi-originality scattered throughout, but what makes the difference? Go watch two random episodes of The Twilight Zone (from the 60's, might I add) and I can guarantee one will make you think: ""Hey, wasn't that also the plot from 12 Monkeys?"" I don't know how anyone can find this confusing; it's just run-of-the-mill. Average at best.The romance spin was so cliché I found myself wondering if it's even possible to have an American movie without a romantic subplot. Ben Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation says it best: ""What if in some parallel universe every movie had to have a subplot where people square danced? That would be absurd, right? It's no different than EVERY last American movie having a random romantic subplot. It's absurd and pointless.""The slow pace builds quality, as I said, but that's also a major problem: 12 Monkeys is slow. I fell asleep during the middle and had to finish it the next day. The majority of the movie is boring talking scene that say things you figured out from the first trailer.Overall: Really, was it necessary to make this movie? Sure, it had some quality and maybe it was a little out of the ordinary back in 1995, but those are the only two reasons 12 Monkeys didn't get a 1/10 from me.If you consider yourself a true sci-fi fan, there is no reason to watch this. If you're just an average joe, you'll be bored out of your mind. So, really, why all the positive reviews? I just don't get it.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Very Good Science Fiction!,"Twelve Monkeys is a very good science fiction film in part because it has a visionary director at the helm who doesn't believe in following the rules of cinema which of course is Terry Gilliam and also it has a very good portrayal of time travel which is kind of different they way it's used in this film. Despite some good, clever action scenes, this is not a straight-up action film. Instead, it's more of a thriller that likes to challenge viewers and that it does successfully. It helps that there are a few mind-blowing twists and turns thrown in.This film is about a jailed guy, James Cole who is sent back in time to prevent a virus that wipe out the majority of the human population by 1997. He meets a psychologist and together, they try to find the 12 Monkeys cult which is believed to be the ones that let the virus out.The acting is really good. Bruce Willis and especially Brad Pitt are on top of their games in the movie. Brad Pitt really gives it his all by playing a mental person with a weird imagination. Bruce Willis is really good as the guy who just wants to do his job and leave. Madeleine Stowe also does a good job even though I thought she was confusing at times.Overall, this is a very good film both as a narrative and a technical display. Both worlds, past and future, are depicted as grim and dirty. It must have influenced 2006's Children of Men, because that is what the bleak landscape reminded me of. This thriller reminds me of the old Hitchcock films and the early Shymalan films with the kind of plot twists the movie has. This is a really sci-fi film and it holds up well. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Brad Pitt's Performance Alone Makes This Worth Watching,"Though it's a mentally challenging movie, 12
Monkeys is still a lot of fun. It doesn't play out as a
simple time travel story, if there is such a thing. Its rules regarding time travel and its consequences are more vague and complicated than what we often get from such stories.It's a very entertaining movie, thanks in a big way to the stellar acting performances. I have to say the best
thing about this movie is Brad Pitt's performance. He's absolutely off the wall crazy and so much fun. He was nominated for an academy award for this
performance and he deserved to win it. But not to
be overlooked is Bruce Willis' performance. It's
one of the most diverse performances I've seen
from him. We see moments where his character
has it altogether, moments where he is a complete
mental wreck, and everything in between.12 Monkeys is not a comedy, but it has its
humorous moments that had me laughing out loud. It occasionally gets pretty strange, but always
remains interesting. The editing is a little weird at
times but in an intentional way. The ending is
frustrating. It leaves things open for interpretation
which can be frustrating as the conclusion to a
story that makes you work hard to stay with it. I
made peace with it by choosing what I believe to
be the most likely correct interpretation of the
ending. It's certainly different now watching
movies about viruses and pandemics after dealing
with the real life Covid-19 pandemic. It makes
movies such as 12 Monkeys feel more real and
even unsettling. Such movies as this should now
be seen as a cautionary tale for those tampering
around with viruses in laboratories.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of my favorite new discoveries.,"This is certainly my favorite of Bruce Wills' many great movies. It really shows his range, or moreso works around his lack of. The plot keeps you guessing and is loyal to it's Hitchcock inspired roots (I know it's partly based on an older French Movie too).I really started to care out 2 main characters and the love that develops between them happens so organically. The more I think about it, and everytime I've rewatched it, it renews my appreciation for this movie. It is hardly spoken about and to me feels vastly underappreciated for all of the thing's it gets right, cause let's be honest, it's pretty a pretty risky idea and it took nearly perfect execution for this work out so well and still feel truly great, even now 25 years later.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Great, but not for everybody","Twelve Monkeys is a time travel fan's dream come true.  It is highly complex, well acted and is incredibly logical.  Of course, it's also quite confusing and takes a while to get into. You'll probably get little of what's going on the first time, which is likely to turn a lot of people off. However, this is the sort of movie that you can watch five times and still wonder what will happen next, simply because in your quest to understand exactly what is going on you missed a scene.  This doesn't mean that it makes no sense, rather it just gives the audience a lot of subtle information that's hard to pick up.  It's also very spooky and effective, and will probably give you the creeps after each viewing.In short, if you're up for a heavy, convoluted but overall quite satisfying experience, give Twelve Monkeys a try.  Go into it with the proper attitude (and don't watch it with someone who's seen it - they'll just feel the need to explain it to you) and you should come out a devoted fan.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Bruce Willis in his normal way has delivered a performance, but i feel that his best was in the 6th sense. But the guy who steals the show is Brad Pitt. He has acted very well and deserves all the accolades.

Madeleine Stowe, Brad Pitt, Christopher Plummer and David Morse are on hand in key roles.""12 Monkeys"" (1996) has a huge reputation as a sci-fi thriller and is iconic of 90's cinema. The man coming back from the future plot immediately brings to mind the first two Terminator flicks (from 1984 and 1991), but ""12 Monkeys"" pales by comparison.Don't get me wrong, it's worth seeing and is entertaining enough with Madeleine Stowe shining, but the story is hampered by a muddled tone of schizophrenia and the unrelenting grunginess of the visual aesthetic (which makes perfect sense for 2035, but not for 1990 and 1996 where most of the events take place). In short, the movie's just not as compelling as it could be.People gush over Brad Pitt's role and he is entertaining, but it's a glaring rip-off of Dennis Hopper's photojournalist in ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), although I suppose you could see it as an homage. In any case, I could see through Pitt's acting here and there whereas Hopper was the real deal, perhaps because he & crew were literally stuck in the sweltering jungle waiting around for days doing drugs or whatever while Coppola & Brando worked out the kinks in the script for the last act.If I'm in the mood for this kind of fare, the first three Terminator flicks are a superior option and even the remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (2008). This one's decent, but overrated.The film runs 2 hours, 9 minutes, and was shot primarily in the Philadelphia & Baltimore areas.

There's no suspense . . . unless you create some for yourself by thinking the ending will be any different than it has to be.Am I spoiling anything with that last comment?  No!  Because the movie spoils it all very early on.  We are shown flashes of events that will happen in the future--we see these several times, lest we forget.  But we are constantly reminded that the past can't be changed.  SO WHAT'S THE POINT?  We know what will happen, and we know nothing can change it.  All we're left with is watching things fall into place.  That could be entertaining if it were a secondary part of the plot, but it's not.  It's the whole story.

"Interesting, confusing, compelling","12 Monkeys was quite a unique movie. Fugitive James Cole is sent back into 1996 to prevent a virus that wiped out 5 billion people. Things go awry, where he is first sent back to 1990 and thrown into a mental institution when trying to explain himself. In this institution he meets Jeffrey Goines, an insane patient whose dad is a scientist, and Kathryn Railly, a psychologist. Cole is then sent to 1996 where he finds Dr. Railly and kidnaps her, forcing to drive him to Philadelphia to find the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, who are said to have created the virus, lead by Jeffrey Goines.The story was well thought out and sure had effort put into it, especially the unique take on time travel, where no matter what everything is destined to happen, even things that, to James Cole, didn't seem to happen yet. I also enjoyed how the movie went pretty convoluted and confusing towards the end, with plot turns I didn't expect in the slightest. 12 Monkeys isn't quite a snappy movie; it has quite a bit of build up, yet when it reaches what it's getting to it's great. In a way the same could be said on Stanley Kubrick's movies...but this isn't a Stanley Kubrick movie, so there's no reason to bring that up.I recommend this movie.

"Review of Terry Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys by Koen Moes, Anh Nguyen Hai and Tim Andriessen","Twelve Monkeys is a science fiction thriller based one Chris Marker's 1962 short film La jetée, it is directed by Terry Gilliam, who is also known for Brazil (1985) and The Fisher King (1991). The film came out in 1995 and since then grossed over $ 168 million, it won the ASCAP award for Top Box Office Films in 1997. The film is set in the 1990's and in the year 2035, and was shot mostly in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Its cast consists of top class actors such as Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve Monkeys was nominated for two Oscars the year after it came out: Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Brad Pitt) and Best Costumes Design (Julie Weiss). Brad Pitt won a Golden Globe in 1996 for his performance.The film is about James Cole, a convicted criminal that lives in the year 2035. He is part of the 1% of the worldwide population that survived the spreading of a lethal virus in 1996, now living underground. Scientists think that the virus was released by a terrorist group called the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and with a newly invented of time machine they send James back in time to collect information about the virus. When James time travels for the first time he gets send to the wrong point in time, where he meets Dr Railly, who will later on aid him on his search. He also meets Jeffrey Goines, who he later finds out to be the leader of the Twelve Monkeys. Since the time travelling was so confusing for James he was declared insane by the people of the 90's, and he even gets put away in an insane asylum. Luckily for him he gets send back to the future and eventually even gets another attempt to change the course of history. But you will have to watch the film yourself if you want to find out whether he succeeds in his task or not.Twelve Monkey's grim post-apocalyptic setting makes up for a good science-fiction story and is quite original. David and Janet Peoples based this story on the famous French silent film 'La jetée'. Some people might consider the story to be weak because of its difficulty, but once the viewer truly enables him- or herself to understand all the plot twists and flashbacks they are given an excellent story. The writers did an outstanding job by introducing all sorts of interesting characters in the story such as Jeffrey Goines. His dialogue is perfect for an animal-activist and anti-consumerist who finds himself in a mental institution like the one he is in. Another aspect which is beautifully represented in Twelve Monkeys is the use of flashbacks which seem carefully planned to build tension and keep viewers interested, in this aspect it succeeds. Because of these perfect planned flashbacks you'll find yourself thinking about the amazing twists and revelations that are to come. If there was one criticism that could be made of the story, time-span is the one to be brought forward. Given that the film is set in 1996 and 1990 respectively and that the film was released during the last month of 1995 you have the feeling a lot of your anxiety is gone because the possibility of all the things happening in the plot happening in real life seem close to impossible. This however should not be seen as important because the story in its own right is excellent and drags you in. Given this Twelve Monkeys has probably one the best stories you'll see in a science-fiction film in a long time.Other things that played key roles in the making of this film were the sound and lighting in it. Each and every time the timing of the sounds or rather the music is nearly perfect, giving you this extra feeling of craziness, madness, sometimes making it even hilarious. This also drags you into the illusion-like world you are watching. You will start to get confused like the characters, even though the narrative mode is from an omniscient perspective. The lighting, like the use of music, adds up to the mood of the scenes throughout the movie. Also the fact that the film is old makes it more believable. If this film was made in the 21st century, with all the technology we have now, it would be very weird and difficult to attract the viewers into the illusion-like world of the film. However it is incredible that these techniques, the use of sound and lighting, were already so well applied to films in the last century.In conclusion we think that this film was put together quite well, they especially nailed the chaotic and insane theme. This is off course to be expected from a director such as Terry Gilliam, since you can easily call bizarre fantasy films his field of expertise. The chaotic styling, the acting and off course the music all play a huge role in what makes this film so out of the ordinary, they really contribute to the story, making everything much more of a realistic experience. Most time travel based films are not flawless however, but apart from a couple of minor points we think that the director and writer did a great job at it in this film. If you are into stories set in a post-apocalyptic world, or you really like films with a crazy and schizophrenic feel to it, we strongly advise you to go and watch this terrific classic of a film. And if you then are able look past the old representation of the future, we can assure you that you are in for 2 hours of pure pleasure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A fantastic and engaging Terry Gilliam film about an apocalyptic Earth,"In 1996 a virus kills five billion people James Cole (Bruce Willis at his best) a prison inmate from the future who is sent back in time to stop a deadly virus from decimating the world's population. ¨This already happened ¨ he explains to Dr Railly (fascinating and charming Madeleine Stowe) in 1990. He knows because he's been there . He meets at a psychiatric hospital, a nutty patient , Goines (Brad Pitt providing a really histrionic , gestual and almost farcical acting) whose environmental action group , the Army of 12 monkeys , may be behind the disaster. The future is history !. They're Coming !. It's about flights of fantasy. And the nightmare of reality. Terrorist bombings. True Love.Terry Gilliam's apocalyptic fantasy dealing with time travels and it is even weirder than it sounds . The film is a complex mess , but a terribly beautiful mess .This modern classic sci-fi classic was competently directed by Terry Gilliam who has made films as ¨Brazil¨, ¨The Fisher King¨holding similar fantastic atmospheres and it results to be a loose remake of Chris Marker's landmark 1962 short film ¨La Jetée¨. Absorbing and overlong tale , both fun and intriguing , and full of thrills , emotion , suspense and an astonishing conclusion in the last reel. An interesting and disjointed screenplay by Janet and David Peoples takes off from a short film , but soon spirals into more pressing milennial obsessions : insanity , mayhem, chaos and ecological catastrophe , before a vertiginous Hitchockian maker-over at the unexpected final . Terry Gilliam was really happy by the movie's script because it touched on some of the themes he'd covered in his former films .

Shows far more originality than 99% of films.,"Bruce Willis plays James Cole, a man from a future where the world has been devastated by a deadly virus, who is chosen to go back in time and try to find out how this came about.Directed by Terry Gilliam, Twelve Monkeys bears many similarities with his earlier film Brazil, but somehow feels more complete. Brazil was a weird, and at times brilliant futuristic parable, with crazy characters offset against grim cityscapes. However it failed to mesh into a coherent whole, and had a plot that amounted to little more than a dash from one mad sketch to another.Twelve Monkeys largely succeeds in improving on the things that didn't work in Brazil. Gilliam has reined in some of his more bizarre ideas, and paid more attention to keeping the plot moving, making this a far more balanced work. Even so, Gilliam remains true to his own uniquely quirky style, making Twelve Monkeys strikingly different from the average science fiction film.Bruce Willis plays a character far removed from his usual action movie stereotype. As a man set adrift in a strange world, he demonstrates that he can do more than just blow up buildings. Brad Pitt also gives a terrific performance as a mental patient, although it does become a tad irritating after a while.Being a time travel film, there are many plot holes in Twelve Monkeys, but this is unavoidable in any film on this theme, since whatever approach is taken to the possibilities of time travel you are bound to create inconsistencies. For example, this film's notion is that the time in which Cole lives is the present, and everything up until this point has already happened, so it is impossible to change the past. However, surely every action that Cole takes in the past must impact on events in some small way, through the very fact of his presence.Twelve Monkeys is an ambitious and impressive film. Of course many of its ideas are derivative, but it shows far more originality than 99% of films. It succeeds in being simultaneously entertaining and thought provoking, and deserves to be regarded as one of the best science fiction films of the 90's.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the only timetravel stories that works.,"The logic in timetravel movies is often contradictory but not here. Everything makes sense (or rather is internally consistent because timetravel ofc doesn't work).This movie together with Brazil is the best Terry Gilliam has ever made. The movie deals with trauma, suppressed memories, our perception of reality and the human psyche in general.It is no coincidence that the first place the time traveler visits in the past is an insane asylum. This sets the theme for the rest of the movie.Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt give an excellent performance.It is without hyperbole a near perfect movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An intelligent and captivating science fiction film,"After a virus wipes out no less than 5 billion members of the human race in 1996-1997 (just a year after the film was released, pessimistic much?), the remaining survivors are forced to take refuge underground, leaving animals to rule above ground level. The lead character James Cole, a convict, is sent back in time to 1996 to gather information on the virus for scientific study, but arrives six years early in 1990 and is put into a mental institution, at which point the plot becomes too complicated to easily sum up, which just makes it all the more surprising how effective this screenplay is.""Twelve Monkeys"" is a dream come true for science fiction fans. In a genre market over-saturated with space operas, borderline fantasy action films, and straight to DVD garbage, it is extremely rare that a compelling, challenging, and intelligent movie like ""Twelve Monkeys"" even gets made. What's even better than the fact that this got made is that it got top-notch treatment. The talent behind and in front of the camera is astonishing. Directed almost flawlessly by Terry Gilliam, the film is brilliantly-acted, shot, and scored. Standout performances include Bruce Willis in the lead and Brad Pitt in a manic performance that proves he is not just a mildly talented Hollywood star.The film's rather complicated time travel plot is admirably handled in the script by David Webb Peoples (who also has to his credit Ridley Scott's 1982 science fiction classic ""Blade Runner"" and Clint Eastwood's 1992 revisionist Western ""Unforgiven"") and Janet Peoples. Cinematography and score among other technical elements are of a high order and help bring the screenplay to life. Perhaps the best aspect of the film is the outstanding production design. It happens so often that good ideas get shoddy execution in genre films, but here you have one which is so well-designed that on occasion the visuals are so fascinating you'll miss a crucial bit of information because you weren't listening properly.""Twelve Monkeys"" is a dense and difficult film and is certainly not simplistic popcorn entertainment, but this is a film that rewards careful analysis and multiple viewings more than most others. This is an intelligent and captivating science fiction film which is extraordinarily acted and comes together beautifully.9/10",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
To change the future you must know the past,"In Twelve monkeys, a disease killed almost the whole world population in 1996. Everybody who survived lives under the ground to make sure they won't get the disease. However, they want to live above ground again, but obviously if they go there they will get infected by the virus. To avoid that from happening they have to make an anti-virus. They send prisoners into the past to trace the path of the virus and find out more about it, so they can make the anti-virus and live on the surface of the Earth again. James Cole is one of the prisoners and gets sent into the past, but he gets sent to the wrong year. He is declared crazy because he says he's from the future and gets locked into a house for crazy people. When the scientists from the 'future' find out that he was sent to the wrong year, they sent him to the right year. Still, no one believes him, until one person finally does believe him and tries to help him. Now, let's take a look at the narrative form of the film. The dramatic structure is a four-part structure; it has a rising action, climax, falling action and a resolution. That is also what makes this movie great to watch because there is a huge climbing action part where we actually get to know the characters and the story develops. Then almost at the end of the movie there is a very abrupt, but very exciting climax. It's a linear narrative form, so in this case the fabula and syuzhet are both the same as the plot. It might seem that it isn't chronological, because the time traveling and dreams make it look like there are flashbacks and flash forwards, but from James' perspective everything happens in chronological order. Also Terry Gilliam chose to use the first persons view, the whole story is told from Willis perspective. Using this technique also makes the watcher confused because you're not shore whether you can trust Willis or not (because you obviously don't know what the other actors are thinking).The confusion this causes also builds up tension and makes the movie exciting to watch. This means that perspective is really important in this film. You could also argue that it is a nonlinear narrative form, but if I'd explain why I'd spoil the movie. The film is also non- diegetic, because there is no story teller involved. One would say it has an open ending, which leaves room for imagination, but I am still not sure whether I should say that the movie twelve monkeys has an open or closed ending. This is because most questions I asked myself at the beginning of the movie where answered at the end. However, still some parts are missing and you will never be completely sure what happened after the ending of the movie. As the plot is so complicated and completely incomprehensible for the watcher at the start, there has to be a way in which all the pieces will fall together in the end. Terry Gilliam used some very clever techniques in his movie as well by starting the movie with Cole's dream. When being introduced to that very first scene, it doesn't make any sense. But as the dream keeps reappearing throughout the movie, each time we see it, we understand a bit more of it. This goes on until the end, where, when we see the full dream for the last time, it all makes sense. This way of unfolding and explaining the plot is very interesting. The overall light and color used in the movie is a bit ""depressing""; the saturation is quite low which creates this mood. Most of the movie uses front light, just like normal daylight caused by the sun. Not many complicated light and color techniques are used, to avoid the watcher from getting distracted from the plot, which is very complicated and needs the entire watcher's attention to be understood. This is a very intelligently done. What Gilliam also does is moving the camera around very fast. The key to making the movie interesting is by making the watcher confused and therefore making him want to understand the movie and see how it ends. Terry Gilliam definitely succeeded in making it interesting with this sixth technique. Overall, my opinion about the movie had several points of view. Even though for me the movie wasn't what I usually like to watch, I could come to the following conclusion: The movie has an incredibly original plot, and the way it is presented to the watcher is very interesting in a complicated way. It is a movie anyone could watch, and I would recommend it to a broad audience; a lot of action and quite some violence is involved, some science-fiction (because of the time traveling), mystery, all blended into one movie, so anyone who likes those kind of movies can watch it. One thing is missing; romanticism. There is barely any romance in the movie, and this is what may already make the movie less interesting for part of the female audience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One Of The Best Time Travel Movies To Grace The Screen,"James Cole is sent back in time to stop a virus that destroys humanity. He must look for clues to lead him to the group known as the 12 monkeys, but is sent too far back in time and ends up as an insane patient in a hospital. Know he must escape the hospital and continue his mission.With a brilliant script, a unique vision and a superb cast, 12 monkeys makes it mark in cinema history as one of the best time travel movies to grace the screen. 12 Monkeys is a film that will take multiple viewings to comprehend, and even then there is still new aspects of the film that appear to you with every viewing. Everything in this film clicks together so well, making it one of the best films of the 90's.Terry Gilliam is a director that looks at the world at an angle, he brings this angle to his films. One only has to view his previous films, such as Brazil to see how far off the edge this guy is. With 12 Monkeys he brings us a film that is off the chart is bizarre weirdness, but is able to make the film make sense in the end. Which is hard for any time travel flick. Unlike other films that deal with time travel, 12 monkeys makes the entire act of time travel seem believable. Gilliam has an impressive track record and 12 monkeys is near the top of it.Brad Pitt stands out in this film as the totally insane patient that befriends Willis. What did Gilliam do to make Pitt so nuts in this film? Simply take away his cigarettes. Maybe Pitt should stop smoking all together and his other films will be as good as this one. Pitt gives this dark and morose film a funny bone. Willis, who normally is mediocre in his films shines here. Along with Stowe, this cast brings a whole new level to the film.The film itself is off the wall and ahead of it's time. It's dark and brilliant. The only fault would be that in some scenes it drags a bit. 12 Monkeys is a film that will still be talked about in years to come. It is definitely one of the best films for everyone involved. It's madness starts from the first shot right up until the last second, it never lets it's out of place style end. Which is what makes this film so good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Random thoughts on Twelve Monkeys,"First, I remember seeing La Jetee (can't do the accent, sorry) in a film class in 1973.  If you have not seen it, try somehow. It is a compelling, mysterious, wonderful 29 minutes of film, very French.Second, as a psychiatric social worker, I was struck by what I thought was the most authentic piece of dialogue in the whole film.  Madeline Stowe's character (a psychologist, if I remember correctly) wakes up next to Bruce Willis' character.  He slobberingly turns to her and says, ""I saw you in my dream."" (Or words to that effect).  Rather than attempting to run screaming from the room (the normal human reaction), Stowe turns to him and says, in a wonderful, even voice, ""Tell me about your dream.""I almost fell out of my seat laughing.  It was so perfect.Third, I used to live in Baltimore, Maryland.  One Sunday morning, I saw Madeline Stowe jogging by.  (She was on location in Baltimore.  I didn't know it.)  A lovely woman.  A lovely moment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Science Fiction Masterclass,"A masterwork of science fiction, 12 Monkeys deserves all of the credit it's achieved over the years. With top-notch performances all around, a smart and twisty script, and atmospheric, almost cartoonish-ly effective directing from Terry Gilliam, this movie is quite an experience.Bruce Willis and Madeline Stowe are in fine form here, with Willis as charismatic as ever. He has the same determination as his other protagonists, but gone are the witty one-liners and caustic asides. Brad Pitt is throughly psychotic and gives a very OTT performance, which actually really works.Like most high concept sci-fi movies, 12 Monkeys establishes a dark and depressing tone with a bleak future, while attempting to deal with some bigger issues. I think the film's ultimate message is to enjoy life and not get so caught up in one goal that you don't stop to enjoy anything. This is most clear when Willis' character is in the car and he leans out the window and smiles with the wind on his face while listening to music. This is a pivotal scene, and arguably the most important moment in the movie.The approach to time travel that the film takes is also more interesting, which is that the future can not be changed. The mechanics of this are interesting, as is how the characters try to deal with it. It gets pretty complicated and mind bending after a while.This movie has crazy cinematography, several cool fight scenes, Brad Pitt being crazy, and Bruce Willis eating a spider. It's completely crazy.Definitely check this masterpiece out. Culture yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
12 Monkeys: 7.25/10,"""12 Monkeys"" is probably Terry Gilliam's most well-known movie, and is a prime example of the problem I have with his movies.While I do think he can make good movies, and I do think this movie is good, Gilliam is clearly more preoccupied with the visuals and quirkiness of his movies more than anything else. I do think the visuals are good, but I just wish the other parts of the movie were given more focus.I thought the acting was okay. I liked Willis a lot more in ""Die Hard"", but I still think he did a good job, and so did Brad Pitt. Its soundtrack wasn't as good though, and was a bit irritating at times.Whatever, I liked it. It's not Gilliam's best, but I still liked it. 7.25/10.Lastly, If you disagree with the opinions stated here, that is completely fine, and you are entitled to your own.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Is this film a prophecy for where the COVID-19 virus is heading?,"Does the story of Twelve Monkeys have some similarities in what is currently happening with the COVID-19 virus? The reason that people are up in arms with the implications of the pandemic is because the strain is strong and we don't want to wipe out our civilization with sickness and death. This is precisely the grim reality that this film depicts: A New York City where there are no humans roaming the metropolitan landscape. Only animals that escaped from the zoo can be seen.My relationship with this movie has been misunderstood. I played Brad Pitt's character in a re-enactment at the Beverly Hills Playhouse in the intermediate class at the Los Feliz location. I felt that I could relate to the character due to my own personal bout with mental illness. Of course, my acting teacher wasn't on the same vibe and I got a terrible review with my acting portrayal.I feel that this was Brad Pitt's best work because being able to play a character who is suffering from schizophrenia and is loaded up on a cocktail of medication in a psychiatric ward is very challenging and required an awful lot of research. I watched some supplemental behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the film and Brad Pitt really did his homework in order to bring the character to life.As for Bruce Willis, he is the star and main character of the film and deserves some plaudits too. I find the subject of time travel to be a fascinating one as well. Wouldn't that be something if we could go back to just a few months ago and stop the Chinese from eating those strange under-cooked animals? Is that story-line even the truth behind how the virus originated.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Astounding. 11 out of 10.,I've always loved this film. There's just so much to it. There's so many strands to work out. I suspect those who give such negative reviews just can't work it out.

Another masterpiece from Terry Gilliam,"After seeing this film I could not stop thinking about time travel and the questions it raises. Is the person sitting next to me from the future? Is there in fact someone out there in a mental institution who is from the future and we just see them as crazy? The plot in this movie is a very good plot about a virus that has wiped out 5 billion people and the people in the future wanting to study it and return to the surface of the earth. (Check out the film I don't want to give away too much) The real intrigue of this movie, however, is the time travel aspect and the paradoxes that it raises as we see in the incredible climax of the film.Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis do a great job in their roles.This movie is amazing. 10 out 10.

My second favourite Gilliam film of all time,"This is the film that proves Gilliam's genius. Faced with budget, time and ratings restrictions, Gilliam produces a masterful version of ""La Jetee"", coaxing excellent performances out of the entire cast. This is one of Willis' finest performances, and Brad Pitt's Oscar-nominated turn convinced me that he's not just another pretty face. The use of existing elements to create a vision of the future is amazing, and results in that rare breed of science fiction that doesn't rely on special effects to tell the story.I won't say anymore, because this is the type of movie that it's best to go into blind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A tilt-a-whirl of a movie,"The question is not, ""What are the 12 Monkees?"" The question is, ""How long of a mind trip can you stand?"" because that's the central experience of the film. It has a great look, a fascinating premise, good performances, a great mystery, but if you don't like having your imagination slapped around for two plus hours, you won't like it. Bruce Willis plays a convict from the future who is sent back in time to get information on a virus which will virtually wipe out the human race. Unfortunately, time travel leaves him so disoriented that he ends up in an insane asylum, the one place in the world where people are trained to not believe crazy stories and to lock up those who tell them. I can't even begin to describe his travails except to say that he experiences a tilt-a-whirl of confusing images, parallel experiences and mixed messages. (It's not David Lynch confusing, but it's close.) There is an eventual payoff, which you will either love or loathe depending on what you expect from movies. The film is a little long, as almost all of Gilliam's films are, but it's a riveting story. You will either step off the carnival ride saying, ""That was fun"" or ""I never want to do that again.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Dystopian visions,"Directed by the master of dystopian visions, Terry Gilliam, Twelve Monkey bombards the audience with a complex, yet digestible, film - which unlike it's fellows in the genre, is also heatwarming. Bradd Pitt and Bruce Willis enter career altering roles, which demonstrate their immense talent and no doubt paved their way for future roles.The direction and photography of everything from the set pieces to the 1996 Philidelphia are breathtaking, to the point where the viewer is fully emerged in the film, becoming part of the concept - yet still being aware enough to fit the jigsaw plot together.This film is a true classic and my favourite Gilliam film (although Brazil is very close), I think it will go down in history as one of the best sleeper hits of the 1990s. It has certainly paved the way for future films of a similar films (just look at the clear resemblances to Gilliam ideas in films such as Children Of Men).Also if you pick up the DVD, the additional documentary film 'The Hamster Factor' is a very insightful view not only into Gilliam's film but the entire Hollywood studio process.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
palpable tale of apocalyptic dread...,"""12 Monkeys"" is a relentless zigzag of a film with a twisted plot of unexpected turns...it launches us into the future (in this case, 1996) and the past (in this case, 1990, or sometimes even earlier) with such jerky frequency that 'the present' is difficult to discern. Of course, this type of disorientation is typical of director Terry Gilliam, whose films are often marked by an unbridled visionary wackiness that threatens sensory overload (just check out his adaptation of ""Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas""). With ""12 Monkeys,"" though, a more somber tone pervades as confused, possibly schizophrenic time traveler James Cole (a properly detached Bruce Willis) enlists the help of psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) to stop an organization--known only as ""The Army of the Twelve Monkeys""--bent on carrying out an apocalyptic plan. Or is all as it seems? Perhaps it would be too generous to put ""12 Monkeys"" on the same pedestal as a vague, thought-provoking work like ""Eraserhead,"" but I cannot deny the David Lynch-quality this film possesses. With a nonlinear structure and a story where every detail seems to contribute to a larger whole, the movie easily invites multiple viewings and interpretations. Gilliam's trademark usage of odd camera angles and his fixation on eccentric characters is ever-present, but the maturity of the telling is a marked departure from the norm--this is a downbeat, fearful vision of the end of the world (Brad Pitt's manic spoiled rich-kid is less a source of comic relief and more a chilling reminder of the escalating insanity of the tale) that offers no easy answers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Multiply layered masterpiece,"Who doesn't like atmospheric movies? Those that can drag you into their world and make you feel like a part of it? Atmosphere is that aspect of a movie which can make up for other ill made aspects. It's like a glue which makes entire movie experience coherent and credible.Twelve Monkeys is one of those movies. From beginning to the end it drags you every moment more and more into it's milieu. Sometimes it's a futuristic milieu and sometimes, rather most of the times, pretty ordinary 90's ambient. And still everything ordinary somehow tastes extraordinary. That's because we're following a story from Cole's (Willis) point of view. Going back to the past felt for him like being born in entirely different world. Clouds and air. People and the way they dressed and looked. Everything was different. And yet everything kinda looked so familiar. Like he had seen it before. This emotional element of somehow rediscovering this world as natural in contrast to unnatural and quaint underworld plays a pivotal role in engaging the viewer into Twelve Monkeys ambient.What else makes a good sci-fi movie? I believe one of the most important aspects is seriousness. Not that seriousness without any kind of humor, but rather that one which takes future events and the way they correlate to us today seriously. Twelve Monkeys does it both ways. Past and future are being delivered to the viewer in a somewhat cataclysmic manner. You know how everything is going to eventually end, but still believe inevitable might somehow be side moved. I won't go into much detail of how good Willis, Pitt and Stowe are. But I'll tell you that both Pitt and Willis nailed very demanding roles. As one reviewer said it, Cole experiences serious time travel side-effects which makes the entire movie look more credible. Too bad Pitt hadn't won an Oscar for this role but got it for 12 Years a Slave where he just didn't have enough opportunities to show everything he's got. Madeleine Stowe play more important role than it might seem in the beginning.I'd even say that she plays an almost central role. Not only is this movie amazing as a sci-fi movie, but it also has a very powerful romantic side as well. I'd even go so far as to say that sci-fi elements serve as means to reinforce romantic and personal struggles one faces in a world in which only some people decide ""whether something is right or wrong"".I'll finish with a short note. This is one of those movies which, if seen correctly, can make you appreciate life more. It can provide you with material for reflection in forthcoming months. Be sure to get most out of it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

This movie puts you right in there, making you question your own sanity at times, while the movie jumps between times and flashbacks. Even the music score is perfectly fitting, strangely light-hearted, and ominous, blending a truly unique soundtrack.

Complex and engaging thriller,"I can't decide whether this is one of my favourite movies. It is a good thriller and has an emotional core but still I can't decide. I definitely liked it. This is the first movie of Terry Gilliam that I have seen. My first impression? I was engaged till the very end and it is not all that complex(to be confusing).The movie is set in the future. A man James Cole(Bruce Willis) is sent from the future in order to get some information from the past(1996 to be specific). A virus killed 5 billion people. He is sent from the future to get some information about it. Also involved here are a psychiatrist called Kathryn Railly. The love story is portrayed beautifully and you can really feel the longing in this love and longing for a regular life. The loose ends are tied up in a very interesting manner at the end.One thing I liked about this movie is that unlike other post-apocalyptic movies, the movie didn't prefer to give any boring social commentary and instead focused on this one guy and his longing for a regular life. ""You want to see the ocean, be with her"" is especially a poignant line in this movie. It chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the person's mind. Therefore this is not exactly post apocalyptic movie but instead it could be described as a romantic sci fi movie with themes that range from time travel to blurred realities and so on. This is what makes this movie a special movie of the 1990's. The complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters.The performances are quite good. Bruce willis surprised me here as he didn't act the regular tough guy here but he gave a good performance of a confused man who is in love. His desperation in certain sequences is portrayed beautifully. I have to check out his other movies. The gorgeous Madeleine Stowe is quite a treat to watch. EVer since I saw this movie, I have become so obsessed with her. She has given a great performance of a woman who sympathises with her patient and finally falls in love with him. Brad Pitt is the real surprise though with his portrayal of a crazy man named Jeffrey Goines. His Oscar nominated performance is quite surprising considering that he doesn't have many critics who have kind words for him.The end is quite chilling and that is also another reason to watch the movie. The length or complexity is not as big a problem because this film is quite fast moving and there are enough incidents to keep people interested. And every incident in this movie has a meaning and nothing is there that is unnecessary.Good thriller 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not Your Average Sci-fi Time Travel Film,"Terry Gilliam's approach to his sci-fi is hard to understand for some, but is brilliant. 12 Monkeys is bizarre right from the get go, but no doubt alluring, Bruce Willis gives a heart wrenching performance as he struggles with is emotions when he travels to a pre-apocalyptic era, crying over the simple fact he can breathe air above ground. Brad Pitt also gives an offbeat and effective performance as well. Most people will expect another Bruce Willis action vehicle, but maybe 12 Monkeys knows that, instead an unsatisfactory but magnetic experience that's worth more than a second watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Better the 2nd time around,"I first saw this movie when it came out in theaters and thought it was OK but nothing special. I saw it on opening night and I guess the movie was different than I expected.My 2nd viewing was in December of 2006 and I really enjoyed the movie. I guess the fact that I knew what to expect but forgot many of the details made it a much more enjoyable experience.I am not a big fan of Brazil and I thought the Brothers Grimm was horrid but I will say that Gilliam deserves credit for this movie.I am sure that this movie has more than quite a few reviews. I am aiming my review towards those who saw it once and thought it was so-so as a recommendation for a 2nd viewing.Also, If you liked this movie, I highly recommend Donnie Darko.

Classic sci thriller,"A mixture of time travel, deadly virus, crazy people, animals and authority! 12 Monkeys is a great sci fi thriller.It's a bleak world of 2035 that has been decimated by a deadly virus. Humans struggle to live and survive under the ground, and animals live on the surface and roam freely. To try and set things right, a group of scientist persuade James Cole (Bruce Willis) with a reward if he travels back in time to the 1996 to gather information about the deadly virus, and then be transported back to the 2035. The scientist want to learn the origins of the virus and how to control it. With very little to lose James Cole begrudging agrees to travel back to the 1996. The problem is time travel doesn't always work well and can create more problems than it solves. James Cole has flash backs and isn't in the best state of mental health, which makes gathering information even more difficult. When James Cole travels back in time he ends up in a mental institution. There James Cole comes in contact with Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe). They form a rocky relationship but develop a bond. Also while in the institution James Cole meets the crazy Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who unknowingly is central to much of the information James Cole needs to get. There are plenty of twists and turns in the story, which makes this movie good with its interesting story.Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe absolutely shine with their performances. The on screen chemistry between Willis and Stowe is perfect and alluring.

A haunting and beautiful masterpiece,"First off let me say that I feel strongly this movie belongs in the top #250 list. It is imaginative, original, and creative and sucks you in. I just got back from watching it and boy was it good. I won't go into the details of the plot since its pretty hard to explain without ruining anything. Performance wise this movie is great, you have some good material from Stowe and Willis but most importantly Pitt (got Golden Globe for best supporting actor and was nominated for an Academy Award) who adds in a looney performance similar to his role in Fight Club. The script was good, there was life in each character. This movie isn't only an imaginative physcological trip but an emotional one at well, the ending being sad. I still feel Blade Runner (directors cut) is the best science fiction film ever made and the novel (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) is probably also the best science fiction novel. But this movie is high up there due to the stellar cast performances, highly detailed (occasionally confusing) script, and its amazing plot.

Good plot destroyed by mediocre actors,"If you like Terry Gilliam films, you'll like this one too. Although I enjoyed most of it I must admit I find it hard to believe, that it has it's place on the top 250 of all time. Actually I found big parts of the movie destroyed by really bad acting from Bruce Willis and ESPECIALLY Madeleine Stowe who always seem to play these kind of confused, hysteric characters you end up hating after 5 minutes. Brad Pitt is terrific though, maybe the best role of his career, and he prevents it all from going down the drains. The story is really good and there's a lot of very interesting scenes portraying the mind of James Cole on the edge of madness. All in all a good flick, but it has it's flaws, most notably the acting. 6/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Moronic drivel,"What a waste of two hours of my life! Utter drivel.

That this film was once rated three stars in Halliwell's was clearly an error - and one they corrected by removing all stars in the 2008 edition. I should have taken note.It is, of course, a pity that IMDb requires me to waste yet more of my time by not accepting a short review. I must write ten lines to say how very bad this movie is but don't they think that my watching the film for two full hours was quite enough punishment?

"Gilliam's ""Twelve""","It's been a while since I've seen ""Twelve Monkeys,"" but I still remember that it is most definitely one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen, perhaps one of the best of the 1990s. ""Twelve Monkeys"" is a fascinating piece of science fiction, with ""elements"" thrown into the mix that can only be the work of director Terry Gilliam. The script by David Webb Peoples and Janet Peoples, inspired by the original French film ""La Jette"" by Chris Marker, tells the tale of a future planet Earth in the year 2035, after a deadly virus has decimated mankind and humans are forced to live underground. Of course, there are criminal elements, and one of these outcasts, James Cole (Bruce Willis), is offered a chance at a clean slate if he volunteers for a mission that is literally out-of-this-world: travel back in time to the year 1996 to gather up information on the virus so scientists in the future can develop a cure. But a mishap occurs and he's sent too far back to the year 1990. Once there, he is hospitalized as insane and meets a wacky fellow inmate named Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) and is cared for by a disbelieving doctor (Madeleine Stowe), who eventually grows to realize Cole's telling the truth. Cole is bounced back and forth between the future and the past so much that he eventually grows disillusioned by his own perception of reality, unsure what time he's in or where. Like Cole's ordeal, the film ""Twelve Monkeys"" packs a mental punch; we too become unsure of our surroundings and great effort was made by the filmmakers to create such confusion. The performances are pretty astounding, especially from Willis (whose ""acting"" ranks as some of his finest) and Pitt, who's an absolute blast and provides some gallows humor, but to be perfectly clear he's totally loony, and may or may not be linked to the group of young, radical animal-rights activists responsible for the unleashing of the virus. Gilliam's imagination again runs rampant in another ""future"" tale, like his earlier ""Brazil"" (1985). ""Twelve Monkeys,"" to be sure, is one wild trip that is definitely worth taking.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A masterpiece and very good film if you have any sense of adventure.,"This film is great in nearly everyway. It has one of the greatest and most thorough plots (which is very hard for me to describe, so I recommend you go to the plot summary section if you want to hear it).The acting is great. Brad Pitt plays a nutjob, and he excels at it. I didn't think he could do it, but he looks like he really is spazzing out and belongs in an insane asylum when you see his evil smile. Bruce Willis also perfectly fits the role of the mostly-mellow Cole, who just seems to explode every now and then.Directive work, as usual with Terry Gilliam's work, is great. It's like the script was designed for Gilliam, and it shows.If there was ever a sci-fi movie that I would consider to be one of the greatest and under-rated movies of all time, this would be it. Twelve Monkeys gets you thinking about the future, about the past; it gets your adrenaline going. It's a near-perfect film if you have any sense of adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Unique But An Acquired Taste,"Unique (as are all Gilliam's Films) and deeply confusing (same) story of apocalyptic times and time travel. A lot of the joy (in a virtually joyless Movie) are the visually stunning sets and props. It is a stylish, but depressing look at unbridled science leading inevitably to a Dystopian future.There are strong statements unleashed with weak exposition and it leaves the viewer searching needlessly around for clues and insights and it all becomes rather a chore. But it has enough spectacular imagery and strong characters to keep one interested, if weary.Brad Pitt (channeling Dennis Hopper in Apocalypse Now) gives an overrated, but okay, performance and Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe are engaging. But it is a Terry Gilliam Film all the way and enjoyment of his despairing outlook is an acquired taste.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"There's no right, there's no wrong, there's only popular opinion","I wanted to see this since it was in the theaters 20 years ago, but somehow it never came to the table. I missed it in theaters, then I did not have VCR, then VHS became obsolete but I did not have internet till 2010... and so on till today. I was really dead set: a darkened room, good sound, snacks, all in order and... complete disappointment. Don't get me wrong, this movie is far from bad: excellent cast, interesting premise, and the baton in the hands of Terry Gilliam... But precisely because of the great names, the incredible hype in the nineties, and probably because of 20 years of waiting to finally see it, my expectations were very high and the film did not nearly satisfy them.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An excellent sci-fi film that deserves our attention.,"I didn't really know what to expect when this movie was on TV very recently, but I was really glued to the set until the end thanks to a truly absorbing story and a collection of great actors who do a great job. I don't know director Terry Gilliam very well, I've only seen one or two of his films so far (not counting this film), but I'm beginning to understand his aesthetic a bit. However, I recognize that surrealism, of which the director is adept, and the bizarre script can really make it difficult to understand the work.The film begins by immersing us in a profoundly dystopian world, where humanity was almost extinct by a pandemic. As the disease comes from an airborne virus that was deliberately released, the survivors moved into underground shelters. Technology, however, has evolved and allows the sending of chrononauts (that is, time travelers) to the past, in order to obtain pure samples of the virus, which can be used in the manufacture of a vaccine or medicine.This is how James Cole, a criminal, is chosen for time travel in exchange for his crimes being forgiven. His mission is not to alter the past by preventing the release of the virus, even if he seems to want to. The mission is to locate those responsible and pass on all the information to the future, in order to send another agent who will collect the samples. But he only knows that a radicalized environmentalist group, the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, was responsible. Sent by accident to 1990 (instead of 1996), he ends up in an insane asylum where he will befriend the manic Jeffrey Goines and endear Dr. Railly.The film deals with very complex themes, such as time travel, temporal paradoxes, the impossibility of changing the past, and even madness, the tenuous difference between reality and imagination, or between sanity and insanity. It has several advances and retreats in time and you have to be attentive, but what intrigues viewers the most is its ending, strangely sudden and confusing. I understood it quite well, and I think you just need to pay attention to the film to understand everything, but I'll leave a clue to help: the eyes of the protagonist and the eyes of the child that we see at the end of the film are exactly the same, and the what she sees coincides perfectly with a recurring dream that torments the protagonist, coming from the future. I say no more.I loved Brad Pitt's performance in this movie. The actor, very used to heartthrob roles where he can use and abuse his natural charm, is almost unrecognizable here. Of course, younger and less experienced, but just as impeccable. I don't know to what extent participating in this film had an influence on his learning as an actor, but I believe it was useful for Pitt. Bruce Willis is also an actor who deserves a positive mention for his work here. He really seems confused, and in many scenes he manages to give the character the feeling that she is abandoning herself to the course of events, fighting against it whenever she feels her mission is in danger. Madeleine Stowe's performance was not so happy: while being frankly positive, it is the least interesting and the most conventional.Technically, the film is flawless. Gilliam cleverly takes advantage of the sets and costumes and makes a truly strange, bizarre future, with those plastic protective suits and that ball in the interrogation scenes. It's an ugly world that we don't want to see one day. I especially liked the cinematography, and the way the director works the footage in a way that makes everything even more surreal and strange. For example, the scene on the staircase of Goines' father's mansion, which is as elegant and majestic as it is labyrinthine and dreamlike. In addition to the good effects, the film also has a very effective soundtrack.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Don't fool yourselves!,"I remember watching this movie in cinema many years ago and didn't like it so much then. And today, more than 20 years later I saw it again and my opinion strangely did NOT change a bit.

You may not derive a message from such a mess. That who derives one is fooling themself. The fact that Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt play in it doesn't make it perfect.

Am I the one who's crazy?,"This wasn't a great movie. forgive me for not ""understanding the vision"", but I feel like it was written by children. or maybe a room full of monkeys...sci-fi is my favorite genre. however i almost turned this one off half-way through. i did not, hoping that some kind of genius would show itself and my patience would be rewarded. it wasn't.Bruce Willis surprised me by not playing himself as usual, and Brad Pitt was excellent. but on the whole this movie fell flat for me. it helps i guess to think of it as a live action cartoon, as most if not all of the characters appear to be mentally juvenile. I'm looking at you, TSA officials who are too busy sniffing farts to stop a biological terrorist who LITERALLY HOLDS CHEMICAL TEST TUBES UP TO YOUR NOSE.

Gilliam Goes Gothic,"Anyone familiar with Terry Gilliam's work will know he is a man who loves the weird, the eccentric and the bizarre. In case you were wondering, this is the guy responsible for Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It was this very tendency towards the outrageous that kept him at arm's length with production company Universal Pictures, up until the release of 1985's ""Brazil"", written and directed by Gilliam. When this risk of a picture paid off, it earned him some credit with Universal, allowing him to later accept the position of director for David and Janet Peoples' ""Twelve Monkeys"".The year is 2035, and the dregs of humanity have been driven underground by the spread of a virus that has wiped out 80% of the population, leaving the surface to the animals. In an attempt to obtain a pure sample of the virus, scientists send ""voluntary"" convict James Cole (Bruce Willis) back in time to 1996. Upon arrival, Cole is mistaken for a crazy man and put into a mental institution. While here he meets beautiful psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and deranged mad-man Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt). Soon he becomes irreversibly caught up in the lives of these people, and the lines between reality and insanity become dangerously unclearWho would've thought that one of the Monty Python boys could turn this rather clichéd Sci-Fi flick into something new and exciting? And yet that's exactly what's happened. Gilliam's extraordinary vision keeps the film just surreal enough throughout that the audience is guessing to the end as to Cole's true state of mind, in a masterful manipulation of audience response, on a par with David Lynch.The most intriguing thing about Gilliam's characteristically idiosyncratic film noir venture is its eerie, almost apocalyptic depiction of modern America. Through the eyes of Willis' confused and emotionally vulnerable character, the world as we know it seems darker, more sinister and the society thereupon built seems to ominously and unknowlingly teeter on the verge of a inevitable tragedy. ""All I see are dead people"", Cole despairingly confides in Dr. Railly, with a depressing conviction that for once has the audience actually hopeful that the main character is crazy.Working with this are some simply superb performances from the lead cast. It was agreed by both Gilliam and Willis from an early point that this was not to be a typical ""Bruce Willis"" movie, in that it was going to be more character-depth and less action. Willis delivers on his promise, giving an emotionally restrained performance as the confused and vulnerable James Cole, unsure of his own hold on reality in a world that feels strangely familiar. Madeline Stowe is competent as always, but it's no secret that the star is Brad Pitt, who should have won an Oscar for this disturbingly convincing portrayal of a complete and total nutter.And if all this weren't enough, the film's been given an erratic, discordant accordion score to boot; interspersed when thematically necessary with more harmonious string section, depending, of course, on whichever of the two Cole is feeling.All up, ""Twelve Monkeys"" manages to be a surprisingly unique interpretation of what could have been a dull repetition of decades of the genre, almost to the extent of which it creates a genre of its own. Impressive stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Monkeying around with time and viruses and crazy Brad Pitts,"Terry Gilliam's ""nightmare vision"" is pretty nightmarish, in a funny Terry Gilliamish way. There's something humorous and mischievously entertaining about ""Twelve Monkeys"" that keeps it from taking itself too seriously and falling prey to pretention, but then it comes back at you just as intense and creepy as a movie can get. It keeps itself fresh and fluid, with a healthy dose of quirk to it. But I don't think it knows it's an apocalyptic vision.The film is about James Cole, played by Bruce Willis, a man from the future who goes back in time to stop the disaster that sent him underground from ever happening. But that's the simple way of describing it. The story is in a constant fight as to where to go with the plot, with probably a dozen sub-ideas that could turn into something. It's twisted and elaborate and almost impossible to explain to someone without them saying ""what?"", but like ""Memento"" or ""The Matrix"", when you watch it, it makes sense. But these plot developements are delicious fodder and keep it moving, allowing characters like Brad Pitt's pitch perfect sort-of-insane ""Jeffrey Bowen"" to take a bow (deserved that Oscar nod, BTW).The film's eccentricity takes hold of it. From the cinematography, to the accordian theme that playfully plays throughout the film, to the excessive production design that you know was made that way just because they felt like it (though it does help make the film what it is). And more often than not, the miserable conditions of Mr. Willis or whoever else may be feeling miserable at the time come across the screen in an almost tangible way.But behind the running cinematic joke, and the dark atmosphere of the film, it drives itself home where it must, and Bruce Willis, surprisingly, performs in what is probably one of his best roles. There's a frusterating and pitiful scene when he is desperately trying to make psychiatrists in 1990 accept the fact that he's from the future. They don't buy it, and he realizes that on top of his original task, he now has to find some tedious way to make these people believe him. Teamed with the talented Madeleine Stowe, the duo help create a touching relationship that grounds the film, as it turns out, on a deep personal level.The film doesn't necessarily scare you into thinking all this would happen in real life, we've heard it too much before, and I don't think that was the goal of the movie. But by the end of the film you've been given a healthy sense of dread for the poor characters in the film. How often does that happen? Though when they play the Louis Armstrong classic ""Wonderful World"" during the credits, it stamps and seals the irony of it all, and does exactly what Mr. Armstrong probably didn't intend the song to do in the first place.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"I hate to sound pretentious, but some people are stupid","Reading the comments from people who didn't like this movie and how they got a headache from it, almost gave me one.

That headache was causes by actually using your brain during a movie for the first time in awhile. It's been turned to mush by Van Damme and Segal. Please, don't say you hate something because you don't understand it, bigots do the same thing. I know that's extreme, but you can't say this isn't a good movie.

The memory of being recucitated in the Dublin children's hospital is a warmer feeling that the memory of this movie. This movie has destroyed more lives than Hiroshima. This movie is so physically uncomfortable that xsitting in a room with three convicted child predators at the ripe old age of 6 would probably be more comfortable.

There's no monkeying around when it comes to this movie,"Terry Gilliam is one of the original six members of the Monty Python cast. His works include Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Life of Brian, and The Meaning of Life, where he helped direct two and helped write all of them. He also directed Jabberwocky where he used Lewis Carrol's poem and some of his Monty Python buddies to make a movie. In 1995, he decided to make a movie that was a little bit different.Inspired by a previous film called La Jetee, Twelve Monkeys is a science fiction thriller/drama that revolves around James Cole played by Bruce Willis. This man has ""volunteered"" to go back in time to try and stop deadly virus from spreading, killing five billion people and leaving the animals in charge on the surface. He is first sent to the wrong time period, 1990. His destination was supposed to be 1996. Instead he winds up staying in a mental hospital. He becomes allies with a crazy man by the name of Jeffrey Goines. Brad Pitt is wonderful as this ""nutty"" of a character. His portrayal of Jefferey gave him an Oscar nomination.What happens now is Bruce is transported finally to the right time period, after being brought back from the mental hospital. Now he must use his psychiatrist from the mental hospital, Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), and her car to try and stop the virus from getting out into the open. Cole must now find out if what he thinks is reality is just all in his head and he really isn't being brought back and forth from the present to the past, or as Railly sees it, from the future back to the present.This story is very well written. Writer David Webb Peoples is no rookie when it comes to writing a screenplay. His previous triumphs were Blade Runner, thought to be one of the best science fiction movies of all time, and Unforgiven where he received an Oscar nomination.Twelve Monkeys is a great movie you can watch over and over again and still find something to like.

Excellent dark sci-fi,"I knew Terry Gilliam's movies were all but predictable, but I had to see Twelve Monkeys in order to truly believe it.This is the only Gilliam movie I've seen so far, but it blew me away so much he's already one of my favorite filmmakers.The story may seem a little bit classic(a man is sent back in time to stop a disaster), but Gilliam immediately makes it original:convict James Cole(Bruce Willis) ends up a few years before the plague breaks loose, so no one believes him and he's locked up in an asylum.He has to convince Dr.Railly(Madeleine Stowe)he's not crazy, while he spends his time with ""fellow"" nut-case Jeffrey Goines(Brad Pitt).The Twelve Monkeys have to be stopped...If you thought you knew what dark sci-fi flicks are like, think again.In terms of atmosphere, this is a perfect mix of Blade Runner and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest(the asylum riot is visually great). The script is incredibly good, and the same is to be said about the performances:Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt are amazing(the latter was Oscar-nominated for this role), playing two guys they wouldn't be associated with under the normal circumstances.But when we're talking about Terry Gilliam, can there actually be any normal circumstances?",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Confusing, but after a while it comes together, extremely well","When I first saw Twelve Monkeys, I felt like saying ""WHAT?! I was also twelve years old (odd coincidence), and I was so wrapped up into the atmosphere of the picture, this very worn-in future and grungy, underground style of science fiction. Years later, after having seen the film several times more, it sinks in a bit clearer, though the mystery around it, a sort of questioning that is posed more for the viewer to figure things out, stays around. It's one of the truly challenging works of not-entirely-classifiable science fiction films to come out of the 'mainstream' Hollywood in many years. It deals with madness, time, and how we chose to have our destinies stay the same or change or do anything to find out about ourselves, and it's done in such an entertaining fashion that it's got layers to it. It is a tale of a man (Bruce Willis) who is sent from 2029 to 1996 to stop the end of the world, which will take place very soon (a possible plausible thing considering the amount of possible ways to destroy the world through chemicals, especially towards the end of the 20th century).But, it doesn't start off there; first we get a series of scenes set in a mental hospital in 1990, with Brad Pitt's character as the deranged wildcat in the hospital. There's even a love story- in a manner of speaking- that unfolds between Willis and Madeline Stowe's character that is so unconventional that it is hard to find where the tension stops and where the real compassion begins. What ensues is strange yet intriguing; we're sure up to a point of where this might lead, but the final revelation still ranks among Gilliam's best. Disturbing and yet some great entertainment that doesn't sit like a lump for its audience to chew. The sparks and gears have to work in your head during this one, as layers get stripped and you have to piece it back together once it's done. But it's done in such a way that is totally apart from pretension. For art-film viewers the sight of Willis and Pitt might be a bit jarring, and likewise for the mainstream action-adventure crowd the amount of intense and odd camera moves will seem one-of-a-kind. For me, it's one of the best films of 1995, even the 90s.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Brilliantly bizarre masterpiece from Terry Gilliam,"I expected to find myself disappointed in TWELVE MONKEYS. I was not. I loved it. It's probably Terry Gilliam's best film, but then again every time I see a Terry Gilliam movie I always find myself saying this. (Except for BRAZIL, which I must confess I did not like.) TWELVE MONKEYS is, I suppose, a time travel movie; but when I was watching it I never considered it to be one. It's so bizarre and multi-layered and multi-genre that I didn't have time to stop and label it as one specific kind of movie. It's a drama, it's a horror, it's a thriller, it's a comedy, it's a satire, etc. It has everything.I would be willing to recommend it on the superb acting alone - Willis gives one of his best (perhaps even THE best) performances of his career, and Brad Pitt is similarly at the top of his game. (His nervous and verbal ticks are classic stuff.) Gilliam keeps this going from beginning to end, never losing momentum. It's interesting from the first shot to the last, and I think TWELVE MONKEYS contains far more depth than many of Gilliam's other films. This is the ""epic"" of Gilliam's career. Because of this fact, some of his die-hard fans will claim it's not any good, because it's not the typical Gilliam style. It's a bit more dramatic, perhaps, than his other films (particularly the ending).But Gilliam's vision is still clear in every frame (with the awkward camera angles, blue tints, crazy outfits and styles and surroundings). I love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An Insane Meditation On Madness,"An intriguing portrait of a dystopian future, an insane meditation on madness & an interesting take on the idea of time travel, reality & memories, Twelve Monkeys must've been one of the most creative examples of science-fiction filmmaking when it was released but looking back now, it doesn't feel as impressive anymore despite the innumerable twists & turns it has to offer.The story of Twelve Monkeys presents a future in which almost all of humanity has been annihilated by a deadly virus which has forced the remaining survivors to live beneath the surface. The plot concerns a convict who's sent back in time to collect more data on the man- made virus, which seems to be connected to a mysterious organization called The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.Directed by Terry Gilliam, the film has a strangely unnerving atmosphere looming over it from start to finish which is further helped by its eccentric set pieces, clever use of camera angles & unconventional editing which tries to engage the viewers with its constantly shifting tones & twists. And its background score is no slouch either for it further enhances its moody ambiance.Coming to the performances, the cast of Twelve Monkeys stars Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt & Madeleine Stowe, and all three of them are crazily good in their given roles. Willis chips in strongly as the convict who's sent back in time, Pitt is completely deranged in his role but is also the most impressive of the three, and Stowe's character is able to hold on to her sanity for the most part.On an overall scale, Twelve Monkeys is full of intricate themes, ideas & homages that's presented in a manner not everyone is going to enjoy. It does play with the viewers' minds & is a bold piece of filmmaking but its acting also comes off as exaggerated on many occasions, its romance subplot feels unnecessary, the entire production appears somewhat dated & for me, it also failed to live up to its legacy. Multiple viewings advised.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good movie but there's just one thing...,"Bruce Willis is quietly effective in this film, but watching it becomes a bit grating after awhile because of Brad Pitt's exaggerated antics. I think he was trying to upstage Willis, and if you watch Bruce Willis, you can read between the lines and realize that Willis knew this....just watch him keeping an eye on Pitt.

Desperate Dystopian Downer!,"A killer virus in 1996 has wiped out billions of people, in the year 2035, a convict is selected to go back in time and gather information about the virus' origins.It took me a few viewings to firmly get close to just how marvellous this film is, nothing at first is ever crystal clear, even now after watching it again I find my partner and I having differing opinions as regards the finale. So with that in mind I really wont expand on the plot structure of the film, if you haven't seen then I urge you to do so, and then watch again and again until its glory hits you in the face.Twelve Monkeys finds director Terry Gilliam crafting his mind meddling panache with other peoples sources, writers David & Janet Peoples (Blade Runner & Unforgiven) to be exact. The Peoples extract the best premise from French short La Jetée, give it a pounding time jumping head spin, and then gleefully thriving on the paranoia of killer virus' that were laying waste to many in the 1990s. Enter Gilliam to bring it all together, showing restraint from his outlandish (yet incredible) vision that he used for Brazil in 1985, Twelve Monkeys still ends up something of a complex masterpiece without over stretching the viewers' patience. There is no glossy Hollywood smears in the film, this isn't the type of film where Bruce Willis (never better) saves the day and cracks a quip at the end, or a film where Brad Pitt (again, rarely better) shows off his pectorals to get bums on seats in the theatre, this is a cold unnerving film that demands not only to be watched, but also respected.Now about that ending...........thank you Terry Gilliam, genius. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Critical analysis,"Bruce Willis as James Cole is surprisingly in his portrayal although it is fair to say the role of saving the world is wearing thin now. Brad Pitt as Jeffrey Goines is a perfect example of over acting and I don't think was suitably cast in his role. The director Terry Gilliam however has brought the film brilliantly together, making a fairly complex syntagm visually stimulating and engaging. I was interested to see Gilliam's fascination with Hitchcock films, as he included footage of The Birds, the theme of Vertigo and copied Hitchcock's trademark of making the woman, Dr Railly (Madeline Stowe), blonde.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Too clever by half,"I love the work of Terry Gilliam.  He is one of my favorites.  Alas Twelve Monkeys isn't one of them.  I'm not saying it's a bad movie.  I just can't get my arms around this one.One of my problems with it is the time travel aspect.  I don't believe in time travel.  I find it impossible to believe that the cosmos are marks on the tape of time.  Events define time; time doesn't define events.  And in the entertainment cosmos, time travel is used too much as a device of convenience.  In Twelve Monkeys, Bruce Willis' character is sent back to a time when a deadly agent is released around the globe resulting in the deaths of 5 billion.  Confusingly, he can't alter events but is only expected to retrieve a sample of the agent to take back to his present.Another big problem is the Brad Pitt character.  Movies love the giddy and manic crazy person.  Brad Pitt is this - too much so.  It's so apparent that Brad is acting crazy although in his defense, I don't know what actor could do better.  What's worse is his character is a leader of a group of activists which is absurd.  Insanity is a sad and lonely place.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Struggle of Cassandra,"If you are somehow aware of a future apocalypse, and you tell it to the people, you would be treated as crazy. It is called Cassandra Complex, derived from a Greek legend, and is what happens to the protagonist Cole.Cole, a prisoner in the dystopian world of 2035, is send to 1990, and later to 1996. We learn from him that 99% of human race will be eradicated in 1996 and 1997 by a deadly virus, and his purpose is to obtain information about the virus before it mutates.He explains his situation to the people, and naturally is put in a mental asylum. He is a rough and vulgar man, having volunteered to the task only for a pardon, but somewhat shows a sense of duty, as heroes played by Bruce Willis always do. He meets Kathryn, a beautiful and sympathetic psychiatrist who you would want to make believe yourself more than anyone else. Actually how she comes to believe him is the most interesting part of the film.As a time-travel mystery, the plot is quite complicated. To be honest, I needed some help from explanation websites to understand the details after watching it. It seems to me that some pointless distractions make it more complicated than necessary. And although I know he was nominated for an Oscar for the role, I don't find the Brad Pitt character that interesting or attractive, compared with the two leading characters, and even with the creepy David Morse.But it still has true tension and thrill that compel you to follow the story to the end. It's exciting to watch the time-travelling twists where an act can solve a problem and cause a new problem at the same time. I love the scenes from the post-apocalyptic 2035, like scientists singing Blueberry Hill and the face of an elderly female scientiest magnified in a lens. The entire film is filled with dizziness and nightmare, but strangely beautiful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
It's so 1995 and late,"Science fiction is hard genre to be timeless. The main focus of sci-fi films is to be super creative, futuristic, and advanced. However, time can make them antiquated and tacky so soon. Not just the forms but also the content of '12 Monkeys' seems out of style. Vinyl anti-contamination suit, coarse machinery, and implausible special effects scenes can be permissible, considering the time of release of the movie. However, dystopian universe, time lapse, false memory, and finding real reality are the most redundant topics, and they all seem like ancient remains especially after 'The Matrix'.Also, I cannot understand Academy nomination for Brad Pitt. He always does this overdramatic imitation of a character rather than being that character himself. He tries too hard to pop from other cast and be unique or one of a kind. He acts too crazy to be a radical lunatic, Jeffery, ironically making the movie less realistic.In contrast, camera work is well done. Unbalanced and distorted camera angle brings out dystopian atmosphere and integrates mental state of James Cole. Asymmetrical shots and scenes makes audience doubt and be confused about which reality is real along with the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of Gilliam's finest works,"Watching all of a film director's movies in a row provides a certain clarity around theme, especially regarding a director like Terry Gilliam who's movies always revolve around very similar themes, mostly dealing with the intersection of fantasy and reality. It's evolved from the hopeless disconnect of perpetual optimism of Denis in Jabberwocky to the fantastical escapes by Kevin, Sam, and the Baron in Time Bandits, Brazil, and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen to the broaching of mental illness and grief for both Parry and Jack in The Fisher King. Twelve Monkeys uses the ideas of time travel and mental illness to ask a lot of the similar questions Gilliam had been asking for over a decade. Namely, he was asking about where the line between fantasy and reality should be, whether we should cast off imaginative thought in our day to day lives.The movie is intentionally muddy about what is real and what is not, giving equal cinematic treatment to things in the past and the present (or present and the future, from the audience's point of view). Gilliam loves his Dutch angles and the exaggerated focus inherent in wide angle lenses in closeup on a characters' face, and it's always meant to imply a skewed reality. In that way, he films both everything in the future and everything in the psych wards using the same methods, saving the more traditional straight on framing for smaller scenes where Cole, the main character, feels some sense of calm, like when he's driving with his psychologist and listening to music. This sense of disorientation lends itself to the central path that Cole follows where he questions the nature of his reality.So, the reality that he starts in is a future where humanity has all been wiped out from a virus, relegated to a meager existence underground ruled by a scientist collective that's solely occupied with finding a cure. They have developed time travel technology and send back undesirables to gather information about the origin of the pandemic. The science is imprecise, so people get thrown about into all sorts of times like the middle ages, World War I, and 1990 when the target is 1996, a few months before the start of the outbreak in 1997. They know that the epidemic started in Philadelphia and focus on a terrorist faction called the Twelve Monkeys that plastered the city with graffiti about how they ""did it"".Cole first gets sent to 1990 where he's immediately picked up and placed in a mental institution. He's an unstable person to begin with, but time travel and his talk about the present being the past just tells the authorities that he's a loony and deserves to be there. Again, this section of the film is filmed in the same exaggerated style as the stuff from the future, implying that we should treat both of them with same level of fantastical skepticism. And therein lies the literal mystery of the story: Is the future we see a construct of Cole's mind or is the past he's trapped in equally real?There's a small moment that I think helps illuminate this. When Cole first appears in the mental hospital, he's cornered by a man, dressed in a suit, who talks about mental divergence and how he's actually on another planet at the same time getting ready to quell the barbarian hordes on Pluto. He provides this literal possibility for Cole's condition, and then we never see him again. Perhaps this man in the suit wasn't mentally divergent, but actually was in two places at once.As with any Gilliam film, that literal question isn't the point. Also, with any Gilliam film, the madman ends up being right. At the center of Cole's struggles with his grasp on reality is Dr. Kathryn Railly, his psychiatrist. She comes into the film as dead certain of her ""religion"", as she calls it, of psychiatry's grasp on the real vs. the unreal. However, as Cole keeps disappearing and re-appearing, even appearing in a photo from World War I, her faith in the certainty of her convictions gets shaken.The framing device of the whole movie implies the cyclical nature of Cole's existence. He has dreams of a memory from his childhood, from before the outbreak, where he's in an airport and witnesses a shooting. As the movie moves along and he becomes familiar with more principles in the 90s, we start seeing more of their faces in the recurring dream. This is most evidence when we see Jeffrey Goines, a fellow mental patient and the leader of the Twelve Monkeys, in his vision only after Cole meets him. I think this raises some practical questions about the ability to change time as well as Cole's grasp on reality, but again, they're not really the point. The point is that this dream, this fantasy, grounds him and provides him direction, giving him purpose in the face of all the questions that assault him.There's a wonderful twistiness to the film that's more than just being clever. The movie is certainly that, but at the heart of it is Cole's journey. He's so wracked by doubt about the basic fabric of reality around him, played wonderfully by Bruce Willis, while Kathryn Railly tries to use her view of the world to make sense of it all. The score is oddly French, probably a nod to La Jetee, the French short film that inspired the movie. Brad Pitt is a maniac as Goines. It's Gilliam's most polished looking film while also maintaining his very particular flair. It's a very good movie, produced well, and with a surprisingly smooth production history, that stands as one of Gilliam's finest works.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Delirious story of time-travel, plague and inevitability","James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time (from 2035) to locate a sample of the virus that killed billions of people in 1997 so scientists in his present can analyse it in the hope finding a cure. As time-travel stories go, the premise is 'realistic' and the film's fatalistic acceptance that the epidemic cannot be prevented avoids overt grandfather paradoxes (but don't think too hard about cause-effect-cause loops). The film is an expansion of Chris Marker's experimental short 'film' (actually a series of still images) 'La Jetée' 1962. Directed by Terry Gilliam, 'Twelve Monkeys' is steeped in his signature bizarre borderline-surreal style and, like 'Brazil' (1985), the imagery is mesmerising. Willis is excellent as the time-traveler whose 'predictions' are not believed (like Cassandra's, a common theme in the film). Brad Pitt is also very good as Jeffrey Goines, an unhinged, hyper-kinetic animal-rights fanatic and leader of the titular 'Army of the12 Monkeys' whom Cole is convinced is the originator of the plague. Madeleine Stowe is Cole's psychiatrist Kathryn Railly, who gets dragged (literally) into the story. Stowe is fine at first but I found that her character grew tiresome toward the end of the film, as she slowly accepts Cole's realities. Despite being a 'leading man', Willis allows his character to be portrayed as somewhat 'repellant' at times (e.g. drooling), a willingness I always admire in a 'star'. All in all, a clever story that is well-made, entertaining, and visually compelling.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Almost but not quite,"Like most of Terry Gilliam's works, this has the air of a great film not quite being made. His baroque vision of the future is wonderful. Civilisation underground after the plague is a hellish dystopia saturated by the same incompetent control-freakery he portrayed in Brazil. Some of the images are spectacular, particularly the wild animals running loose in an American city. Gilliam's narrative playfulness, throwing Bruce Willis back and forth through time before the story really starts, almost rescues the plot from clichés. Not entirely though. This was designed as a blockbuster thriller and is only original by those dreadful standards. But the chief problem is the cast. Willis, while being less annoying than normal, is a monosyllabic grunter. Madeline Stowe only really does a job as the usual beautiful scientist-cum-love interest Meanwhile Brad Pitt is allowed to give us the full scope of his non-existent talents.

"Complex, different but solid.","12 Monkeys is a very complex Sci-fi film that keeps you guessing how it will end.

My favourite time travel film,"Time travel is something that fascinates me and there have been many time travel movies both good and bad. Out of all of them, my favourite has to be Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys.12 Monkeys shows us a world in the future that has been ruined by a virus. Scientists decide to send a man named James Cole to the past in order to find out the cause of the virus that wiped out the majority of the world's population.What I really love about 12 Monkeys is the way it shows the psychological effects time travel has on its protagonist, something a lot of time travel films tend to ignore. This made the film feel so much more crazy and mind-bending. Over the course of the entire film we see Bruce Willis lose his mind as he blurs the line between which reality is real and which is fake. The film's narrative is something that made feel like as if I was going insane as well. The way the narrative goes back and forth, through the time travel and constant flashbacks, makes us relate with the character of Cole as it seems like we're experiencing what he's going through.Even on a technical level, 12 Monkeys succeeds. The strange angles and close-ups Gilliam uses provides a more insane and distorted experience to the viewer. The heavy use of white in the film's cinematography serves as a great tool to increase the feeling of madness. The story goes in many directions and has something for everyone to enjoy whether that is action, drama or sci-fi and it's all done within the boundaries of the film's rules. Everything is done impeccibly well.The performances are solid from everyone involved. Bruce Willis is at the top of his game here. He gives great expressions here which clearly indicate the confusion and madness his character is going through due to the effects of the time travel. Madeleine Stowe did a good job and served as a great support to Willis. The scene stealer, however, was Brad Pitt. His portrayal as the crazy and mentally insane Jeffrey Goines is the highlight of the entire film. I loved his work in films like Fight Club and Inglourious Basterds but his performance in 12 Monkeys is his best in my opinion.12 Monkeys remains as my favourite time travel film. It's a film that's got action, sci-fi drama and ends in a way that still confuses me to this day. Terry Gilliam has created something truly special and I cannot praise it enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Incredible!!!   MILD SPOILERS,"Terry Gilliam might be a smart director, but after watching Twelve Monkeys I am a little more convinced. Twelve Monkeys is just INCREDIBLE.Its entertaining, thrilling, interesting and Mind Screwing. But its not like the other Psychological thrillers. The 2 hours are lengthy but the screenplay captures your attention throughout.The Sci-fi and psychological mixture turns out GREAT and the movie doesn't leaved you confused at the ending.Brad Pitt played a pretty nice character. Cinematography was pretty genuine. Screenplay was clever and direction was fine. Over All it was really worth a watch.RECOMMENDED! 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"""Certain unnamed realities""","The future dystopia has been a staple of sci-fi movies for around forty years now, and for even longer in sci-fi novels. However there are only so many ways you can show the world going to buggery before it gets a bit samey. Twelve Monkeys however is a future dystopia movie that mostly sidesteps looking at said dystopia, and instead twists through time to reveal where things went wrong in the first place.Although sometimes thought of as a non-linear movie, Twelve Monkeys in fact follows the personal timeline of its hero as he zips back and forth, and in broad outline is not actually amazingly complex. However, the David and Janet Peoples screenplay does not make any clear opening statements – apart from a couple of lines on a title card which are put in dubious context. We then plunge straight into the flowing narrative and have to glean what the movie's about in bits and pieces along the way. While this demands close attention from the viewer, it works very well to embroil us in the world of a confused outsider.This confusion and oddity is deepened in the approach of director Terry Gilliam, who uses rather overt stylisation to make the world of Twelve Monkeys as distorted and alien as possible. His near-constant Dutch angles and claustrophobic camera positions (racked up or toned down depending on protagonist Cole's mental state) could easily become tiresome, but the focus on macabre set design, unusual faces and familiar objects made to look outlandish allows us to get swept up in the wonkiness of the whole creation. At times, watching it feels a bit like being unpleasantly drunk. But don't let this fool you into thinking there isn't precision to all this. Knowing that the story often relies upon the audience recalling some tiny detail, Gilliam uses a number of cunning tricks to fix something in our memories, for example Madeleine Stowe's distorted voice on the words ""Merry Christmas"" or the fact that Dr Peters has those distinctive ginger locks.As Gilliam garnered his reputation as a belligerent maverick, he also began to work with more and more prestigious Hollywood stars. Twelve Monkeys sees Bruce Willis in a role that is arguably to his type, with a fair bit of macho action, but with a presentation that is very much counter to his usual confident demeanour. He's actually very effective in this lonely, vulnerable guise, seeming mysterious yet sympathetic. The most memorable turn is that of an exuberant Brad Pitt. Pitt's madman act is derived mostly from the hammy madman acts of Jack Nicholson and Dennis Hopper, and it's really just as overdone, although there is some amazingly complicated business he's doing with his fingers that is at the very least distinctive. Gilliam seems to have achieved the impossible and make Pitt look, not unattractive as such, but disappointingly plain. Madeleine Stowe gives a strong and steady performance, a credible turn in what is really the only straight dramatic role. Her best highlight – and the most poignant moment in the whole picture – is that ghost of a smile in her final scene.While Twelve Monkeys in many areas falls some way short of perfection, it works better than many movies with stronger components, simply because good or bad everything is of a piece. Pitt's overacting, Gilliam's extrovert camera, the improbable converging of events in the storyline, these all fit in with the strange and giddy rhythm of the movie and its grim yet oddly sentimental mood. It is far from the typical sci-fi fare that gets the geeks salivating, but it is an absorbing thriller and one that, even through its unreality, carries a striking humanity.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Superb acting, intelligent script, impressive and powerful","I watched this movie for about 8 times, always is a real pleasure.Bruce Williams is in his best acting shape as well as the brilliant and gorgeous acting performance of Brad Pitt, with , in this movie, is completely different character from witch we were used him to be in movies like ""Meet Joe Black"" and ""Seven"". His acting performance is as memorable as he is in ""Kalifornia"", a totally different way of view. I think this is one of the best intelligent and sensible SF movies of all times, along with Blade Runner's sensitivity. Watch it, but not once, because you will not see everything that is hidden in this beautiful movie, watch it at least 2 times...then you will understand...same goes for Fight Club.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Bruce makes another bad choice,"Bruce Willis has proved when he wants to he can really act, but between those times he picks crap like this, Twelve Monkeys along with Fifth Element is Bruce at his worst, the question I have is it Bruce or does he just pick bad material? Twelve Monkeys has a rehashed script that was taken from other movies including Andromeda Strain (which is a far superior movie) Logans run, one flew over the cuckoo's nest and a little know movie called Millennium from 1989, twelve monkeys take all of those movies and many more and mashes them together to make one dark long confusing boring mess that makes you shake your head at the end. The one bright spot is Brad Pitt who plays a crazy genius the rest of the cast is wasted. 4 out of 10 it's not the worst movie I have ever seen but it is far from the best",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Time travel story done right,"I ask for only one thing in a time travel story: Whatever rules you establish for how it works and what the effects of paradox are, you follow them. They can be totally ridiculous from the standpoint of both physics and common sense, but whatever rules are established early in the story must be obeyed as the story continues.Twelve Monkeys does this. There are a couple of points where the story could cheat, but the director/writer avoided the temptation. On top of being internally consistent, the plot is compelling and the ending is dramatic. The sterile future world contrasts well with the dirty polluted world of the past, and viewers will slowly understand the irony that it is the dirty, polluted world that the time travelers are hoping to restore by changing the past.A beautiful film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Very good. Although towards the end it gets too over-the-top.,"Twelve Monkeys stars Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt in an Oscar Nominated Performance. Twelve Monkeys is the story of James Cole (Willis) who lives in a world underground with the surviving humans from a man-made disease which was set in motion in 1997. He is sent back, before the disease plagues the world and eliminates most of the entire human race, to gather information about how it happened, why it happened, and who was involved.I watched this film under the impression that it was going to be amazing. It isn't quite ""amazing"" but it's still pretty good. The story line is very clever and innovative. The script was well written, the acting was great especially from Brad Pitt, who is usually great in most things. The directing was cool, with some nice, tricky shots that I quite liked. The ending was good. Most things were good, but there were a few things which throw me off it.I felt it went a little over-the-top for my liking towards the end, Madeleine Stowe annoyed the hell out of me, she just isn't that good of an actor. Although there isn't many complaints, they are still big to me, which is why it will only receive a 7/10. It could have gotten an 8.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Great Film and the  recent TV Serialisation is also very good.,"The story works and the film is excellent in all respects. My favourite moment is when a hoodlum, who bursts into a room to find Cole and his companion comes unstuck. The hood is caught then left in a locked room. The cops arrive, all blues n twos and mob handed. They hear a plaintive cry from within as they enter the apartment. I thought it sounded priceless. ""Hey! Is that the cops? ... I'm the innocent victim in here... I was attacked by a coked up whore and a f in crazy dentist!"" I know it would be totally unsuitable, in public, but man, I would love too use it as a ring tone. The part played by Brad Pitt is very demanding and he is absolutely convincing, playing the lunatic. Bruce Willis convincingly portrays a man going through absolute hell.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An outstanding time travel film which is never too overly-complicated,"Science Fiction has always been my favorite movie genre. I love seeing the imagination in movies of the genre and many of my favorite films are science fiction movies. This movie has everything which I think is mandatory in time travel movies. It has a great plot which gets you interested in its story line, it has great imagination, and a slightly complex story which requires a couple repeat viewings so you can understand and enjoy the movie more.In the year 1996, a deadly virus wipes out all humanity and the few survivors live underground to avoid becoming sick themselves. In hopes of finding a cure to the virus, a prisoner named James Cole is sent back in time in order to find a group of people called ""The Army of the Twelve Monkeys"" who are believed to have started the virus. However, he is sent to the year 1990 by mistake and he meets a few people from that time period who may be able to help him complete his task.What makes this film so good is that while it can be complex at some times, it keeps you interested and it makes the viewer want to come back for more. The ending kept me thinking about what it meant long after viewing it and I wanted to watch it again after I watched it for my first time. Also, I did like it a lot more on my second viewing. The movie isn't really too complex up until the end, but it does feel a lot different on your second viewing. Also, the airport flashbacks keep on feeling more important every time they are shown. On your second viewing, they have a greater impact on you as you are already aware of what the purpose of them is.Also, the ending to this film is very well-done. I honestly did not expect that the film was going to end like how it did and it pleasantly surprised me. I'm sure that some were able to predict the ending if they paid close attention to the airport flashbacks, but I didn't notice it because the camera movements during those scenes were really disorienting. Also, the sequences are really hypnotic so it makes it kind of hard to get a clear view of what's happening. When I first watched the movie, I thought that the scene was meant to show numerous people dying from the outbreak since many other people in the background were laying on the floor.Also, the visuals and production design is up to notch. The unusual camera angles can be impressive at times at hiding big parts to the film (this works exceptionally well in the ending). There are also cleverly timed zooms which demonstrate how small and insignificant our protagonists are. Gilliam's execution in some of these scenes are perfect and they profoundly always win out. Also, the movie does a very great job with the scenes which take place in the future. The scenes which take place in the future feel very top notch and the set design looks high-tech enough to make you convinced that this is actually what the future will look like. Also, the scene where you see how the city above them looks abandoned is pretty good as it looks like the earth has actually been left to rot for several decades.The performances in Twelve Monkeys are all pretty well-done. Bruce Willis gives his finest performance yet as he displays sensitivity and emotional depth which is not only believable, but it makes the audience aware of his suffering and struggle to find a cure to the virus. Madeleine Stowe manages to show frenzy and energy in her performance without ever overcooking or overdoing it. Those 2 actors carried the movie excellently, but the actor who steals the show is Brad Pitt. He is amazing because he manages to play a convincingly insane and crazy role without ever seeming the slightest bit annoying and he never overacts or overstays his welcome.Of course, Twelve Monkeys is not for everyone and it isn't perfect. It may be too choppy or jumbled together for some people's tastes. Also, it may take a few viewings for you to be fully entertained by it. However, no movie is objectively perfect and it's easy to overlook these flaws if you run into them. If you're not too impressed with it on your first viewing, you should consider watching it a second time because if you do, you will be in for a great treat which is what happened to me when I re-watched it.In conclusion, Twelve Monkeys is an outstanding science fiction film which isn't too overly-complicated, but complicated enough to make your 2nd viewing of it feel a lot better and engaging. It also has great acting and great cinematography which convinces you that you are actually in the time periods that the movie takes place in. If you're a huge fan of Christopher Nolan or other complicated films, you will like this movie. There are very few things, if anything, wrong with it and in my opinion, it is one of the best films from the 90's.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An intelligent comedy/thriller that rewards careful watching.,"I remember when 12 Monkeys first came out on video, and I just never did get around to watching it. Well, I'm glad I waited so long, because the DVD version is so good. As good as the movie is, this DVD has the very best ""making of"" feature I've seen yet. It was done independently and in parallel with making the movie, and gives you a clear idea how this movie was made from concept through test screenings and finally release.The premise of the movie is complex, but involves a future, underground civilization about A.D. 2035, sending people back in time to try and figure out how to prevent, or to find an antidote for, a deadly virus that had exterminated 99% of the world population. It moves back and forth, from ""present"" to past, and drops good clues about how everything fits in. Ultimately all is resolved, but you have to be observant. A great movie for real ""movie watchers"".The 3 main actors all do a fine job, but Brad Pitt as the semi-crazy character is so well done, and funny, that it is hard to imagine the movie with anyone else. Overall a really fine movie.(Sept 2012: I just re-watched it after 12 years, I enjoyed it again!)SPOILERS: The time-traveler was told to find the ""Army of the 12 Monkeys"" as the likely responsible group, but in the end that turned out to be a red herring. The culprit was actually a mad scientist working for a wealthy businessman, and they managed to figure this out at the airport as he was starting his deadly journey in 1996 to spread the virus across the world. One of the future leaders, a woman, has come back in time to sit next to him. She says, ""My Name is Jones. I am in insurance.""

"Beautiful, poetic, like an ever-flowing stream...","This ...is a brilliant film right here. This brings together all of dystopian sci-fi in its most thought-provoking, grim imagery, excellent story-telling that is consistent from the very first scene to that highly emotional ending, subplots that are intentionally distracting enough to serve as lure and densify the main plot - all while having Bruce Willis play the main character excellently, along with the beautiful and also very good Madeleine Stowe, strong cinematography always very contagious with its visuals, its ambiance with carefully picked and adequate background music, always a sentiment of urgency and danger and instability throughout... But more essentially, there is a beautiful poetry about the end of the world's theme, like a romanticism of the apocalypse and hopelessness, the Sisyphus myth, a ringing echo of eternal repetition, a man who will do everything he can even when nobody believes him to try to literally save the world, against all odds, and the beautiful love relationship that is forged through this most unique destiny; and finally, the full ending chapter is masterful at how it brings back abstract past references from earlier, and the film makes you understand something enormous is about to take place and you just can't look away. Excellence on various levels, ambitious and totally accomplished. Either a 9 or a 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Madcap time travel saga,"A saga about James Cole, imprisoned in the year 2035, sent back to the past to try and stop the release of a deadly virus. Converging timelines introduce us to Jeffrey Goines, played by Brad Pitt and Dr. Kathryn Reilley, his alternate timeline shrink, played by Madeline Stowe. Bruce Willis does a fantastic job with the role of Cole, who is never sure if he's sane, or what's going on; plagued by dreams of a shootout in an airport. In alternate timelines, he meets Goines and Reilley, both 1990 and 1996, and tries to solve the mystery of the Army of the 12 Monkeys. While Pitt has a breakout role, this film is carried by Willis, who works the difficult role with ease. Gilliam is a singular filmmaker, with a manic, zany cartoonish and off kilter worldview of his dystopian landscapes. So, the fun is really in the ride, and it's enjoyable along the way. The design is impressive, but still doesn't feel like the upper high brow cinema it intends. That said, this is a good movie; ready for a tub of hot buttered popcorn and an open mind. The three leads all are wonderful, and make this an enjoyable filmic diversion. Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Original and unpretentiously intelligent,"The year is 2035. The vast majority of the human population has been wiped out by a deadly virus. That virus has contaminated the air to the point where it is almost impossible for the remaining inhabitants to breathe. Those who still remain are forced to live underground in a bizarrely regimented, hierarchical society. Our unlikely hero, James Cole, (played by Bruce Willis) exists at the bottom of that hierarchy. He is a convict. However, he has the opportunity to gain the good graces of the new order he has offended: his mission, should he choose to accept it, is to travel into the past in order to investigate the circumstances which led to humanity's rather dismal future state. The reward for returning with useful information will be a pardoning of his sentence and advancement within his underground community.Cue a succession of mind-bending scenes which switch from future, to present, to past and back again. Cole finds himself in all manner of environments, from a lunatic asylum, to the battlefields of World War I, back to his underground lair. Amid all of this, he meets two key individuals: one is the renowned psychologist, Kathryn Railly, (played by Madeleine Stowe) whom he abducts and slowly falls in love with; the other is Jeffrey Goines (played by Brad Pitt) who is clearly insane and may or may not be responsible for the events that will lead to humanity's precarious future.12 Monkeys is one of the most unique and intelligent films Hollywood has ever produced. It is part comedy, part sci-fi, part love story and part thriller. Its pacing is original and disorientating, but once it draws you in, you are fully immersed. The film is utterly unabashed about challenging its audience with its constant jumping between time-lines and its inclusion of a plethora of characters which are able to merge between them. It gets you thinking and, thus, it draws you in even further. Insanity is a strong theme in the film and the line between madness and genius is walked like a metaphorical tight rope. What is so rewarding about the film, however, is the way that it is able to strike a unique chord with its strange combination of notes. You may well keep returning to this film and, if you do, it will show you subtle new details each time it is watched. It is a complicated film but it is not convoluted for the sake of it. The plot fundamentally makes sense and once it is fully processed and understood (it may take a few watches) the true weight of its journey and ending is extremely moving.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Don't let the title fool you... it's not about a jury of Jerry Springer audience members,"Much as I like Terry Gilliam, ""12 Monkeys"" disappoints.  It's familiar, belabored, too slow, and too long.  The meaning of the mysterious airport flashback becomes obvious miles in advance, and when I look back on the movie, all I get is talk, talk, talk, accompanied by very little of Gilliam's trademark visual bravado.  A good cast tries gamely, and the soundtrack music is good and quite memorable as well.  But ""12 Monkeys"" mainly just made me curious to see ""La Jettee,"" the 1963 French short that inspired it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A ""Masterpiece"" eh? I don't think so. Not on this planet.","10 Years ago a friend gave me a VHS tape of this movie to watch. He was very enthusiastic about it and thought it was the greatest science fiction movie he had ever seen in his life. I wasn't quit so sure as he was. Even back then I was very skeptical about Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis being able to pull off a legitimate Sci-Fi movie. I never did watch it and lost the tape many years ago. I made the mistake of renting this movie on DVD a few days ago and finally watching it. Now I regret not continuing my initial enthusiasm for this movie. This movie wasn't any good at all. It nearly put me to sleep about half way through. This has never happened to me before watching ANY movie! That should give you some clue as to how good it is. This movie was confused. There was lots and lots of dialog but very little was being said. Perhaps I've failed to see what everyone is seeing in this movie (a sci-fi ""masterpiece""? Please!)

A 29 Million budget Masterpiece,"And to think that some decades ago you could do a first class sci-fi with a budget of 29 millions dollars ? Seems crazy, considering that most top productions nowadays surpass the 100 millions dollars, many going beyond 200 million. Twelve Monkeys succeed most in a field that many others fail, there is a script that is on the verge of perfection and a story perfectly developed. We travel between future and paste, real and surreal, and everything is well balanced and makes sense. The conclusion makes this one of the best time travel movies ever made, but don't get me wrong, this is not one of those movies specifically about time travel.

On repeated viewing it becomes all the more clear. The performance by Bruce Willis still ranks as the best and most vulnerable he has ever given. The writers David and Janet Peoples have given Terry Gilliam a script that ranks up there with the best, if not the best within the time travelling genre.

Then at the end you feel that everything works out, but still leaves you with some questions about what is next. Either way this is an excellent movie, and if you like movies like Memento or Seven in my opinion this movie is a perfect fit for you.

"Willis, Pitt, and Gilliam at their finest!","I think it might be a sci-fi masterpiece. And of the movies I've seen from Gilliam, the others being Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Brazil, this is my favorite. I like how much more dark and seriously toned it is compared to those two films.If you ask me, Bruce Willis' performance in this is tied with his performance in Unbreakable as the best of his whole career. And I don't think I've seen Brad Pitt act better than in this movie, and he's been great in close to everything I've seen him in! (I haven't seen every movie of his. He was meh in World War Z, Legends of the Fall, and Troy, all of which sucked, by the way.) And both actors were casted against type. Seeing that sort of thing work out is very satisfying.Madeleine Stowe was great, too. And I love the transformation her character goes through. ""We need cash, James!""All of the aesthetics are fantastic, which is to be expected from Terry Gilliam.

A sci-fi film with time travel and real vs surreal,"The movie 12 Monkeys is a Sci-Fi film with many great actors such as Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe. Willis, who plays James Cole, is a survivor of a deadly virus that has killed all but 1% of the population. As a convict, he agrees to let scientists (who were all part of the survivors) send him to the past to attempt to collect any information regarding the virus to help save lives. Cole hopes to receive a pardon for doing this job. As he arrives in the year 1990, he is arrested after failing to cooperate with police and was babbling about the virus. He is given a mental evaluation and is later admitted to where he meets Jeff Goines, played by Brad Pitt. Goines is a complete lunatic who befriends him in the mental hospital.The theme of the movie is real life vs. surreal. Scientists from the past who are evaluating Cole are astonished that he seems to think he is from the future. The whole time Cole is still on this mission to find the Army of the 12 Monkeys, who are expected to have spread this deadly virus. Cole kidnaps his psychiatrist, Dr. Railly (played by Madeline Stowe) who is surprisingly interested and in a way understanding of Cole and sets out to find Goines, as he discovers he is part of the 12 Monkeys. One relatable movie to this is Girl, Interrupted. Cole feels like he is the sane person in the mental hospital, much like Susanna (played by Winona Ryder) felt when she was admitted to the hospital.One technique that emphasizes the theme is the lighting. In the mental hospital, the lighting is very bright and it allows the audience to see the faces and emotions of all the patients. Many people have glazed over looks on their faces from medications, and others have scrapes and scratches on their faces. The lighting while Cole is in sitting with the scientists underground and being reviewed is dark and dreary. It is supposed to give the feeling of being underground and the bizarre experiments they are performing on Cole. The film also used low-angle shots, which allowed emphasis on the characters and not the surroundings. One particular scene that is very noticeable is when Goines is showing Cole around the hospital when Cole first arrives. The emphasis on the characters allows the audience to focus on the quirky personalities of the patients.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"This could have been a great film, but","The acting: really very good.The direction: clever, thematic and nicely understated.The plot: unbelievably simple  a six year old would easily spot the holes: - ah but we can't have that can we? So what to do? ""I know"" someone says ""lets hide it."" This is where the film goes wrong: time travel is notoriously difficult to get right in terms of narrative so that it both works out and is internally consistent. Unfortunately the method used here was not to bother and just hope that if everything is sufficiently cryptic-seeming then no one would notice. To be fair this does seem to have worked at least partially judging by some of the reviews. I have a mathematical background and am a lover of science fiction and I am sorry but good acting and film-craft can't cover up a childish plot.Clearly the overly signalled end was the starting, and perhaps the only, plot premise of this entire film. This really means that the rest of the film was effectively filler to get us there and when analysed in terms of plot consistency this does seem the only possible conclusion. Let us look at some of the many really blatant faux pas:1. They are not very good at finding the right time or place. Yet they always manage to find the Earth and get there person on the surface wherever and whenever they inadvertently send him. (We will forgive this one: it is a biggie, but it is kind of necessary so lets be generous)2. Why do they need this 'dead letter' method of passing messages if they can find there target when they inadvertently put him amongst the French forces in world war I or when the collect him from his hospital cell?3. What is the point anyway? They know when and where to find the first victim  so go back get a blood sample; end of problem.In those precious few moments in this film when we are given access to some actual plot we are presented with that tried and tested 'Time Travel' conundrum: what came first the cause or the effect? The 'If I hadn't tried to fix it there would not have been a problem to fix, so how did this get started anyway' question. Don't get me wrong, I realise this is the inevitable distillation of most good 'Time Travel' stories and if it is handled well and given a new or interesting spin it still has plenty of mileage left in it. Unfortunately there was nothing new or interesting here; there was not even a real attempt to make it fit with the ultimate (obvious from the beginning) plot twist.This film could have been so good, but no one likes being taken for a fool. So once one realises that in plot terms the king really does not have any clothes one really feels rather used and this makes the good parts of this film all the harder to appreciate or enjoy. Unfortunately a near miss often come off worse than something a good deal worse: compare this with 'Plan Nine from Outer space'; this is so nearly a good film, yet 'Plan Nine' is arguably less annoying to watch!",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Much better than I ever expected.,"This is a movie I figured I would like - but did not think I would like it as much as I do. The movie is well worth watching if you are into time travel.I'm not sure what I liked best about the film: The humor, the action, the twists, the idea of a criminal rescuing humanity, or the idea of time travel itself. Maybe its a bit of all of it because 12 Monkeys has all of this.The way this film is made, you can actually keep up with what is going on even though there is travel in time happening - not like some time travel films where you can't tell where they are or where they have been half the time. The film is well made (and well written) so you can easily follow what is going on.This is a film that fans of time travel, science fiction, action, and comedy-dramas is sure to enjoy!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
No Monkeys,"As a massive fan of monkey hijinks and a numerologist who fancies the number twelve, I was proper pitching a tent at the prospect of seeing a film about a dozen apes. Well all I can say is, I've seen more monkeys in a zoo, where they actually have monkeys where they say they're gonna have monkeys. If like me you wanna see monkeys, then be warned this ain't the film for you. Bubbles will be turning in his tractor tyre. Twelve monkeys? More like a handful of homosapiens.Bruce willis is typically bald as the paranoid primate with a purpose, and Brad ""The Baboon"" Pitt ain't bad as the films Wooly Monkey weirdo, but the film lets itself down with its total lack of boobs. Even if Madeleine ""Simeon"" Stowe was to get her fanny out it couldn't rescue this tripe. All in all I thought this film was bobbins. You're better off watching chimpanzee's at a tea party smoking fags. Des O'Connor.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Masterpiece,"Twelve Monkeys will go down as a true classic. It's the story of power and subsequent death, told in a superbly directed manner. A welcome change for Bruce Willis, a seemingly weak mannered Cole, who cannot change the fact the universe will come to an end, and cannot change the fact of time no matter how hard his attempts are. Terry Gilliam brings us a detailed analysis of the balance of power (or Cole's lack of it) to chilling effect, along with an equally strong ending, which may make us believe what really is 'sane'.I loved this movie upon first viewing and I still do. Willis proves himself an actor of all genres, not just your typical action hero as proved with the Die Hard films, but also as a vulnerable and weak individual who tries to do whatever he must to save and help others, but simply cannot because of his own severe issues, such as his performance in the excellent Sixth Sense as well as Tweleve Monkeys. A terrific nail-biting film. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"incredible movie, doesnt stand the test of time","Overall I liked the movie, I wasn't amazed or captivated by it however I can easily tell why or how it would have been revolutionary at its time before so many movies similar to this one (many also inspired by this one) were made.The acting in this movie is great and so is the music.The plot falls a bit dry nowadays and is kind of predictable, which is kind of standard to old movies that were considered revolutionary at the time.The idea for the movie was great and while it sure is worth a watch it was incredibly outdone by others along the years to come.I tried to make this as spoiler free as I could but I hope I still managed to get my opinion on it across.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

No.,"The film contains so much quality detail and substance that not nearly enough attention was paid to giving it even a little bit of sense-making ground on which to follow it. The result was a fat load of amazing content portrayed disastrously in a sequence of craziness after craziness. It's not clever or thought-provoking, it's one of those films that doesn't make sense and thus leaves a lot us thinking it's clever, it's different, inspiring somehow. No. Awful, awful film.The four stars, however, go to the cast's supreme acting, and the last few scenes of the film when it finally gains the only tract it was going to across the entire duration of the film.Summarised, watch if like me you feel it necessary to have watched something so critically acclaimed and known, but don't expect any sense of it and above all try not to be fooled into thinking it's a 'clever' or 'thought-provoking' film.

I'm in Insurance,"A deadly virus that is released into the world forcing the humans to live under ground, and the animals to rule the surface. With the pandemic going on in the world today. I decided to take a look back at 12 Monkeys and see if it stands the test of time. Boy am I glad I did.12 Monkeys is a great movie it's a little bit dated but it has great performances from Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. You can really see director Terry Gilliam's style in it. Probably my favorite of Gilliam's movies.Set in a future where humanity had to abandon the surface of the planet because a virus was released killing off humans and saving the animals. Bruce Willis's character is forced to go back into the past and try to stop the terror group the 12 Monkey's before they release the virus. This movie is brilliant in the way that it handles the story, lots of twists and suspense. I won't say anything else because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it. This is a definite must watch just for the performances of Willis and Pitt.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A breathtaking feast of visuals and uncertainties,"One of the most appealing elements of a Gilliam film is that the well-concocted visuals, the unsettling backdrops, and the manically frustrated characters are evidence of the creator's involvement. Instead of most movies (where the filmmaker is some director-for-hire that is paid to feature a star or two), you can feel Terry Gilliam's presence through the experience. ""12 Monkeys"" is evidence of Gilliam's own vision and style, as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake. ""12 Monkeys"" is a variation on similar themes of Gilliam's repertoire:oppressive/recessive societies, the solitude of the protagonist, the frustration associated with disbelief, and parallel realms. In this film Gilliam does a fine job of blurring lines between the two realms, using ambiguities to force the audience to believe rather than know. This tendency for Gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of art-house pretentiousness. The difference between Gilliam and artsy posers is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning. The two nearly identical bathing scenes of Cole in the beginning are meant to draw comparisons which leave the audience unsettled. His bald head is a mark of uniformity in the disease-ridden future world, yet makes him recognizable in the 1996 world. The title itself is a mark of Gilliam's creativity, as it requires the majority of the story to flesh out for its meaning to be fully understood. All in all, Gilliam's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch yet also require thought and interpretation from the audience. The film has immense re-watch value, since there are subtle details and hints that can be missed upon the first viewing. Definitely one of my favorites.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An Interesting Watch,"Twelve Monkeys are an interesting watch. I had low expectations for this movie but surprisingly I was above my expectations. I enjoyed the movie.The story was good, the screenplay was good, the direction and the performances were also good. The story building was nicely executed and the thrill and suspense elements were nicely embedded in it. One thing that made this story different was that it was not thay regular type of story where you will find hero winning or a happy ending.

Brad Pitt Is Insane!,"This may be the worst headline for a review I've done yet, but screw it!

However that is based on all th either time travel films I've seen and this movie is still good! Brad Pitt absolutely kills it in this role, the same year he starred in Se7en so that is really saying something. It was fun to theorize at some plot points and it was nice to see others were thinking the same things as me, meaning I wasn't as lost as I thought I may be by the end.

Very intelligent movie that will keep you thinking...,"Twelve monkeys is a very good movie that keeps you right on the edge of your seat and thinking because this is not a plain good old action ordinary action flick.The story is very consistent and tight throughout the movie because the actors do not start talking about other irrelevant, unimportant things. Another thing about this movie is that if you miss a small bit, it will translate into missing a lot so you really need to pay a lot of attention.I do not want to tell you much about what happens during the movie because I think it will spoil the brilliance, but I will tell you that the acting is very good, especially Madeline Stowe. Brad Pitt was also good as a maniacal scientist.Definitely one of the best Sci fi movies out there and from my side, I highly recommend, but pay close attention because this is a movie in which every single scene is connected to another.Overall, twelve monkeys is a very good movie that is something different and the director does a good job in pulling it off.

The Future is History,"This film is about a volunteer, James Cole, has been chosen to go back in 1996 to gather information about the origin of the epidemic that wiped out 5 billion people, which he was told was spread by the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

Bruce Willis', Madeline Stowe's, and Brad Pitt's performance was all great. I even thought this was Brad Pitt's best performance, since it's so weird, could earn him an Oscar nomination.This film is not like most sci-fi films. There's not CGI nor many action, since it's such a low budget. Don't expect guns and bombs in this movie. This film is very imaginative, as always by Terry Gilliam. It's very different.This film is not a master piece but just an enjoyable work. There's nothing special about this film. It's smart and compelling.

I'm insane and you're my insanity *deranged giggle,"12 monkeys was such a surprise. Bruce's best performance to date, outstanding screenplay, perfect sets, original foreboding score, impressive acting from all, hilarious dark humor, a well conceived and a captivating plot characterize this sci-fi flick.I'm struck by Bruce's performance especially. Not playing his usual wise cracking, generic, tough guy character but a totally grounded and deeply developed man given the most strenuous task of solving a time bending mystery. This mission of his requires him to cross via several ' dimensions ' slowly wearing him out and making him dubious of what's real or what's a delusion. Bruce played his character to consummate mastery. He perfected being mission focused, scared, confused, protective, hopeless and all the emoting the script asked of him. Very much a fantastic performance from him.The story pulls you in and captures you with the mystery of the source of the said virus ( that is if James isn't mentally divergent and didn't make everything up ). Who's responsible for almost wiping out the human race? Lots of misdirections, foreshadowing, twists and turns in the story. Not a single dialogue is a waste. One has to follow every line and scene to fully understand the finale.I loved the dark humor too. Was laughing my ass off from Brad Pitt's performance and the black humor all over. Everything was gritty, realistic and sometimes too dark but that's how life is. 12 monkeys was an achievement. A well thought out, entertainingly and smartly written, excellently performed sci-fi with a beautiful ending.Also loved the fact this movie acknowledges past events can't be undone and only thing a time traveler can do is learn from history and better his own future. Anything more he tries to do would just be an already inscribed record and he just might even end up being the sole reason for the unwavering scenario to happen. One simply cannot change the past but learn from it. Most sci-fis these days botch this simple concept, however 12 monkeys recognized it. A 10 for me. Love this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

His adventure brings up questions immortal and illusory, quoting Revelations in a chilling allegory with vivid symobolism paralleling his paradoxical existence.

I would love to see him adapt something by Philip K. Dick,"Without a doubt one of Gilliam finest moments. A perfect vehicle for him, although he did not write it himself. He manages to inject it with his own trademark quirkiness and idiosyncrasies without losing focus, as he have done in the past. Here he has, as in Fisher King, a strong script to work from. He is utterly unlike any other director out there, balancing the melancholy drama and black comedy elements with great skill. I remember being blown away by the first scene with Brad, what a total transformation! I hardly recognized him, and to be able to do what he does here is a sign of a serious hard-working actor. The intricate story lends itself well to multiple viewings, and I have returned to this film many times since 1996, and I probably will continue to do so. The score is also remarkably original for a Hollywood production. At first Piazollas accordion may seem to be a too bold a move, but it soon becomes clear that it works beautifully. The rest of Paul Buckmasters score is also right on the money. Now I would love to see Gilliam adapt something by Philip K. Dick. In retrospect, this is one of the top ten movies of the nineties, and continues to be high on my all-time top ten SF movie-list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"What is sane, what is insane and who is to judge?","""12 Monkeys"" is inspired by ""La Jetée"" (1962, Chris Marker), a short movie of 28 minutes consisting mainly of a collection of stills.Its main themes are:outbreak of a deadly virus;
time travelling;
psychiatry, what is normal and what is crazy?1995 was a good year for films about viruses. Apart from ""12 Monkeys"" also ""Outbreak"" (Wolfgang Petersen) was released. In ""12 Monkeys"" the outbreak of the virus and the dystopian future it produces is however not the main theme of the film but more the motivation behind the time travelling.Time travelling leads to all sorts of paradoxes. One of the most beautiful of which is in my opinion still the one in ""Back to the future"" (1985, Robert Zemeckis). A boy travels into the past, meets his mother as a teenager, his mother falls in love with him and the boy must do his utmost to match-make between his father and his mother because otherwise he wouldn't be born. In ""back to the future the main character travels back to a time before he was born, in ""12 Monkeys"" the main character travels back to a time after he was born. This gives rise to another paradox: meeting yourself.Still I don't believe playing with time travel paradoxes is the essence of the film. I would like to call attention to another aspect. When the main character arrives in his past he is making strange statements in the ears of the other characters, his past is their present. They think his is crazy and put him in a madhouse. With the passage of time there occurs a remarkable change of roles. The main character, staying amidst of psychiatric patients all the time begins to think that maybe he is crazy after all and only imagines himself the time travel stuff. The treating psychiatrist on the other hand, noting that some of the strange statements of the main character are coming true, begins to doubt more and more about his mental state.For me this is the essence of the film.

Terry Gilliam's Take on the Future,"""5 billion people will die from a deadly virus in 1997...the survivors will abandon the surface of the planet...once again the animals will rule the world."" Thus with these words, Twelve Monkeys (1995) begins its opening credits. It's an ominous prologue for an ambiguous yet amazing movie brought into the world by writers David and Janet Peoples and molded into a tangible and indelible entity by director Terry Gilliam. Yet to say Twelve Monkeys is a tale about a dystopian future would be an understatement.Twelve Monkeys begins with our hero James Cole (Bruce Willis) waking up from a reoccurring dream, seemingly placed in a prison of sorts against his will. His is to be volunteered for a mission on the surface of the earth. He is then informed by a group of scientists that they have the ability to time travel and can go back to the events preceding the deadly virus that wipes out most of humanity. They want him to go back and gather information on a group of radicals known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys; perhaps bring back a sample of the virus in its original form before it mutated. Thus Cole goes through quite an odyssey bouncing back and forth through time to connect the dots.﻿﻿The film co-stars Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt who along with Willis bring their incredible acting abilities to the table. Much hubbub has been made about Pitts performance as the comically deranged Jeffrey Goines and by all means he certainly deserved his supporting actor nomination. However Willis's frailty and uneasy confusion is a real sight to see when you consider that no one besides Gilliam and M. Night Shymalans has thought to put him in anything other than pulpy action thrillers. His character is our assumed surrogate for our feelings and as his mind slowly breaks apart before us we start to mistrust his judgment and even his sanity. They say that the insane don't know they're insane. From their perspective everything they see or do is rational and normal. But in Cole's case, he looses his grip on reality when he declares himself insane.By the midpoint of the film Madeleine Stowe's character psychologist Kathryn Railly becomes our sympathetic inference but near the end we even start to lose her in the ether. Insanity is a very relative term and while giving its audience a very stylistic yet conceivable image of apocalypse, Twelve Monkeys forces us not only to question the rational of the characters but our own sanity as well. It's a theme that director Terry Gilliam has explored in nearly all of his films, the nature of insanity within our society. While his earlier films such as Time Bandits (1981) and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988) had a much more hopeful viewpoint on delusion, his later films, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), Tideland (2005) and Twelve Monkeys are much more fatalistic.Fatalistic yet brilliantly envisaged. For like Gilliam's magnum opus Brazil (1985), Twelve Monkeys can be interpreted in multiple ways. In the film, Cole speaks while watching Vertigo (1958), ""The movie never changes, it can't change but every time you see it, it seems different because you're different."" During test screenings, Twelve Monkeys got mixed marks echoing Cole's sentiment. Is Twelve Monkeys an easily defined genre movie? No. Can it be seen as a time-travel picture? No. Can I conclusively confirm the film is about insanity at all? No. Yet it works and works well.I close my review with part of a Persian poem that I think captures the depth and enigmatical aura of Terry Gilliam's triumph:Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare; To-morrow's Silence, Triumph, or Despair: Drink! for you know not whence you came, nor why: Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where. -74th Quatrain of the Rubaiyat by Omar Khayyamhttp://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A Film For All!,"Inspired by the French short film 'La Jetée', '12 Monkeys', directed by Terry Gilliam, is a film that belongs to all. It gives birth to an idea, a virus, that will appeal to all. But the only problem is.... I don't know how many would really understand this one? I mostly did, and I must say... I enjoyed myself!'12 Monkeys' is an epidemic call for us. Human-Kind is getting wiped out by a virus. The remaining left have gone nuts. Now add a Hero, a Heroine, supporting characters and a conniving villain. And here it is... you've successfully entered this mad-mad-mad world.'12 Monkeys' begins with a BANG. The entire 1st hour, is amongst the best I've seen from the 90's. It's that good. But, the second hour plays a spoilsport. The goings get confusing, and the culmination is the weakest link. It may be damn new in terms of ending a story, but I somehow, couldn't grasp it.Terry Gilliam's direction is first-class. The screenplay is generally superb, but gets confused mid-way. Music by Paul Buckmaster, is haunting. Roger Pratt's Camera-Work is worth a mention.In the acting department, Bruce Willis is good. Brad Pitt is the show-stealer. The star-actor is superb in a role that is very difficult to execute. Madeleine Stowe is another topper. She's in terrific form.

Excellent,A really great movie.  The performances are uniformly magnificent.  Bruce Willis surprised me at James Cole.  I cannot imagine anyone else in this role.  He's perfect in his use of body language and in how he modulates his voice.  He manages to appear dangerous and extremely vulnerable and damaged at the same time.  The plot is engaging particularly once you begin to believe that Cole might really be insane and this is all part of his delusion.

MY REVIEW: The Time Travel Mystery,"Don't go by the title, it's not about animals. It's a pure science fiction based on the concept of time travel. The idea here is complex and even execution does not try to make it simpler for you. You need to provide your full attention to it in order to understand the sequence of events and correlate them to unsolve the mystery. The lead actors Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe play their part with perfection but it is Brad Pitt who steals the show with his portrayal of a maniac. The screenplay is water tight and background score is first-rate. There are lots of interesting conversations over understanding of human psyche.

"Trippy, weird, and massive-just WOW.","""Twelve Monkeys"" is the kind of film that plays mind tricks-which, also is part of the plot of the film. It is cerebral and a story about time-travel in a goal to stop a plague that is about to exterminate billions of people. Everything starts to shuffle as Bruce Willis' character, James, dives into a series of events that prevents him from reaching his goal. Will he ever make it back to his own time? Will he reach his end by then? Is nothing real? What is real?This film is ahead of its time and manages to pull off some strings here and there; making it possible to be entertaining while also being puzzling. It is a film that makes you question what is reality and a film that is vastly misunderstood for its advanced knowledge.

I can predict often, but never to the degree with this movie. I mean -- I felt as if I had written the script. I still thought the plot was brilliant, I just identified so much with Pitt's character that I knew where the movie would be going.

Like ""Kpax"" the ""hero"" (Bruce Willis) is thought insane, so much so that he begins to doubt his own sanity. He is from the future but has no gadgets and arrives almost naked. He is yanked back and forth through time and is ""volunteered"" to try and stop a madman from releasing a plague that destroys 90% of the Earth's population.

Monkey puzzle,"James Cole is a prisoner in the year 2035; he is offered a deal; go back to the year 1996 to gain as much information about a man-made virus which wiped out the majority of the population in that same year in exchange Cole will be paroled if successful. However, Cole is mistakenly sent back to 1990 and when he tries to explain what he is doing there, he is institutionalised, escapes and becomes a wanted man. Returning again to 1996, he befriends psychiatrist Dr Railly and the pair find themselves in a race-against-time chase to stop the virus being released before it's too late...Gilliam is well-known for his quirky off-the-wall narratives and more often than not his films can be something of a head-scratcher... I sometimes wonder if even Terry Gilliam himself understands all of his films....Having said that, what 12 monkeys has which very much works in its favour is movement and energy and a story that engages. It's one of those films that is very much like a jigsaw-puzzle whereby every scene, every moment of time-travel and every character interaction adds a piece to the puzzle. Speaking of jigsaw puzzles I think that is the best way to describe a lot of Gilliam's films; in that all the pieces are there, but it's up to you to put them all in the correct place.The film benefits from a few talented players on board who all combine well to compliment the engaging narrative; first and foremost we have to begin with Brad Pitt (he was a lot of fun and actually managed to convince in his role as a crazed asylum patient). This was a role that was very much against type for Pitt at the time and a brave call to cast him in such a role, but for me the risk paid off. Willis is forced to play things much straighter, but still has several strong moments. Madeleine Stowe is a bit mousey in the first half, but really comes in to her own in the second half delivering an excellent performance. Plummer isn't given much to do in what was little more than a glorified cameo.This is a Terry Gilliam film so expect to be slightly confused and expect for it not to entirely make sense (I believe Gilliam sometimes does these things on purpose). It has a good story, good performances and as I say Brad Pitt is electrifying.DISHONOURABLE MENTION: All those unnecessary ass shots. The scars may be with me for some time!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Brilliantly Disorienting,"This certainly isn't your average, run of the mill movie about time travel. It's a confusing and disorienting story that left me at least guessing for much of its run time about what actually was reality. The performance from Bruce Willis was wonderful. As James Cole, he plays a prisoner in a nightmar-ish future earth, where most of humanity has been wiped out by a virus, and the remainder have had to retreat underground. Cole is chosen to go back into the past to the point just before the plague erupted, not to prevent it - because you can't prevent what's already happened - but to bring a sample of the virus back to his time.Willis did a marvellous job with this character. He is himself disoriented from the start (time travel isn't as easy as some movies make it out to be) and, making no sense to anyone he speaks to, he finds himself locked up in a mental institution.It's in the mental institution that we meet the other two central characters: Dr. Raillis (Madeleine Stowe), who starts with the assumption that Cole is insane but gradually comes to believe his story, and Brad Pitt as Jeffrey Goines, the unbalanced son of a famous scientist who's central to how the virus is released.What I really liked about this movie is that almost to the end, as a viewer I had some doubts about Cole: was he really from the future or was he delusional. That's finally answered, but it took a while and it was fun to speculate.It's a well done movie, often chaotic and confusing and disorienting, which was actually a good way of getting the viewer into the head of Cole, who must have been feeling exactly the same way.

Still an excellent and clever science fiction thriller over 25 years later,"Terry Gilliam's science fiction thriller 12 Monkeys, based on the 1962 French short film La Jetée, is still an excellent movie over 25 years later. Bruce Willis leads a great cast including Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt in an amazing performance, with Christopher Plummer and David Morse in supporting roles.The year is 2035 and the world has almost been decimated following a plague which has wiped out a majority of the human race and the survivors are now living underground while the animal population roams free above ground. Violent criminal James Cole (Bruce Willis) is selected by scientists while imprisoned as a ""volunteer"" to travel back in time from a post apocalyptic 2035 to 1996 to find out the origins of the virus and to prevent its release by the ""Army of the 12 Monkeys"".Cole is accidentially transported back to 1990 where he finds himself imprisoned in a mental institution in Philadelphia where he meets Dr Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe) who senses that there is more to his backstory. Cole also meets fellow patient Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt in an Academy Award nominated performance) who is the mentally disturbed son of famous environmental scientist Dr Goines (Christopher Plummer). Cole returns to 2035 to report his findings and is again sent back in time to 1996 although once again he accidentially arrives in 1914 in the middle of a World War 1 battlefield. He finally lands in Philadelphia in 1996 where he finds Jeffrey Goines is part of a group of animal rights activists and the virus is still under threat of being released by scientists led by Dr Peters (David Morse). Cole also reunites with Railly who becomes an ally in his quest to stop the virus from spreading.Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career, not reverting to his heroic trademarks and quips in movies such as Die Hard and The Last Boy Scout, and instead portraying Cole as a simple, tragic and vulnerable character. Equally good is Madeline Stowe as Dr Railly who later becomes an ally to Cole. Brad Pitt steals every scene with an off-the-wall performance that earned him an well deserved Academy Award nomination.12 Monkeys is an excellent and clever movie with a number of mind bending twists. A critical and commercial success at the box office, it is still held in high regard as one of the best science fiction movies of the 1990s.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A sci-fi time travel film presented in a quintessentially Gilliam style !!!,"'Twelve Monkeys' is a sci-fi thriller directed by Terry Gilliam. It is based on the French sci-fi featurette 'La Jetée'. It stars Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt. Time travel is the basis of a major section of the literal storyline. After a virus wipes out 5 billion people in 1997, the remaining human population is forced to abandon the surface of the earth and somehow survive underground, while the animals reclaim control of the surface of the planet. Bruce Willis' character James Cole is picked as a volunteer who is going to be put in a time machine so that he can go back in time so that he can acquire some information about the virus at its unmutated state which would help the scientists in the present to come up with a cure. We are informed that a group named the 'Twelve Monkeys' was behind the spread of this virus in the first place.The script by David and Janet Peoples which is based on Chris Marker's script for 'La Jetée' is brilliantly written. The beauty of the screenplay lies in its versatility and with Terry Gilliam's visual flair and bravura, the film elevates to the next level. There can be various interpretations for the film. I think Gilliam's style of storytelling actually provokes varied interpretations. There are red herrings, there are subtle hints and there are unanswered questions. This can be seen as a straight up sci-fi film set in a dystopian future with the phenomenon of time travel in it. The concept of whether time and history can be altered or not plays a big part. However it can also be seen as a film about trauma and reality-escapism. Everyone knows that Terry Gilliam is one of the champions of standing up against the mechanical and overly commercialised treatment of the art form of cinema by the big studios and this discontentment and anger is present in the film. Gilliam clearly again makes subtle commentary about the ill-effects of uncontrolled capitalism. We see people make monologues about the materialistic life, the exposure to commercials,etc. Cruelty towards animals is another topic that is addressed which subtly refers to the repression of the poor by the rich.The film is another example of Terry Gilliam's visual bravura. Just by looking at the dystopian future presented in the film, a viewer would know that this has been made by Gilliam. The look of the film really reminded me of Blade Runner and it has a cyberpunk-esque vibe to it. The film looks bleak and almost dirty, but very intentionally so. The music composed by Paul Buckmaster is beautiful too.When it comes to the acting, I think this is my favourite performance by Bruce Willis. This was back in the day when Willis actually cared about playing a character rather than himself in every film. He really goes for it here and shows range. He is terrifying, he is weird and at times he exudes child-like innocence(which is important in the context of the film). Madeleine Stowe is also very good. She actually has a tough job of playing the most 'normal' character in the film while all hell is breaking loose around her. Brad Pitt is a dynamite in the film. He has to be admired for deciding to play a character like this at a stage in his career when he could have easily used his looks and played generic characters in romantic comedies. He thoroughly deserved the Oscar nomination.'Twelve Monkeys' is a philosophical sci-fi film that leaves the door open for varied interpretations. The acting is great, Gilliam's style and attention to detail is meticulous. This film has to watched and then re-watched to fully admire its brilliance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The plot is excellent; it succeeds in involving the audience in the post-apocalyptic experience.

"For any genre fan, Twelve Monkeys is definitive.","Following years of turmoil flirting with the Hollywood studio system, Brazil director Terry Gilliam signed on to Twelve Monkeys walking a fine line with Universal, the studio which had sabotaged Brazil by way of significant cuts and alterations in the face of its questionable financial potential. Twelve Monkeys presented a similar occupational hazard for Gilliam, who determined to meet the studio's non-negotiable stipulations of a twenty-nine million dollar budget, an R rating and a maximum two-hour fifteen minute runtime in exchange for final cut privilege. While these factors may have appeared to be a combination destined to compromise creative vision, Gilliam delivered the film - which he believed 'may or may not be a European art film' - to Universal as a stunning example of how mid-budget filmmaking can lead to innovative stories and an equally innovative way of telling them.Gilliam and his production crew achieve a great deal with what was a considerably low budget for a science fiction film in the nineties. While stars such as Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt are notable investments, they inhabit a convincing apocalyptic world where humanity has retreated underground following the global spread of a killer virus. From here, Willis' prisoner James Cole is sent back in time with a mission to find the original sample of the virus in exchange for a reduced sentence. Twelve Monkeys' atmosphere and energy derives not from sleek, shiny technologies and CGI monitors, but literal repurposed junk and an imagination capable of transforming an abandoned power station of a film set into a primitive time machine. In an age where two-hundred million dollars buys shot after shot of soulless, empty imagery, Twelve Monkeys creates tangible, fascinating environments on a relative shoestring.Such creativity extends to the story, a tightly-woven and double-knotted plot which embraces the ambiguity of the theoretical science it uses as its driving force. Gilliam's time travel delves into the implications of determinism and free will, and marries it beautifully with a question of the nature of reality to create a conclusion that is immediately thought provoking, endlessly captivating and demands repeated viewings. Bruce Willis showcases his movie star appeal at the peak of his career, but his chemistry with Madeleine Stowe - an actress with leading lady charisma in her own right - creates a haunting love story which grounds viewers as the temporal displacement grows ever more convoluted.Twelve Monkeys is a gem of a film which this writer wishes they had discovered a lot sooner, wherein Gilliam takes a staple of the science fiction genre and lovingly transcends it to the classic, placing it firmly in the upper echelon of the time-travel fiction pantheon. For any genre fan, it is definitive.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

An outstanding job of acting by both Willis and Pitt!,"I found this movie interesting and entertaining. Synopsis: The movie setting is in 4 different times, 1916, 1990, 1996, and an undetermined future date. As the movie frequently flips back and forth between the different dates some may be challenged by or dislike the hard to follow instantaneously changing time confusion... I believe that you can see that this movie is one part 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and two parts 'Terminator'. A virus kills 99% of mankind in 1996 and the remaining 1% lives underground to avoid the deadly virus. Bruce Willis is a convicted criminal in a future time where scientists have developed the ability to travel back in time (Though not an exact science...). Willis 'volunteers' to go back in time to help scientists obtain an unmutated strain of the virus to try to develop a way to counter the virus so man can return to the surface of the earth. A technical glitch sends Willis back to 1990, not 1996 as planned, and with his limited interpersonal skills sets is deemed 'crazy' by authorities in 1990 and they put him in a 'nut house' where he meets Pitt, who is truly crazy.

"Another germ, from the monkeys behind this film","This ""plot"" verges on incomprehensibility, but is not brilliantly complex.

When I watched the scientists from the future who force convicts into ""volunteering"" for deadly assignments break out into a chorus of ""I found my thrill on blueberry hill"" to Willis when he comes back from yet another time trek, all I could think about were all the morons who actually like to watch stuff like that. What time travel, the psychiatric world, and animals rights activists have in common is unexplained from start to end and each of these themes aren't explored and converged to produce anything stimulating. What's more is that nobody on this site or elsewhere can seem to explain that, or at least give a thoughtful, provocative, or at least more than superficial analysis of why this movie is any good. They're all the mindless sputtering clichés like, ""what a masterpiece!,"" ""Gilliam is a genius!,"" Brad Pitt is brilliant!"" I did notice quite a few people who wrote that like many of Gilliam's films, this movie is actually more enjoyable to watch the second or third time around. Well, so are Freddy Got Fingered and Episode I, so I'd have to say this film is in good company.

"A post-pandemic psychological pretzel starring Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt.","This is one of my favorite movies. I saw it on the big screen twice and about 50 times on DVD. Each time, my appreciation for the script, editing, direction and acting continues to grow.It is an amazing drama, rich in layers and dark humor.On the big screen, the story was so overlaid with complexity that I missed it entirely. I went back the second time to find clues to the storyline. The post-apocalyptic vision and Cole's psychological conundrum are so entwined with time travel that the story cannot be evident on the first viewing. It helps to enter the world a few times to wear the skin of the main character.Gilliam has undertaken to tell an amazing story, but he asks his viewer to be a partner in the telling. His Monty Python sketches were that way, too, with the humor lying somewhere beneath the surface, inviting you to go down the rabbit hole with Alice.On the big screen, I was entertained by Brad Pitt, who is sometimes hilarious, but his antics caused me to overlook Bruce Willis, who plays the perfectly sane straight man forced to question his own sanity in a perplexing situation. Even without the problem of a world-killing pandemic, all of us should be able to identify with the problem of the central character. James Cole's psychological overlay adds a lot to the telling of the story.In lesser hands, 12 Monkeys dystopian vision would be just another piece of pulp science fiction. The psychological dimension enriches the deeper mysteries and gives the film ""legs.""Today's headlines warn of an impending world-wide pandemic. England is preparing for 50,000 fatalities, and most other countries are groping for some way to head off a major world-wide catastrophe. In light of our reality, 12 Monkeys' post- apocalyptic vision strikes a cord each time I see it.If we are tiptoeing along a similar precipice, we should get it right... we don't have the luxury of time travel to fix the problem.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Terry Gilliam's other masterpiece,"Terry Gilliam excels at portraying a world gone mad. That much is clear from a single viewing of either 12 Monkeys or Brazil. What 12 Monkeys has that Brazil does not is a little more experience and expertise. By contrasting the maddest kind of future with an equally mad past, Gilliam creates a nightmarish science fiction world where contrast is the meat in one very odd sandwich. For Gilliam, it is one of many masterpieces. For lead actors Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, it was the turning point in careers of varying prestige. Although Pitt had yet to truly make a splash as the darker half of a strange personality in Fight Club, Willis had literally turned portraying the vulnerable, less than superhuman hero into an art form some seven years previous in Die Hard. Both have since gone onto bigger, although not necessarily better, things. Willis is asking the sky for a fourth Die Hard film, and Pitt made no less than twenty million dollars for his most recent film. Neither of them could have achieved that without this film.What makes 12 Monkeys especially stand out in their careers is that it refuses to follow a conventional storyline. While it does have the tragic heroine thing all through the main story, it evolves in a manner rarely seen in Hollywood. Madeleine Stowe proves herself in a role that must have taken quite a toll on her physically and emotionally. Her disbelief at the start of the film and her growing sense of belief in Willis' story towards the end is very palpable. Brad Pitt manages to feign a kind of insanity in a very convincing manner. The moment where he feigns being cross-eyed as he enters a room is frightening. But the real star of this show is the story, which links together fragments from alternating periods of both the past (our past, that is) and the future in a manner that gives the film a great sense of economy. There is nothing redundant in 12 Monkeys, just a plot that leaves the viewer gobsmacked at the end.If there is a weakness in 12 Monkeys, it is in the scenes of the future. Borrowing heavily from the playbook he used in Brazil, Gilliam builds a future where scientists coerce cooperation from prisoners, often by drowning them in visual and audio stimulus. I doubt that Gilliam's intent was to paint scientists as a cruel, evil mob. Perhaps he tried to contrast the scientists with Stowe's compassionate doctor, but the Monty Python-style acting of the future scientists does get on the nerves. Christopher Meloni sticks his head in as a police lieutenant who delivers one of the best gags in the film. It is the one that, in fact, makes a convert out of Stowe's character. This way of linking the past with the future as her character spraypaints a message onto a wall as Pitt spouts out a theory about how she could know what he is up to becomes one of the classic moments in cinema. I will not speak of the film's ending, but when you see it, you will be amazed by the continuity links. This is one tightly put-together film.Paul Buckmaster creates an original, timeless score that punctuates the wild mood swings Willis' character endures. As Willis acts out the questioning of his own sanity, a desire to be what he calls ""well"", and eventually his acceptance of a patently impossible situation, Buckmaster's score delivers a suitably downbeat punctuation. The music is part of what makes the misery of the situation so tangible. As Willis recites the last half of Stowe's message to the future, the music turns the action into a ghost story. The real kicker is the string and accordion theme when the army of the Twelve Monkeys appears perfectly conveys the sheer nuttiness of its leader. Many of the people who have changed our world, for better or worse, were very much mentally divergent, as the film puts it. Einstein, for example, is believed to have been a sufferer of Asperger's Syndrome. Pitt's character, a real sod by the name of Jeffrey Goines, will never be as loved as Einstein, but Pitt does manage to inject some Einsteinian quirks into the character. In spite of the fact that 1996 is now the past, the scenario depicted seems more believable than ever.I gave 12 Monkeys a nine out of ten. I am still in two minds as to whether it or Brazil is Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. Either way, it is worthy of watching at least once. If you enjoy science fiction without the need for an uplifting message, then this film has a good chance with you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Wondrous preacher of time travelling mayhem,"Terminator, Donnie Darko and Bill and Ted's excellent adventure have all debated the mystic art of travelling to and from collective points in time. Throughout this wonderfully colourful and exuberant picture Gilliam contests the implications of time travel and how it affects society.Bruce Willis is the time traveller as he is sent from the future to suss out the beginning of the end for humanity. This complex ideology provokes meaning of health, disease in the face of humans and animals and strikes a provocative note for the way the world is being run. 14 years since its release and issues with animal testing and time travel are still present in our world and with this being a good preacher, alerting us to the environment's dangers; this is also a timeless picture, easily watchable again and again.Like Donnie Darko you will need to watch it over and over to fully comprehend the hidden messages. The climax is heavily debated and open to many depictions. This is a very good picture owing to its preaching ideologies and masterful open situations.However there are a few issues to be debated. For one the ending whilst brilliantly open still leaves a massive weight to be decided. There is an overload of characters with not a strong depiction on many except the central three. Though you will want to watch it again the first viewing gives the viewer an awful lot to deal with but it is certainly worth it come the finale.Willis is good as the central protagonist keeping a clever restraint on his character's emotions whilst Brad Pitt's elaborately provocative protagonist excels in being mentally unstable but with a hidden agenda that adds delicious mystery and tension at all the right places. His Oscar nomination fully deserved.Gilliam, a master of the unusual, brings his elaborate styling to this picture with the future depicted as cellmate survivors chosen to go into the past and the guard ruling from high chairs. The selection process is wonderfully weird with Cole's brief future stint on the earth's surface exceptionally breathtaking. This particular scene marks the picture's cinematography highlight with the snow and the lion placing the picture right into its main point, the future. There are occasional over steps, such as the weird ball shaped object Cole looks into before travelling in time and the section in the war seemed a bit unnecessary.Whilst there are minor slip ups this is a wonderfully imaginative picture that excels on its issues of real life and the climate we live in. Gilliam shines with profound imagination with the story revolving and turning till the excellent end scene.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

This didn't age well...not an 8/10 in the year 2022...,Just watched this film and feel as though I've completely wasted 2 hours of my life.

Visually stunning,"A post-apocalyptic future gets the ""Gilliam"" treatment - and it's visually stunning! But is this future real ? - or is it the psychotic imagining of mental patient, James Cole (Bruce Willis). That is one of the delightful conundrums of the film, and it is not resolved until near the end (it IS resolved, despite some idiotic postings on IMDB suggesting otherwise).Don't dismiss the film simply because of Bruce Willis' name on the cast list - he is far less annoying in this film than in every other film that I've seen him in. Likewise, Brad Pitt's atypical role is thoroughly entertaining.Even after many viewings (about 7 in my case), the themes of madness and fate, and the `monkey' motif stand up strongly.

2nd worst movie of all time,"After Pleasantville, this is the worst movie I have ever seen.  It is entirely pretentious, dull and stupid.  The movie proceeds at a snails pace leading towards an absurdly obvious climax that has been telegraphed for the entire movie utilizing a flash back/flash forward technique copied from other movies.  We get to see snippets of something that hasn't yet happened, or perhaps it has, and we are supposed to play the art of dutiful detective and figure out what it all means.  The creators of the film would have you believe this is a cerebral tour de force, an intellectual masterpiece, a thinking man's buck rogers.  And they try desperately to make it a smart movie.  A cryptic plot can be interesting.  But this movie is deliberately cryptic and convoluted - it tries to elevate itself to an intellectual plane far out of it's reach.  This movie is not another 2001,...it's a 2001 minus 2001.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Terry Gilliam strikes gold,"Terry Gilliam has always been one of the most unique directors working in cinema. Originally of Monty Python fame, he moved on to direct his own feature films. He's known for his elaborate sets, crazy props, odd camera angles and his many, many, many fixations.So, when I say that I find this particular film, 12 Monkeys, to be his most mainstream film, keep in mind that it's still way out there. This film is an experience for all senses.The story goes that humanity has pretty much gone underground in the future, after an event known as the Army of 12 Monkeys happened and wiped out most of us with a virus. Both now some of our remaining scientists have cracked time travel and are about to send a man into the past to find a cure for this virus. The man chosen for this is a convict named James Cole, brilliantly played by Bruce Willis.12 Monkeys has a well-earned reputation as one of the better time travel movies out there. And for a good reason. To explain exactly why would involve heavy spoilers, but suffice to say that I really admire the cohesion the film has in regards to the time travel paradox. The ending is a beauty.Plus, it's a crazy-looking blast of oddball characters, highly memorable conversations, great acting moments and it's also a decent enough love story. After a fashion.Great movie. Surprisingly easy to follow, given that it was directed by Gilliam and involves heavy time travel elements, but it is what it is. Hadn't seen this in a while and was pleasantly surprised just how good it was. Recommended for each and all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One clever movie,"Quite an impressive work by Terry Gilliam, and that's a nice change after all the mind-twisting numbness of Brazil.12 Monkeys has a brilliantly constructed plot about the destruction of mankind by a virus, but I won't go into the plot details here. Bruce Willis gave one of the best performances in his life, but I don't agree with the majority of people about Brad Pitt's acting. He is quite distracting and a bit exaggerated, but obviously he's having a time of his life playing a nutty character.The best moment is when the character is in the theatre, feeling a sense of deja vu, that he is somewhat re-living a phase of his memory. That scene became genuinely creepy when Hitchcock's Vertigo is playing in the background.For those of you who struggled with Brazil (watched it several times already) 12 Monkeys is more fun and comprehensible, but by no means I'm suggesting that the movie itself is simple-minded. If there is any criticism, I'll say that the ending is just isn't satisfying enough. After all the twists and thrill, one would expect an equally, if not more, startling ending. But it ended in a way like someone has walked around in a circle.Highly recommended viewing!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good,Twelve Monkeys keeps you wondering throughout.

"As complex as they come, but ultimately rewarding","This is a film which does not pretend to be simple, nor does it try to be straight forward, but stick with it to the end and it is ultimately a pretty satisfying ride, even if certain illogicalities serve to baffle.This Terry Gilliam effort is a slightly apocalyptic tale of the future, with mankind's majority having been wiped out by some kind of virus. Now underground where the air is breathable, our future selves have developed time travel it seems, and wish to use it to send volunteers back in time in order to somehow figure out how the virus broke out and use that knowledge to escape the confines of their enforced prison.The always highly personable Bruce Willis is James Cole, one of said volunteers in this future time. He goes back in time but ends up in 1990. Suffice to say his mission to find '12 Monkeys', which seems to be some kind of army responsible for the problems mankind now suffers, goes very wrong and the rest of the film is a convoluted story which requires a good level of concerted concentration from the viewer.Without question this is a demanding picture. The plot and direction are rich with subtleties and vast amounts of information, and you need to be on your toes to make sense of it all. The biggest problem with it on a technical level is much of the dialogue is viciously mumbled or delivered way too quickly. Lots of it simply passes you by, particularly Brad Pitt's over imposing Jeffrey and his rapid fire diatribe. Willis' Cole doesn't suffer this so badly, fortunately, but the overall audio quality perhaps lacks at times and the clarity of dialogue could be better.The actual performances are generally pretty good. Willis' Cole is neatly understated, and makes an effective reluctant hero. Madeleine Stowe is fairly convincing as Railly, the psychiatrist who initially takes Cole in as a patient when he arrives in 1990 and babbles inanely about nonsensicals, but Pitt is basically a bit too boisterous and too much as Jeffrey, a mental institute patient Cole meets in the hospital in 1990.As touched on earlier, the direction is pretty decent, and it helps the story move on reasonably fluidly. It's maybe not quite as immersive as it should be, but it does enough to facilitate the narrative.Overall it's a decent film really, and if you find yourself interested in philosophy and determinism et al you'll find this particularly satisfying. You'll also get a kick out of it as a time travel movie.There are certainly a fair few inconsistencies, and things which make no sense, but it does enough to merit inclusion as one of the better films I've seen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Timeless, beautiful masterpiece from Terry Gilliam","Terry Gilliam's masterwork Twelve Monkeys is in my opinion the best of his films, and my favourite time travel movie of all time. Gilliam has a limitless, childlike imagination that surges forward in any project he helms, and this one thrums with a futuristic, fable like aura that pulls you in wonderfully. Bruce Willis, in a remarkably focused, wounded portrayal, plays James Cole, a convict in a derelict underground dystopia. Mankind has been forced down there following a dead global contagion that wiped out the majority of life on the surface. Cole receives a mission from the pseudo government down there: be sent back in time to research what caused the outbreak, and bring information back. Only problem is, he's sent way too far back, to 1994, before the incident. He winds up in a mental institution under the care of gentle, understanding Doctor Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe). No one believes his story, and pretty soon, even he starts to have doubts about his own sanity. Brad Pitt plays fellow inmate Jeffrey Goines, a lunatic who figures in the story later. Pitt has never been better, positively frothing at the mouth like a rabid chimpanzee, prancing around with virile madness, crazily present in every moment of his fantastic performance. Willis drops his smirking antihero presence for a simmering vulnerability that gives the piece it's unique heartbeat. There's welcome turns from Jon Seda, David Morse Frank Gorshin and Christopher Plummer as well. Gilliam spins the story to some truly unexpected places, giving us a hard hitting character study and a madcap sci fi adventure with surprisingly down to earth storytelling for such a genre, and a melancholic sensibility that keeps you in the film's mood long after you have finished it. A classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A Time-Traveling Tale of Hope and Despair,"This movie is about James Cole, a prisoner in the post-apocalypse world where the human race is almost reduced to extinction by a manmade deadly virus. He gets an offer of a pardon if he accepts a time travel mission to stop the person responsible.The storyline is a promising factor in making a time-travel movie. The movie establishes well that the post-apocalyptic world is not a suitable place for humankind and how important it is to travel back in time to stop the phenomenon. The characters were well-written as they all contributed to the movie to progress further. The screenplay is engaging and intriguing as I am fully immersed in the movie. The conflicts like how time travel affects his sanity, sending him to the wrong year, as he questions what's real and gets hope that he is on the right path were well written for Cole's character arc. Even though the movie is good at most. I find some flaws in it.The character Jeffrey Goines is portrayed as a serious threat in the entire movie even though He is the one who suggests to his dad to make the virus and at the climax, showing that he had a completely different plan all along make the pre-climax silly just to give a big twist at the end. The scene with scientists cheering for Cole as he returns with major information looks weird and questions me if they are even sane or not. I am not satisfied with the climax as nothing has changed, everything happened as it is all over again despite that Cole struggled too much to stop the apocalyptic virus. That's a huge drawback for me to have a dilemma to appreciate it wholeheartedly.Bruce Willis did a great job in his role as a person who loses his sanity; hope even tries to abandon the mission almost. Madeleine Stowe was good too as a psychiatrist who struck with a patient trying to stop the apocalyptic virus that she believes does not exist or even will not be created by humans to go extinct themselves. I am not convinced by Brad Pitt acting as a mentally ill person. The cinematography and colour tone were good, and I can't even remember the music after a day; it could have been better.In conclusion, I would recommend this movie if you are into time travel and the apocalyptic genre. I like the movie, but if not for some drawbacks I mentioned, I would have loved it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The ape and the great escape,"Why waste time and write a comment on an old science fiction movie of the nineties? The special effects are executed so much better nowadays, aren't they?Number one: You don't even have to accept this movie as Science Fiction. The story is told as if we were witnessing the main character (Bruce Willis) losing grip of reality, as if everything we see might only exist in his mind. Movies sort of only exist in our mind, by the way.Number two and all the way to number twelve: I don't believe Terry Gilliam will ever top this: It's not just his best movie, It's an all time instant classic, with a terrific script and a stellar cast.Disconnection and misinterpretation are key words in this feverish update of the H. G. Wells classic ""The Time Machine"". But in Gilliams deconstructed version, the Sci-Fi technology is reduced to visual madness, and human life is reduced to fear of contact, both inward and outward in life. Everybody's in cages, and when they try to break loose or are set free, they just become even more disconnected and visually surreal. Every time you try to loosen the knot, it turns out you're just tightening it.It won't take you long to realize that this movie unfolds like a classic tragedy. But the story will keep twisting and turning long after you've finished watching the movie. To me, that's as good as it gets, if you decide to waste some of your precious limited time on earth at watching movies - without the possibility of escaping by time machine to the nearest banana outlet or whatever you fancy in life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A solid piece of sci-fi let down by a lazy finale,"As far as psychological thrillers go, I guess 12 Monkeys is one of the better ones. However, I would have to question whether it deserves the acclaim it received. The concept is exciting, and considering this is from the mid-90s, I guess its fairly original too. Unfortunately, the film is let down by some sloppy character development and a very rushed ending that feels like an afterthought and devalues the entire viewing experience.I'm not much of a Bruce Willis fan but I quite liked him in this movie. The role is a good fit for his style and he carries the film very nicely for the most part. I did feel there was some very inconsistent writing of his character however, as we see him inexplicably transform from being barely conscious and almost illegible to suddenly turning into a nineties Jack Bauer. As for Brad Pitt, well it's certainly a fun performance and one of the most enjoyable aspects of the film, but the Oscar nomination is probably a bit of an overreaction. His twitchy manic qualities are just a shade too excessive and make his character almost cartoonish.Overall, I quite liked the pacing, the atmosphere and the lead performances. The plot was intriguing but unfortunately it unravelled somewhat towards the end. A very compelling time-travel dystopic that just falls a bit short in places.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Very good time-travel whodunit,"As time-travel stories go, I liked that one very much. Captivating performances from Pitt and Willis, and I liked the overall intensity and the claustrophobic camera/light. Very good and ingenious production design as usual with Gilliam, but in 12 Monkeys he also managed to keep everything under perfect control - he's a bit of a hit-and-miss director in my opinion.The mystery part works well, the different scenes in different times all fitting together like cogs in a well-oiled gearbox.Highly recommended, even if the re watch-value is not that high (knowing about all the twists takes away some of the fun, still rewatchable for the great performances).

Bruce Willis & Terry Gilliam team up for a memorable sci-fi flick,"Terry Gilliam's ""12 Monkeys"" is a modern science fiction classic inspired by a celebrated French short film from 1962 (Chris Marker's ""La Jetée""). Set in the near future (at the time), the movie accomplishes the rare feat of living up to its inspiration (and, arguably, surpassing it).The story's protagonist is James Cole (Bruce Willis), a man who supposedly travels some forty years back in time in order to gather data related to a catastrophic viral outbreak. In addition to biological samples, he seeks information concerning a mysterious group known as the 'Army of the 12 Monkeys'. However, this fantastic scenario may be all in his head, which is what psychologist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) is arguing. Nevertheless, Railly feels strangely drawn to Cole for reasons that elude her.The cast is a pretty good one with both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt contributing performances that significantly depart from their usual star roles. Pitt landed an Oscar nomination for his performance as a manic mental patient who may be the mastermind behind the shadowy 'Army of the 12 Monkeys'. Bruce Willis was scarcely less impressive in the demanding lead role. The female lead, Madeleine Stowe, also performed well in a less showy role. Apart from the principles, though, the cast is mostly undistinguished, barring a few exceptions like Christopher Plummer and David Morse.Directorially, the movie is distinguished by Terry Gilliam's unique vision. Odd camera angles and freakish settings produce a visual experience that mirrors the main character's doubts regarding his sanity. The memorable main theme enforces this feel, while the other soundtrack choices (including Fats Domino's ""Blueberry Hill"" and Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"") contribute an interesting sense of nostalgia. Though the cinematography may be fairly dull at times, this is acceptable as it was an intentional stylistic choice.Where ""12 Monkeys"" arguably shines brightest is in the sometimes convoluted but always compelling storyline. Taking a setting & concept that isn't entirely novel, the screenwriters managed to craft an involving science fiction story that successfully juggles reality & delusion. While I'm not sure of how first time viewers will react, it's a story that continues to hold my interest after multiple viewings.In the end, it's difficult to predict someone's reception to this movie since it is somewhat demanding. You'd be advised to pay close attention due to the narrative shifts and ever-present questioning of Cole's sanity. However, attentive viewers should be rewarded with an uncommonly well-realized science fiction movie that ranks among the best of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Who Can Stop the Army of the 12 Monkeys?,"Good Science Fiction has the power to make us look at ourselves as a society. The events in this movie metaphorically mimic events in our everyday lives. Even though we have not yet discovered time travel, all of the other events in this movie could happen, which is absolutely frightening. This is a dark movie, not for everyone, which has a deep high-minded script and plot (it may take a few watchings to fully understand this one.) The cinematography, directing, and acting are wonderful. Bruce Willis proves that he can do other movies besides his normal action type. He also proved it later in The 6th Sense, but I think this is one of his best performances. As for Brad Pitt, it is his best performance. It's so real that by the end, you'll think he's crazy.Bruce Willis plays Cole, a prisoner in a post-apocalyptic future recruited to do some dangerous time-travel work in the past for a group of very odd scientists. The goal of the work only becomes apparent later, and by then there is confusion about whether Cole is really on the mission he thinks he is or is just deluded. Brad Pitt has a major supporting role hamming it up as another who may or may not be insane. Ultimately, while I don't think the film does full justice to its premises and possibilities, it does well enough to be entertaining and thought provoking. Director Terry Gilliam's surrealism adds much. The acting is very good on the whole, itself rather surreal in some of the supporting roles. There is some violence showing how disturbed Willis's character is, not bad for an R-rated movie.

"""Is it true?""","La Jetée, the short that inspired this, is somewhat different, if there are a lot of similarities, and one could argue this as partially a feature remake. There is a long list of reasons why this is a masterpiece of cinema. Allow me to go over a couple: The time-travel makes sense, and the logic of it holds up here more than that of quite a few other films. It's surreal(and yet credible, and not so loose that it's difficult to follow) in the way we would expect from Gilliam, though the focus is considerably clearer. The ambiguity lasts from beginning to end, and you are not limited to one interpretation of what actually happens, and, just as important, what does not, in the course of this. You won't feel confident that you know what's going to happen next in this, with the one devastating exception, which is a mortal sin to spoil for anyone who hasn't taken this in on their own. Heck, it's got two star names of Hollywood, both playing against type and delivering performances that are beyond reproach. In general, the acting is impeccable. Stowe is very natural. The plot and concept is excellent, and the development throughout, the gradual uncovering that so skillfully appears to supply the audience with additional pieces of the puzzle, when it is in actuality also forcing us to ask the question, ""does the board even exist?"". You have to pay close attention to ""get"" everything, and viewing it only once may not suffice. With that said, this is satisfying and you come out of it having been told a full story. The pacing is spot-on, this doesn't really stand still at any time, yet you are allowed time to relax in-between the intense sequences, and are not overwhelmed to the point of being drained. This is immensely engaging and involving. You will be served quite a lot of food for thought, and you will find yourself emotionally affected. This is an amazing piece of film-making craft, technically speaking, as well; the lighting, cinematography and editing are astounding. The special effects are marvelous. Every character is well-written, you believe that people like these could exist. There is strong language, disturbing content and bloody violence in this. The Collector's Edition DVD comes with a 90-minute documentary that I will review on its individual page on the site, a theatrical trailer, production notes and a commentary track of Terry, the director, himself, and producer Charles Roven, and it is entertaining and informative. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a challenging piece where you won't always know exactly what's going on, and fans of intelligent science fiction. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not some monkey business.,12 Monkeys is a fine time-travel based sci-fi movie. Its smart and filled with outstanding performances by Bruce Willis as lead and Brad Pitt in supporting role. James Cole(Bruce Willis) gets sent back in time to save humanity from an apocalypse set up by a unknown virus infestation. It begins nicely but soon loses focus. But its Brad Pitt playing a lunatic who saves the day in the asylum where Willis ends up after being sent into the past.This is one of the best performance he has given till date.The best thing about the movie is that it generates suspense in the minds of the viewers whether it is time travel or just mind games of Cole.The script is neat focusing on variety of things that happen in this corporate system. Also another positive of the film is the character played by the lovely Madeleine Stowe which is of Cole's psychiatrist. She adds the required charm in this dark time-travel loop.The ending is marvelous and really fits perfectly for the questions raised by the time-travel in the movie.I would have liked it more if it had developed more interesting thoughts in the middle rather than using the same ideas. Anyways its worth a watch for all sci-fi fans.RATING: [3.5/5],7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
More Gilliam Brilliance,"This movie is really amazing. It's so good that I signed up for an IMDb account just so I can write a review for it and I have never been the type to sign up for any kind of discussion or opinion boards, just really loved this movie so much that I wanted to share my appreciation for it somewhere, and this seemed like the only logical place to praise a movie on the net.It's probably the best movie I've seen Brad Pitt in and also the best Bruce Willis movie although I also loved the first Die Hard film. I don't want to say too much or give away any of the story but it concerns time travel and there's some really amazing characters in it as well as some great plot twists that you actually may not see coming, I didn't and I'm usually pretty good (or is it bad) when it comes to knowing where a story is going.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Totally Funky Monkey,"This is a good film that has stood the test of time. It was frankly a relief to see Willis playing somebody other than the indestructible all American hero, and he does it well. This is Willis performing at the top of his game and proving why he has been and continues to be one of Hollywood's best.Supporting Willis are Madeleine Stowe and a young Brad Pitt, both of whom portray their characters superbly, Pitt is almost unrecognisable in this film and that is a credit to his ability, goofy hand gestures and the wonders of an odd haircut and moustache Directed by Terry Gilliam (of Monty Python Fame) this film twists and weaves like a snake; perhaps a little predictable at times the film is ultimately satisfying and the viewer is left with all loose ends tied up nicely. If you stick with this film, and watch closely you can pick up the clues that Gilliam has scattered around with reckless abandon, and that makes it all the more satisfying for all concerned. The ending is possibly one of the best that Hollywood has produced and Kudos to the script writers for a wonderfully slippy and ephemeral script.If you want a good night in; grab yourself some popcorn, prepare to concentrate slightly more than normal and kick back for some excellent mid-nineties time travel.A well deserved 7/10. Long live the army of the 12 monkeys!",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A waste of time,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen! When I finally got through this movie I had the worst migrane in the world!

"Wonderfully Strange, Powerful And Technically Brilliant","Many years from when I first watched and repeatedly re-watched this, I'd forgotten quite how wonderfully strange it is. It's a Terry Gilliam film, so of course it's star; but revisiting it now I appreciate the extent of that - and more of why it's so. The direction, especially the cinematography, keeps unsettling us; light, sound, camera angles and more keep us disoriented, grasping for something solid in the same way key figures in the film always find themselves doing. Narratively it continually pulls the rug from under us right up to the end: certainty here is an elusive thing, of course made all the more haunting post-Covid. The performances all work well, but it's Gilliam's (and his crew's) technical brilliance that does the film's Hitchcockian heavy-lifting, leaving us with ideas and images that haunt long after the final credits.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This movie left me dizzy but it's great,"I don't want to spoil the movie, so the best way to resume is to say that it's about the character James Cole(Bruce Willis) not being sure if he's a time traveller researching on a virus that in the future will kill 99% of the human race or if he's just a mental patient imagining all of these circumstances.Nobody did a bad performance that took me out of the story, Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe did great, but my favourite part about the movie was Brad Pitt's character, he's just insane and hilarious to watch.Everybody that wants to watch the movie will have to pay full attention to it in order to not get lost, because it gets truly confusing if you don't.Overall a movie worth watching if you like mistery, Sci-Fi, gross and dystopian settings, and also action, because it's got some of that too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Appealing,"I was interested for a good minute as the story goes on it becomes somewhat predictable. Visually it can be a bit tiring, the world looking all grey and depressed but its well done. Brad Pitt performance is definitely the best one, he's layered with insanity and it makes a pretty good and entertaining to watch character. Bruce Willis' performance is not exceptional, though his character is still interesting, He's simple, dubious and confused. At the end of the day despite the predictable time travel paradox it still a good movie with some unanswered question that'll captivate the mind of anyone who watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Python meets Terminator,"'Twelve Monkeys' is Terry Gilliam's mind-bending time travel epic which tells the story of convict, Bruce Willis, being repeatedly sent back in time to discover the cause of a mysterious virus which wiped out 99% of humanity.It doesn't have Terminator's action sequences, but the plot is kind of similar, plus Gilliam shows his flair for depicting his weird vision of the future by showing us a world that is a cross between Brazil and Time Bandits.Despite Bruce Willis not always receiving that much praise for his acting abilities, he comes across pretty well here as a vulnerable and confused man, trying to make sense of the weird situation he finds himself in. (A very young) Brad Pitt also co-stars and steals every scene with his odd eyes and borderline psychotic personality disorders.It's a great film, but you have to be in the mood for it. I've watched it about three times in the space of nearly twenty years and loved it every time. I have to feel like sitting down and really trying to get my head around who's doing what and why.Like I said, it's not just like Terminator where bad guys fight good guys. You may have to think a little with this one. If you're a fan of Terry Gilliam's work, you should love this. If you've never seen anything he's done before, you may have to tread carefully with this one and check out some more reviews before you decide to commit over two hours to looking into his twisted mind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Gilliam's battle against Hollywood to make an European art film - and he won!,"I can't believe it took me so long to finally watch this gem, although I am a hardcore Gilliam fan (but obviously not hardcore enough to watch his 160 Mill box office runs, haha).He started small and came up with a very expensive looking production design, featuring vintage sci-fi, steampunk and many weird twists. I was impressed by the interrogation room (although they used designs by Lebbeus Woods), the interrogation device ball, the use of abandoned opera buildings, rehabilitation centre (as mental institution) and re-building an airport terminal in a regular congress hall. The worn-down atmosphere's and no-man's-land-sceneries add enormously to the dark vibe, which is contrasted by the sweet, melancholic orchestra/tango music by Astor Piazolla as soundtrack. Once again, like in Brazil, Tideland and what-not films, the sceneries are just WOW.I also loved the camera framing (e.g. often VERY tilted wide angle lenses when it comes to true scenes of madness, e.g. with Brad Pitt in the mental institution - maximum distortion of reality) - and it was the first time, I saw Brad Pitt actually doing some serious acting that was NOT based on the normal personas/character's he's used to play. Same goes for Bruce Willis, showing him in one of his rare not-in-character roles (weak, vulnerable Bruce here, wow!).Overall, I also enjoyed the documentary based on the film production of 12 monkeys and it gives a lot of insight into the whole process. Gilliam is for sure one of those directors who loses his heart to the production and works with a wonderful team (and is not afraid to tell the world about the fact that he's merely sorting the strings while other great artists on his team pull them). I am sure, he'd be LOST without the ability to make movies.I am so happy that UNIVERSAL gave him the money to produce the film and Gilliam battled his way through all the hollywood-ish guidelines to produce something that features HIS known style and voice. Sure, there are other films that are even more ""gilliameske"", but this one had enough budget to pull off a really impressive production design, actors, filming team and what not!I did really enjoy the film visually - and yes, storywise, too: it takes a few watches to truly grasp all the hidden details and there are many ways to interpret this - for sure it fires up the brain-machine to do some work. So go, see it - it is and remains a groundbreaking science fiction film of that era!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Wow, really...?","Oddly enough, I don't think I actually ever got around to watching the 1995 sci-fi thriller ""12 Monkeys"", despite the fact that I had it laying around on DVD for years and years. And it wasn't before now in 2024, as I was sitting through the back catalogue of Bruce Willis movies that I eventually got around to watching it. So I wonder if I have been missing out on a grand cinematic moment here.The storyline in the movie failed entirely to entertain me, and I found it rather erratic and random. And it took me two failed attempts to try to get through the narrative. I had to take a break after 40 minutes, and ended up giving up after 90 minutes. Then I just tossed the towel in the ring out of sheer and utter boredom and disinterest in the movie in general. And this is definitely not a movie that I will be returning to attempt finish watching. Writers Chris Marker, David Webb Peoples ad Janet Peoples failed utterly to conjure up a script that appealed to me in any way.The movie is carried by the likes Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt, to mention the familiar faces on the screen. Brad Pitt's performance was really interesting, and I have to say that I really enjoyed that, despite the fact that the movie's storyline was utter rubbish. In fact, I will go as far as to saying that this was perhaps Brad Pitt's best performance ever, and he totally outshined Bruce Willis on the screen, but even that couldn't manage to salvage the movie for me.How director Terry Gilliam's 1995 movie managed to land an 8.0 rating, as of this very moment while I am reviewing the movie, is simply beyond my comprehension. But hey, taste in movies is individual after all.Not having watched ""12 Monkeys"" before now in 2024, it turns out that I hadn't been missing out on anything.My rating of ""12 Monkeys"" lands on a three out of ten stars.",3.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Genre defying!,"Really good apocalyptic science fiction. Has a great plot, with twists and turns so good that it benefits from multiple viewings. Both Willis and Pitt are great in it. Pitt actually turns in perhaps one of his most memorable roles in this, in my opinion!

90's Classic,"The first time I saw 12 Monkeys was (gulp!) about 20 years ago (wow time flies). I saw it again this evening and the impetus for me watching it again was the self same titled TV series on SyFy. As I was watching the TV show I began wondering how much likeness it had to the movie as my memory of 20 years ago is a little fuzzy. Just to digress a bit... I know where Willis and Pitt have been the last 20 years, but where has Madeleine Stowe (Kathryn Railly) been?12 Monkeys is definitely one of my favorite time travel movies. It does suffer from the same paradox and conundrum issues that a lot of time travel movies do, especially when the time travel is to prevent a particular event (i.e. if you went back in time to stop said event and were successful there would no longer exist a reason to go back in time which leads to the question: would that same event still occur since you never went back to stop it????). Paradoxes aside, the movie was a blast.Brad Pitt did a bang up job as the certifiably insane, Jeffrey Goines. I had forgotten just how cuckoo he was in the movie and how well he did as a nut case. Willis was decent as well. I almost forgot he did non action-hero roles. The accordion rich, French music score ground my gears a little bit but it wasn't too distracting. And I couldn't be too upset considering the movie was based upon the French film ""La Jetee"". The story was gold, so much so they've made a TV show based upon the movie. Another, now, oldie but goodie from the 90's.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Terry Gilliam flourishes an exhilarating vision, and Twelve Monkeys powerfully demonstrates it","Director Terry Gilliam is a man with a vision that many could only describe as one-of-a-kind, if visceral. If he's proved anything over his previous efforts, with 'Brazil' being his magnum opus, it is that he knows how to exceed in potently building up a dazzling visual heft while carrying on a solid narrative. Gilliam effectively accomplishes this feat in this dystopian science-fiction thriller, and the best part is how well he manages to operate on a script that is not only intelligent but feels vastly original. Though it is clear Terry Gilliam borrows a few elements from other entries in the genre, his execution still feels fresh. And with the charismatic performances by the lead actor Bruce Willis, supporting actress Madeline Stowe, and Brad Pitt is arguably his most idiosyncratic role of his career. This film is set 2035 when a deadly virus has devastated nearly all of the human race and animals have dominated the Earth. As a result, this disaster has force mankind to live underground. Prisoner James Cole (played by Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1990 in efforts to hunt down an evil group known as the Twelve Monkeys who are believed to the masterminds behind the pandemic that is set spread worldwide in 1996. When he is unexpectedly thrown in a mental institute by Dr. Kathryn Railly (played by Madeleine Stowe), he crosses paths with a mentally unstable Jeffrey Goines (played by Brad Pitt) who appears to have a key to stopping the virus.Terry Gilliam is without a doubt deeply ambitious when it comes to breathing life to his unique vision. From his steampunk-like production design (particularly in the underground world), to the engrossing screenplay by Chris Marker, to the white-knuckle storytelling; this film fulfills just nearly everything, if not everything to excel as an electrifying science-fiction experience. This all begins with a dark premise of a deadly pandemic that places mankind on the doomsday agenda, and instead of driving for the plot into an action-heavy territory, Terry Gilliam places time travel in the mix. Although supplementing time travel in plots is a daunting task often resulting an overwhelming number of plot threads throwing the story in a convoluted romp. Fortunately, Gilliam engineers the plot in a way that is complex, yet solidly makes sense. Though the story occasionally slips into some questionable areas mostly during the second act, Gilliam more than knows how to keep things moving. Following Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe on the run after the evil doers who threaten the future of mankind, and throughout the picture we are hit nearly non-stop twists and turns including James Cole's nightmarish hallucinations to leave us guessing who's good and who's evil, and what is real and what is not real. When the equation is made up, the film brilliantly achieves the thrills audience deserve.When thinking of Bruce Willis, the first role that may come to your head is when he was facing against the twelve German terrorists in the Nakatomi Plaza as John McClane in 'Die Hard'. This film marks an unique role of him as he carries the lead role of James Cole with astounding charisma and humanity. Yes, while it is less light-heart role than John McClane but by the end, it is safe to say that he delivers the role with clear ambition. Supporting along his side Madeleine Stowe as the psychiatrist Kathryn Railly who becomes a helping hand after realizing his out-of-whack claims of the threat of mankind on the horizon become dangerously true as the two stroll on. Like Willis, Stowe gracefully accomplishes a solid performance to make for an engaging character. Each time these two are on screen together, it is almost instantly enthralling. There is almost no doubt however, that the star who greatly stands out above them is Brad Pitt as the mentally rocky patient Jeffrey Goines who pops in and out of the story as a key character of the diabolical plot. Pitt cashes a manic vibe as the mentally unstable patient who displays an unusual behavior that strolls between the line of comedic and eyebrow-raising insanity. And Pitt spears the role through his jittery dialogue and bombastic demeanor. What results is a fascinating character that swipes your attention each time he appears on screen.Twelve Monkeys is an exhilarating dystopian, science-fiction thrill ride polished by the outstanding vision of director Terry Gilliam. And for lovers of the science-fiction genre, it is a film that expands upon the boundaries of the dystopian subgenre. By the end, it feels like classic, if not a souring masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A good movie,"In a futuristic world where most of the human race has gone extinct as a result of a purposely released virus, convict James is sent into the past, numerous times, in a desperate attempt to discover the author and try to develop a cure. Bruce Willis' character, with his time travels, seems to become more and more confused about which is the present or which is reality, beginning to doubt his mental condition. At the same time, he must focus on the mission he has been assigned, fact which will prove to be more problematic than expected, as he is easily stolen by the beauty of nature, as he's never seen it before. Add a female psychiatrist to the equation and you'll get a very complex and tangled storyline in which James struggles to find his place.Although I enjoyed its plot, I feel that James is being dragged away from one place to another, always being the wrong man at the wrong time, always suffering or being injured and thus, being unable to do more to defend the beloved or to advance into his investigation. Although unexpected and unpredictable as the entire movie, I was somehow disappointed by its finale, which doesn't do anything to bring the slightest change to the apocalyptic situation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Pointless. More grotesque than inspired.,"The time travel plot is insipid. There are two tiny bits of inspiration --the mental confusion resulting from an arbitrary ""present"" and the calm acceptance of being unable to change the past-- but they don't amount to much. And of course, if you can't change the past it doesn't matter what the time travelers do, so that makes any suspense silly. The director's grotesqueries don't resonate with me; I like weirdness (Twin Peaks) but just having ugly people do odd stuff is not profound. The last 15 minutes of the film took an eternity to end, and didn't mean a damn thing. I know life is pointless, but I want a movie to distract me from that for awhile.

"Dystopia gone Monty Python? Yes, half way.","Twelve Monkeys (1995)The best parts of this movie are so farcical, horrifying, inventive, or lyrical, it's hard to swallow the worst parts, which are unbelievable when belief is required, and sentimental when sentiment is cheap.You can see a Monty Python influence in director Terry Gilliam's style, or vision, in parts of the movie, and in other parts it more hard edge dystopia. Both work well. The lead actors (Brad Pitt in a twitchy role and Bruce Willis in a confused tough guy role) are right on, and they make the movie have heart where it might have just been a great production designer's extravaganza. Lead female Madeleine Stowe plays the slightly too-cocky psychiatrist well, getting in the middle of an awful lot of madness.The movie is terrifying in its vision of a hellish, dark, poisoned future, and yet it's comic and silly enough to not be a downer movie. The overtly clever main scene which is shown to us with a little too much cinematic control (we sense a movie trick of editing, and slow-mo, right off the bat) is key to the plot, but sort of a thin bit of the larger plot. But following the main characters through their race against time, almost literally, is totally absorbing. There are many scenes to remember, and the whole experience is just tongue-in-cheek enough to forgive the movie makers their glitches and foibles.Watch it.

Consistent time travel!,"Consistent AND clever.  All too often a writer or film-maker will make it over the first hurdle only to crash into the second.

There are conflicting accounts. Presumably Gilliam's version adds SOMETHING to the tale.  It's much longer, and none of the time is wasted.If you've heard that this is the story of a time traveller who reports that he comes from the future and is locked away in an asylum as a result, and if this makes you sigh wearily and reach for something else - I know exactly how you feel.  But you've got it all wrong.  The action does NOT get bogged down in the loony bin; the story is NOT your standard `I'm sane, I tell you - saaane!' chestnut; indeed, the film cracks the chestnut to give a satisfying surprise to everyone like me who hates that sort of thing.Don't be put off, either, if you're one of those people who finds Gilliam's visual ticks (beneath-the-nostrils close-ups, stupid tilting camera) irritating.  Again, I do too, but there aren't so many of them in `Twelve Monkeys'; and anyway, they aren't a problem.  The film looks great.  Visual imagination lifts rather than detracts from the story.  And it really is such a neat story.There's more to praise but other writers can handle that.  If there's a better science fiction film from the 1990s I've yet to see it - which isn't saying THAT much, since there's a fair few I haven't seen; but it's saying something.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Gilliams Best!,"I'm not a real big fan Terry Gilliam, I enjoy Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but I think Brazil is just to confusing. In 12 Monkeys we're provided with a great middle ground between confusing and accessible. Not only is the direction top notch but the acting is superb, Brad Pitt's best performance since Floyd in True Romance and Bruce Willis shines in a complex and difficult role. The great emphasis throughout this film is whether it's true or James Cole is just crazy and it could swing either way until the end, at times you will believe it one way at times you will believe it the other. For a time travel paradox story its surprisingly easy to grasp and simple to follow, the story is kept fairly simple as not to confuse the viewer and we focus more on the characters interactions. I'm a big fan of Sci-Fi and this is one of the best films I've seen of this genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A magnificent dystopia,"Terry Gilliam's bric-a-brac and cultural proposition is very typical of his universe, which works perfectly here. He loves to play with the focal length and the depth of field. The camera is very often oblique or in low angle with always a concern to highlight the frame, the background, things behind the characters.In the qualities of the film, there is of course its cast with Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt well directed in sober performances except for Brad Pitt who makes an impressive number of crazy.With a subject that resonates a lot in these years 2020 since it is about a virus that will destroy humans, the film tells how Bruce Willis is sent from the future to the past to investigate and find out where the epidemic that has devastated the planet comes from.The whole thing is mixed with a very fashionable concern for speciesism (between the animals who resisted the virus in the future, and the activists against animal experimentation in the past). Finally, in its genre, the film was very much ahead of its time regarding its themes.Finally, when Terry Gilliam works for a studio and under certain constraints, he manages to produce an interesting film, while containing some of the elements of his universe.In spite of Terry Gilliam's bric-a-brac, the film manages to be moving and the last scene at the airport keeps all its power, in spite of the wig and the ugly moustache that Bruce Willis' character is wearing.Note an interesting choice in the music of the film: the use of the accordion on a dystopian science-fiction film is an excellent idea.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A Touch of ""Gilliam Noir""","In the world of the mind and in the realm of the imagination, anything is possible-- even the ability to transport someone through time.  So suspend your disbelief for awhile, check it at the door, and launch yourself into `12 Monkeys,' an adventure directed by Terry Gilliam that takes you into the past by way of the future.  It begins sometime in the near future, a time in which the inhabitants of the Earth are forced to live underground, having been driven there in 1996, when a deadly virus was intentionally released into the atmosphere rendering the air unbreathable and ultimately killing five billion people.  Now scientists believe they have attained the capability of developing a way to make the air breathable again, in which case mankind will be able to return to the surface of the planet and rebuild a new world.  But their plan is contingent upon first acquiring a sample of the virus in it's original, pure form, rather than the mutated strains currently available to them.  This means that someone must be sent back to 1996 to collect data and locate the source of the virus, which would then enable them to send a scientist back to procure the needed sample.Thus far, though they have successfully implemented a system of time travel, their efforts have been for naught.  Using `volunteers' from the penal system, they have failed time and again for any number of reasons, not the least of which has to do with the lack of cooperation and effort put forth by their `chosen' few .  Now, however, they feel they have just the man for the job, a prisoner named James Cole (Bruce Willis), who has agreed to collect their necessary data in exchange for a full pardon.  The biggest problem seems to be that their `time targeting' isn't exactly precise.  They have information that will help Cole once he gets there-- a cryptic message they uncovered points to a high profile group known as the `Army of the 12 Monkeys' as being responsible for unleashing the virus-- and if they can just land Cole sometime before December of 96, he'll be able to track them down.  So, Cole suits up-- and the adventure begins.As he did with his 1985 film, `Brazil,' Gilliam here has created a bizarre world that seems to have been dropped through the looking glass.  He presents a future that comes through as something of a subterranean version of the world in `Blade Runner;' a bit darker and with the definition of a reflection in a fun house mirror.  And it's all quite effective, especially in contrast to the `real' world of the past in which Cole finds himself. But what really makes it interesting and keeps the audience involved is the fact that you know everything that Cole knows, which allows you to share his frustration in dealing with an unimaginable situation, and it makes it a tense and exciting experience.  It works because Gilliam has created a very real fantasy world, as well as a believable `present' that for the purpose of the film is actually the `past.'  The plot becomes fairly complex at times, but after a couple of twists and turns, it all comes together and makes sense in the end.Bruce Willis does a good job in this one, creating a character that is actually quite unlike any other he's ever done.  Cole is certainly heroic, but not in the same straightforward manner as John McClane in the `Die Hard' series, or the more subtle, understated hero of `Unbreakable,' David Dunn. And the emotional character development you see in Cole is credibly realized, for which Willis and Gilliam both deserve a nod of recognition, as it's a good piece of acting by Willis and a demonstration of Gilliam's ability as a director.  It all comes about quite naturally through the narrative of the story, which makes it believable and very real.Brad Pitt, meanwhile, practically steals the show in his supporting role as Jeffrey Goines, the well-to-do idealist with sensibilities that are just a notch off center.  It's a memorable character, created with nuance and detail, and he deservedly received an Oscar nomination for it.  Also giving a notable performance is Madeleine Stowe as Dr. Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist who meets up with Cole and attempts to sort out his psyche while trying to find out just who he really is and where he came from.The supporting cast includes Jon Seda (Jose), Christopher Plummer (Dr. Goines), David Morse (Dr. Peters), Frank Gorshin (Dr. Fletcher) and Michael Chance (Scarface).  With an ending worthy of M. Night Shyamalan, `12 Monkeys' is an engrossing action/suspense/drama that will keep you going until the very end.  And in retrospect, few movies fall just outside of a specific genre or category the way this one does, so for the sake of argument, I'll create one and call it `Gilliam Noir'-- a new genre especially for Gilliam's films (and others like them), including `Brazil' and `The Fisher King.'  Unique films that deserve their own unique place as paragons of cinematic achievement.  It's all about the artistry of film, and the magic of the movies.

It is a futuristic sci-fi story about a man ""James Cole"" (Bruce Willis) going back and trying to find out about a virus that killed five billion people and sent the remaining humans on earth underground.Suonds interesting but the first half an hour (at least, because I didn't last a whole lot longer with this) takes place in a cruel mental ward.

Enjoyable movie...it could be worth a second look,"Although I'm not a big fan of time travel movies because they twist your brain so much and you still cannot come up with a decent logical answer, I liked `Twelve Monkeys' as a time travel movie and otherwise.There is one feeling I particularly get from time traveling stories. It's the way the characters are organically and cosmically connected to each other, there is a sense of universal order when two people meet each other and the feeling of past/ future familiarity forms inside them. This is what happens with James Cole and dr. Railly. They know somehow they are bound to each other, but they just have to let things happen to get to know HOW they are connected. The courses of their lives are governed by the implacable flow or leaps of time, which already set into place the events for them.I also enjoyed the discourse of social insanity, delivered in a funny and witty manner by Brad Pitt's lunatic character. Although his ideas are not new (not wanting to be a consumer labels you as a crazy person, or if others decide you are insane, you accept it and become insane or the fact that the real' crazy people are outside institutions) they are still sensible and captivating.Overall, Twelve Monkeys is not the most original film I have ever seen, but it's pleasant, active, has a natural feeling about it so that you can empathize and communicate with the characters. Quite nice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
12 Monkeys,"This film explores the possibility that humans can control their fate. It deals with whether or not determinism is our fate. Railly questions the ""Cassandra"" premise. Cole is not a passive cog, but an active participant. The question of dogmatic creep into Science, as it has crept into Religion is probed. Gilliam's vision is indeed dangerous in a world where pursuit of Truth is shackled. This film is even more apt today than when it was first released. Cole asks:""Is this about doing what you are told?"" The film's philosophical underpinnings assert the validity of dissent, in a world that closes that possibility more each day. Like the best Sci-Fi, it is a cautionary tale. It is Universal in its Space/Time reach. The use of music is perfect! It asserts the only valid reaction to Living...LOVE...of self, of other, of Truth!

Gilliam's Blockbuster,"Here's a far-fetched, stupid metaphor for you: Terry Gilliam is to film directors what an ivory, diamond-encrusted harpsichord is to a symphonic orchestra. A precious, unique artefact's, but a very impractical one, and without a doubt, an acquired taste. I love Gilliam for his relentless blending of poetry and silliness, his is a unique voice we should treasure more.Someone in the early nineties clearly thought there was enough cross-over potential in not just Gilliam, but a story based on a niche classic, experimental 60s photo-montage film La Jetee, assigned homework of film students everywhere. From this seminal piece, writer David Peoples (Blade Runner, Unforgiven) crafted a nifty time-traveling thriller which, in safe hands, would have probably been a safe investment for the Summer season.it's even nicer then, that someone threw caution to the wind and entrusted this, along with a sizable budget, to Gilliam, who not only managed to lure in heavy-hitter Bruce Willis, but draw from him unprecedented depth, pathos and commitment. Their collaboration made this a very unusual Summer blockbuster, and drew a very able supporting cast, chiefly Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt, the latter stealing every scene he appears in.Narratively-speaking, many reviewers have pointed out that this is a bit of a one-off, the ""twist"" weighing so heavily over everything, but as with all Gilliam's work, the real beauty is in the small touches, many of which reward repeat viewings.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Blimey. I'm absolutely obsessed. (twitches like maniac).,"This is a must see. For anybody. It should be available free on the NHS and prescribed to everyone as a rite of passage as soon as they come of age.OK. So you want to know if this film has flaws. Are there any flaws in this film at all, ever? I'd be lying if I said no, if I said that I did not find at least one second of this film slightly annoying. I was slightly peeved at early appearances from the character of Dr. Railly, but as the film progresses (i promise not to give anything away to unfortunates who have yet to see this beautiful, beautiful film)she givess a more believable, less annoying performance. Perhaps it's just that I grew to like her more as the film progressed, but this is just a nit-picky observation and it wasn't a serious dislike that distracted from the film, I just found her character a bit stuck up. Also, as you may expect from a Gilliam film, you may escape from this film a nervous wreck on the verge of a major heart attack, but MAN! is it Liberating?! (Grits teeth in crazed smile). (screams, monkey-like).Bruce Willis gives a performance as good as that given in Pulp Fiction, but in no way reminiscent of this, proving that he isn't just some ageing bald guy shouting catchphrases all the time, that he is indeed a talented actor and can 'do art'.Brad Pitt, Brad Pitt. Hmm. This may possibly be one of those films that proves the talent of actors that have grown to carry tired associations. Yes, we know that Brad Pitt is a very attractive man. We are comfortable with this, and accept that some film makers may exploit this fact to pull audiences. However, we also know, having observed this film (and Fight Club)that he is also a very, very good choice in a serious and seriously good film because he's really good. Not JUST good, like in Interview With The Vampire, which I'm not convinced about because I don't think he suited the role, but really, really great, fantastic, applaudable, surprising, admirable.

Gilliam's view of Madness,"Pros: Directing, sets, cinematography.Cons: Muddled, very confusing, feels too close to Brazil.Terry Gilliam's new film is about a virus which will wipe out the people on earth and a man sent from the future to save us all. This reads like Terminator 2: Judgement day but this movie is far from it. First of all, Bruce Willis is human, and second of all, when he time-travels, things don't go smootly as the terminator. Willis keeps us guessing whether his character is really from the future or one of those people you meet at the streets proclaiming the end of the world. Brad pitt plays a animal right activists whose character is basically limited to incoherent babbling and Madeline Stowe plays a psychaitrist who is a kindred spirit to Sam Lowry. Gilliam uses bookend technique to begin and end the film and this provides for two very ingenious twists. Much better than the fisher king and Baron Munchausen, Gilliam would later fall from grace with Fear and Loathing but that's another review.Premise: Willis is sent to save the world from a deadly virus.Twelve monkeys was nominated for two Academy awards.Grade: 8/10 (Gilliam is back on track).",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Extremely confusing,"This movie is so weird and confusing, when I watched it with my mom and brother, I kept pressing pause and asking them to explain what was happening. Then, when it was all over and the credits rolled, I still didn't get it! As the years passed, my memory of the unexplained faded, so I have even less of an idea of what it was about than I did back then.Bruce Willis stars in this sci-fi thriller as a man from the future who travels back in time to prevent a disease outbreak in the past. Of course, something goes wrong, and he winds up in a mental institution. He meets Brad Pitt, a literally raving lunatic, and Christopher Plummer and Madeleine Stowe, psychologists at the hospital.From there, my memory grows hazy. There's quite a bit of discussion of time travel, going to the past, the past becoming the present, the present being the future, going crazy, crazy people being sane, truth, and illusion. If you can decipher any of it, you're smarter than I am.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. There are some canted angles and swirling camera motions, especially when the spiral staircase is shown, and it make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to adult subject matter, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Nothing as seen before,"First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you'll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same. His character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far... and counting. The story begins in the (not so far) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth. The story seems to go towards SF but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. About that. Movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you'll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down. Its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good. But that doesn't mean that the ending wont pull your nerves, cause its pretty good. As far as the direction goes, it is prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better. So, if you are getting ready to see a Sci-Fi movie or some action, you'll miss it.

One of Terry Gilliam's Great Successes,"Of the many films Gilliam has directed, attaching his unique, twisted style to, this is one of the few it really works for-one of the films that I think of when I think of this prolific director. It's a fun time-travel comedy with tons of brilliant camera work and set design, supported by stellar performances, and just enough drama to make it a thrilling watch. I highly recommend this film to any fan of weird. It's a light watch, but it has a healthy amount of evocative imagery and themes and will keep you entertained throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant work,"I'm ashamed of my shallowness, but the only reason I could come up with for not giving this movie a 10 (instead of a 9.5) was the fact that I simply don't like Terry Gillam's costume design. All the plastic and wires and chaotic metallurgy leaves me irritated, and try as I might to view it objectively, I can't. This movie deserves a 10, but what's with these useless mechanical devices? The absurd pseudo-techno-insanity? Yuck.Aesthetic concerns aside, 12 Monkeys is a fantastic tale, told fantastically. A vicious plague has decimated the world's population and sent the survivors underground (literally). Cole, a futuristic time traveller played by Willis, must go back in time to unravel the events surrounding the rise of the plague so that scientists in the future can attempt to set things right (put human beings back on top, so to speak). The plot sets up a wonderful mystery to figure out, as well as creates an interesting morality play regarding the place of human beings on the planet. Are we destroying the Earth with our consumeristic, growth based economy? Is our culture sustainable in the long term? What fate awaits the human race?There's also an interesting dynamic between Cole and the ""modern day"" therapist played by Stowe--they are both forced to question their sanity, which creates an intriguing ambiguity for the audience and the unusual and shocking conditions that create a somewhat plausible possibility of romance for the characters. It's all good stuff.The acting is great--Willis, Stowe, and Pitt all play their parts to a tee, and as mentioned, the story is rich in every way. This movie makes you think while you're being highly entertained, and to me that's what it's all about.Too bad about the crazy costumes...",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Excellent,"A very strong movie.

However, I do believe in Back to the future theory of worlds' multiplicity.So Bruce could save the world, but not his world.In the theory of parallel worlds the man can meet himself.And I do believe there is no problem in that. Here I disagree with Dr. Brown from Back...But the story pf 12 Monkeys has its own beauty. Inspite of all these theories of one world or many or continuum one can believe that he is really insane and the doctor - his girlfriend was just lost.A sequence of events which may lead her to believe that he is from the future.

It's good, it's great and you should watch it and appreciate it... Or you won't... But no matter your opinion, saying that this movie is bad is just a plain lie... It's what movies are made for...

Now some may say that it is an excellent perception of a person being sent to far back in time, i can see what they mean by this, but it doesn't cover for how grotty this movie is. Now don't think that im some sort of clean freak or something because i think it is a disgusting film, don't get me wrong i love action and stuff with people getting there head blown off and stuff, that doesn't bother me.

Confusingly epic,"""Twelve Monkeys"" from 1995, directed by Terry Gilliam, is a mind-bending, dystopian sci-fi film that explores themes of time travel, sanity, and the fragility of reality. The story follows James Cole (Bruce Willis), a convict from a future ravaged by a deadly virus that has wiped out most of humanity. He is sent back in time to gather information about the origins of the outbreak, but things quickly spiral out of control as he becomes entangled with a mysterious group called the ""Army of the Twelve Monkeys,"" led by the eccentric Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt). Madeleine Stowe also gives a great performance as a psychiatrist who gets involved a little bit too deeply with her patient Cole. As Cole delves deeper into his mission, he begins to question his own sanity, as well as the true nature of the virus and whether he's really traveling through time or just experiencing a mental breakdown. The film features a gripping mix of tension, paranoia, and surreal visuals, with Gilliam's distinct style adding a chaotic, dreamlike quality that keeps all things unnerving. Willis gives a strong, emotional performance as Cole, balancing his character's desperation with vulnerability, while Pitt delivers a standout turn as the unpredictable and manic Goines, earning him an Academy Award nomination. The film is both thought-provoking and almost deliberately confusing, with its intricate narrative demanding full attention. The plot twists are unexpected, and the ending is chilling, leaving audiences to question whether the events of the film are part of an inevitable loop or a tragic misunderstanding. With its unique storytelling, complex characters, and philosophical musings, this is quite a unique ride, and nothing less than yet another weird Terry Gilliam puzzler. Compelling throughout with twists and turns every step of the way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Philosophical Odyssey,"Several films have examined the classic form of the Greek Tragedy, but none with more sophistication than this and due mention to the Greek myth of Cassandra that drives such plots.   Although Bruce Willis is in classic ""detached man with an important mission"" mode, he shows why you've got to see him outside of an action film in order to gauge his worth as an actor. His restraint in the role of a man not quite sure whether the disaster he foresees is real or just a figment of his own mind helps to allow the viewer to wonder whether it all might be a dream.  During the movie, you have more faith in Bruce's mission than Bruce does.In the end, like many movies of this type, including ones with happy endings (think ""Terminator 2"" or any of the many time travel episodes of Star Trek), you have to wonder whether prescience is actually something to be envied or whether knowing the outcome is actually enough to alter it.In addition, Terry Gilliam is one of my favourite directors merely for the sense of style he gives to the cinematography.  Even a stinker like ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" treats every shot like a masterpiece of art and this film is no exception.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Solid,"One of the better sci-fi movies you've probably never heard of, 12 monkeys is a familiar concept (travel back in time to save the world) realized in a wholly original way. From start to finish the film looks sinister, with the post apocalyptic future reminding you more of a gritty, low budget, indy movie, and the past maintianing that atmosphere, tho turned down from a 9 to about a 7. Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis. The man has a natural charisma that helps him sell any role hes in without having to stray from his natural behavior too much, and this film is no different. The real highlight of this film is Brad Pitt and his complete transformation into a total nut job, which is very convincing. I suspect method acting with how pinpoint his mannerisms and speech patterns are, awesome job on his part. As far as the story goes, the majority of the film is nothing to amazing, it gets you from act to act keeping you interested but never doing anything to really peak your interest or suck you in further. However once Madeline Stowe's character has her arc I would say is where the film really picks up, and the last half hour or so are full of twists and turns that keep you glued to the screen untill the climax and the films eventual conclusion. From a technical aspect, I have no issues really. Film looks good, directed well, sounds good, all the little things that are overlooked by your average movie viewer. Replay value is moderate I would say, just because there are sci-fi movies out there that are much more ""fun"" so I'm thinking this movie gets lost in the rotation. Overall 12 monkeys is a solid watch, keeping you interested until its enthralling last 30 min, but the fact that it is much more a drama with a sci-fi setting will ultimatley cause it to remain largely on the shelf. 8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
stunning visually and intellectually stimulating,Terry Gilliam always gives the customer a visual banquet in his films and often challenges the intellect as well. (ie Brazil) This could possibly be the best ever performance by Bruce Willis as a confused time traveling agent of a team of scientists in the future trying to track down a virus that wiped out the surface human population of the Earth. Brad Pitt is hilarious as the crazed son of a present day scientist who might have released the virus. Gilliam's organic machines of the future are intriguing and strangely beautiful. A must see for fans of the genre.,10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A True Masterpiece,"Director Terry Gilliam and writer David Peoples, both talented in their own right, have collaborated to create the best movie of their careers. Twelve Monkeys is a time travel story mixed with an apocalyptic air about a killer virus and a man from the future who must go back in time to stop it.  But the movie is also about mental illness, it's about what constitutes reality & non-reality, and it's about how small mistakes of identity or incorrect assumptions can alter the course of history.Weaving a multi-textured and highly nuanced script from Peoples, Gilliam invents a movie that stands up to repeated viewings and seems to reveal more layers of itself each time it's watched.  Performances from Bruce Willis as the time traveler, Cole, and especially Brad Pitt as Jeffrey Gomes, the mentally disturbed son of a viral scientist, head up a cast of sturdy, if somewhat over the top, performances (keep in mind that this is Terry Gilliam, and over the top is par for the course).Any who dismiss Twelve Monkeys as a silly exercise in filmmaking or a confusing movie about time travel have missed the point.  It is both of those...but it is made that way intentionally and used as a thin commercial hook to disguise a deep and meaningful film, something American audiences tend to shy away from.High credit to Peoples and Gilliam.  Twelve Monkeys is a must-see and an experience the viewer not easily forget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Good Film, interesting plot, be prepared to think","I love the cinematography.  The acting is great.  My biggest objection is the amount of swearing in this movie.

Another Terry Gilliam oddity.,"Terry Gilliam might not be as well known and appreciated as the Spielbergs, the Kubricks and the Scorseses of our world but he certainly has the same status as those directors, especially in the world of movie making business itself. Just look at all those big name actors who are always willing to play in his movies, for a very small payment, also often in some quite small and odd roles, like Robert De Niro in ""Brazil"" and Brad Pitt in this movie.Gilliam movies are not easy to place in one corner. They often have surreal elements of pure chaos but they are yet made with an incredible eye for detail and precision. ""Twelve Monkeys"" is above all things a science-fiction movie but unlike any that you have ever seen before. It doesn't use any fancy effects or futuristic looking places. It's instead more set in the 'present' time and the futuristic elements from the movie are all far from looking settling. It's a filthy and depressing future, which also helps to bring you close to the main character. It certainly is one of the essential science-fiction movies from the '90's.It's a very visually rich movie, that is very imaginatively put together. But no, the movie is not just purely style over substance. It also has a really great written story, that takes on original approach on time traveling. It doesn't progress as you think it does and the story is in constant motion and development. It provides the movie with some great moments, as well as a great and unforgettable ending, that makes the overall movie perhaps even better.It stars Bruce Willis in the main lead but in a role like you have never seen him in before. It's perhaps his most emotional and involving roles. It also stars Brad Pitt in a totally crazy role, before he had reached the true status of a big Hollywood celebrity (the movie has already began production and signed on Pitt before the release of movies such as ""Se7en"" and ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles""). It still is perhaps the best role Pitt ever played and it also earned him his first Oscar nomination.It also is perhaps Terry Gilliams best movie till date and it also certainly still is his best known one and commercial most successful one, despite the fact that this is not really a mainstream movie and this certainly also is not Gilliams style, as can be seen in this unique, visually and narratively strong movie.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Good sci-fi flick,"Let me start by saying that I am not a huge Terry Gilliam fan. Honestly most of his films I could do without. But I sort of saw this one by accident and I must say I am glad I did.Twelve Monkeys wasn't so much good on account of the story. I suppose it was unique enough and original enough to keep me entertained. In many ways it was similar to other science fiction films of past and present but there were some aspects of the story that I had not seen before, which was nice. But the best thing about the film was Bruce Willis.Let me clarify. I am not a huge Bruce Willis fan by any means. I like him in some things and dislike him in others. But the thing that made this role so good for him was that it allowed him to branch out. People, this is Bruce Willis like you have never seen him before. He is believable in the role and he makes the film worth watching. It is a completely different character for him and I think you will like it a lot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"If everything is pre-destined, what is the point of effort?","I hadn't seen this movie for years, but remembered it fondly without really remembering what I liked about it. On re-watching it, I realized that this is truly a great film, dealing with a lot more than just the old who decides who is insane question. One of the major themes is that even though humanity has developed far superior technology by 2035, it's being run by the same incompetent bureaucracy we've had since the time of Caesar. In one scene, when Bruce Willis has been returned to his own time after finding the information he was sent to find, his superiors are behaving so bizarrely that he begins to believe, and the audience along with him, that maybe he really is insane and the entire future world is just a hallucination. This movie plays fair by the rule that nothing in the past can be changed, and most of the action takes place in the past of 1990 or 1996. Bruce is sent back not to prevent the spread of the virus, but just to retrieve a sample of it so that scientists in the future can develop a cure for it. The cinematography is a tour-de-force of point of view work. When Willis is first admitted to the mental institution, drugged up and disoriented in time, no shot is fully perpendicular, no composition balanced. Brad Pitt is a wonder as one of the mental ward patients. He's completely manic and full of energy. He's the first clue in the movie as to why it might be called 12 monkeys. My test of a good movie is always whether I want to see it again. This is especially true of a Chinese-puzzle movie like this. Once you know how it ends, is there any interest in watching again. In this case the answer is certainly. Willis says to Madeleine Stowe while they're watching ""Vertigo"" that visiting the past is like watching an old movie. You can't change the way it comes out, but you notice different details. This movie is so rich in details and ideas that it will stand up to many viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Terry Gilliam directed not only science fiction, but also drama and thriller in one. But I agree, that this is not a film for everyone. This movie contains lots of messages on philosophy and physics but only in context. I discussed this movie with my friends for hours and we still have something that we can discuss...after 5 years. So i think this is an overtime movie and even children of my children will watch it with opened mouth. I saw it maybe twenty times, but each time i found something new. And there is one more thing that i love in this movie - how it makes an order in the end of the chaos that you see in the beginning and during the first hour of the movie.I wondered if Cole is really mad or it is all reality from beginning to the end.

This movie deals with many interesting aspects that appeal to me; time travel, animal preservation, insanity and epidemics. Not only does ""12 monkeys"" deal with topics of interest, it is presented amazingly well.  ""12 monkeys"" provides Great performances by the likes of Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe, a plot that will keep you guessing, and some very atmospheric background music.I especially like movies presented the way ""12 monkeys"" is, ones that feed the plot to us in fragments, and only achieve total unity when the film is complete, not unlike ""the Usual Suspects"".

A small budget produces one of Gilliam's best movies,"Gilliam made this after the flop of Baron Munchausen, and had to work with a smaller budget than for some of his earlier movies.  I think it forced him to focus on the characters rather than the effects, and the result is a brilliant psychological drama about a man whose personal ghosts mirror the ghosts of a plague-ravaged future Earth.If you thought Bruce Willis was a lightweight (and Alan Rickman carried Die Hard), then take a look at this.  I completely reevaluated my opinion of Willis after seeing this movie.  Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt are also very good, but it's Willis who carries the focus of the film.Yet another reminder that even with a science fiction / end-of-the-world / time travel story, good characters and good script writing (and decent direction) are all-important.  I suspect that this would not have been half as interesting had Gilliam had a big SFX budget.

Try to blend in,"I'm way behind the times because I've just watched 'Twelve Monkeys' for the first time, 14 years after it was released in the theaters. I went off Terry Gilliam for awhile, can't really say why. I got involved in other stuff, I guess. Anyway, I missed having this masterful film under my belt all these years.Recently I proclaimed 'Tideland' as having superseded 'Brazil' as his masterpiece. Now, in so short a time, 'Twelve Monkey's has snatched the crown from 'Tideland'. All three of these films are solid evidence of Gilliam being one of the great living directors.What is most great about this movie, for me, is that I didn't know what was going to happen next. Nothing about it is predictable, even to the very last shot on the airplane to San Francisco.I began to think this was a modern version of the nightmare classic 'Dead of Night', then, at the very end it turned out to be something quite different. Gilliam has never been a director to explain everything to a supposedly gawp-mouthed public, but relies upon them to be capable of rubbing a couple of brain cells together and figuring it out on their own.My brain cells were so fuddled until the last scene that I gave up trying to second guess the ending.It's a frequently depressing movie, showing modern society as corrupt and violent and cynical. It even began to seem preferable that 99% of the world population should be destroyed by a virus, but somehow, when the credits were running I abandoned that dark thought. It's also a very funny movie, thanks to the very subtle performances of Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt and the scientists living in the future, all of whom seem slightly cracked, like the psychiatrists in the present time. Madelyn Stowe is superb throughout, and near the end of the movie becomes a tremendously moving presence.This story blows holes in all the political-socio bickering that goes on between various factions with their hidden agendas and brings the viewer back to the main point, which is: we are alive and it's a miracle, and that's all that matters... make the most of it.Brilliant cast, brilliant music, direction, cinematography, art direction... the whole ball of wax.And Brad Pitt really CAN act when he's working with a great director.A great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Fever dream,"When it was finally over I had to ask myself, did I just have a fever dream or did I really watch a movie?""12 Monkeys"" left me utterly disappointed, failing to live up to the hype surrounding it. The convoluted plot seemed like a tangled web of confusion rather than a coherent narrative. The film's reliance on time travel as a central theme only added to the chaos, leaving me with a sense of bewilderment rather than awe.The characters lacked depth, making it challenging to connect with any of them on an emotional level. Bruce Willis, despite his acting prowess, couldn't salvage the poorly developed protagonist, leaving his performance feeling lackluster and uninspired. The attempt to blend dystopian elements with time travel resulted in a muddled and disjointed storyline that left more questions than answers.Moreover, the pacing of the movie was erratic, making it difficult to follow the sequence of events. The constant jumps between timelines were disorienting and hindered the overall viewing experience. The film's attempts at suspense often fell flat, as the audience was too preoccupied trying to make sense of the plot twists.In conclusion, ""12 Monkeys"" was a convoluted mess that struggled to establish a coherent narrative. Despite a talented cast and occasional visual appeal, the film's confusing plot, underdeveloped characters, and disjointed pacing left me with a profound sense of disappointment. It's a regrettable attempt at blending sci-fi and dystopian themes, ultimately falling short of the expectations set by its ambitious premise.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The best science fiction movie ever made.,"The unlikely combination of Bruce Willis in a Terry Gilliam film turns out to be the best thing either of them has ever done.  I've never been a big fan of Bruce Willis' action movies, but he's at the top of his form as a reluctant time traveller / psychiatric patient.  Terry Gilliam, on the other hand, proves that he can make a fairly mainstream, psychological thriller while still imparting his cynically comical world view.The structure of the movie, constantly switching between the supposed future, where Bruce Willis's character is a prisoner being forced to go back in time to find the origins of the virus that drove humans underground, and the present, where he is considered delusional for his belief that he is from the future, is expertly handled such that it's impossible to tell which is ""reality"".  Willis does a fantastic job capturing the despair he feels as he becomes increasingly unsure of the truth and his own sanity.Everything about this movie is perfect -- the story, the acting, the direction, the scenery, the plot twists, and, especially, the ending.  Far more than just a ""fun"" science fiction movie, you'll be thinking and talking about this movie for months.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Very stylish, almost cult, science fiction with good story.","Pretty good, stylish movie that tells a time travel story without any major flaws to the storyline. Gilliam also gives the viewer himself a sense of insanity when the main character starts doubting his own time shifts: you can totally imagine how one could fool oneself with what he really experiences and what he thinks he experiences.I was pretty impressed with Brad Pitt's acting, except for a few dispersed looks with the eyes. Bruce could have done better, it's hard for him to shake of the image of the hero that eventually will stand up and do the best things possible to save the day(pulp fiction).Madeleine stow I think is too sweet for this dark movie and pushes it toward films like Outbreak and Sphere instead of Blade Runner.After all a pretty good Sci-fi almost cult movie with a great story and a great setting but not dragging you in another world as Blade Runner and Fight Club can do.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

What A Wonderful World. What a wonderful film.,"Beautifully made film. Terry Gilliam is a marvel. Bruce Willis is fantastic as well as the rest of the cast. Very memorable scenes are everywhere throughout. An extremely intriguing story that continues to unravel and thicken every minute. Sure it's a little dark, a little hard to follow the first time, and a little off-kilter pace wise, but this great movie is filmmaking at its best. No question. I cannot stress enough how much of a good movie 12 Monkeys really is. Bravo!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Haven't I seen this idea before?,"I seem to remember a french B/W ""art house"" film that followed the same plot. Someone goes back in time, gets shot. The twist is that the guy, as a kid, once saw someone get shot in the same place. Get the picture? I can't remember what the french film was, it was made up of a series of still photo's though with a voice over.Anyway Bruce Willis rises above his usual blandness, with Brad Pitt playing a crazy. Interesting casting.The best Terry Gilliam since ""Brazil"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The New Generation of Hitchcock filmmakers,"What and under watched piece of art. Terry Gilliam creates an amazing world where he comments that he himself got lost within the time constructs of the film. The brilliance of the film is how easy time is visible within film. The new generation of viewers who go to see Hollywood movies watch linear stories and cannot get used to the fact of how beginning, middle and end can me skewed. People think once a story is non-linear it becomes in intellectual movie. Anyone can understand this movie very simply, I've heard too many complaints about how hard it is to follow the story and Brad Pitt's insanity (which I thought was amazing step in his acting career) . Gilliam blends Hitchcock style shots and combines it with the science fiction genre. Gilliam knows how to play with the mind of the viewer which made Hitchcock brilliant. When you get the viewer conflicted you spark more and more interest and your intrigued by every character. More people have to watch this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the best Bruce Willis works,"Bruce Willis has starred in a plethora of movies that later became classics: The Fifth Element, Armageddon , Die Hard and Pulp Function. As you can see, ""12 Monkeys"" is omitted from this list, which is a shame in my opinion, as this movie had all the ingredients to write its name into the history as one of the best Bruce Willis movies: the setting is as unique as in The Fifth Element, the stakes are as high as in Armageddon, Bruce is as loveable as in Die Hard, and the overall story is as captivating as in Pulp Fiction. But it wasn't meant to be - only a fraction of the people who watched the classics above have even heard of 12 Monkeys, let alone watched it. If you are among them, please do yourself a favor, and dedicate one of your evenings to expanding the list of your favorite Bruce Willis films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Really bizarre but brilliant!!,I actually had to see this film twice before I could fully understand it. The acting is really good and the story line completely absorbing and fascinating. This is a great film which you should see. Beware though it does make you think a lot and you have to follow the story carefully!!,9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
See It.,"Very good SF film. Willis gives the best performance of his career and finally proves to those of us who had our doubts that he actually can act. The plot is quite easy to follow provided the viewer pays a little attention. The movie is very funny throughout, with Brad Pitt's manic appearances being the side-splitters (he perhaps owes a bit to Dennis Hopper in Apocalypse Now).Visually, 12 Monkeys resembles  Gilliam's Brazil a great deal and shares some of that film's atmosphere as well. I give this one an 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
What a thriller!!!!,"This movie is an instant classic. If you don't like this movie, then u like crap. This is a must see. Bruce Willis is superb and Brad Pitt plays a perfect nutcase ala tyler durden. The story is a bit confusing at first but once the movie is over it will all come to place so don't get lost at the start, try and stick with it . This is definitely Gilliams best, and yes its better than brazil, the holygrail,and probably fear and loathing although it gives it a run for its money. I must say this is one of my all time favorite movies. Without a doubt top 20 movies ever. I say roll yourself a fatty and enjoy cause this is definitely a 8.6. Just remember all you potheads, you got to pay attention in this one. I give it 2 blunts up without a doubt.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"incredibly tight, fast paced and different","twelve monkeys was an incredibly unique movie and a highly demanding one. the audience needs to pay a lot of attention to catch the plot that goes see-saw and up and down. all with a purpose. the plot unravels brilliantly as more and more things fall in place gradually.bruce willis is once again brilliant in a tough role as is madeleine stowe, but the standout performance is brad pitt as the mad kid living in the shadow of his genius father.this movie has many brilliant shots, the soundtrack and cinematography were just excellent. technical brilliance apart, the terrific story telling and acting carry through what would otherwise have been a difficult movie to watch.the movie is slickly made and tight. the only flaws being the slight exaggeration of coles presence at various points of time and the cole-railly romance, which i thought was a little overdone.in all, an excellent 9!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Absurd...,"Absurdity all around. Twelve Monkeys was a confused product that depicts about the tense. It's all about past, present and the future were the protagonist always looks for the future. He knows exactly what going to happen in future. That's the film is all about. Loved the performance of Brad Pitt and from the technical side it's all about the production design. The sci-fi world out from the planet is quite an interesting one. Terry Gilliam who always invites us for such kind of absurdity through his films, and that's I recalled about his 2005 film Tideland in the list. I rated 4 for that films. Even though 12 Monkeys might be his masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A tricky plot, that should delight fans of good science-fiction.","A film, that has to be seen more than once.

Also a great appearance of Madeleine Stowe and Bruce Willis.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The end almost undoes it for me,"I almost want to give this film a 6 or so because of how it sort of unravels at the end stylistically.  But the rest of the film is well written and well acted enough to keep this at an 8.This was the first film in my mind where Brad Pitt showed he was developing into a strong actor--not brilliant, but strong.  Bruce Willis (always underrated) spends most of the film looking dazed--which he does very well--but it's not a tour de force performance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Deep and brilliant...,"Bruce Willis' 'Twelve Monkeys' is one of the greatest films of his career, and one of the greatest psychological/time travel films ever made. The script is amazingly strong, and we as the audience get to see the effects of time travel on Cole (Willis), rather than the character bounding along and completing his mission, we see his sanity actually declining.Bruce Willis offers an extremely in-depth character, and due to the nature of the film, one we can relate to. At times, he is even frightening due to the unease with his situation.Brad Pitt is equally as good as Willis, offering an unusual take on his character Jeffrey Goines. This is also one of Pitt's greatest characters, and the way he handles him is fantastic. His lines are strong, and the relationship that develops between him and Willis moves the story in a new direction.Madeleine Stowe also creates a great character, Kathryn Railly, as a psychologist who loses her faith in her profession. The way she almost comes to see life through Cole's eyes is an amazing character transformation.The script is strong, and the original cinematography is crucial and brilliant.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Brad Pitt can ACT,"There are lots of other reviews on this film, but I just had to state one thing... which is that Brad Pitt absolutely deserved an Academy Award for this film.  I thought he was a pretty-boy annoying actor until I watched his performance here, and it was unlike any other I have seen.He did not win in 1995... he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, and lost to Kevin Spacey for The Usual Suspects.The Usual Suspects was an excellent film.  It won an Oscar for its screenplay.  But Spacey won his award because no one guessed the ending before its time... which is not inherently the work of an actor, but of the script working so very well.  Spacey wasn't playing Soze playing Kint... he was just playing Kint.Brad Pitt is playing a psycho, but not JUST a psycho... a subtly nuanced psycho, so you can see all that is going on in his head... he's got different levels, and is thus more real than Verbal Kint or Keyser Soze can ever be.And scarier too.Bruce Willis and Madeline Stowe also give A+ performances, and you should see this film if you're up for a head trip.  That was all I wanted to say.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"An almost masterpiece of science fiction film - original, well played and surprising","Terry Gilliam's almost science fiction masterpiece is a visually dark and impressive film that tells an exciting and allegorically self-contained story. The beginning and the end are intrinsic, but not clichéd or addicted to the rounding off of the story. Willis can be seen here in one of his best acting performances, while Brad Pitt is simply very iconic and plays the somewhat insane knowledgeable; maybe even a little too crazy. The film opens up with some very impressive scenes from film history and is almost perfect. Only now and then do little things make the difference to the masterpiece. Including the already mentioned, sometimes over-exaggerated portrayal of Pitt (even if it seems difficult to play this role in that sought-after perfection and Pitt by no means does it badly), or the sometimes too untold story, which leaves a lot in mystery (but also Most of the time this is easy to understand, because the atmosphere, style of directing, representations and metaphors are intertwined here). All in all a really great, serious and dark film by the team member of the Monthy Python family.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Repetitively enjoyable.,"I have a lot to say about this film and I'll doubt I'll get it all out. Who would have thought Bruce Willis can act? I mean, he is always a very entertaining action hero- but despite all the kudos that went to the maniacal Brad Pitt for his role, it was Bruce as the lost, intense, quite possibly insane but vulnerable James Cole. They say you'll never forget your first time, and this is true for Twelve Monkeys, who wasn't caught up in the relentless, intense and fascinating plot that tightened up around the characters? Who's mind wasn't left shattered at it's finale? But this movie isn't to be discarded as a one time thrill ride, no, for as James Cole himself says while watching Vertigo- the film is different every time you watch it. Sometimes it is the funniest of comedies, sometimes a great tragedy, sometimes just breathlessly intense. And every time I watch it I appreciate the care and intelligence that has gone into every aspect of it. The script by David Peoples (and wife), who also wrote the perfect Blade Runner, is brilliantly structured, complex, but too much so, and peppered with great humour. Director Terry Gilliam is great at creating an intense paranoid, what-is-going-on-am-i-crazy world and without him the film could have been totally ruined. The acting, Brad Pitt, yes is entertaining, memorable and riveting, but he rips a lot off Dennis Hopper in Apocalypse Now. The real respect should be going to Madeline Stowe (subtle, but the more you watch her the better she gets) and Bruce Willis, who is absolutely brilliant. OK, time to shut up now, even though there is plenty more to say, if you haven't watched it, watch it, if you have and enjoyed it, buy it and watch it over and over, and if you didn't enjoy it... well... it's your loss.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Another 48 Hours,"A visionary tale about modern and past lunacy.We are connected to this movie by Bruce Willis, whom we do not sure whether he is crazy or not. And through his eyes we witnessed this ludicrous past and future, the happened and the will be happened, and so on.I have to tell you this is really Terry Gilliam-ish. You can see the resemblance to Fisher King. And both deserve standing ovations.A plus for Brad Pitt who willingly put some of his crazy acts, show his bottom, and joins Bruce Willis in some drolling and crazy acts.Interesting movie to watch at night before Friday.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Quick appraisal of one of the most brilliant films ever,"When Terry Gilliam (director) got the results back from the first test screenings of '12 Monkeys' he became worried that he had created a major flop and repeated the misfortunes that befell 'The Adventures of Baron Von Munchausen'. What he later discovered was that the audiences at the screenings were too narrow-minded to appreciate the brilliance of what later became a very successful film. The main problem was that it was something they had never seen before and it confused them.The film depicts a dark and scary world of maniacs and distruction, yet has an underlying message of hope. Not perhaps for the material world which is inevitably wiped out, but for humanity. Bruce Willis, in one of his best performances, plays a man from the future who is sent back to 1996 to prevent the release of a virus that all but destroys the human race. Although not sure what is reality and what is delusion within his confused mind, he struggles on to save the world.The film is full of ambiguities: the imagery of decay yet has a certain beauty to it; the ending is the most depressing and yet heartening that i have experienced in cinema. The result is an emotional experience that leaves you all ""over the shop"" mentally. If you want a thought provoking european style film with the cast and crew that only a major Hollywood studio can get their hands on, here it is.Whatever the mass audience may say and however hard it may be to realise your ideas, Terry, keep making the movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Complex, and involving story","12 Monkeys is one of those films that creeps up on you.  It doesn't present its plot right from the beginning, it slowly unfolds in many different layers.  Only after the film is over do you get the full impact.  Full of Terry Gilliam's usual visionary images, the film carries you along from past, present and to the future.  The airport sequence is where everything comes together, and the final scene in slow motion is mesmerizing.  A hard movie to pin down, and explain.  All that can be said is watch the film, and make your own judgments.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Wonderful,"This film will haunt you after you see it. The story revolves around a prisoner who is supposed to be sent to 1996 to stop a deadly disease from spreading. Instead he is sent to 1990 and is placed in a mental hospital. There he meets a psychotic man ( Brad Pitt) who clames to have a rich father and a beautiful doctor who tries to belive him. After escaping the hospital he is later sent to 1996 and kidnaps the doctor and forces her to drive to Philadelphia to find the army of the Twelve monkeys. The rest is a series of surprising events which ends in a ending that will make you scared for your self. Terry Giliam has twisted this film into a 2 hr epic that will shock you and surprise you untill the final scene ends and Louie Armstrong's "" What A Wonderful World "" plays during the final credits.

One of the great mind-benders of all time,"Terry Gilliam is a mad genius who in a wickedly clever way combines sci-fi, the ennui of an impending apocalypse, film noir, and star-crossed romance in this classic mind bender that needs to be watched over and over to be enjoyed. Will Bruce Willis save society and discover who unleashed the virus that killed millions and forced survivors to live underground in his erratic court appointed trips through time? Is Brad Pitt simply an insane rich kid with too much time and medication on his hands or the potential cause of the fall of civilization? Will Madeleine Stowe crack the case of the patient she has fallen in love with before she herself becomes insane? Will the people of Philadelphia ever get another movie that utilizes the city to such madcap and insane lengths? (Only in Philadelphia could this film exist). Will I forever have nightmares about the Philadelphia International Airport? Will the viewers be sucked into an elliptical vortex of darkly comic, hauntingly sad, and ultimately tragic ends to our beloved mind tripping characters?

You'd better watch it twice!,"Twelve Monkeys combines an exceptional story with some really good performances.In this movie Bruce Willis (James Cole) shows us, once again, that he became more and more an actor. Madeleine Stowe (Dr. Kathryn Railly)shines as the doctor who wants to help the poor Cole. And Brad Pitt is just brilliant as the insane Jeffrey Goines.The story itself is quite unique. In the future, prisoners are sent back into time to find out why we are all dead. All the people in the future know is that a virus killed almost the entire worldpopulation.To find out more about that virus prisoners are sent back to time. James Cole is one of those ""volunteers"". But things went terribly wrong. Cole is sent back to the wrong year and ends up in a mental institution. From there on, he tries to convince his doctors that he is not insane.The movie is very well made. It swings back an forward into time and does that in such a way that even the viewer starts to question Cole. At the end of the movie you really wonder wether Cole is a hero, or just another mental patient.This is a must see film, and if you want to understand it, you'd better watch it twice!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Really great!,"Don't think you can watch this movie passively. It requires attention, but you'll be awarded. The script is extremely intelligent. I've now seen it three times, and at last I think I know what it's all about. It is best on VCR, since you can pause. If you miss one minute, it may well be one of the minutes that contains the key to the plot. So: be patient and attentive!Willis makes the performance of his life, and so does Pitt. As for Stowe, I haven't seen her before, so I can't judge. Although the acting is first-class, it is the intelligent script that makes this a top-ten movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An instant cult classic made by an expert in cult classics,"Even if the critics don't give to his films their higher rating, and even if the massive audiences can't appreciate all that his films express, Terry Gilliam's movies (especially ""Brazil"", and ""12 Monkeys"") are some of the most important achievements of the 20th century's cinematography.""12 monkeys"" is a movie that explores cleverly themes like: Apocalypse, time travels, animal rights, science risks, insanity (a recurrent Gillam's theme), and even the movies its self (especially and that great tribute to Hitchcock' Vertigo, and with the multiple cuts to a cartoon scene on TV). All that have been put together in 2 hours of a stylish cinematography, spectacular art direction, intelligent script and ""as disturbing as brilliant"" performances from the three leads and the notable supporting cast.It's a movie made for the real movie fans more than the massive public, which, at least along my personal request, didn't like it too much. It's better like that, because so we can have a little treasure of our own... Don't you think?",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Death by the pursuit of a cure,"Twelve Monkeys is a really intriguing and different kind of science-fiction film, presenting the fantastic idea that we can't change our past and can only learn from it, to a very literal degree.The setup and exploration of the iterated apocalypse was intriguing, built up with minimal dialogue, great direction with wide and establishing shots, and fantastic set, costume, and prop design. The cast were all really good, with Bruce Willis giving a more manic-yet-sombre performance, and Brad Pitt having a much more crazed and deranged performance. The story as well as the themes of time travel and how nothing can change what's already done were really compelling, making a great mystery-thriller out of what could've been a typical 'change the past to save the future' plot.And on that note, the only nitpick that I found was present was that some of the time travel logic doesn't always check out, when considering that small interactions can potentially have colossal repercussions. But aside from that minor oversight the movie is really entertaining.Overall, the intriguing investigatory angle and well-defined rules helps Twelve Monkeys stand out as something truly different in the science-fiction genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
