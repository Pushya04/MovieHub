One of the greatest British horrors ever made.,"Focusing on the fear of claustrophobia with the simple dread of the unknown, The Descent puts likable characters in frightening situations. As a horror fanatic, this film floats at the top of my list of best scary films in recent years. The setup feels like it moves quickly and seamlessly into the main storyline, but that's because it's so beautifully shot, well-acted, and scripted so that we know and care enough about the characters to worry once they belay down into the dark cave. This character knowledge carries weight throughout the movie, as the group variously splinters and works together to escape. Shocks and jolts start before the central scare appears. And props to an all-woman cast that feels totally natural and not slapped together to achieve cheap feminist self-congratulations. Well-acted and atmospheric, I recommend this movie to anyone wanting to see a solid, scary horror movie that doesn't reinvent the genre, but definitely strays from the norm.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The ultimate claustrophobia,"The Descent is a little Alien, some Predator, and quite an amount of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The story involves a group of cave explorers' journey through a deep cave, two miles underground. They don't necessarily make a great team-they seem unplanned, and we would go on to the third act, and figure out that they lack strategy as well. That is when some of the members become badass heroines, joining the bloodfest in the cave, where the unknown lies await.Simplistic as it is, The Descent offers an excellent atmosphere and very creative moments. The opening shows a shocking event that becomes a minor plot device. The entire first half is a better adventure film than a horror one; the team's first enemy is the landscape. There are lots of ""setup"" shots showing items that will inevitably appear later. Writer/Director Neil Marshall has an impressive style, especially for some amazingly lighted claustrophobic scenes.The thing is, these wonderful 50 minutes set my expectation high, that I found the latter half underwhelming. Fake jumpscares are a prominent element in the movie. There is so much of it that the real ones are less effective. The tone makes a 180-degree shift, changing to a lot of gory fights and killings. They should be thrilling experiences, but the problem is I simply can't see what's going on, because: 1. The scenes are extremely dark, which is realistic but unworkable for fight sequences. 2. The team all have the same gear, look, and voice. I have a hard time distinguishing them. 3. The editing makes a shift as well; the cuts are intensely quick, making my eye sore by looking at it for too long.But The Descent is a sufficient horror movie, because it is so interestingly constructed, and Marshall has great talents. Watching the characters, the situation and the film itself descend into madness is of great fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good gore movie,"An interesting and differentiated horror movie in the ""gore"" style. It is above average for the genre. It started slowly, but after half it became interesting, maintaining a tense atmosphere, a little frightening and claustrophobic. The atmosphere is good. It can be divided into two parts: before and after the cave. You sit on the armchair during the exhibition with that feeling of agony and distress. It escapes from the usual clich√©s to the genre, having an unconventional and surprising ending. There are some logic flaws in the plot and the characters, but nothing that compromises the story. The curiosity is to see the cast practically all feminine. It's worth as entertainment. I recommend it to all lovers of horror art.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliantly tense from start to finish,"With Dog Soldiers, Neil Marshall created a tight and claustrophobic atmosphere then added the scares to create a very good horror film. However, the tension was often released with humour and the audience were allowed to catch their breath and relax. At no point in The Descent are you allowed to relax as Marshall grabs your attention within the first few minutes and doesn't let go until the credits roll at the end.With the film set almost entirely underground, the lack of light is used to wonderful effect and Marshall keeps you on edge for 100 minutes; if you liked Dog Soldiers, 28 Days Later and/or Haute Tension and are sick of the formulaic rubbish being pumped out of Hollywood then The Descent is likely to be right up your street.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining,"It's not exactly subtle and relies on a lot of the standard tricks of the horror genre, but this is one frightening, claustrophobic film. I love the nearly all-female cast, all of whom are pretty badass when push comes to shove. Make sure you watch the original UK release, as it has an extended ending which is as dark as those subterranean caverns.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Perhaps Too Grim To Be A Total Success,"I really enjoyed Neil Marshall's DOG SOLDIERS and knew right away that here was a genre director to keep an eye on . For some strange reason it wasn't until tonight that I got round to seeing THE DESCENT and felt disappointed with it . If you're after a film that delivers buckets of gore and has you jumping out of your seat then you will not be disappointed . If however you're after a film that has the same sort of charm as DOG SOLDIERS then you'll be as disappointed as I wasThat's the problem with THE DESCENT because it lacks any sort of charm , humour or warmth and unfortunately if you liked one of Neil's films you'll probably dislike the other . The one problem I had with DOG SOLDIERS is that it took a long time to get into its stride and it's possibly the only thing it shares with this film , though to be honest it's worse in that respect because we have to wait almost a whole hour before the monsters turn up and until then we have to endure a girls get together in the remote American wilderness . Compare this narrative structure to something like 28 DAYS LATER which instantly draws the audience into the story , or even better 28 WEEKS LATER which has an absolutely awesome opening ten minutesRight away you can see the difference between the two movies . In one we have good natured British squaddies complete with a blokey attitude while in the other we have a cosmopolitan bunch of unsympathetic women who I found very annoying , so much so that I found myself cheering for the monsters . Not a very charitable attitude I know but compare this with the characterization of Sgt Wells , Coop and Spoon from the earlier movie where you couldn't not like the characters . Likewise throughout THE DESCENT there's a totally grim , bleak and nihilistic atmosph ere that is reflected in thestoryline and you won't feel like smiling after watching this . You can make the argument that Neil Marshall has made two horror films that are poles apart and you'd be right , but shouldn't a horror film be fun ? Isn't this the reason why DOG SOLDIERS was so enjoyable ?Despite my criticism THE DESCENT was met with critical and commercial success and put Neil Marshall on the map in America . Seeing as we have a horror director who can make very different genre films I can't help thinking that if the rumoured 28 MONTHS LATER makes it into production then Neil Marshall would be a strong contender for director . One common criticism of the first two films in the franchise is that the second halves have a problem sustaining the momentum which is not a problem I've seen with this director's previous work and a grim , downbeat ending would be more in keeping with the 28 franchise than with this type of horror movie",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great,"I loved it, I went in expecting something along the lines of ""Dog soldiers"", something funny and enjoyable but instead I got a roller coaster ride of tension and fear. So often these days horror movies just aren't scary, they make you jump they have a little bit of atmosphere and that's it, well this film was scary. It was tense, well acted, and the director made great use of the setting to scare the hell out of you. I don't want to go in to a lot of detail in this review, as I don't want to spoil the experience for anyone who reads it, and that is what this film is an experience I came out of the cinema shaking. This film is well worth your time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A movie full of tension every minute,"If you are afraid even when you watch a horror movie with your friends or family, I think that movie is really scary. This movie is one of them. Unlike classic horror movies, the story and locations of the movie are very different. A horror movie that is way above its rating. Definitely worth watching..After watching the first movie, you will definitely want to watch the second movie as soon as possible. Of course, if you actually have the courage to watch it. Some scenes can be extremely disturbing. I definitely think that people under the age of eighteen should not watch it. But it's a great movie for adults.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An excellent horror movie,"The concept of crawling through tight, winding, unfamiliar tunnels is scary enough. But, of course, this movie moves far beyond that.This movie has a great setup with a close group of long time friends having fun and reuniting for different outdoor adventures.From the beginning the directing is great. You really get a sense of adventure and the anxiety/excitement that goes into exploring a cave. It portrays it well and brings home the endeavor that cave exploration is.The story is engaging as it builds. They run into natural trouble that's bad enough. But then the dire situation becomes far worse.This movie is genuinely suspenseful. The gore is well done. The characters are sympathetic. The emotion builds to a fever pitch.There are some shocking elements to the ending.It is a great movie and there is no way it should be rated anything less than an 8 out of 10.It really is well done. With relatable characters you can actually care about. It's considered a classic by many for a reason. It's legitimately uncomfortable, suspenseful and scary. And well directed. It's just a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This frightening British  movie concerns about a women group being trapped into claustrophobic caves,"The film begins when a woman has a tragic car-crash ; one year later , six friends (Shauna McDonald, Nalie Mendoza, Alex Reid, Nora-Jane , Buring , Muldder) gather together for a caving hick . But the expedition gets horribly worse when a rockfall collapses and blocks the dark way out . After delivering further into the cavern , the group of girls encounter a pack of carnivorous , crawling creatures are waiting for them . Then , they find themselves chased by bloodthirsty , predatory monsters which have added them to his food chain . Furthermore , their friendship is deteriorated and undertake a desperate fighting to survive and confronting each other .The picture contains thrills , chills , tension , drama, and lots of blood and gore . This terrifying movie packs a certain similarity to 'The cave (2005)' (by Bruce Hunt with Piper Perabo , Lena Headley , Eddie Cibrian) ; both films have virtually the same features , women being trapped in a dark cave , a half dozen of adventurers with peculiar characters and ultimately ominous human-alike that look relatives from bats determined to prey them . The difference is that 'the Descent' is more horrifying , terrifying and shocker than 'The Cave' with a fantastic , unreal , and Alien style . The theme of people being stranded in a hostile , dangerous environment with attackers creatures is justly reminiscent of 'Pitch black' . The sets are realistic with underground scenarios shaped by formations and spaces that one might watch in certain impression , conveying a sense of vertical scale .Suspenseful musical score by David Julyan (Prestige , Memento ,Insomnia), Christopher Nolan's usual musician . Photographed in Southern England though set in the Appalachians by Sean McCurdy , Neil Marshall's habitual cameraman who created a perfect atmosphere . The producers considered it too risked and perilous to shot in an actual cave , it also would have been far too time-consuming , so they opted to build one instead . The motion picture was decently directed by Neil Marshall with splendid visual style . He's expert in making brutally violent horror movies (Doomsday ,Dog soldiers) . Rating: Good , better than average , the film is rated PG-13 for lots of guts, gore and violence.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Leaves you sitting on your lunch,"The descent is purely terrifying. It will provide you with an  experience that relates entirely to those of the characters on screen.  Each one is trapped, isolated and alone. In that theatre, you will  understand the fear of having no escape.  The film, like it's big brother 'Dog Soldiers', takes British horror to  it's deserved glory. Unlike such films as 'Creep', which was a complete  mess, The Descent is a chilling experience that places believable  characters into a situation that is strangely real, despite the obvious  fiction.   After a quarter of the film has passed, you pray for the characters  escape as, in a way, you will also be saved from the mental onslaught  that drives into your mind throughout.  I didn't expect anything from this film before I walked into the  theatre it, yet it is the greatest horror I have ever seen, and am  likely to for a very long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
They never learn!,"The Descent is a good addition to the horror genre and is directed by the same guy who directed Dog Soldiers.The story is a group of woman go exploring dark caverns with one just recovering from a mental breakdown following the loss of her husband and daughter. But this still has some of the oldest horror clich√©s such as the cast (all women) delve deeper into the unknown caverns they are exploring instead of retreating (but this is just an excuse to get some victims for the movie), because of this it's great when they meet the creatures lurking in the darkness. The gore is great and the creatures fascinated me.This wasn't scary but it's a good way to pass 90 mins and most horror fans will love it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Architectural Darkness,"Regular readers of my comments know I am interested in cinematic architecture.There's built space of course, but much cooler is when a filmmaker deals with the non-physical: architectural fire or water. Smoke.And then there's perhaps the hardest of them, architectural darkness. Form of the formless, containment by absence, the pressing in of the absence of light.""Ghosts of Mars"" did a bit of it, poorly, and it is exceedingly rare overall. That's why I celebrate any attempt. This isn't great, but it has some competence and lessons.If you don't know this little film, it has a long setup period where we have a group of young women ¬ó not girls, surely ¬ó who arrange to be stranded in a cavern with a threat.There are monsters but the threat is the dark. This isn't terrific cinematic engineering, that part all seems to be hit and miss. But it does have terrific pacing overall and that attention to pacing extends to the use of darkness and the various lighting devices they have at their disposal.Much use is made of the point of view nature of the lighting: flashlights and cameras and even after they are gone much of the blocking uses those sensibilities. Its a subtle fold, but so very effective. It makes us see what these women do and joins us to them in terror.There's an effective plot device that pings off this. One of our women has visions, which we follow until we have our legs pulled out from us and her. The ending has one of these ¬ó two endings ¬ó where we aren't quite sure which is real and which imagined. The idea that both are true is the most unsettling.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good Scary Movie,"When I read that ""The Descent"" featured an all women cast I expected a T+A extravaganza with spelunkers in too tight T-shirts and panties cavorting beneath the earth. I was disappointed. What I saw was a scary movie. I am not by nature claustrophobic but a few scenes of the close quarters they were climbing through left me squirming in my seat. I can't continue the review without issuing a SPOILER alert since I will be discussing critical movie facts. The movie was very spookily lit with looming shadows and false colors and was expertly designed. The creatures living below ground were creepy and scary since often they were only glimpsed in the shadows. I hadn't expected the death count to be so high nor the movie to be so bloody. I flinched often during the movie due to the sudden appearance of the creatures or from the wounds suffered by the cast. The pace of the movie once they began the cave exploration was very fast and of course with this type of movie a deeper examination of the facts reveals some plot holes but events move too fast for reflection. I can't say I liked or agreed with some events in the end of the movie. I think Juno, maybe not the best person in the group, was unfairly judged and condemned. None the less the movie was very effective in scaring me and holding my attention. The fact that it had, primarily, an all women cast was hardly noticeable. This is not a chick flic. Worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Magnificent gore fest,"The Descent is an exceptionally good film. I just wanted to state that at the start of this review, because it is easy to dismiss a film like The Descent as having some good gore scenes, but little else to commend it from a directorial or cinematographic point of view. However, with what must have been a budget that pales into insignificance when compared to films like Ring 2, the film packs in top class gore with exquisitely detailed 'creatures' and brilliantly claustrophobic cinematography.Films with great gore abound, for example Jason X, with the audience just waiting for the next gruesome killing to end the tedium in between. However, The Descent keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout, struggling for breath as you feel the walls in the cinema closing in. This is a film to watch in a very dark cinema with great surround sound. You almost feel the creatures closing in around you.I would have given 10 out of 10, but some of the acting is not top class, so that brings it down to 9 out of 10 for me. That aside, this is a must watch film for those who complain that horror films just aren't scary anymore. Just make sure that whoever you take with you is prepared for the experience. Word of mouth is sure to make this film a success.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprising!,"We're all afraid of what lives deep in the oceans, we're all afraid of what may live out in space, but you really have to respect this film in exploiting the fears of what may live deep in the earths crust. The movie is really scientifically accurate (if you're not a nerd like me though, that probably doesn't matter). I love the design of the monsters, they're like some kind of bat-human hybrid. The movie has plenty of suspense, infuriating moments and character situations, and monster creature screen time, which is what people like me want the most.

"Finally, I lived to see a good horror film!","I actually wanted to go see Mr and Mrs Smith but it was showing too late in the evening so we chose this one, not having a clue what it was about.I read the synopsis, a team of women exploring some cave and finding they were not alone...Well, just prepare yourself for your worst nightmare, because once it starts, it doesn't stop until the end.Just brilliant!!!

"Girls, mutants and gore...what's not to like?","A good sophomore from from Neil Marshall that'll have gorehounds and fans of genre horror grinning from ear-to-ear.The film suffers slightly from a lack of decent characterisation. You simply don't feel much for any of the ""chicks with picks"" protagonists. It's not, however, meant as a deep and thoughtful character study, it's strictly genre horror and as such is certainly bloodthirsty enough and contains a level of inventive killings and shocks to satisfy a fan of the genre.I do feel that due to the director's decision to play it entirely straight as opposed to having an element of tongue-in-cheek means that the film won't be as re-watchable as Dog Soldiers was.Still, beats the crap out of any of the predictable kiddy-horror Hollywood's been responsible for of late, and as such should be applauded. I for one can't wait for someone to hand Marshall a decent-sized cheque and tell him to go have fun.Basically, if you like your thrills'n'chills with a splattering of gore then The Descent is a fun way to kill a couple of hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Descent Sacres Good,"A friend picked The Descent as a film for us to see together and I wasn't all that excited about the choice. I was very mistaken. The Descent is a scary fun film. If you're claustrophobic or in general just don't like tight spaces then you might find this film particularly unnerving. The descent down into the tiniest caves and crevices of the earth gave me considerable anxiety. During their exploring of the caves they start to get the feeling that they are not down there alone. Something else is down there but just not sure what it is. That alone creates even more tension and fright to be down a space like that with some unknown creature around. It was at this time that for me it went in a different direction with the creatures becoming the new central element of the story. This is fine but it kind of turned into a more typical killer monster/creature thing. Sure they idea of the creatures being down there is good but the extent to which they are utilized was a bit too much for me. Despite this one criticism, The Descent is definitely a film to check out.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Formulaic, but expertly done","I've never been one for adrenalin addiction action sports. If I had to pick one it probably wouldn't be pot-holing. One enthusiast explains the attraction: "". . . as much a psychological as well as a physical activity. You should be prepared to push the envelope as far as both your mind and body are concerned, but the rewards are endless. Try this exciting and challenging sport and you will see how it allows your imagination to run wild as it takes you to the brink of what is both challenging and mysterious."" I went to see this nasty little blood-soaked movie wondering whether I would thrill to find a genuinely new British horror innovation, or alternatively just enjoy a camp and less-than-scary diet of gore-fest. (Yes, sad as it is, I am a fan of horror movies.) The Descent turned out to be neither of the two main categories but, in its merciful 99 minutes, delivers a better share of shocks than most.Six strong, capable women (one of them recovering from a traumatic bereavement) set off into the Appalachian Mountains for a pot-holing experience. They seem like regular, good looking and intelligent women, mostly with some pot-holing experience. Even before we go underground (especially if you've seen the trailer) the litany of psychological challenges are promising, as the self-appointed leader of the group lists claustrophobia, paranoia, and a host of other hurdles to jump.The film has been expertly put together, however formulaically. There is the initial attention-grabbing horrific incident in the first few minutes, the type of female characters that are designed to appeal to women as well as men, skillful editing to make you drop your popcorn by letting you relax momentarily first (so the sudden shock is greater), a cutesy kid, very effective use of light and dark, monsters that have some 'reasonable' connection with their environment, and a reality factor from the interesting mechanics of climbing down into caves and how you cross seemingly impossible chasms. Once it gets under way, there is little or no pause for light relief. You make a prediction to yourself about how many if any will get out alive, then sit back and have the wits scared out of you.Comparisons to Creep are valid - the storyline and mutants have some similarity, as do the pacing and denouement. Those to Deliverance and Aliens less so - those two were outstanding movies involving deep character development and masterly pacing - in category way beyond this Saturday-night shocker. But The Descent delivers on its promise of being very, very scary for the time you're in the cinema. You won't go home looking over your shoulder for monsters, but if you're easily unnerved you're probably better off not leaving home in the first place.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
incredibly boring,"Well, this review doesn't contain any spoilers, since this movie was so tedious, so awful, so boring, that I couldn't make it very far into it, truth be told.The characters are mostly incredibly annoying. Loud, obnoxious, dumb, phony, idiotic. I hated all but the quieter one immediately and thoroughly.I've wised up over the years, and don't give a bad movie much slack anymore. Inevitably, my guts are right, and they never get better, despite a pack or morons having rated it highly enough to encourage me to take a gander. So I quit it, and took a closer look at the poor comments here at IMDb, which I should have done before watching it.How it garnered an average score of 7.3 is beyond me. But then, people eat trash all the time and call it good..It sucks. It's amateurish, lame, and pointless. Save your precious time.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good film and better than the bog standard Hollywood fare we're used to,"Superior British horror movie sets tense claustrophia with old fashion suspense and comes out on top.There have been a lot of less than impressive horror movies in recent years, particularly out of Hollywood. Cabin Fever is a prime example of such a sub-standard flick and there are many more. One distinct advantage British horror has is a true grittiness to it, a kind of 'realness' which makes the characters a lot easier to identify with.In The Descent we follow the fortunes of an all female cave exploration team who are going on an adventure in a mountain range. The purpose of this expedition is to bring them all together after the hideous events of the previous year which are revealed at the beginning of the movie.It's not a particularly big name cast with perhaps Saskia Mulder as Rebecca who also appears in the BBC's Book Club the best known actress on display. Certainly the most recognisable. However, the strength of this movie isn't in its star acumen, but rather in its story telling and direction.The Descent is claustrophia in abundance; tight cave systems barely give room to breath, and the overwhelming darkness compounds it ten fold. In this movie, light is at a premium.As for the horror side of it, well let's just touch on the fact that there are rather unfriendly cave dwellers (Who it must be admitted look successfully hideous) who intend to make life difficult for our heroines. They also sound vile - a testament to the sound engineers and overall design of these characters.Gore levels are impressive without being over the top, and what would a horror movie be without its gore? On that note although this could easily be classified as horror, I would also class it under suspense and claustrophobic dark thriller.The direction is uniformly effective, but the insatiable darkness and occasional fast action do tend to make certain parts a bit confusing. It's a small price to pay for what is overall a very useful technique in terms of film making - although it should be added that it's quite unique as deployed here.Overall, this is a good film and worth your attention. It's certainly one of the better horror films I've seen for sure. The ending clinched it for me for sure.Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The brilliance of Dog Soldiers and the intensity of  Aliens to create The best horror film in years,"Ten.... wow is that is a high rating.

Pretty good action-horror film for 2005.,"I watched this film many years ago. It totally rocked when it finally started moving. One must consider this was a 2005 film cast with all women cave explorers. How unique and sexy was that? I absolutely hated the woman that lied and got them trapped in the first place, Juno. I wanted to kill her myself, which means the writers did their job by making me emotionally vested (good or bad) in their character. Not to mention, she was fine!!! I absolutely love brunettes.The whole cave dwelling creatures plot caught my attention as I am a city-rat from birth. I have never been in a cave. After watching this film, I never wanted to go inside one (lol). What often gets overlooked are the actors who play the creatures. They did a phenomenal job and brought a lot to the suspenseful scenes.Although this film isn't epic. It was a cool change of horror especially for 2005. I don't know how they filmed some of the scenes but they had me convinced they were deep inside a maze riddled cave.As a horror flick, the blood and gore is on par with the bloodiest goriest flicks you can imagine. Its horror. What do viewers expect? One scene involving basically a swimming pool of blood and muck, took gross to new levels.I gave this movie an extra point for the setting, the creatures, and the human villain (she is fine!!!).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well it is another one of these.,"Without spoiling the ""PLOT"" this is actually a very common bad slasher direction.You will get it very quick after the movies gets done with bad acting intros for the extreme sports chicks who mostly aren't.I actually like this premise and if they had 2 actors in the whole movie it might have been good.Sadly it is apparently supposed to take place in North Carolina but is in Scotland. ""failed plot twist or weird error""
Every actor has a different and thick british/uk accent and that will bother some.As with all these movies there is no balance or precedent.Just silly scenarios that are missed opportunities.Funny I waited 19 years to be bored to death for what felt like 2 hours.This may be better for Women, I cannot speak to that.I would not watch again.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant,"I read an interview with the director Neil Marshall that he had read a review of (the excellent) Dog Soldiers where the reviewer asked ""when will a British director make a genuinely scary Horror?"".Gauntlet thrown, the result was the Descent.I have always liked this movie. It is genuinely scary. It's claustrophobic, atmospheric and extremely well made.It is also a growing force that asks a different question each time I watch it.Basic story is a group of friends go caving in an uncharted cave system, get stuck, realise they're not alone and have to fight for survival against a subterranean population of mutated humanoids. It is much, much more that that. Early on the main character suffers unimaginable trauma which hits you hard. The caving trip happens a year later and the groups is still hugely grief stricken (for various reasons) and the trip is an attempt to restore some semblance of the lives they used to know.The film is about grief.There are also overtones of female identity. An all female cast, an exploration of what it is to be a mother and a wife and I've even read about the cave system itself being representative of a woman's body. I'm not sure if that's intentional or not but it's interesting.The film is about womanhood.What is fantastic about this movie is the ending. It's a little ambiguous and very much open to interpretation. Pretty bleak either way. Theories abound as to what the descent is. A descent into a cave system or a descent into madness. Our final glimpse of Sarah might indicate the latter and that then poses questions about the whole movie.The film is about madness.It's a proper horror and a cracking piece of British cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good flick but why the crawlers?,"For the most part I enjoyed this movie. The table was set at the beginning with two friends, a probable affair, tragic accident and an opportunity to re-visit/resolve issues while on a cave spelunking adventure with friends. I felt within the first few minutes of the movie that the direction, script and characters were well developed and could lead to a great movie. The tension between the two main characters was great and pretty well acted. The cave scenes were also excellent for generating a wonderful sense of isolation and foreboding.The problem I had with the film was that it was really two movies in one with the director unable to decide which way to go. The conflict could have played out well in so many different ways without so many other characters involved. I also felt the crawlers were overplayed and maybe even unnecessary except for creating ambiguity surrounding Sarah's actions at the end toward Juno. Was it revenge, or an act of survival?As it is I suppose it's a (decent) horror flick because of the creatures and blood, but it could have been an amazing adventure/thriller without.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Almost there, but not quite.","The first half is actually rather good, playing with claustrophobia and fear of heights¬Ö until the creatures start attacking, just before the 1 hour mark. Then you realize that the film's antagonists are inconsistent, nonsensical, and incredibly incompetent until the script calls for them to specifically kill someone.The monsters appear to be some kind of subhuman carnivores (who have been around for a long time, judging from the amount of animal remains and blood we see). They've evolved in the darkness to be blind night hunters - but they suck at using every single sense except hearing. One actually places its hand on a girl's head while looking for her, then starts to move on. Seriously, you can't tell the difference between a human head and ROCK? The monsters also don't seem to have a sense of smell. One of the humans says ""they must navigate through sound"" but the monsters don't appear to have developed any kind of echolocation whatsoever, which in real life would make a blind predator unable to even navigate the network of caves it calls home. And despite living in darkness, the creatures (1) are shown to hunt outside of their caves (2) don't exhibit the traits of light sensitivity despite their eyes giving the impression that they should. Instead, they seem almost drawn to light, and don't recoil when it's shoved in their faces. So despite being blind, they also rely on sight, but can't seem to see anything properly¬Ö yes, this is a massive plot hole.The monsters are literally impossible. There's no rhyme or reason to how they navigate, why they attack the way they do, or¬Ö pretty much do anything that they do. They're shitty unrealistic villains.Even The Cave (2005) had better monsters, and those things looked much less realistic. Yet they had echolocation and were fittingly competent within the narrative.I also disliked the ending of The Descent. I'm not sure if it's a good or bad ending, but my first impression is dislike. There's a theory about the monsters not being real, but I'm pretty iffy about the validity of that considering a sequel was made. At any rate, as some IMDb users have said (see the discussion board for this movie), the monsters sucked and should have been (1) excluded, or (2) completely rewritten. Their appearance was fine - the costume/prop department did a good job - just their behavior was terribly written. Almost every scene with a monster should have been redone.The Descent could have been a terrific horror film. Instead, it's closer to mediocrity. The film IS still entertaining but the monsters are remarkably disappointing, as are a few other things in last 30 minutes or so.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Descent is a low-budget thriller with horror elements,"The Descent is a low-budget thriller with horror elements. With such a small budget, it's hard to expect anything good, or at least a Cave-level movie of the same year. But how unsatisfactory is The Descent in everything better than Cave. But unless the cast in The Descent is not remarkable at all and that's it. The Descent is able to captivate the viewer for 100 minutes, which Cave did not succeed in my opinion. Yes, here everything is filmed simply and cheaply. But suspense is the most important thing? And here it is and is balanced throughout the film. I advise everyone to watch who is interested in the topic of speleology and thrillers with closed spaces. And I definitely advise you to watch 2 part.

Excellent,"In the times of crappy horror remakes and weak, watered down movies comes The Descent. The Descent is a original, claustrophobic, dark and disturbing horror flick that also has solid acting, great locations and some brutal gore. A group of adventurous (and attractive) women go on a cave exploring expedition. This ill fated vacation goes awry when they realize they are in the home of bat like creatures that don't take too kindly to their presence. Writer/director Neil Marshall proves to be a master of terror that gives its nods to Alien, Deliverance and The Thing. Like The Thing, having it being a ensemble piece with one gender leave no room for any love interests, but focus on the characters, the group and their tension among them, as well as their need to survive the ordeal. The all female cast did great and was not afraid to get physical or get dirty. The Descent holds up very well and Neil Marshall is a director that I would like to work on major theatrical movies more often.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"the deeper you go, the horror you find","After making his directorial debut with ""Dog Soldiers"", Neil Marshall turned his attention underground with ""The Descent"", about some women who explore an uncharted cave, only to discover the horrifying reason why it remains unknown.This is almost certainly one of the most claustrophobic movies out there. It was interesting to see a horror movie with a mostly female cast; I suspect that the movie passed the Bechdel test. One scene towards the end reminded me of an intense watery scene towards the end of ""Poltergeist"".All in all, it feels like something that could actually happen - to some extent, anyway. If you've ever had an interest in speleology, this is sure to temper it. Like ""As Above, So Below"", it reminds us that we don't fully know what lies beneath the Earth's surface.

I always look for innovative cinematography and there is plenty of creative shots here.I especially love the gritty bloodshot look of the cave scenes, and how there is little detail to make out the immediate surroundings in the quieter darker shots of the movie, but just enough that the foreground looks so much more menacing.I love the amateur feel of this film and it is definitely one I'm glad I didn't sleep on.

Something Truly Special in the Horror Genre,"This movie is a nail-biter. I would even label it a classic. It's full of thrills, horror, adventure, and even a little mystery.

As if being lost in a cave isn't scary enough, this cave is full of creatures that 6 women must battle while searching for a way out. The creatures inhabiting this cave are truly terrifying. Their appearance is blood-curdling and their screams will send shivers down your spine. Before the creatures even make their appearance, we're unnerved with claustrophobia as we watch the women crawl their way through tight, dark tunnels. It's also a fun element that rather than being helpless victims, these women decide to fight back. These characters are strong, intelligent, likable, and relatable. You can't help but be invested in their journey. Brace yourself as you venture into this cave. It will have you on the edge of your seat.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

But apart from all this the Descent contains something that every horror film should utilize- a good screenplay and characters one can relate to/side with.

The movie works great once the girls move underground. At that point, the girls don't really have to be distinctive to be good. That is one of the minor problems of the movie. The girls are not unique enough. The movie should have started with the two most important personalities Sarah and Juno. Those two needed better actresses to play them especially Sarah.

The Descent (2005) ***,"Marshall improves on the promise shown in his earlier DOG SOLDIERS (2002) with this nail-biting sleeper. After a slowish start in a belated female DELIVERANCE (1972) mode, the film piles on the shocks and the gore with unfaltering expertise. The all-female cast members are relative newcomers, a factor which adds immeasurably to their vivid portrayal of women out of their league fighting the elements, the supernatural and, at times, themselves. It is to the director's credit that he deliberately withholds the appearance of the ""Crawlers"" (with their creepily effective Graf Orlok-like make-up) for as long as he does; if I were to nitpick, I would say that I would have liked for them to have been given a different 'voice' - which to me sounded far too similar to that of the creatures in Guillermo Del Toro's MIMIC (1997). The surprise, downbeat, open-ended 'twist' ending, then, is ultimately the natural progression to the relentless grimness of what has gone on before.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Highly Enjoyable British Horror Entry,"From the Director of DOG SOLDIERS comes a very well made ""mainstream"" horror film. I have, for the most part, given up on current theatrical horror films (with a few notable exceptions...) but THE DESCENT gives me hope that horror audiences are still interested in seeing some good ol' ""blood n' guts"" with their horror films, and that these films can still be intelligent and well-done. Although this film has not yet been released theatrically in the U.S., I hear it's coming (although I'm sure it will be chopped to death...) and this is one that I would recommend to any real horror fan.Sarah and her friends are extreme sports enthusiasts who enjoy activities like rafting and caving. When Sarah's husband is the victim of a brutal accident and killed (in a scene that ""jump-starts"" the film right in the first few minutes...), she has a hard time coping with the loss. Cut to 1 year later and Sarah's friends determine that it's time to help get Sarah back on her feet and into some of her old activities. They plan an ""all-girls"" trip to explore a cave system in the Appalachian mountains. Little do any of the other girls know, that Juno, the organizer of the expedition, has planned a trip into a previously uncharted cave system in the hopes of claiming a little fame and recognition. This obviously isn't such a smart idea for a group of novice spelunkers, and things start to go downhill pretty quickly. Along with such setbacks as injuries, cave-ins, and the mental stress that the girls undergo when they realize that they may be in a life-or-death struggle just to get out of the caves - we then become aware that the group of explorers are not the only ones currently inhabiting the caves - and this is where the film REALLY takes off...THE DESCENT is nearly perfect in almost every way. The tension and claustrophobia of being trapped in an unknown cave system is palpable. The gore comes pretty hot and heavy in the second half of the film, and the ending of the film is appropriately surprising and bleak, without being corny. Another big plus in my book is that the ""creature"" FX aren't over-the-top and don't rely on much, if any CGI. When I first heard that THE DESCENT was a ""creature"" film, I was kinda worried because I feel that those types of films have gone severely down-hill with the advent of the over-use of CGI...but THE DESCENT doesn't fall into that category. Some of the acting isn't the greatest but it doesn't really detract from the film overall, and some seem to think that the first half of the film is slow. Personally, I think that the early sequences in the caves are a great ""tension-builder"" as things go from bad-to-worse, and right when you think it can't go any lower, the audience is clued in to the existence of the other ""inhabitants"" of the caves and and all hell breaks loose. THE DESCENT is an excellent film that shouldn't be ignored. Highly recommended - 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Descent is the very definition of claustrophobic horror.,"Trust me when I say this, it will make you think twice about setting foot into a cave. We follow a group of British women who decide to explore a famous cave system in America. Problem is, one ""smart cookie"" in the group decides to take it upon herself to guide the group into an unknown cave maze instead...where something else inhabits the darkness. That something being a large pack of blind cave dwellers that pretty much resemble the Falmer from Elder Scrolls (my best comparison). Oh, and they hunt and devour pretty much anything. This is a pretty decent gem from the horror genre. My main admiration has to go to director Neil Marshall who somehow took on the impossible challenge of filming in small narrow passages and dark caves. I'm sure dynamically recreated sets were utilised, but it felt authentic and a damn terrifying creepy environment. Embracing darkness is incredibly difficult, and consequently means the lighting has to be on point...fortunately it is. Flares, torches and fire all felt natural and added appropriate light so that we can visibly see our characters. Marshall's inventive direction and adventurous environment enhanced the claustrophobia needed to create the scares. There are some clever scenes, particularly when the Falmer (yup...I'm calling them that) are introduced. Night vision on a camcorder and quick movement of the head torches assist in some extremely effective techniques. The characters have glimpses of development and personality, especially Sarah, but probably not enough to actually care about them. Speaking of Sarah, can we just reflect on how she entered the cave as a scared fearful woman and yet somehow turns into Arnold Schwarzenegger of the cave world by the end. Even does the scream from Predator! The constant rapid cuts when the Falmer attack the humans made me slightly nauseous and made it difficult to differentiate what the heck was going on. However, this is a gory, claustrophobic, dark and often tense horror film that will appeal to genre enthusiasts.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

In terms of imagery its everywhere - wild and deadly fluctuations in mood against a backdrop of blood drenched passages. Everyone knows the definitive take on the subject is The Blob but this is a close second. Saturated in horrid, ovulating imagery its a pion to the desires of the flesh - those feelings that build to a bloody crescendo at a certain time.

One of those rare instant classics,"The Descent became an instant classic upon its release. Famous for it's all-female lead cast, its ultra-violent horror carnage, and almost unbearable suspense, the movie holds up as a great entry in the genre. The plot is pulse-pounding, and the deeper story is brilliantly told: a glance between two characters in the beginning; the subject of that glance completely ignored until the very end of the movie, but actually not ignored, as it sits like an anvil above the two main protagonists, feeding the story and the character development without so much as a word exchanged about it, not coming back again until the very end with the clever use of a prop, another shared look, and still no words exchanged. It's some of the most efficient but deep storytelling you'll ever encounter in a film, particularly in a horror movie.

A Descent Into Madness,"Neil Marshall has managed to create a low-budget but big-fright film in The Descent. And not all the scares happen when the predators are on screen.The setting of the caves themselves is enough to send any claustrophobic person into fits. But Marshall manages to stir up fear in those of us who don't suffer from it-and make us second-guess ever going cave exploring after seeing this thrill ride.Though I won't be getting into story specifics, I'm glad the film chose to focus on the story and characters for the first bit. You get a sense of who some of them are. And when the tension starts to ratchet up, you see who they really are.The camera work is tight, and though the low-budget effects are prevalent at some points, I personally don't mind them. There's a grittiness that comes with the film being set in the setting it is, and the less-than-impressive CGI doesn't hamper it too much.Likewise, the acting's solid. Both Shauna Macdonald & Natalie Mendoza give worthwhile performances, though the the other characters don't get as much development.The beasts/monsters/predators in this film also blend a uniqueness with tried-and-true horror.

"Nice spelunk-a-dunks, ladies!","Smothering. Suffocating. Stomach-churning. All words to describe the feeling of Rosie O'Donnell sitting on your chest (I lost a bet in college once; don't ask). But these words also accurately describe Lionsgate's European horror import The Descent. I wish ""scintillating story"" were two other ""s"" words I could use in my cute little description, but I guess we can't always have it all. Darn you Bogey and McCall!Be aware that this is a film for hardcore horror films. It's gory. Gorier than I expected. If you're not in the mood to see thumbs digging into eye sockets, heads being bashed against rocks, sharp objects going through jugulars, or the cringe-inducing sight of broken bones and gaping wounds then you might want to look for something a little lighter to satisfy your entertainment needs. If you're a self-admitted wuss then you'll probably feel more at home at a James Blount concert. But if you like a slice of horror served raw, gritty, and with nastiness to spare then The Descent will highly entertain.The atmosphere is effectively eerie, the tension is constant and claustrophobic, and the cave setting rarely allows a moment of comfort. Some of the best visuals happen even before we're introduced to the cave-dwelling creatures. I felt uneasy just watching these lovely ladies crawling through tight spots and hanging over cavernous spaces. The creatively subtle use of music only adds to the discomfort and helps make our anticipation of what's going to happen even more unsettling than what we eventually see play out on screen.I also really liked seeing a handful (plus one) of girls flex their toned little muscles and kick some monster rumpage. I don't always need my heroes to be big tough guys with five o'clock shadow to spare and cigars to chomp. Feel free to give me some ladies who are ready to throw down and refuse to cringe and cry in the corner. Of course, I prefer that they be fit and fairly good-looking. I am a male, after all. But the director is to be commended for using the ladies as more than mere window dressing.Granted, I'm not sure how the deformed-looking Gollum creatures could easily kill huge animals and strip them to the bone yet they were easily punked out by some skinny gals, but that's just one of those internal flaws that you have to resign yourself to not obsess over.There are a few of those throughout the film. The biggest flaw being that there isn't much story of which to speak. Read my plot description and you've got about 90% of the story. Though I do highly recommend that you pay careful attention to who's who and what's what at the very beginning. Otherwise, you might be confused as to why certain things happen at the end of the movie.There's still a good chance you'll be confused anyway because for some inexplicable reason the filmmakers decided to go the whole ""let's make the audience scratch their collective head and go huh?"" conclusion. Why? It's a disappointment. I wanted a finale that would really knock me over. Saw's final 10 minutes come to mind.I've heard that the European version's ending was more satisfying, so I guess I'll have to wait and see if the DVD gives me the closure I was craving. Something a little less clich√©d, perhaps. We know; women scorned have a lot of fury. Apparently Hell is no match for them. But come on, would... no, I won't say any more; I don't want to spoil anything, so I'm stopping here.The Descent won't appeal to all audiences, but it'll definitely please all you horror fans who are sick and tired of crap like When a Stranger Calls that thinks 90 minutes of a phone ringing is satisfactory tension.THE GISTIf you like your horror films loaded with atmosphere, tension, and gore then you'll be highly entertained by The Descent.

A year after Sarah's (Shauna McDonald) husband and daughter are killed, they get together near Juno's (Natalie Mendoza) cabin in the Appalachians to explore a cave.The ""Descent"" of the film is not just the descent into the cave, but a metaphorical allusion to hell, madness, and death. As things start to go wrong, friendship, and perhaps sanity, begin to rip apart.Setting is very important to The Descent, and though a bit unrealistic, the cave environment is very nicely detailed and well portrayed. The cinematography is excellent. Tension and horror are achieved without buckets of blood and gore, and the film suggests much more than it shows - to great effect. The film is tightly directed and very well edited - not surprising from Paul Marshall given his credentials.The story descends somewhat beyond the initial forays into unreality, but this is done with a level of insinuated ambiguity which implies something important about the plot. Avoiding a spoiler, I can not elaborate further... But anybody expecting a documentary from this film deserves what they get.A great deal of credit for making The Descent the success that it is should go to the ensemble cast. The two leads - Mendoza and McDonald give stellar performances, but the entire cast deserves credit for making this film stand apart from the pack. The extras on the DVD indicate that Marshall gave each of the women considerable space with which to flesh out their characters and it is suggested that some liberties were taken with the script as well. If this is so, then the creativity, talent, and intelligence of this bunch should not go overlooked. Each character is beautiful, beautifully developed, and beautifully played - and each in her very own way.The Descent borrows a bit from films such as Alien, Pitch Black and even Lord of the Rings (you will understand this when you see the film), but still, it is several steps above the average horror film.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gives you a good cheap scare.,"I can't stress this enough: This film is all about cheap scares. Almost every ten minutes, something else pops up on screen accompanied by a quick bass drum hit. In fact, this happens so much that by the end of the film, the constant shock horror becomes nearly comical. That said, the film keeps you on your toes and keeps you truly hoping that the next scare doesn't happen.So why such a low rating? Because this film has been done literally hundreds of times, and the horror movie audience is growing bored of it. While it may be one of the better ""creature features"" it doesn't mean I care to see another one.But like I said, it IS one of the better films of its genre. It's not groundbreaking; it's not terrifying; nor shall it make you deathly afraid of the caves, but it will make you jump. I just wish I wasn't chuckling after most of those jumps.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Preposterous Scenario, Horrible Creatures, No Scares, Little Tension, and Weak Characters","The descent is a disappointing horror gore-fest that is heavy on blood and light on scares and tension. The scenario is preposterous and the creature effects are beyond crap. The characters and the performances are weak. The film is not scary and the characters are unsympathetic, which is ultimately why the film is ineffective. The creatures are pathetic and look like poor versions Smeagol/gollum. The film gets worse as it goes along. The creatures really sink this film to junk levels. The attack/fight sequences look like crap and the camera work is quite inept at time. The lighting is probably the most effective element of the film. The Descent will no doubt benefit from the lowered expectations set by todays extremely low grade, assembly-line sanitized and saturated horror genre. The Descent is by no means a classic or even a good horror movie, but it is better than most of the schlock horror films we see today.Preposterous Scenario, Horrible Creatures, No Scares, Little Tension, and Weak Characters. 4/10 Avoid it unless you are a rabid horror movie fan.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"(8/10)- "" Good storyline, tense at times with okay acting"".","The Descent 2005 review "" Good storyline, tense at times with okay acting"". (8/10)Quite a pathetic beginning, with a lot of unnecessary details. The main concept was set out clearly though which helped the sense of adventure. It was a long while before the horror seemed to truly build, yet tension was met early on cleverly at a lower level. 
The sort of film which only gets better as time goes on.The lack of music and diverse range of gore, horror and despair worked well to keep the viewer entertained throughout the adventure. Relationships played a key part of the outcome and the film did well in bringing out personalities, and how they differed in traumatic moments.The film gives you a sense of context aswell throughout, keeping you aware of the significance of what is going on. The title is good and reflects enough to describe the themes of the movie, without spoiling the plot.I would have liked a little more music in tense moments and some modern effects in places as well. Cliff hangers were given which provided the opportunity for a sequel. I wouldn't rule out watching it based on this film.While in the opening the acting was a little overplayed, the expressions did get better throughout. The film could have given more tension, and became scarier with better acting.Overall the movie storyline was good, the acting wasn't great, but the tension was built well, with clever use of the camera and setting. I would recommend certainly for those into adventure horror as it is one of the better ones I've seen. For those looking for a truly epic film though, you may wish to look elsewhere.",,Anonymous,Horror

Perfect!,"This movie had me totally freaked out even before the real action started. It's been instantly relegated to my top horror flick list as well as my top movies with female heroes in it. It's not for the faint- hearted or weak-stomached and if you're claustrophobic (like me) you will struggle with it but persist!!! It's more than worth the effort. Superb direction, cinematography, acting and music.... everything in this is absolute top class! Shades of Alien & Predator amongst other things, one of the coolest things about this film is the wonderfully drawn characters of the female leads. One of the reviews here draws out the ""hidden"" story in this movie - relating to Sarah's subconscious which I really liked. I'll be watching the movie again with that in mind.Reading the negative reviews here I can only assume they watched a totally different movie or went into this one determined to dislike it despite how brilliant it is (for some unfathomable reason!!).

the low brow horror flick tricks,"Given, that when i rented this movie, i sorta new what i was in for. Cheap thrills with age old tricks of the trade to make you jump in your seat. The movie had a bit more depth in it, because of the work of the actors involved, but ultimately it came down to how the movie spun on. A regular pitch line, an excuse to do something dangerous or go someplace where you can't ask for help, in this case both. Blocking the path behind you, forcing you to go down a path, having to face the fears, in this movie choosing to not tell anyone where you were going, going into a cave no one else had gone previously, and then the cave-in. Tragedy to slow things down, the broken leg. Spike of things to come, seeing the creature.etc etc.after this movie i think i came to the conclusion that i'm worn out on these mundane single sided movies where there is a preset method to scare the viewer.1) when you're not on the screen you make no noise what so ever, person on screen turns around and BOO, a friend of yours is now 2 inches from your face ""you coming?""2) people lose about 50 IQ points when faced with danger and add to that an insurmountable curiosity to find out what the source is of every little noise they hear, mind you, without telling anyone about it first.3) the ""villain"" is willing to wait in the dark, 2 feet away from it's next potential victim and not make a sound or move, until said victim swings it's light source directly at the villains face, followed by a monster scream from both villain and victim.there are better ways to make a thriller, something that makes you squirm in your seat, but doesn't take use of the cheap tricks to startle you.good example : Red eye.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the most claustrophobic film ever made,"Besides BURIED, yes, this horror film, the best of the 2000's, is a pure gem, a pure masterpiece and of course the best film from director Neil Marshall.... It is also a women's tale, nearly two decades before the new fashion of strong women schemes. And one of the most famous film about speology, caving ever made. I also loved the sequel, made in 2009. Here, the acting is absolutely outstanding, the best ever for me for a horror film. It is an absolute must see. Neil Marshall opened the way for this kind of horror film, but so far, no other movie has matched this one. When I discovered this film in a movie theater, I literally suffocated, because I am myself a bit claustrophobic. A milestone if horror and survival mode genre. And there were hundreds of them since the seventies and DELIVERANCE, which was not a horror film. I will even say that the horror element - the crawlers - is not the best part of this movie, only the atmosphere, claustrophobic atmosphere, and the acting. The only horror film ever made with only women characters, except the crawlers creatures played mostly by men; And in the movie history, there were not so many features with only gals either....",,Anonymous,Horror
"tense, gory, and malicious","The Descent has effective special effects, and executes the claustrophobic feel of the film flawlessly from start to finish.

Claustrophobic survival horror thriller.,"Director Neil Marshall did a terrifc job. His previous film, dog soldiers is my fav too. Descent is loaded with horror, tension, suspense n action. The story follows six female friends, one of em still reeling from the death of her husband and daughter- as they embark on a caving expedition. One of em covertly changes the plans and takes the girls to an unmarked cave n like a true horror film they r trapped in it n under attack from forces ...... The movie effectively captures the atmosphere of being lost in the last possible place one would ever want to be lost. Though shot in a cave n wil hav more of scenes in dark, it was very well directed n one can make out what was going on. Marshall also establishes a slow-burning tension that develops between two friends and n allows it to boil over completely at the harrowing climax.

This is why cavers should leave a call-out...,"I am a caver, and knew that the sets were mostly studio before I saw it, so was very pleasantly surprised by just how good the sets are. A few inaccuracies- mostly the cast's clothing- but also some amazingly realistic touches: in the close-up of them rigging the traverse across the chasm, there is coloured tape around the krab (fastener) so the owner can tell it is theirs. Yep, we all do that. I also loved the part in the same scene where the first obsolete equipment is found in a ""new"" system... uh-oh. Also the night before, with them all drinking beer in the cabin- yes, all the cavers I know do exactly that!I liked the fact that the Crawlers mostly were real actors, not CG- much more work involved and they look good close-up.

B movie with better effects?,"wow up until now this movie has actually accumulated a score of 7.5 on average... I have to stop and ask myself how? The two lead actresses both seem to wholly overdo their parts, especially in facial expression which to many people I suppose wouldn't mean much, but to an avid viewer of Horror films such as myself, facial expression is often key to conveying the terror to the audience. Aside from this the acting was alright, nothing really notable, with as usual the best character being offed first (Holly). This all is very trivial in the scope of things. The real thing that makes this film awful is... the plot. First and foremost the creatures which suddenly decide to up and kill all of the hikers have zero background. None. We never even learn what they are by the end of the film. I was a little offended by this because I felt like this completely dumbed down the plot to the level of every B movie. There are people, along comes a monster and kills them all with no motive. Thats it. And to add to that the monsters even look like they're straight out of a B movie (either that or they were rejects for Gollum in Lord of the Rings). Now unless you plan on seeing this movie with someone who is very (and I mean very) easily scarred I would recommend skipping this movie and seeing the real deal movie by this director; Saw.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

A horror movie that does a great job on speluncaphobia,"I enjoyed this movie a lot and is another of my favorites. The opening of the movie is tragic in how Sarah loses her husband and daughter due to a car accident and how this affects her. The main story is great and interesting with a group of women going exploring into a cave and encountering something deadly. It's built up well with the introduction of the character, their exploring the cave, and what they encounter. I like how these characters are strong and supportive of how their goal is to find a way out of the cave and them fighting back. We also see how the creatures aren't the only thing threatening or creepy about the cave. There's a fear of claustrophobia, being trapped or stuck, getting lost, and the darkest surrounding the characters. Also, the characters encounter some strange or interesting stuff that shows the cave has a history over it. The movie is suspenseful and intense, with the characters trying to survive against the creatures and find a way out of the cave.There are about two endings to this movie, I won't spoil it, but I like the UK ending more than the US ending.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good horror flick, but its importance is exaggerated","The DescentAs a lifelong horror fan it takes a fair bit to get me excited about a fright-flick these days, but 'The Descent' had me rubbing my hands together. Back in 2002, British director Neil Marshall did the impossible and breathed new life into the werewolf archetype with his gory indie film 'Dog Soldiers'. I was lucky enough to interview him around the time of its DVD release and he was obviously a guy who knew his horror. So when I heard that The Descent was being hailed overseas as the scariest thing since 'The Blair Witch Project', I was pumped. Neil Marshall with more than $5 to spend? Hell yeah!'The Descent' starts out well, with a flashback road accident that is the stuff of nightmares ¬ñ enough to make even a hardened horror veteran flinch in his seat. The present-day narrative begins as we are introduced to Sarah, a woman who has recently lost her daughter and isn't taking it well. Juno, supposedly Sarah's friend, is an outwardly tough woman who has more or less abandoned Sarah in her time of emotional need.The estranged pair meet up again at a log cabin deep in the American forest, where they join a group of acquaintances ¬ñ thrill-seeking women who plan to rappel down into an underground cave and squeeze through its tight shafts to get their kicks. (Strong yet believable female characters ¬ñ an all-too-rare cinematic achievement.)They're a good mile or so underground when a rockfall blocks off the way they came in. No problem ¬ñ this cave is supposed to have two ways in and out, and the girls ask Juno to check the guidebook for information. Trouble is, the risk-loving Juno has taken them to an uncharted cave, hoping to claim it and name it. As they search for a way out, it becomes clear they aren't alone in the complex subterranean system. Something else is in there with them ¬Ö and it's not friendly.Neil Marshall, what have you wrought here? 'The Descent' is like a deformed hybrid of 'Aliens', 'Pitch Black' and 'Predator' that fails to measure up to any of its forebears. For a sadly short 20-minute period, 'The Descent' does create a cloying sense of claustrophobia akin to 'Aliens', and as he did in 'Dog Soldiers', Marshall caters to horror buffs by weaving homages unobtrusively into the plot. But these elements only serve to make the other 75 minutes a bitter disappointment.So what exactly is wrong with 'The Descent'? Cheap frights are one problem ¬ñ the unconvincing CGI bats that burst out of the cave entrance are an unpleasant entree hinting at the meal of the horror clich√©s to come (including those tired old 'Look behind you!' moments). The overuse of high-speed shutter is another ¬ñ in small doses it can give a scene a frenetic feel, but Marshall employs so much of it that it's often hard to tell what's going on at all. Lastly ¬ñ and this would be forgivable if everything else was up to scratch (see Pitch Black) ¬ñ the science regarding the cave creatures is all over the place.Now, there are two versions of the film out there, one for UK audiences and one for US audiences. The UK version (which we got in Australia) has a rather more ambiguous ending. But frankly both climaxes are unsatisfying and make The Descent seem like a $9 million version of the stories we all wrote in primary school that ended with, ""¬Ö and then I woke up.""By no means is The Descent a bad horror movie. The central premise is good, the acting more than competent and some of the sets are exceptional. But its significance in the overall history of horror films has been grossly exaggerated.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'm not sure I put this with the all time classics that some do but it is very entertaining and well done.,"The Descent (2005) is a film I recently rewatched on Tubi. The story follows a group of friends who go cave exploring, only to find themselves trapped after their entrance collapses. As they search for a way out, they realize they aren't alone in the cave.Directed by Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers), the film stars Shauna Macdonald (Mutant Chronicles), Natalie Mendoza (Moulin Rouge!), Alex Reid (Misfits), and Saskia Mulder (The Beach).The storyline, character development, and dialogue are all impressive. The lemon joke is a standout moment, and the ""don't trust her"" conversation adds real tension. The acting is better than expected for a horror film of this kind, and the makeup and special effects are top-notch. Several scenes are particularly memorable, like the pickaxe through the neck, Holly getting her throat ripped out, the mother creature reveal, the jump into the pool, and the final standoff between the friends. One moment that always makes me roll my eyes is when one of the characters is hanging from the rope with a knife in her mouth, but that's a small gripe in an otherwise well-executed film.While I don't place this movie among the all-time horror classics as some do, it's undeniably entertaining and well-crafted.

Frighteningly bad,"Getting 6 women lost in an unchartered cave with the land based equivalent of creatures that live at the bottom of the ocean isn't a bad idea for a film. But that's as far as The Descent should have got. The monsters aren't scary, they're cocks. And the film's actually more effective before they arrive. A lot more could have been made of why they were there etc, because their introduction is about as subtle as the musical score. Perhaps if they were a little more terrifying, the melodramatic orchestral bursts whenever one of the Dr Who type goons appears wouldn't have seemed so inappropriate. On the positive side, the cave claustrophobia is effective and there's a nice broken leg scene. Apart from that it's all a bit crap really.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good claustrophobic horror movie,"""The Descent"" is a horror movie that avoids the genre's clich√©s for the most part. There is no inane nudity (if nudity can ever be ""inane"") and the first appearance of horror elements isn't rushed. The all female characters and their relationships to each other are explained decently enough and after a short intro we enter the dark cave with them. The more time the six women spend underground the more the claustrophobic atmosphere and the constant darkness begin to affect the viewer, too. You are trapped down there with them and as you watch them getting lost you begin to feel just as uncomfortable as they do. As if being trapped in an unexplored cave wasn't enough, creepy, flesh-eating creatures start turning up and all hell breaks loose. The second half of the movie is a gorefest galore.For a story that could easily have turned into a predictable and campy b-movie, writer and director Neil Marshall brought out the best of his little flick. The creatures look pretty good (could they have been inspired by the infamous K-Fee spots, by any chance?), the pacing is tight and fast, and, as I've said before, Marshall really knows how to create tension. Personally, I was a little turned off by the general darkness and the quick editing, though. Most of the time it was hard to make out what was going on, which was a bit confusing and annoying.Anyway, Marshall has already deservedly made a name for himself among fans with this movie and ""Dog Soldiers"". Hopefully he will continue making horror movies as well worth seeing as ""The Descent"".",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Chilling and claustrophobic,"Six adventurous friends, some recovering from a tragic accident a year earlier, embark on a spelunking expedition in big ol' cave in a desolate part of the Appalachian mountains. Suddenly, there's a rumbling in the earth, and the entrance is blocked behind them. And that's about when they realize they're not in a mapped cave, but rather a new cave that their ersatz leader Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) wanted them all to ""discover"" and perhaps even be able to name.The women do not fall under the typical categories for horror films; all are strong, tough, kind, resilient, and indomitable. They don't screech at the slightest noise or movement just beyond their line of vision. At the same time, though, they're not all uberfit adrenaline junkies out for another thrill (one character remarks that she's an English teacher, not Tomb Raider). All bring something unique to the team, such as scouting, climbing, or medical knowledge.So there's your situation. Six experienced cavers are trapped in a cave that may or may not have more than one entrance. Will they be able to use their combined skills to find another way out? Perhaps, but the situation quickly worsens, as they discover they're not alone in the cave - one of their number spots a Gollum-like creature climbing the walls and ceiling of the cave. Eeek! The ladies discover that the creatures aren't benevolent at all; they're blind (think mole men, really) and track their prey by sound, like bats, and they're utterly carnivorous.The overall question that the movie poses to its audience is: Will the friends work as a team, as they always have, to escape their predicament, or will they turn on each other? It's not a question with a simple answer; the women all like each other, but they don't necessarily like each other equally, as would be the case in any small group. Take minor tension among them and add a severely traumatic situation, and nerves will be frayed, with possible tragic results.Director Neil Marshall did a fantastic job of scaring the bejeezus out of me at the appropriate times. This isn't a film that just throws a whole bunch of blood and guts at you, hoping something will metaphorically stick. The chills are calculated, sometimes coming one after the other, others laying in wait for the right time to pounce. Marshall's pacing prevents the film from lagging while not overwhelming the viewer with imagery and special effects. I imagine it's not easy to convey true dread and trepidation when most of your scenes are in literal darkness. Indeed, Marshall, who also wrote the screenplay, is perfectly adept at putting the viewer in the place of the six protagonists, allowing us to feel just as afraid as they do.To be sure, there are some minor problems with the plot. Sometimes the connection between certain items is a little too blunt (i.e., the camera lingers on something, so you just know it'll come into play somehow later in the film). But these problems really are inconsequential in the grand scope of the film.Personally, I found it to be particularly terrifying, because I am a little bit claustrophobic. Elevators are fine, but anything smaller than that would make me wig out. Some of the scenes in The Descent take place while the women are crawling through the tiniest crevice in the rocks - that, as a matter of fact, is where two of them find themselves when the cave entrance is abruptly closed. Truly frightening stuff.Another caveat, though: This is a very gory film. People are liberally covered in blood; there are stabbings and guttings and smashings and what not. If you're the type whose own blood makes you squeamish, you'd do well to avoid this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A classic or classics,"I saw both Descent 1 and 2 right after each other. I did that because I've seen them before, and knew that the sequel continues where the first left off.As a whole it's a really cool story, but the first movie is the best story-wise, intensity, claustrophobia, and splatter elements aren't so over the top as it is in the sequel. It's a refreshing piece of film, despite it not bringing something new to the table.Strong female characters can be cool, when it's done like in Descent. They're all different types of women, with different backgrounds, and yet they fit together pretty well.

Other times the monsters walk right over the women, literally with their hand on their head, and do not notice them. They do not seem to pose much of a threat to the protagonists, even though the outcome may say differently, which takes the fear out of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Claustrophobe's Worst Nightmare,"The Descent is simply fantastic. I had some decently high expectations going in and sadly a bit spoiled about a certain scene, but it was still a great experience. What makes this movie is a great combination of likeable characters, genuine dialog, a incredible setting and well designed monsters.The movie justifiably takes it's time to get comfortable with the characters and start to like them. Some more than others but in general you root for them and the most for Sarah. I though the acting was pretty decent all round, the main two actors were the best, where others my main problem was with the line delivery, or just the lines themselves. Audio wise as well sometimes, especially later it becomes somewhat hard to understand what they say, but it's easy enough to connect the dots.The set design and monsters in this movie... so good and so disgusting. The monster design is creepy and definitely a shock when seen at first. Human enough to be creepy but ugly enough to warrant their monster status.The score here is really good, I was not expecting such a great score to this movie but it elevated it to another level and was applied really well. It's epic and daunting at the same time. Sound design is a similar story, nailed it.Directing and editing, mainly imo the editing is something that lets this movie down, it's chaotic. And a particular death is just done awkwardly. But the editing especially during action scenes is messy and you can hardly see what's going on. Sometimes the editing can also just be a bit harsh and cut off.Gore and scariness, gore is pretty much up there but it's not the off-putting cringe gore if that makes sense, or that might just be my own sick mind lol. I didn't find it too scary as in jump scares were predictable mostly and tension wasn't that high. Talking about jump scares, this movie does not shy away from them so beware.The story is fantastic, very fitting to horror (UK version). Though maybe weakens the character journey of Sarah. Overall I enjoyed this a ton. Once it gets going halfway it doesn't stop.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A visual treat with a dark aura,"I do not know why, but from all years beginning with 1995, 2005 is the year with the least movies I have seen so far, 9, compared to 35 movies in 2019 for example or 12 in 1997 (I am still 21 and I have only managed to watch around 700 movies so far). Well, I have made an excellent choice by picking this 2005 horror movie: ''The Descent'' is - visually speaking - one of the most interesting horror movies I have seen (the reds and the greens and especially one scene with a reddish fog in the first chamber of the cave system left me in awe and pleasant surprise); without spoiling anything, I just want to hint towards a realistic reaction of one of the characters in front of danger, a particular behavior variation that is rarely seen in today's movies where killing a monster just leads to silence and then jump-scares and then killing another monsters and so on, too much slaughter all of a sudden. What I try to say is that this movie sort of lets you breathe while also keeping yourself on the edge of your seat, it really builds and towers tension up and it is worth it. Of course, there are some common tropes about which the audience has become blas√© (fake jump scares, the first one to die, turning back indicates a jump scare etc) and the unstoppable cycle of copying elements does not contribute to the aging process of this movie. But, overall, it is a good horror movie. I liked it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Must Watch,"Can't believe I hadn't seen this yet. One of the best horror movies I've seen, instant classic. Edge of my seat the entire time. What an atmosphere.. and set. Great cast, great acting, and every character had respectable development. Good dialog and pacing. Amazing effects and cinematography. I can't fault this movie, other than the ending. The ending while good, could have been more sophisticated. It was too abrupt and I felt it deserved more. I guess I didn't want it to end.

An absolutely bloodcurdling terror film.,"Director Neil Marshall (who gave us the smashing werewolf movie Dog Soldiers in 2002) returns to the horror scene with an even more intense and horrific adventure.In the North Carolina mountains a band of girlfriends are exploring underground caverns and learn that they are not alone in the black depths of the unknown.The Descent is a fine horror film that has quite a lot of good things going for it, but one thing above all makes this an excellent horror outing - it delivers genuine fear! Frankly, it had the audience I was viewing it with screaming on a number of occasions! Unfortunately, I can't say the same for most horror movies I watch in the theaters.Marshall's story is one that builds extreme tension, even from its opening scenes. It builds to terrifically intense action and plenty of bloody violence. All of this is capped off with a surprisingly twisted finale. Even more effectively disturbing is just how claustrophobic this movie is! The setting is dark and tight, leaving the audience in just as much unsettling blackness as the characters in the film. This adds up to some solidly jolting scares. The cinematography is stylishly well-done, the filming locations are beautiful, and the special 'creature' FX are gruesomely good. Oh yes, and there's lots of bloodiness to be had for all you gore hounds!The cast is quite good as well. Shauna Macdonald is perhaps the best of the cast, as a young woman who lost her child in a tragic car wreck and now must fight to save her friends.The Descent is a movie that I almost didn't see, but thankfully after reading some strong reviews for it I did. Believe me, I am one happy horror fan for having done so! The Descent will undoubtedly go down as one of the best horror films of the year!**** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nightmarish spelunking,"It was rather good with a few decent jumps (read: surprises that make you jump) and creepy moments. I wasn't overly scared but then it takes a lot to achieve that with me. The plot is pretty simple but sometimes simple is best. I think the production design for the cave network setting was well done and suitably claustrophobic. I liked how the whole thing was lighted, in a place with no external light sources. It was played seriously and for me the actresses were quite convincing with a stand-out performance by the lead. However sometimes it was tough to distinguish the actresses but I did like the ambiguity of certain characters who don't always act heroically although they're basically good people. It's worth a rental but perhaps not a purchase at full price unless you're a big survival horror fanRating: 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An unrelenting, claustrophobic and subversive film that relishes its unique horrors and never relents.","What's remarkable about this low-budget British horror film is just how much tension and, frankly, sheer terror it's able to eke out of the central situation before we're even given but a glimpse of the carnivorous creatures that dwell in the dark. There's a claustrophobic, and almost panic-inducing, sense of isolation and entrapment that expertly escalates from the central cave-in in 'The Descent (2005)'. It's also thanks to the subtle yet consistent character development that we care for each and every person trapped in the caverns below and are on the edge-of-our-seats as their lives are almost constantly threatened. What's also refreshing, and somewhat exciting, is that most of the brutality comes not from the so-called crawlers - whose very existence centres around catching, killing and eating their prey - but rather from the group of women fighting their way through the caves as their battle for survival forces them to lose their innocence almost as quickly as they might lose their sanity. This brutality also makes each encounter unpredictable, with the violence always having tangible consequences. The scares are well crafted and mature too, meaning the whole picture comes together to form a cohesive and taut thrill-ride that relishes its unique horrors and never relents. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror allegory.,"'The Descent' is addictively rewatchable, with excellent ensemble acting (from an all-female cast) and clever references to other films.

"Critics' choice for the most likely ""best horror movie of the year""","(watched in Toronto)I am among the group of regular movie goers who like to check out critics' reviews before seeing a movie. I was slightly surprised at the unanimity and enthusiasm in the critics' praise of this movie. Having watched the movie, I can see that they have their reasons.If you know nothing at all about the movie (maybe you should stop reading this, right now), you would be thinking, during the first half of the movie, that you are watching an adventure-turned-disaster movie along the line of ""Vertical Limit"" or ""Into the void"". There may be just that additional hint of psychological flavour, as the main protagonist Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), right at the beginning of the movie, suffers a devastating loss of husband and daughter in a traffic accident, with steel rods impaling the windshield and victims.I don't need to elaborate the nightmares that haunt Sara in the ensuring year, at the end of which her two best friends who were with her at a white water adventure just before the accident try to help her get out of the sinking feeling by, ironically, organizing an exploration of descending into a cave. Three more women are added to the group. While they think that they are all taking a relatively ""safe"" adventure trip, under the experienced guidance of Juno (Natalie Mendoza)their leader, into a charted course, Juno harbours a more ambitious plan of exploring a hitherto untouched cave, thereby giving them the naming right, her idea of cheering Sara up.As I said, the first half, although already gripping in its own right, provides the tension and thrills in the form of natural accidents. The real meat comes with the discovering of carnivorous cave dwellers that look like Gollum, move like the Aliens and operate like bats (totally blind, relying on their other senses to move around the bowels of the earth). Towards the end, the story takes on very much the route of Sigourney Weavers ""Aliens"" (i.e. with an ""s"", the second one) and much satisfaction can be obtained by watching the heroines' ferocious destruction of the ultra-vicious villains.There is not one thing in particular that makes this movie outstanding; it's how it all fits together. In this British movie, you don't see the banal, formulaic Hollywood treatment such as trying to give each character a special, but superficial ""story"". This is Sara and Juno's story, and is left at that. There is unquestionably a great deal of gore, but no blatantly exposed as in the standard run-of-the-mill horrors, but cleverly softened, taking advantage of the various lightings used in the underground cavern. There are lots of referential tributes to various scenes in a good number of movies, as the critics point out, which I wouldn't repeat. There are well paced actions and thrills. There are explorations into a deeper layer of psychology, which tactfully avoid the pitfall of being too pretentious and overbearing. Yes, there are logical aspects that can be challengesd such as how can human beings have any chance at all in the underground environ that is the home tuft of these ""crawlers"" ¬ñ they had enough trouble with the deadly terrine even before these things show up. But all in all, this is a movie that you do not find much fault with, and that is perhaps why it has become the critics' favourite.",,Anonymous,Horror

One Of The Decades Best Horror Films,"It's bleak and tragic, manages to invert and avoids a few clich√©'s, and the directing, sound, and especially lighting are pretty good. The stories nothing special, but that's not what's important here, it's the claustrophobic, dark, lost, nightmarish quality that all horror films seek, but rarely achieve, that is captured really well here. Anyway, I saw it for free, and I thought it was good, I'm tired of CG ghosts(as I'm sure you are too). Make sure you watch the UK Ending too, it's the icing on the cake, literally, the US version is s*%$.I don't mean to subtract too much from the story, but at the time this was coming out I think there was another horror film called, ""The Cave"".""The Descent"" was made first though it was released in the states after, and though their basically about the same thing, which is people fighting monsters in a cave, ""The Cave"" was every horror/action clich√© you could imagine, while this managed to generate genuine suspense and a sense of doom, as well as the usual gore. Also it includes an all female cast, a rarity in horror films, especially since the characters are not just sexualized teens.

Strong Characters and a Terrifying Story!,"One of the best modern day horror movies ever made, as well as one of the best-reviewed horror movie of the decade. The tension is high, the characters are strong, and the atmosphere is nice and thick, The Descent does just about everything right. Of all the 'isolation' horror movies being made, this is hands down the crown jewel! The production designs of the cave system look fantastic, they were all man made of course, but it gave them room to create some truly frightening scenarios.As I said before, the real highlight of The Descent comes from the group tension between the women and their history together, which just happens to hit a rough patch during this time of crisis in the cave. They're forced to work together, even though previous drama has surfaced creating some very thick tension amongst the group. Plus, there is something else about having an all-female cast that makes the movie a bit more harrowing and interesting, probably because when you think of violence, you typically think of men committing the violence or being violently killed. But that being said, the woman certainly are up for the challenge, and the movie just would not have worked with men in this type of situation.And as a final note, the ending of The Descent is simple, yet brilliant (from what I have read, most people were expecting more), it's actually one of my personal favorite horror movie endings!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not just bad. Ugly.,"I don't personally know the authors of this movie, but they couldn't be my friends, not anymore, not from tonight on, since I've seen this horrifically bad horror. No friends, because I just feel they wanted to tease the spectator, take the mickey out of them.Simply not fair. Yes, of course he who goes see an horror film wishes to be scared; sure as hell he wants. But politely. Intelligently. You simply cannot ground all the horror in scenes with sudden screams and thunders, sudden visions, sudden whatever. I can as well come to you and shout in your ear and probably scare you, if you aren't thinking of me.And this film doesn't just (try to) scare in a stupid way; it's also stupid, too. In the plot, in the characters, in the occasions created to introduce the events. I can understand that some movies just need a very basic plot to introduce amazing and entertaining SFX scenes... but besides some little pale scary monsters, there really was nothing amazingly beautiful to see or follow.""It's beautiful"", says one of the cave divers as soon as she reaches the bottom. Perhaps the scene was really beautiful (an hidden cave with a rich vegetation), but not even once the director chose to show us some of that beauty.Deprived of any beauty, this movie, very bad, is just and plain an ugly movie, which surely shocks you, but not more than a long series of loud bangs and explosions you could hear in your room.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
not even half de(s)cent.,"The descent: I'm afraid (not of the film) but of the fact that this wasn't even half de(s)cent. What starts as a normal low budget British horror soon turns in to a low budget British horror with American sensibilities. The main character starts off as a gibbering widow who also lost her baby in the same accident as her husband and ends up like a cross between Bruce Willis in die-hard and Carrie. From a middle-aged schoolteacher (or whatever she is) who is rubbish at pot holing to a blood-soaked, axe-wielding monster slayer who is f-ing ace at everything. It is just a little too much. Sure enough when the film starts and these six friends (shame it wasn't the cast of friends!) go underground into what they all believe is a series of easy climbs, it's o.k. a little boring but o.k. Except one of the party has taken them somewhere no one has ever been before, a series of uncharted caves. Then as the unsuspecting team lower themselves in to smaller and smaller caves and tunnels the tension starts to build. Thing is it's still not scary, I guess if you are claustrophobic then you might be breathing a little heavier than everyone else but only in the same way that someone with a fear of clowns might not particularly enjoy 'bobo's big top adventure with the clown quartet'. The jumps are there but obvious and despite the fact your in a dark cave you can see them a mile off. It is only when the monsters arrive that it really gets silly, they look like a reunion of Gollum's family tree complete with mad uncle and aunt. The thing that lets these creatures down is that they apparently have adapted to hunt like bats using only sound now if you can get around a dark cave in complete silence let me know. At one point our heroine has a flaming torch that the monsters can't see even though it makes more noise than all six screaming women put together. From the outset of this expedition gone wrong it's a race to find a way out before the creatures get them and that's it. There is a sub-plot about one of the girls having a bit with one of the others husband but it's so thin it's almost as transparent as the monsters skin tissue. Before seeing this film I was expecting a kind of Blair Witch/Most Haunted vibe with cameras on green night-vision and fuzzy screens in the atmospheric underground. What we got was a poor excuse for a gore-fest in a cave. Empire gave this film 5 stars, well if that's what a leading film magazine thinks of this p#ss-poor pot holing parody then I'm sorry but I won't be able to trust their judgement on anything ever again.",,Anonymous,Horror
Should Be Damned By The National Speleological Society!,"I've had some minor problems in the past with horror films in which the bulk of the action transpires mainly in the dark, or in which the monsters go largely unseen (even in such classic entertainments as ""Alien"" and ""It's Alive""), and so sat down to watch 2005's ""The Descent"" with some degree of trepidation, despite its great rep. And it turns out that my qualms were justified, but not enough to matter. In the film, a sextet of sexy and spunky spelunkers--significantly, all semisuperwomen--explores an undiscovered cave system in North Carolina's Appalachians, becomes trapped after a cave-in, and encounters some truly ferocious underground dwellers. Though not a sufferer of claustrophobia, I have had many nightmares in which I am crawling through a very tight space underground (Freudians, make of this what you will!), and this film really does capture the frightfulness of those dreams. The monsters themselves (""Crawlers,"" the filmmakers call them, in one of this DVD's many extras)--though perforce only seen dimly and in flashes, for the most part, as I suspected--are a truly horrifying bunch. Humanoid, albino and vaguely batlike, they make a catastrophic situation enter the realm of the surreal. As it turned out, my only real problem with ""The Descent"" was the fact that it's very hard to differentiate between the six gals once they strap on helmets and start crawling around in the dark, although a repeat viewing did admittedly clarify things a good deal for me. I felt as if I'd been put through a wringer by the film's end, actually, which I suppose is high praise for even the murkiest of horror films. And I would imagine that this picture would be as welcomed by feminists for its depiction of sisters sticking together as it would be damned by the National Speleological Society! ""The Descent"" will certainly not be drawing in new converts to the sport of caving, that's for sure; another indication of its power and effectiveness!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

If you loved Alien vs Predator you'll love this,"I love horror films and lower expectations accordingly but this appalling piece of lazy plagiarism stinks any way you look at it. Trite scripts, zero characterisation and amateur hour acting have always been a staple of the genre but an original way with the material can lift up even the lowest budget horror and that's precisely what's missing here. Every single scene and ""shock"" is lifted wholesale from other movies and remade very, very badly. Most damning of all though the whole ""directorial style"" is filched so completely from John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" that when they even start playing the main theme from that classic you'll wonder why the lawsuits didn't swiftly fly across the Atlantic. What really riles though is this ""give it a break it's British"" attitude our film critics have been displaying since about 1980. The British film industry is a corpse more putrid and frightening than anything you'll see in this movie. I don't know where directors rise up from now but after watching the soulless artifice of the Descent I'm guessing advertising.

"Not bad, just not creepy","The Descent is one of THOSE movies. Those horror flicks that have a lot going for them in terms of production value as well as acting and build- up, but screw things up right when you think they could've impossibly done so. Point in case: a bunch of women, one of which suffered a horrible trauma a few years ago, retreat themselves in the mountains as they go ahead and do some spelunking. Note: you won't care about any of the women as only 2 of the 6? 7? members of their little club have an actual personality worth mentioning, be them very generic ones. Interesting twist: they're in a cave no one knows anything about, so on one side, it's theirs to explore, on the other, this could be incredibly risky, dangerous, even. Like any good scary movie, this one has a lot of tension and suspense going on for it before the actual scares make their entr√©e. The downside: once the ""good"" part of the movie is over, it quickly translates into a bland jumpscare fest, free of any imagination and/or breathtaking moment, excluding some scenes. Granted, it has its moment past the figurative point of no return, but they're scarce and really far in between. In general, I wouldn't really recommend this movie, but I have to grant it an extra point for its good ending, lifting up the experience as a whole and handing it over an extra point. Could've been better if the director knew what he was doing in some places where it was really necessary.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty good,"I don't think this is a masterpiece like some people do. It's starts off great but by the midway point, it kinda blows it's load. All the tension and build up devolves into a typical, high octane creature feature. The first half feels like horror, second half feels like gory action/adventure. Not necessarily a bad thing, just had potential that I don't think was capatilized on.However, most of the film is tense, claustrophobic, and gritty. I also think that the characters are well written and well acted. It's manages to be a compelling drama in the midst of all the chaos.In the end this is more of a dramatic action story with horror elements. The horror aspect stopped being scary after the halfway point and that kind of bummed me out.The conclusion is fantastic though! All in all, a really well made film!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent horror movie,"The Descent is a decent horror movie. Hahaha, sorry, but I had to. It starts as a drama of the main character because the story is set around her. Right at the beginning, the film gives us one punch to the stomach. Then follows the slower part, seemingly like a female light drama, getting to know the characters who go on a fun road trip to connect. However, somewhere in the middle of the film, things slowly start to go up until the real horror starts. The film relies heavily on an atmosphere that is quite dark and claustrophobic. I have to mention that in addition to all that horror, there is also a real dramatic horror between the characters, and that is something that the average horror film does not have. Feelings at the end are twofold as it tries to cause one effect that not every viewer will like.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""The Descent"" reaches new heights of horror.","Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) could use some cheering up. Just one year ago, she lost her husband and her only daughter to a bad car accident. In an effort to cheer her up, five of her best friends take her on a vacation into the Appalachian Mountains for some routine spelunking. Things go horribly wrong, however, when they find themselves trapped and without a map inside one of the caves. Unfortunately for them, this cave has yet to be thoroughly explored and an unknown threat lurks in the darkness, ready to attack and threaten their solidarity and sanity.Writer/director Neil Marshall spends ample time building up the characters to the point where they feel real, but also wastes no time in getting to the point. It isn't long before our characters are submersed into the abyss from which they spend 90 minutes of the film trying to escape. A claustrophobic's nightmare come true, the film makes sure you're in the cave with the characters as they fight for their lives with a careful balance of character development and spooky atmosphere, achieved by its stunning cinematography and authentic location. By the time you get to the gore and the creature effects, the movie has already done its job and the rest is just icing on the cake.In fact, that's pretty much what sets ""The Descent"" apart from most modern horror stories. Rather than relying on outlandish death scenes and over-the-top gore, it's slightly restrained in its old-school approach that values tension over eye-candy. To be blunt, the death scenes are probably the last thing you'll remember from this film. What you'll likely take away from it is an unmistakable and unforgiving tone, a healthy portion of unforgettable imagery (see: climbing up a hill of human skulls) and an ending that will stay with you for days. It's a well-rounded, well-written and effectively directed film that warrants repeat viewings to absorb it all. With this film, Neil Marshall has certainly earned himself a spot in the echelon of iconic horror movie directors, and is truly a visionary to keep an eye on.A sequel is currently on the horizon, although what would possess Sarah to enter that cave again remains to be seen, especially if you are to go by the original ending -- found in the ""Original Unrated Cut"" (the true version of the film) -- which leaves nowhere for a sequel to go. By itself, though, it stands alone as a modern classic for a reason and a film that will effectively creep out and thrill audiences for many decades to come. When this decade is looked back upon in future years, ""The Descent"" will no doubt sit at the top of the pile of films that helped define horror movie cinema in the new millennium.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great unique horror idea.,"This is truly one of my favorite horrors made in recent years. It has a new creative idea, It is well directed and the actors all did a very good job which is rare for horror movies. And it sets up a creepy atmosphere with great writing and cinematography. Also a horror movie that does not rely souly on jump scares.This movie is about a group of young women who go on a cave expedition. What they don't know however is these caves have never been explored and soon after becoming trapped by a rockslide they soon start to be hunted by a strange predatory creature.This is definitely one of the best horror movies in recent years and of all time.

Nice Try,"Descent, The (2005)** (out of 4)The latest horror film from director Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers) comes as a major disappointment after hearing so many good things. My girlfriend told me to pick out a winner, I picked this but sadly we both walked away disappointed. Six women travel to the mountains so that they can explore a cave. Once inside the cave they get trapped and don't know their way out so they must travel forward where they run into flesh eating humanoids. This film has so much going for it but at the one hour mark it runs into a wall and blows up in the viewers face. There are two major problems, which I'll get to in a second. Technically, this is one of the best made horror films I've seen in quite some time. Once we enter the cave the director is able to build some great atmosphere, some nice suspense and an overall atmospheric mood. However, building suspense is very tricky because you've got to know how far you can pull the suspense without the viewing growing tired. The suspense builds for the first hour and then it just hits the wall and it seemed everyone in the crowd grew tired the same time I did. Another problem is that the monsters are hide throughout most of the first half of the film. As Roger Corman use to say, hide the monsters as long as you can because when you finally show them they won't be nearly as effective as what the viewer has already build up in their minds. When the monsters finally did appear they were another letdown because they seemed like that bald guy in The Lord of the Rings. The monsters were nearly as scary as the suspense that lead up to them so this just added to the boredom. Then there's a ""twist"" at the end that I really hated. This was a very nice and strong try but things just didn't work out in the final thirty minutes.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good Horror Film,"THE DESCENT is a very original horror film. I'm not normally a big fan of most horror films in general. Many of the ones that a lot of other people like just end up boring me. But this one I found intriguing.The story is about a group of women who go exploring in a cave. What they find in there the scary part. I won't give it away, but it feels very original. I haven't seen anything like it before. The acting and directing are bother very good. Recommend for horror fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Best,"This film by far, is one of my top 3 favorites of all time. Excellent character build with plenty of suspense and drama. No overkill on the gore factor and at the end, left me wanting more.

One of the greatest horror films ever... apparently,"I love horror films and I've now watched The Descent three times. I suppose that means I do like it (I do own it after all), yet I never seem to see what everyone else does. When I read other people's reviews they use words like 'Awesome' and 'Amazing,' however, if I was using words to describe this film I'd simply use the term 'Pretty good,' as that's all I felt after watching it.If I'm in the mood for a reasonable monster-hunting film, then I put on The Descent. It's not overly long and it doesn't take much of my brainpower to understand it. Basically, a group of women go underground caving and get hunted by some of Golem's relatives.I like the way it's shot and scored. For some reason it reminds me of John Carpenter's early work, but for a film that lasts ninety minutes, the beasties don't make an appearance (properly) until over half way. You have a lot of creeping around dark caves before you get to the gore.As I say, many horror fans LOVE this movie. So, there must be something there I'm not seeing. Personally, I'll stick with an average 7/10 and probably watch it again in a few years time (maybe I'll 'get it' then? After all, I am the only man alive who doesn't like either Bladerunner or The Godfather!)http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Claustrophobia,"As a claustrophobe this movie really played on me, a group of women trapped in a cave, sometimes getting stuck. It really made me edgy, but I absolutely loved it. It is a movie that deserves repeated viewings as it has a lot of gusto to it.More horror films should pray on conditions such as claustrophobia as a hook to pull in the terror. Well done t all.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Overrated,"I liked this better than ""Dog Soldiers"", and I think Neil Marshall is a great talent in the horror genre. I look forward to seeing more movies by him. However, I think both Dog Soldiers and The Descent are problematic as horror movies. There's no real supernatural feel. The shocks are not scary. Japanese and south eastern Asian horror (such as ""the eye"") make scary shocks. The move by Hollywood to just try and copy what they couldn't have done themselves is pathetic, I think. The descent is a British movie, and it shows. It is better than a lot of recent American horror. However, my main problem with the descent except that it has little or no suspense is that the plot is devoid of logic. What is the connection between the accident and the descent into the cave with the monsters? Let me tell you: THERE IS NO CONNECTION. Thus the plot is not making sense. You can analyze this as much as you want to and try and see connections but take my word for it: there isn't any. It's just some kind of plot decoy which in the end didn't seem to fit although it might have been intended. Moreover, whereas the accident is exciting and seems to make sense in terms of horror, all the non-horror things in this movie is just so borderline superfluous that it sort of ruins the occasional splendid elements of successful horror.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Your own mind is scarier than anything on the screen,"***SPOILERS AHEAD***What an absolutely outstanding horror film. Not only is it very well acted, but Marshall takes the time to establish the characters, causing the viewer to invest their emotions into them. This not only makes for better film-making, but the forces the viewer experience the film on a more intimate level; invoking more uncertainty, tension and terror.Also, Marshall uses the penultimate tactic that makes any horror movie good. The viewer is shown almost nothing, allowing the mind to make up for what is not shown. Just like in ""Alien"", you are left to your own imagination to invent what you think may be in the darkness. At times when watching this movie, I was literally paralyzed with my own fear, unable to tear my eyes away from the screen. I have not been that truly scared in a long time. Outstanding work.However, do yourself a huge favor and attempt to see the original UK release, as the U.S. version has a modified ending. The UK version is by far superior and Lions Gate (the American distributor) should have left well enough alone.I can only hope that more movies like this one come out as this is the way it should be done.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
good horror,"A tight gripping horror that'll pump your heart and shake your nerves. I have been watching a quite lot of horror movie this past week and this is genuinely the scariest one. In the dark is where the movie shines, the use of the environmental nature of the cave is so effective, even with many flashlights and flares around it's still look terrifying. I fell for some of the jump scares, there are some obvious one that I didn't fell for but overall it was well done and scary. A simple premise can go a long way as this movie proved it. Just women descending into a cave and finding there's no way out but through and some creepy creatures. Some people say there's a twist to it, well I wouldn't call it a twist since they set it up from the beginning and the setup is quite obvious, regardless the story is simple, not pretentious and thoroughly entertaining. One thing that I really like is how they manage to create this feeling of endlessness. We get a feeling of being in their position, not knowing when and where this is going to end. Near the ending there's a transition to a dream sequence which is very smooth and well done.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Garbage,"I just got done seeing this and i'm not gonna beat around the bush. This movie had almost no plot. The writers tried to create some sort of back story with 2 or 3 vague references to an ""accident"" that involved the characters, but the accident is never explained and actually plays no role in the movie. I feel like i was robbed of the 6 bucks i paid to see this garbage, it was by far the worst movie i've ever seen in theaters. Other then the cheap pop out scares the only thing this movie has going for it is a slight tension because of the claustrophobic cave atmosphere. Not surprisingly the ending is even less fufilling then the rest of this trash.Bottom line: No plot + cheap scares = The descent",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Very Definition of Horror in Its Purest Form.,"One of the most genuinely frightening & paranoia inducing films to come out in a long time, The Descent is an ingeniously crafted horror masterpiece that seamlessly intertwines its incredibly tense & cleverly paced story with inventive cinematography, tight editing, mesmerizing score & strong performances from its all-female cast to create an undeniably creepy atmosphere of unrelenting claustrophobia which eventually launches such an all-out assault on our senses that the ensuing events turn into nothing short of an escalating experience of nightmarish horror.Inducing fear from its isolated look, grim tone & eerie mood rather than relying on typical jump scares, The Descent is the very definition of horror in its purest form and with its sinister plot & nerve-jangling adventure, easily qualifies as one of the scariest films of this or any other decade. Its story concerns Sarah; an adventure junkie, who accompanies her friends on a spelunking trip after suffering a horrible tragedy an year ago. But their adventure soon turns into nightmare as their cave expedition goes horribly wrong & they find themselves being pursued by strange blood thirsty creatures.The direction by Neil Marshall is very impressive as he lets the claustrophobic nature of his film play mind games with the viewers & by employing the 'less is more' trick, he truly succeeds in letting our imagination run wild. The screenplay makes sure that plenty of time is devoted to creating the build up, tension & mood of isolation while moving the story forward. The mountains & underground caves are exquisitely photographed but it's the effective use of shadows & lighting where cinematography plays its best part. And David Julyan's score contributed immensely in evoking the perfect tension & mood this film was aiming for.Coming to the acting department, this film features an all female cast of six beautiful actresses who all chipped in with strong & sincere performances which apart from providing this film a realistic mood also made the drama all the more plausible. The character of Sarah is the centered piece around whom the whole story revolves, and Shauna MacDonald has done a terrific job in elegantly capturing the trauma, uncertainty & survival instincts of her character. The rest of the performances are no slouch either & everyone did an amazing job in their given roles.On an overall scale, The Descent is a claustrophobic horror that works as a masterfully executed piece of original work from Neil Marshall and is an illustrious example of a horror film done right. It plays with your mind, forcing you to make assumptions & imagine the outcomes, and yet manages to surprise & shock you psychologically & viscerally. Destined to bring a smile on the face of every horror fanatics along with many screams of horror, this bloodstained nightmare of a spelunking adventure gone horribly wrong is absolutely recommended.P.S. Make sure you grab the Unrated Cut of The Descent for it contains the original ending which sensibly wraps this film in a way that was always meant to be. The alternate ending (which was included in its US release) cuts to credits before its real ending & only ends up destroying so many of the possible outcomes it could've had, just for the sake of cashing in on its success with an uninspired sequel which eventually happened.",,Anonymous,Horror
Great scary movie!,"Creepy enough when it's just about being dark and claustrophobic. Only gets better. Not enough legit scary movies out there, so if that's what you're looking for, check this one out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
When extreme holidaying goes wrong...,"I had relatively high hopes for 'The Descent' before going into it. Neil Marshall proved that he has a good understanding of the horror genre with his debut, 'Dog Soldiers', which is also a film that I like very much and don't hesitate to name as one of the best horror films of the new millennium. This follow up to that film works on the same terms; with tension and atmosphere being more important than characters and substance, and I'm pleased to say that Marshall has created another worthy modern horror flick. It's clear that he wanted to be more original this time round, as the monsters here are of his own creation rather than being classic horror icons, like the werewolves in Dog Soldiers. The plot follows an all girl group of cavers who descend down into a cave somewhere in the UK. Things quickly go awry for our team, when, in a surprisingly tense scene, part of the cave collapses and seals them inside. Things get worse still when it turns out that they're not the only ones down there; and what is down there with them isn't exactly friendly...Through a gritty and realistic plot pacing, Marshall has managed to take a simple premise and turn it into a slick and extremely suspenseful horror thrill ride. The film is slow to start, with only one exciting event in the first half hour, but once the movie starts properly; the thrills come thick and fast, and even when the plotting slows down; you can always count on there being another moment to drag you back into the action. I'm not usually a person that jumps during the 'jumpy' movie scenes; but this movie actually did the trick! Marshall obviously knows what makes horror movies work too, as he spends much of the film building a foreboding atmosphere, which is complimented by the isolated setting of the cave, which is two miles underground. He keeps the atmosphere going with a plethora of different tricks, including 'Argento-style' lighting, which he realistically blends into the movie by way of the lights that the girls take down into the cave with them. The film always breaths a sense of the horror of journeying into the unknown too, and this along with the tension filled atmosphere and realistic way that the horror is presented ensures that the film always sticks firmly to it's horror style.It's clear that Neil Marshall is more interesting in creating a film that shocks more than anything else, and this is shown by the complete lack of characterisation. Marshall does give his girls something of a story, but it's never the focal point of the film and, in fact, it's hard to really care about it. This does bring the film down, as the girls are clearly in the movie just as an excuse to show the horror, and this makes sure that the film is as empty as it is stylish. This isn't all bad though, as the style is consistent; and the way that monsters have been designed reflects that. Much like the werewolves in Dog Soldiers, the fiends here look great and despite the fact that they're a work of fiction; they even have some sort of reality about them. The scenes with the monsters in, however, bring the film down. For some reason, Marshall has opted to fast edit the sequences, and while this succeeds in being disorientating and true to dark surroundings of the film's environment; it also makes it very difficult to see what's going on - which is never a good thing.The Descent isn't a great film, or even a great genre film, but it's style, effects and fair amount of gore will ensure that horror fans will be pleased; and if that doesn't grab you, the vast amount of tension in the film certainly will. It definitely is nice, however, to see a modern film that isn't afraid that show blood and gore, along with a bit of imagination. It's even better to see, due to the wave of Japanese and American remakes getting unjust high praise, that the film is home-grown right here in the UK! Overall, The Descent isn't 'must see', but it's well worth seeing and I recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, but...","The good-- plenty of gore, good creature effects, the instensity, the claustrophobia, some shocking, surprising, and outstanding death scenes; apparently there's some story twists here and there. The bad-- no full-frontal female nudity; unattractive cast; excessive loud sound effects; indistinguishable characters, even though some folks have pointed out that the lighting is supposed to help us identify the characters, not even that works; no male characters; the telling of the story is hindered by the annoying English accent that is undeciphrable, unless you're used to it, you're going to feel like Sledgehammer listening to the Scottland Yard guy; unrealistic premise, are we supposed to believe that these women hike and climb into caves without guidance, communication, or male companions. Yeah right. The ugly-- anti-male sexism. When the director said that this movie was to be a horror movie for women he immediately made it clear that he doesn't care for his male audience, that is, the the people who make up 98% of horror movie fandom. I was offended by that. Luckily, as the dismal box office for this movie shows, female movies goers are normal and healthy and don't fall for this nonsense- they happen to want to see strong male characters. This is the second movie this year, after Silent Hill, that makes the point of not having males in it. What the hell is the matter with these people? For decades now Hollywood has been trying to work toward a global matriarchy by making males the buffoons and the butts of all jokes, while the women are the wise, smart, witty, strong, aggressive characters. So that's their BS political agenda of girl power and helping the supposedly once oppressed. Fine, I'm getting used to that since it's so transparent and it's part of the self-hatred of psychotic Hollywood homosexual males. But that European directors, Cristoph Gans and now this Marshall guy are taking sick ideologies of hatred to the max by making movies sans males is incomprehensible and reproachable. I was planning on not seeing this movie as male fan of horror but after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews I decided to see it, knowing full well that I would be exposed to this sexism. This movie, just like Dog Soldiers, is overrated. They are good, but not THAT good. I suspect that most of the glowing positive reviews are by Hollywood/media psychopaths who fully support the extermination of men from the media.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
awesome movie! really makes you jump!,"this movie was released in england last year... it's worth going to the theater's to see. you'll get your money's worth of scare! best horror flick I've seen in a good while! no cheesy cgi's either.

A two hour heart attack,"The poster lists this movie as the suspense successor to Alien and for once, I can agree with the hype. While horror/suspense movies are generally a genre that requires me to be in the right frame of mind to truly enjoy, I can remember the first time I saw Aliens and was fully on the edge of my seat. The kind of edginess that is independent of who is with you or where you are; the gasps and jumps are involuntary. But once the movie is seen once, the surprise and suspense are lost and another title must be found to replace the same feeling. This is one of them. The Descent offers a slow build-up, introducing the characters who are believable as friends and anonymously unknown to the North American audience so no preconceived opinions of who will make it out and who is wearing the Star Trek ""red shirt"". While character development is minimal, there is nonetheless a developing tension within the characters that builds to a tragic and rather original conclusion. CG effect monsters are replaced with traditional makeup and gore that present a visceral, real (and probably, given the situations probably realistic) depiction of the atrocities that ensue. My only criticism is for the first half of the movie, some of the characters are difficult to distinguish from, as costumes and hair are similar the inevitable culling commences.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
the descent,"This has all the inklings of great horror movie the effects are spot on with some of the best i have seen in a long time, and the evil lurking at every corner doesn't help by raising a few goosebumps.the action comes pretty thick and fast and the blood tally almost rivals the likes of kill bill vol.1. however it is all let down by a rather annoying cast. who are ultimately forgettable. the overall gore levels are taken up a notch with the on screen brutality that clearly made to make you wince if you are not hiding behind the sofa by that time. overall though it is one of the best British horror movies out there so see it and make up your own mind. are you afraid of the dark????????????????????????????",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A tense, thrilling, and claustrophobic survival horror film","THE DESCENT is a movie I let sit in my video library for a while before actually watching it. Not because I was scared to, but mostly because I wasn't sure if it would be as good as I'd heard. Thankfully, my fears were assuaged when this turned out to be an effectively creepy and claustrophobic horror film. I'm not particularly scared of confined spaces but I can sympathize with those who are, and this film does a great job of creating an maintaining such an atmosphere for most of its running time. The basic plot is about these six women who go on a spelunking trip in the Appalachians. As a group, they've gone on similar adventures before, but nothing quite like this. As they get farther into the cave and deeper underground they are pushed to their limits and their sanity is tested, as well as their bond of friendship. They also discover that they may not be alone. Or are they?Generally speaking, the acting was sound and the characters were believable as a group of friends. There wasn't too much in the way of character development, but they were established well enough in the beginning that once things started to go south you cared about what happened to them. Of the six friends, only one is really given a back story, namely that her husband was killed in a freak accident after water rafting trip with a couple of her friends (who are in the main group). Her mental state is actually very important to the story, but in a way that I'll save for whoever wants to watch the film.Other aspects of the film that I thought very well-done were the cinematography, lighting and use of space. A lot of the film takes place in a cave underground, and it made good use of natural and artificial light to create a dark and mysterious atmosphere that kept you involved in what you were watching. You often get the sense that something could come out of the shadows at any moment and, in fact, there were a number of jump scares that utilized this very effectively. Although somewhat predictable in this regard, I didn't think they were overused and were germane to the story being told. Also, considering that this is a Neil Marshall film, the gore effects were well done and suitably gross.However, I do have a couple issues with the film as well. First, the score, while appropriate and engaging, was a little too insistent in parts. I don't really like when a film's music telegraphs how you're supposed to feel in a particular moment, and the music here gets used like that occasionally. With such a dark and claustrophobic film, I thought it would have been more effective to dial back the score a bit and let the scenes breathe a little on their own, creating a more natural sense of terror rather than inflating it with somewhat overblown instrumentation. I also thought that the story and character development could have been a bit more substantive. Instead of being rich and layered, it was minimal but effective.Overall, despite my misgivings about the score and thin plotting, I rather enjoyed this film. It's most effective at establishing an maintaining a tense mood and claustrophobic atmosphere that really works. At no point was I ever bored, although I would scratch my head at some of the stupid things that the main characters would do. But what horror film doesn't have characters who make ill-informed decisions at one point or another? What I got out of it what is a tense and thrilling survival horror with strong (but loosely defined) female characters and their descent into madness (the title works as a double-entendre). Highly recommended for genre fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
my notes,"Really creepy and scary horror flick. this is a mixed bag. there is a lot to love. like some of the directing, the claustrophobia in the caves, the suspenseful tone, some beautiful shots, the realistic feel created by not using any unnecessary light in the caves other than the light that the characters are producing. there are also a lot of flaws. while i give it credit for the realism from no extra lighting, it was also annoying at times since i couldn't really see much in some of the scenes. and in a lot of scenes i could barely see what's going on. and a lot of shaky cam was used along with some sloppy editing which also made it hard to see what was happening. and some of the story elements seemed out of place or unnecessary. if it wasn't for these flaws this could have been an amazing movie. still very enjoyable (2 viewings)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"One of the scariest movies I've seen, period!","I just saw The Descent last night, opening night, and the midnight show! Great time, right? Oh, my God, it's the next day and my heart is still pounding like crazy. The Descent is so original and incredibly intense. This was such a gift to horror fans and I'll explain why.Lately, horror movies are bland and are not that original. You know when the scares come and how they are going to come. Despite you truly don't see the monsters until the last half hour of the film, the environment was so well created, the claustrophobia, the tight spaces, the darkness, and the unknown.

Good film with a good premise,"With a formula like this, The Descent was guaranteed to be a decent film. Attractive women + decent scares + creepy cave = lots of good scares.I'll admit, the film wasn't terribly scary, but the tension that was all throughout the film did feel real. This was the reason why this film doesn't get a higher rating. While gore and violence makes for good movies, it doesn't really help in the horror genre. But the real triumph with this film was the great make-up, and not just for the creatures. When you saw the compound fracture, you were genuinely grossed out. Even the blood looked real.All in all, this film was really nothing more than a popcorn munching showcase. Sometimes the action near the end of the film was almost ludicrous to the point of being funny. But then again, that doesn't mean the film was unwatchable.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best horror movies I saw recently!,"When someone told me the story of Descent, I though ""Oh yeah, just another stupid movie about a bunch of stunning college girls in revealing clothes trapped by accident somewhere in nowhere and being chased by bunch of freaking monsters, then slaughtered one by one in horrible ways but not before we see most of their perfect bodies."" Surprise, surprise, it's not like that at all. First of all, I was pleasantly surprised to see that movie was British, and since I have a big respect for British cinematography it was actually a good sign for me. Second surprise: it is actually scary! And it's done very well, very professional direction, great script, great actors and genuine scares. Women (not girls!) in the movie are beautiful though, but not in a pin up way. What hit me most is the many ways story could be interpreted. I can not describe those ways of interpretation here, because that would contain a lot of spoilers, but it's fascinating how many details in movie have symbolic meaning and how their interpretation, which depends on the viewer, can affect the whole plot and the way we see the story. Even without surreal horror elements in The Descent, the movie would be scary because of all that claustrophobic setting that is offered. Just the thought of being trapped 2 miles in the underground cave with possibility of never seeing sunlight again is scary enough for me. And the whole expedition into the caves looks genuine enough for me to believe. Characters are also great, well developed, though uneven. It's quite clear that some of them are more in focus, more developed than the others. Even so, the Descent is great horror movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Zzzzz... Take a nice nap instead,"Style isn't everything, but this film offers nothing else. Considering how laborious the set-up is, it's a miracle that an ounce of character development couldn't work its way into this flashy mess.Somebody seemed to think that a handful of taut female bodies with a slathering of attitude would be empathetic enough to involve the viewer, but the characters in this film are so blank and uninteresting that neither I nor the group of folks I watched this with could have cared less what happened to any of them.There have been worse ""horror"" films made. But I can't remember one that was more boring and pointless than this.The cinematography is totally wrong. Why anyone would choose warm yellow and red scrims to color a descent into the cold chilly bowels of the earth is unfathomable. When the ghoulish action finally starts, the color scheme switches to green, but for some ungodly reason the brains behind this fiasco chose a nice vibrant organic green rather than a pasty fluorescent sickly green which might have added a hint of unsavoriness to the cookie cutter proceedings.It's interesting that many English viewers rate this director's crappy movies so highly. With all the great English directors out there, you'd think they wouldn't be so hard up for glory.If you choose to watch this sorry chunk of offal, dose up with plenty of coffee or Irish breakfast tea before hand.

Everything just keeps getting progressively worse and you can't help feeling they deserve it (well, maybe it's only me that feels that way).

Scariest film ever made,"OK, just a brief comment-- I saw this a few days ago at Sundance. I'm both a huge fan of horror films and a really difficult scare-- while I enjoy horror films, I frequently find myself disappointed in the actual scare department.As far as I can think, I have never been more scared during a movie than this one.I spent half of my time jumping out of my chair and the other half clutching my chest. People ran out of the screening because it was too scary for them-- which I don't think I've ever seen before (at least, not at Sundance). As a total claustrophobe, I thought it might have have just been targeting my weak points, but my boyfriend screamed about 10 times in the movie- a first that I can think of.Afterwards, I said ""This is probably the scariest film I've ever seen."" He said, ""Well, it's definitely one of them."" ""What have you seen that's scarier?"" I asked. He couldn't think of a movie that came close.And again, we watch a lot of horror movies.

Remind me not to crawl in any caves!,"The trailer promised little and offered less. Thirty seconds in a parade of snapshots promising more of the generic horror films that seem to be swamping our screens at the moment. But having sat through Neil Marshall's second film ¬ñ a tale of humanity pushed beyond its limits and into its most gruesome instinctive self, I have been forced to tell myself once more never to believe the trailers.The film is surprising for several reasons:- Firstly, it is a horror film about a group of women who do not a) do nothing but run around screaming or b) take their clothes off. There's not even a scene featuring people in their underwear having pillow fights. Secondly, It's a horror film that's been released in the last year that a) isn't a remake of a successful Japanese film and b) doesn't have Dakota Fanning in it.Marshall explains that he wanted to make horror films that are entirely for adults, and this film thoroughly deserves its 18 rating. The women loose their veneer of humanity faster than a rat up a drainpipe and quite willingly become brutal killing machines fairly early on. The scare factor is increased somewhat by their attackers taking almost human form ¬ñ making it even more unwholesome when the women celebrate and seem to relish killing their enemies, a part of the narrative at its most gruesome when Sarah (as played excellently by Shauna MacDonald with a ""Creepy Carrie"" expression that would make Sissy Spacek blush), the woman who is still mourning for the loss of her husband and child a year before is attacked by and kills a child crawler in the cave. The movie also smacks of a well put together action film with the show being stolen by Natalie Jackson Mendoza who plays the tough cookie with something to prove ¬ñ Juno. Who chops up and kicks her way through monsters in a way that forces the words ""you go girl"" from your mouth before you even knew they were there.Marshall is a technically skilled film maker and the tone is almost playfully set up with the beautiful extreme long shots of the vaguely threatening landscape (in a style deliberately reminiscent of Kubrick's ""The Shining"") contrasting entirely with the later fast paced low light close up action within the cave. Probably the most irritating part of the film is the excessive use of choppy editing throughout the fighting sequences which seems to act to distract from the action on screen and leaves the audience feeling slightly unwell, (like they've just sat through Blair Witch again), but this is, thankfully, limited. He does, however, use some fabulous visual tricks to overcome the lack of a natural light sources below, by eerily illuminating the cave with flares and the piercing spotlight of torches which maintain an air of authenticity throughout.The British have always made good horror films, from the success of the Hammer films to Don't Look Now. You can make a scary film with a low budget, about three lights and some good story telling and The Descent keeps up this tradition. Overall the film left me feeling upset, disturbed and desperate never to go potholing, which I think is a measure of its success. The fact that I actually grew to like the characters before they were maliciously picked off one by one is a credit to the writer / director and the injection of some good old fashioned human tragedy to the proceedings lifts The Descent slightly closer to (although by no means amongst) the acclaimed movies of the seventies that it so wishes to join and far away from the mass produced rubbish of Hollywood.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best horror film of the decade,"The caves look amazing, they are so convincing. For what could be a really dull film to look at it actually looks amazing. The sound is awesome. It uses the surround and bass to perfection. The score is absolutely spot-on. The pacing is perfect. It's rare that films get the pace so right! It is really scary, makes you jump, painfully claustrophobic and incredibly tense. The atmosphere and suspense is perfect. The creatures looked pretty cool but nothing too insane. It is really gory and grotesque. Hands-down best horror film of the decade. Intensely claustrophobic and riveting horror that never lets you relax.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than Dog Soldiers?,"The Descent is summarily along the lines of Dog Soldiers...WITH GIRLS!. Director Neil Marshall makes his second major feature (first being Dog Soldiers) with a story of 5 girls who get together for a yearly ritual of adventure seeking, this time being Caving. Although character development & the story unfolds well from the get-go, it does take some time for the all consuming sense of dread to creep in,even though you know that it is coming, even inside the claustrophobic caves. Although brilliantly shot once again by Marshall's regular cinematographer, Sam McCurdy, I felt that the action takes place all at once - too fast & its over before you know it. Worth a look if you like low budget horror!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Metaphor of the Cave Adapted,"The Descent into darkness, into facing your fears in order to succeed and, consequently, get the revenge, the vengeance you aim for. This magnificent film is clearly a metaphor about courage, and the capability and ability to fight, to act and overcome our deepest fears, only that way we will be able to crawl and rise to the surface and breathe to a different new life and world, full of the purest oxygen, that we deserve.The scrip and production were way ahead of its time, in 2005. A so powerful story only portrayed by woman, way before the cultural, social, and political movements of this century, about equality in all fields of society.The music production department also deserves to be congratulated. We have the general theme, way original and on the point, but also the little music pieces that helped so well to transmit the message of tension, anxiety, claustrophobia, but also adrenaline and courage.""If we stop, we will die!"" or ""the only way out is to keep moving forward!"" - those are powerful sentences that we can use as life inspirational and motivational quotes.The climb the ceil of the cave scene was so powerful, so tense, so strong, simply transmitting force and courage.""Which way?"" - they asked with a lighter in Juno's hand. Only those who ever feel lost for years, know and understand that feeling and sense of pure anxiety, about what's is coming on the way next, about what atrocities, negativities we must deal and overcome next in our life path.When you fight to overcome, and fight again and again, personality begin to change - ""What happen to you?!"" Juno asked Sarah.The last scene when Sarah is crawling towards the surface of the cave, is so powerful! She is physically covered in blood, sweat and tears, emotionally is suffering, but she is fighting until the end, until she found her goal! That survivalist mentality that we all need this society is portrayed here. Plus, the magnificent classical music, that add the final emotional and simultaneously rational force to the scene that we viewers feel intensely as well.Personally, I have been in love with this film since 2005, when I saw it through a video club rental shop. Since then, I never witness a better story, plot, cast or directing that was better or can even compete with ""The Descent"".Overall, it's a masterpiece of huge relevance in proportion in suspense-horror subgenre. So, I will give it 10 out of 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
British horror at its finest,"So far the 2 best horror movies of the new millennium are made by the Brits. 28 Days Later and now The Descent. I put my DVD in expected a lot after reading many reviews and wanting to see it for ages (sadly none of my friends are horror fans and I hate going to the cinema by myself) and I must say I did enjoy it. I did not expect a lot of things to happen, and although I had read many reviews, I strayed away from spoilers. The storyline, creatures and main characters may not be the most original, but dammit the made a fine movie out of it.Okay so think about it; 6 girls stuck in a cave being attacked by unknown creatures. Sound original? Neh. I don't know why this film was so good. I was extremely surprised to see how much you actually see of the creatures and how often. That actually let me down a bit, I enjoy creature films more when you rarely see them. But once you see that first 'crawler' they pop up everywhere. The characters aren't exactly exciting, and I think I'm one of the few people who really disliked the sub-plot, although I thought the final scene with the birthday cake was very smart. The protagonist Sarah has the most background of the 6 girls of course, but I hoped that there would be no major character; that all 6 girls were equal in the eyes of the viewer. Sadly not. Luckily this doesn't let the film down and leads to probably the one part that scared me the most. The gore was great. Hands down. Halfway through I was thinking ""Why is this rated MA15+?"", and by the end of the movie I knew why. Not only the ending being extremely dark (UK version), the violence is very brutal when it comes. And you Brits seem to have something with eye gouging, because I've seen 3 British horrors involving some eye pushing!No lengthy review here. Just to sum this up: If you like; Horror Gore UK Women Gollum from LOTR Or dark places See this dark British film. Unless your a cave explorer yourself.

In fact there is something to be said about the power of music in a movie....I mean Halloween would not of been Halloween without John Carpenter's brilliant score. Anyway, I have a lot of favorite movies in all different categories and I can safely say that this is my favorite horror movie of all time.....just beating out The Exorcist and Halloween for the top spot.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Move over Hollywood,"If you love horror movies but are sick of all the crap that gets churned out of American film studios you should definitely go and see The Descent, the new British horror flick by Neil Marshall. Yes, a Brit! Showing the American movie moguls how a horror movie should be made! Rumour has it that this movie hasn't even made it to the cinema in the US. Wake up America!! This is a movie that will scare the life out of you, I didn't relax from about the fifth minute until the very end it was so tense. This isn't for the faint hearted, I'm not just talking about the moments that make you jump out of your chair yelping but also the moments of suspense when you're on the edge of your chair and also there are some pretty gruesome oh-my-god moments in there too! You can see the trailer here but it doesn't really do the film justice. The director has used a very small cast of mainly low-key female actors, I didn't recognise any of them which made the film so much better for me. (You know a horror film will be shite when Sarah Michelle Geller or Jennifer Love Hewitt are fleeing from a masked murderer with their breasts bouncing all over the place).The film tells the story of a group of adventure seeking friends who go pot-holing in America. Things go wrong and they end up trapped in the caves below, cue darkness, claustrophobia, and of course, death. The idea of predators lurking in the darkness might seem a little far-fetched to you but the director has based his creatures on the scientific and if you think about it a little, it isn't that unlikely! I thought that the ending was going to be spoilt by some sort of Hollywood finish but I was saved from such tripe. The director takes you on a roller-coaster ride and you don't get off 'til the very end. When the credits were rolling I couldn't move from my chair. The horror movie had done what it was supposed to do , frighten me to death and although the idea of extreme sport attracts me I can safely say that I'll never go pot-holing!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
No equal,"''Hey, there's something down here.''There is no equal is to this horror film within the last few years. It's better than the terror of 2005's WolfCreek, and while not having the epic quality of 2003's 28 Days Later,it scares you with class and restraint a bit like Open Water but inside the earth. It is a distaff Deliverance (1972), every bit as macho, every bit as scary in its suggestion of human and inhuman depravity.Six British ladies go spelunking in our Appalachians. Besides the discovery that these caves have never been charted is the terrible recognition that they are not alone two miles into the adventure. As if getting lost and stuck were not horrible, the girls face a humanoid clan that finds flesh a happy meal for what must be limited cuisine at the center of the earth.Although the crew faces some pretty disastrous events before seeing the light, director Neil Marshall never allows them to degenerate into the usually ranting females of other slasher films. These are competent women (one is a med student) whom we saw in the title sequence negotiating at least a class 6 rafting river. Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) lost a daughter and husband in an auto accident after that rafting trip and faces her late husband's affair with Juno (Natalie Mendoza), so writer Marshall has built in emotional tension to complement the physical horror.The camera work is agile and the lighting realistic enough to allow the head lamps and flares to do their job yet not deprive us of creepy monster images and scary false turns. The gore is about as vivid as any I have seen recently in the slasher mode, and the monsters, while not as horrific as Alien's, are memorable for their reasonably thought-out physiognomy with useless eyes and bat-like instincts. Where these monsters came from is perhaps a story for another time, for this cave-in is story enough.",,Anonymous,Horror
"A group of gal-pals go spelunking in Appalachia, and don't have a particularly good time.","""The Descent"" is an excellent horror movie with several scenes of real horror, lots of juicy/squishy sound effects accompanied by gobs of ruby-red blood, and a psychological element that gives it -- no pun intended -- unexpected depth. It's a decently written, solidly acted, fast-paced effort that has it's excesses (a few cheap scares and a virtual lake of blood that really aren't needed -- it's scary and gory enough already, thanks), but it's hard to hold it's weaknesses against it, given how well it delivers the scares. Appalachia hasn't looked this unappealing as a vacation destination since ""Deliverance."" By the end of the film, you're dying for something as wholesome and sweet as a 8-toed, banjo-picking mutant -- but alas, this little movie has something far more sinister in store for you. If you're not claustrophobic when you see ""The Descent,"" you will be when it's over.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cerebral Candy,"Being a lore and horror scholar, I truly enjoyed this film. It was almost like watching a bunch of Lt. Ripley's running around in the dark, but hot ones at best. Bad ass chicks that would kick any man's ass in a claustrophobic setting with some troglydites is an interesting premise that hasn't been done as well as this before.What worked in a subversive way is the subtext of Juno and Sarah's relationship...it could've been a bit more intense in the beginning, their history should've been a bit more elaborate.An interesting spin on it would've been the bit of Sarah's grief and psychosis throughout the film, especially after the loss of her husband and daughter. As the group of women were walking towards the cave, one of them mentions 'paranoia sets in...' with that said, what if it were all in Sarah's head? Grief and despair are lonely places and I feel the film would've worked a bit better if Sarah constructed the entire 'cave dwelling monster schema' in her head and she's murdering everyone to get to Juno. A bit of Haute Tension, but it would've worked better here and with a more tangible motive.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Overrated,"I bought a copy of The Descent last year when I read raves about it from British presses and I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed. I thought the subplot involving the lead character's husband and daughter was distracting and lessened the impact of the horror. There are several good jumps and lots of blood but the ending sucks. Try to ignore the commercials for the American release - it gives away the film's best scare! I liked Hostel a lot more - it was fun and it didn't try to be meaningful and insightful. It just delivered the good stuff, something The Descent should have learned. The film is also too long and takes too long to get to the action.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Smart Horror,"The Descent features a team of British spelunkers exploring a cave system in the Appalachian region of the United States. As you can imagine, the deeper they delve, the more harrowing their situation becomes.The Descent, unlike most horror movies, features characters that are for the most believable. And, more importantly, they behave in a somewhat rational manner. There's no bimbos checking out ""mystery sounds"", all alone, clad only in bikinis. It's tough chicks in for the fight of their lives.The movie does an admirable job of conveying a sense of claustrophobia and urgency in the beginning. To be honest, I thought the lead-up to the ""introduction"" of the creatures was quite a bit creepier than the creatures themselves. As a matter of fact, once the creatures make their presence known, the movie does tend to devolve into more traditional slasher fare.But, in the end, it's a decent horror movie with some downright chilling moments. Definitely worth checking out.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Decent horror movie, Horrible Ending",At first this movie started out really well. It had some substance of a story where as other horror flicks tend to fall short on. The movie could also get to you and make you jump quite a lot but thats at most what it will do. The movie uses a person's fear of the dark and whats contained in it for its real spooky area's but I feel the movie lacked a proper ending. I don't want to ruin it but it seemed as if the writer of the movie had reached his 2000 word count and hit print leaving you wanting more. If your looking for a movie to bring your girlfriend to so she jumps all over you go for this but if your looking for a more built horror film look else-ware. This one just doesn't deliver. I supposed you can't have your cake and eat it.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scary and Claustrophobic Cave of Horror,"The sportswoman Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) loses her husband and daughter in a car crash, but she survives. One year later, her friends Beth (Alex Reid), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), Sam (Myanna Buring) and Holly (Nora-Jane No one), leaded by Juno (Natalie Mendonza), invite her to explore a deep cave in the mountains. When the expedition is about three kilometers underground, a rock collapses and blocks the access tunnel, trapping the group inside the cave. With limited supplies, they try to find a way out, but sooner they face a hunger and savage breed of predators.The storyline of ""The Descent"" is not original, inclusive a couple of months ago I saw a very similar movie called ""The Cave"". But on the contrary of the foregoing film, ""The Descent"" has a great screenplay, with a scary, claustrophobic, tense and gore story, and a psychological study of the characters under a huge condition of stress, deteriorating the relationship among them. The use of light and darkness in the special effects transmit a sensation of fear for the unknown. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Abismo do Medo"" (""Abyss of Fear"")",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
More Horror than Thriller,"I went into the film having heard it compared to Alien and thus had my expectations set on a little more suspense-thriller than horror. That was an incorrect expectation as the film tended to try to shock the viewer at least every 4 minutes with a ""Boo!""(scary) moment and didn't build them up like they did in Alien (or like you'd find in classic thrillers from Hitchcock). It's mostly a splatter fest in the last half of the film. People looking for a gory splatter fest will not be disappointed.It's scary though and most of the viewers at the Waterfront Film Festival were frightened. I know my wife was scared.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A tense and very well made horror film!,"The Descent was a very nice surprise. I thought it was very well-shot and directed, had some very good writing, and very tense at times. I loved the claustrophobic feel the film gave me, and how it was all done underground. It really made me appreciate how horror films like these can be, and how America cannot do horror films like these often. The acting was very good, all performances were solid. The creatures were very scary, and we really root of all of the characters. Overall, this is nothing too original, but the execution is, and there has not been a horror film like this in the decade. Very good film, and I recommend it to practically anyone who loves horror films, and those who do not will also get creeped out by it.",,Anonymous,Horror
"lol, I could not finish watching it!","O man o man. Now I'm a 23 old guy who can handle a lot when it comes to scary movies or blood. At first I didn't even think the movie is worth watching because it was just a bunch of girls hanging out and laughing about stupid stuff. Once the expedition begins, things start to look different. One time I got so scared that I gave like a weird sound of me (simular to a low pitched scream hehe). This completely surprised me as I never show any emotions to movies. I re-winded the parts that scared me in hopes that it would harden me up a bit but that didn't really work. Not long after that I knew something really scary is going to happen and I turned off the movie as fast as I could :)Think twice before watching it; I feel it is the scariest movie I have ever watched.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Horror Movie That Scares The Hell Out Of You,"I had heard the hype surrounding this movie, mainly pertaining to the gore and graphic content that flows freely throughout the whole movie. I was expecting a gross-out film like ""Hostel"" or ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" which are disturbingly horrific, but not ""scary."" I was pleasantly surprised. ""The Descent"" is scary. You feel as if you yourself are in a claustrophobia-inducing cave being hunted by God knows what. The acting by these newcomers to mainstream cinema is impressive, as with a group of 5 women you either expect ultrafeminest-like macho-ism or nudity and helpless screaming. Nope...in ""The Descent"" you get realistic characters with pasts and actual human reactions. Without giving anything away, the ending was one of the most well-made parts of the film. With scenes reminiscent of ""The Shining"" and ""The Thing,"" this movie will literally scare the hell out of you.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad at all,"It's seems that cave related horror films are like buses - none for ages, then two come along at once. While The Cave, has yet to grace our screens The Descent is already out there, fulfilling the movie going publics people-trapped-in-a-cave-and-attacked-by-monsters needs.Like most horror films, there is little to no plot or character development. There isn't really any need. There is genuine tension and the cast seem to work pretty well. The camera work is a bit variable, very much from the 28 Days Later school of thought. So at times - generally the action - it can be quite hard to tell what is actually going on at points.Despite that, it actually manages to create a rather convincing sense of claustrophobia and fear. It also doesn't use too many of the old clich√© tricks for making you jump.So overall it hangs together rather well, some will no doubt be confused somewhat by the ending - but I think that's because it's confusing. Overall all though, it's quite compelling viewing and rather pleasantly surprising.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
possibly the most effective and scary horror movie of the year,"Neil Marshall is not a name I was familiar with before seeing his latest film, The Descent; he's made movies released in the UK, which got limited to no release in the US, to which it would be rightful to say that this is the best kind of calling card he could have made. It's a horror movie that's made with the eye of a professional, one who realizes that the best way to get an audience involved in what comes in the second to third acts of the picture is to make an equally compelling set-up act with the characters. The cast is also all but unknown to me, but they all too perform very strongly as the tough, hot women who decide to risk it down in a spelunking (if that's the word) expedition. Particularly the roles of Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) and Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) are very compelling once the action really starts to roll.But going back to the professional part of the style- this is the kind of horror movie where you do and you don't notice what the filmmakers are doing. Unlike a recent horror movie like Saw which induces lots of fancy shmancy photography and editing to try to draw a viewer in, the director knows the best way is to not show what's going on. With this case being a cave, where the claustrophobia, consistently dark corners, and the lack of direction and light, marks enough doom that it just needs to be shot in a straightforward telling-the-story manner. At the same time, even with all of this atmosphere induced once the creatures appear and the pace picks up tenfold, you almost might forget really that a 'style' is going on, which is quite pleasing at a time when horror directors feel the need to make things gritty just for the sake of it. This is not to say the film isn't one of the most gory of the year, with enough blood to probably go through two of these newer remakes.The set-up to the film with the girls is quite good (including a beginning involving a certain child that is one of the great modern horror movie beginnings by being realistically horrific), leading one to want to see these girls make it through to the end. The ending that has been apparently changed by Lions Gate for the US release is indeed unsatisfying, though it's lead-up is a plot element that's the only convention that doesn't really work. This is that a particular character near death gives information that's only there so that later in the film something else can come of this, breaking part of the belief within the disbelief (if that makes sense). But, overall, this is likely to become a nifty cult hit from overseas, the best of its kind to come from the UK since 28 Days Later. It doesn't really lie to you about what it is, and within certain conventions everything is put to top notch use with locations, tension, special effects and make-up, and even a couple of amusing points. It's a piece that I would probably in good conscience recommend to any serious fan of the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This is Alien underground; and even then, it's all a bit silly.","The Descent seems to be a film that has tricked people; it has tricked people into thinking that what it is they are seeing is new, original and fresh yet at the same time: scary, unpredictable and violent. I would argue back that The Descent is nothing more than a going through of the motions that made films like Alien and the original Dawn of the Dead the successes they are. I remember seeing Dog Soldiers, director Neil Marshall's first film, and being impressed with how he got across an atmosphere of no-hope; how he set the situation up with the soldiers and how he actually had the intelligence to at least acknowledge what sources he was getting his ideas from: in that case, it was Zulu as stated by one of the characters as they held up inside an old country house ¬ñ I liked the twist ending more in that film, also.Here, instead of trained soldiers who you would think are up to the task of defeating whatever beasts lie ahead; we are given half a dozen of your everyday British girls who are into boyfriends, clubbing, driving dangerously, hard drinking and..........climbing and cave dwelling. Here, you could say there is an excuse for the stupidity since they aren't going to be prepared for what awaits them unlike the soldiers were but then again, half way through The Descent; the women are strong enough and hard bodied enough to actually fight back against these cave monsters: and there's me thinking it would just be lambs to the slaughter but it turns out they're up for the scrap much like the soldiers were in Dog Soldiers. But wait a minute ¬ñ hard bodied, trained soldiers going up against beasts of some kind in a last stand scenario? That was Dog Soldiers; it would seem Marshall has made the exact same film only replace 'soldiers' with 'women' and delete 'trained' altogether out of the last sentence.Yes, there is no originality here in fact Marshall has just remade his last film. The characters don't need to be women in fact they are written as male characters BY an actual male ¬ñ Marshall probably just thought he'd be clever by changing the gender at the last minute; Queer theory fanatics will no doubt have a field day in deciphering what that all means, the result of which will probably culminate in them thinking the writer doesn't or hasn't known many women in the past. The Descent is Alien in a cave; but unlike Dog Soldiers, no girl ever comes up with the line: ""It's just like that film: Alien!"" The film begins in a tragic and eerie way and follows on with one character, as they walk through the woods before they get to the cave entrance, exclaiming some sort of warning: Watch out for hallucinations; paranoia; schizophrenia; etc. is her advice ¬ñ one question: why would she say all this and does she know something we don't? ""Watch out for film clones"" would be my advice to any one about to sit through this film. The girl also carries around a hand-held camera, filming her expedition which is something I remember Tarantino announcing that he hated in an interview once: but the POV shot from the DV camera is more a spoof of Aliens than that of a clich√©.Once we are at the entrance and in; the girls do their very best to find the smallest and tightest crevice they can in order to trap themselves into. They do a good job since one such scene involves a girl who it would appear is, (wait for it), actually afraid of small spaces that gets stuck in a tiny, tiny tunnel as the ceiling begins to move down on top of them. Then the first of, well, two twists: it appears that no one actually brought a map but that isn't the twist because one such character has some dark reasons: at this point you'd probably want to bang your head on the cave's rocky wall but then you remember you're not actually in the film since you've seen it all before anyway and haven't been absorbed at this point. Following on from this, The Descent for the next forty or so minutes turns into a series of obligatory jumps: I am amazed at how many people like this film ¬ñ it can't be the star power selling it and it isn't the level of gore so what is it that's so good about it? The jumps, for the record consist of: Bats flying out into a characters face; someone looking down a narrow gap only to turn around and have a buddy in their face and of course: ""Let's show the monster piece by piece in fast flash-bys."" Ridley Scott should sue.I admit that The Descent had me entertained and thinking what would happen at certain times. This was when the team got split up and had to fend for themselves and the final thirty minutes reminded me of Apocalypto; a film that hadn't been made yet. The film's crucible is also much better than Aliens' (Cameron's 'attempt') since it engages us and doesn't resort to cheesy one-liners and mindless gun toting action. Instead, it references Apocalypse Now and Predator in two immediate compositions (coming out of the swamp/avoiding detection of beast) but also gives us a deadly game of cat and mouse between the girls and the monsters ¬ñ often chase, often 'how do I get out of this situation'. The Descent wasn't a film I liked and can't say was great but it quenches the cheap thrills thirst although I was expecting a little more.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome,"Neil Marshall has created another top class movie, 6 friends get trapped when a caving excursion turns bad and the Descent becomes more than a journey into the depths of a cave system; it becomes a descent in to a world of mistrust and even madness.As they are hunted down by a breed of predators adapted to surviving in the darkness of the caves, their individual characters and friendships are tested to the limit.Marshall creates a very strong sense of tension throughout the movie, and all 6 of the actresses give outstanding performances, in particular 'Shauna MacDonald' and 'Natalie Mendoza' whose characters have their own sense of tension between them right from the start of the film.The Descent really is one of the finest horror movies to come out in years, it is relentlessly creepy, dark and atmospheric, it is very gruesome, but it's way more than just a gore-fest; and it is truly terrifying.9/10 Simply has to be seen",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cave Horror Has Never Been This Good,"Preface: I recommend going in blind if you are having doubts as to whether you want to watch the film doesn't matter. If you are a fan of horror this film is a must-watch even if you end up disliking it. One last thing, make sure you are watching the UK Uncut version for an extra 40 seconds of footage at the end that is far more brutal and better than the American version. If you can't find the UK version; finish the film then search up the Descent UK Ending on Youtube to get the proper cinematic experience.This is an all-female film done right, there's like one dude in this film it kinda felt like The Thing but with the researchers being all females even the plot took some notes from The Thing. Although the difference is it isn't a game of Among Us it's more of a game of survival. It was however entertaining, I haven't watched a cave horror movie before this I have seen underground horror movies but nothing quite like this. The plot is interesting and goes places the cinematography was entertaining and wasn't headache-inducing like you would expect when filming in caves although it was mostly done in a studio. So I assume that makes it easier to film it but it feels just right, to be honest. What kind of a person takes their recently widowed friend to unexplored and unsafe cave systems that may not have a safe route and deadly things lurking there. That's the only blatant plot hole I took issue with, given the rest of the film I'm happy to say I consider The Descent the best horror films of the 21st century. I'm not claustrophobic (I know kind of crazy) so her being trapped under rocks never really scared me (not a spoiler happens in the first 20 minutes), neither did the other cave running or crawling parts. The rest of the film with the blood and gore was incredible, the action was surprisingly good for a horror movie. I like how it was a mix of The Thing (without the whodunnit mystery), meets I am Legend but with the added twist of it all taking place underground. Even if you know some of the general plot it's still worth watching. I watched the Film Theory video about the Descent creatures and how their evolution is impossible or... possible. The horror aspects were still entertaining, our protagonist Sarah Carter (played by Shauna Macdonald) is very likable. Trust me the first 10 minutes make you sympathize with her and give you reasoning to like the film. Juno (Natalie Mendoza) was an absolute nut. I hated her character the entire feature-length. I find few faults with this one, a masterpiece to be cherished by all horror fans like me.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Probably one of best parts about the movie is that there is a feeling of dread and tension through the entire time they are in the cave. Its claustrophobic environments make an excellent setting for a horror movie. Much like Aliens there is also the tension in the air that something is about to jump out and attack. Although the movie is slow to start (some would disagree with me) after the action begins there is not one dull moment. Basically your subjecting yourself to a 2 hour cardiac episode. If I had one complaint (other than the cheesy story) over the movie it was the overuse of gore... which was completely unnecessary... it felt like the director was putting gore in the movie just cause he could: it doesn't add to the scare factor at all... which is impressive for a horror flick. Most scary movies NEED gore to get a reaction from the audience... this movie, didn't even have to have it, and people actually walked out the theater at some parts because of it. I give it a thumbs up though, and its the scariest movie I've seen in a long time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not Marshall's Best, But Still Better Than Many Horror Films","A year after one woman loses her husband and daughter in a freak car accident, she joins up with five of her friends to go spelunking in a big cave. But a fun afternoon turns tragic, and the women are not alone... can they survive the dark, tight spaces, and the unknown? This movie is by no means original. Other movies take place in caves and other horror movies take place in caves and other movies, horror and others, have people encountering similar problems in caves. For example, ""The Cave"" (see the review for this elsewhere). But this is not to say it's a bad film... all movies have predecessors, and this might set the new standard for cave movies.Also, I should highlight Neil Marshall, a ""rising star"" on the horror scene and a member of the nonsensically sorted group known as the ""Splat Pack"". This is his second horror film, following ""Dog Soldiers"". Many in the horror world and in the media have praised ""The Descent""... but the real praise should be for ""Dog Soldiers"", which is by far the better movie in terms of plot, editing and gore.""The Descent""'s biggest flaw was, for me, the editing and pacing. I watched the DVD timer and the entire first hour consisted of simple talking about random things with no plot relevance (I'm glad they have a good girl's weekend, but why does this matter?). The action arrives in the last twenty minutes. The action is gory and fast-paced, but hardly makes up for the first hour. Could we have extended the second half and lost the first half? Or maybe just condensed this to an hour long film? I realize theaters won't carry shorter movies, but the fact of the matter is there was not enough of a story to tell here.I also think the number of characters could be reduced. I cannot tell you the names of the women for the most part, and they had little back story. Cutting the number down to four or five and making them more three dimensional would have helped tons. I think there was a lesbian relationship in there somewhere, but it was not made clear. And the thick Scottish and Irish accents made the women more dense... far too dense to throw that many people in without developing them.One small complaint: the women in this film were supposed to be about twenty-five from what I could gather. I found them to be in their mid-thirties. This made the film not only misleading (why do you look so old?) but denied the viewer a horror staple: young women. The iconic blood bath scene was hot, but would have been even hotter with a younger woman. (I suppose you could argue the woman with the child needed to look older, but I don't think so. A 25-year old woman could easily have a 6-year old daughter, especially after seeing ""Amityville Horror"" where a young Melissa George somehow has a 12-year old daughter.)If you have the option, watch this film on DVD, because I honestly think the best part was the outtakes. Showing the green screen was hilarious... a nice surprise after such a snoozer of a film. I'm also disappointed in the special effects... notably the fake bats. Marshall proved in ""Dog Soldiers"" he's a fake gore and puppetry master -- why all the computerized blood and bats and morlocks?Despite all my nitpickery and bashing, the movie is still worth seeing and really sets a pace for other films of its kind. Neil Marshall has made a name for himself with this one and I hope he is able to ride that wave with ""Doomsday"" and future projects. I know what he's capable of and I want nothing more than for him to give fans the very best.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant,"This film was brilliant. I saw it the first time in a ""sneak preview"", I therefore had no idea what it was about. Everyone in the cinema was so taken, that they just remained silent throughout the film. It's full of surprises and the actors do everything so well, they really make you feel glad you're in your safe cinema seat and not going through the horror trip with them..I love horror movies,thrillers etc, and this one has got to be the best one I have seen in a long long time.

Gory and exciting horror film.,"A bunch of women drop into a cave system in the Appalachian Mountains and the bloody nightmare begins.Trapped by a rock fall,they are hunted and attacked by slimy humanoid predators.As the women fight for their lives,the fault lines within the group are exposed:betrayals surface,tensions explode and loyalties disintegrate.Neil Marshall's ""The Descent"" is a fast-paced and very exciting horror film that offers plenty of blood and guts.This movie plays on every primal fear:of darkness,claustrophobia,deformity,drowning and being savagely ripped limb from bloody limb by creatures with very pointy teeth.""Dog Soldiers"" was intelligent and vividly gory.""The Descent"" is a much darker,more intense horror flick.The atmosphere of fear and panic among six females is well-captured and the acting is great.The gore effects are spectacular with bodily dismemberment and geysers of blood to boost.I strongly recommend this film to fans of the genre.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Things lurk in the dark.,"A group of 5 friends head into an unchartered cave system to claim it as their own. But after a cave in forces them to move further down the rabbit whole they realize they are far from alone.Claustrophobic and filmed in the dark for those who are scared of it. This movie to me is more than that, it's as if they are so far away from civilization that they might as well be on a distant planet and the director played into this to no end. The chemistry between the leading ladies worked really well and the scariness is mostly atmospheric with many jumps in between. The location and setting is beautiful which is so cool because it lays the foundation of never knowing what's underneath. Very original and clever plot make this a must see creature feature.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Death By Gollum-A pack of chicks go cave spelunking.,"THis movie is not without it's flaws but it is generally a solid offering with a difference- an all female lead cast. I didn't particularly like the ending and it starts VERY slowly. I expect women to like this as a horror offering since all the characters besides the monster aspect are female.There should have been more development of the monsters- that was a failure of the script, to leave the darkness to fill in the gaps that the writer's imagination couldn't create.If you are claustrophobic at all, some of the beginning scenes will make your skin crawl and that's even before they find the monsters. Some of the physical prowess of the women in this movie was quite stunning. I wish they made em all like that. :-) Especially the Chinese dish.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I won't be spelunking any time soon.,The Descent started to frighten me long before any creatures showed up. This movie plays on multiple fears at the same time and that's what makes it effective. It also takes its time to build up suspense before it gets to the truly gruesome parts. I don't think I'll be going spelunking any time soon after watching this film.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"original movie idea,  really good.  For the most part","I gave this movie a 7 because it did have a very original story i liked a lot of things about this movie besides a good plot the location where the filmed it was really good in this day and age Hollywood is putting out some pretty crappy stuff where people just talk and move from room to room, but in this movie they go out in to the world and do something. i was super shocked when the filmed developed about half way through I expected the movie to be stupid and it turned out to be a great flick i have not seen the sequel to this movie but i really want to now super good movie, even with the British people in it lol I think that you should watch it for sure, i think that this is a thriller and a horror in one, it was great",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awkwardly constructed; some good scares though,"The greatest weakness of this film is the direction. The director concentrates too much on some irrelevant material, and occasionally fails to utilize the most exciting elements of the story being told to their utmost potential.Still, it's an exciting ride. Several women, all friends for several years, and adept at many athletic thrill-seeking pursuits, reunite after one of their number loses her husband in a tragedy. They decide to be spelunkers this time out, finding some mysterious, deep, and unexplored cave. There's excellent interaction between the characters, and the suspenseful scenes with difficult to see creatures menacing the team. Close hand to hand combat and claustrophobia are the order of this adventure, which rarely lets down. The director wastes about a half hour with unnecessary back stories, and nearly puts you to sleep, but if you make it to the chapter when they enter the cave, you will be rewarded. The acting is superb, the monsters appropriately yecchy and creepy for their grisly purpose.This could have been a better production with another director more masterful at the horror genre; however, the movie is still very chilling in places, and a worth while way to spend a couple of hours.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrifying Descent in Horror and Madness,"This was a film that I checked out after it came out on DVD for my first viewing. I thought the previews looked good, but I didn't realize how good until after finally seeing it. It's been some time since that viewing and got the chance at the Gateway Film Center. It was part of their Horror 101 series and I'm glad I got the chance to see it on the big screen there. I'm also now giving it a third viewing as part of the Podcast Under the Stairs' Summer Challenge Series for the 2000s. The synopsis is a caving expedition goes horribly wrong, as the explorers become trapped and ultimately pursed by a strange breed of predators.We kick off with a few women white water rafting. There's Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), Juno (Natalie Mendoza) and Beth (Alex Reid). Awaiting them is Sarah's husband Paul (Oliver Milburn) and her daughter, Jessica (Molly Kayll). He helps Juno out of the water and Beth watches them. Sarah and her family get into their vehicle to head back to the hotel. Sarah's world is turned upside down when they get into a car accident, with Paul and Jessica not making it.A year later, she meets up with Juno and Beth as well as the rest of her friends. Joining them is Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) who is a pretty experienced climber. Also there is her sister, Sam (MyAnna Buring), who is in medical school and Holly (Nora-Jane Noone) who is Juno's prot√©g√©e. The following morning they are going to check out a cave in the Appalachia Mountains.Something doesn't feel right when they get there, but they go anyways. On the way up, they see a dead elk, but no one really thinks anything of it. They go into the cave and they encounter their first problem, tight tunnel. Sarah is hearing children's laughter and ends up getting stuck. She starts to panic and Beth helps her through. A cave-in happens and they are now trapped. To make matters worse, Juno lied and no one knows where they are as this is an unexplored cave system. They have to find a way out as no one is going to come looking for them. They run into a much more dangerous threat though as well.I wanted to lead off stating that this film is really two different ones combined together. One of the scariest aspects of the film is the setting. I'm not claustrophobic, but this film really got to me a couple parts. They are trapped under the Earth, it is pitch black and some of the tunnels are extremely tight. The unknown of will they or will they not make it out creates a feeling of dread. There is good writing here when Rebecca is explaining the descent into madness in the cave could cause and actually states a bunch of symptoms that will come back up later.Now the second half of the film becomes a creature feature. What I like about this though, is the truth of what they are. There are some subtle things that this film has in it. For one, there's the cave painting. While I was watching it this time, I was wondering how long it would take a species to become what we have in this film. Originally I was thinking that this would have come from Native American times, so it would be a couple hundred years. The more I think about it though, this could legit be caveman times when they started to live in this cave system, which would really explain it so much more.There is another aspect to this film that happens at the climax. Juno is harboring more secrets than she is letting on and there is an amazing change in Sarah. I absolutely loved it and seeing her rise from the pool that has this nasty layer of floating things on it is great. The character arch there is wonderful. It actually gives the film a dual meaning to the title. Not only are they descending into the cave, but they are also descending into madness dealing with what they do.To the pacing of the film, which I think is great. The film never hits a lull and it really just builds tension throughout. As I stated above, we get two different films that mesh together seamlessly. I think that getting the characters trapped is scary to start off with. I could have had a film with just that and still enjoyed it. It really raises the stakes. I also like that we're hearing things that we aren't sure are real and seeing things as well fairly early on. Part of this is Sarah is unstable, but some of it is real.Shifting gears to acting here next. Macdonald is an interesting character to me. She had her whole world turned upside down due to tragedy. I feel horrible for her. She is trying to piece herself back together and then this happens. Her character is broken, but as I said, I love the change that happens to her to become the woman she becomes. Mendoza really becomes a villain in this film as well. She seems like a good friend, but there are subtle things we see. Once they are revealed, she becomes worse and worse. I don't want her to seem all bad. When she gets separated from Sarah, she does want to go back for her. I think that uneven feeling I have is helped by her performance being solid. I thought the rest of the cast works for what was needed and each is unique. This really shows as they are attacked as well. I couldn't finish this out without giving props to the actors that played creatures. They did an excellent job.The effects of the film I liked for the most part. Whenever they went practical, I thought they did a good job. The blood looked good. There is a bit of gore in the film and one scene in particular really made me cringe. The look of the creatures was absolutely amazing. There is a bit of CGI here and you could tell some of it is a green screen. Not enough to ruin it. I also feel the film is shot amazing though on top of that. Giving the setting life and making almost a character is really a plus for me.The last thing to cover before wrapping this up would be the soundtrack. I will admit for the most part it didn't stand out to me. What did though was the use of sounds in the cave. We see that with Sarah and the children's laugh. We know it isn't real, but it is creepy. The yelling and the echoes are used strategically as well.Now with that said, I liked this film the first time I saw it and it just got better to me after this viewing. It is very well written and the two concepts that are meshed together are seamless. The acting really reveals this and was great to bring these characters to life. I feel the pacing was good and builds tension throughout the film. The setting really helps there as well with the building of dread and claustrophobia. Practical effects were good, but I did have some slight issues with the CGI. The sound design was solid as well. If you haven't seen this film, I would recommend it. I found this to be great film for sure.My Rating: 9.5 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly a good scare,"The Descent is a story about 6 girls going spelunking. The director provided us with many jump scares. Fortunately, a couple were effective. The characters are pretty likeable to the end. Except one. A little disappointed with how they handled the main character at the end.There was no growth either, we got some backstory but then they just went off getting scared and dying.The only guy in the film was an adulterer... So there is that but the story isn't about thatGood pacing, the music hits, tension is pretty good. Happy they didn't held back on the gore, but the blood didn't look real. At some areas it even looked like red poster paints. Didn't see any dried blood either.The ending just felt like plot armour to me. It couldn't be more typical.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Certainly not.The Descent, as other commentators has suggested, is something I would have guessed to be a movie like The Cave, but this movie at least holds up on the fact that it's listed as a thriller. The movie itself is simple, and there are moments where what you would like the most, is to turn your head away.My suggestion would be to watch this with your girl/boy-friend, if you need someone to hold closely.

It was definitely the most disappointing movie i've ever seen. I actually wanted to go see it quite badly. It looked like it would actually be scary because i was expecting it to be suspenseful not just relying on gore for the freight but actual plot development. but none of this happened. The acting was also horrible and there were random pointless sudden flashes, the kind that are supposed to make you jump out of your seat, but they made no sense. and there was no explanation for anything. like why there are these demented adapted humans living in a cave. there's no justification for it at all. If you scare really easily then it will scare you so go see it. Or if you like to laugh at really horrible movies like me than you might want to watch it.

surprising for a horror movie with only chicks,"This movie is quite up to the standard of fast moving original horror flicks made after 2000! Also the fans who don't like suspense there is enough gore to keep you entertained. The story (only female leads) is quite gripping. Even for the most experienced horror fan this film contains twists you cannot expect.The only real problem I have is that the female characters are not very likable. I didn't have much sympathy for them. Some of the actions of these characters are very questionable and seemed to be aimed to shock rather than compel. You just don't care that something will happen to them. I also had trouble relating to their hobby. What possesses people to go adventuring deep into caves they know nothing about. Especially if the rest of the world is unaware of this. Surely you take some precautions in case things go badly. None of that here. How often don't you read about incidents where people get lost or killed because of an adventure go wrong or where others have to risk their lives to save these imbeciles. It is hard to evoke sympathy for people who disregard safety like this but at the same time expect to be rescued when things go wrong.That being said however there are some very good old school horror elements that make up for most of the flaws. The setting, the darkness and the sound are very effective. You can imagine the terror the characters must be experiencing. How would you carry yourself in a similar situation?

"""Descending into Terror: A Thrilling Journey through Darkness with 'The Descent'""","""The Descent"" is a masterclass in tension-building and atmospheric horror that captivates audiences from start to finish. Neil Marshall's direction shines as he expertly crafts a chilling narrative around a group of adventurous women exploring uncharted caves. The film wastes no time immersing viewers in a sense of unease, utilizing claustrophobic settings to amplify the mounting terror.One of the film's strongest elements is its well-developed characters. Each woman is uniquely portrayed with depth and complexity, allowing the audience to form strong connections with them. As they navigate the dark and treacherous caverns, the tension rises not only from the claustrophobia but also from the psychological and physical challenges they face.The movie excels in creating an ominous and foreboding atmosphere, utilizing darkness and isolation to deliver heart-pounding scares. Marshall's brilliant use of lighting, sound design, and cinematography intensifies the fear, keeping viewers on edge throughout.What sets ""The Descent"" apart is its ability to merge visceral horror with emotional depth. The characters' fears and struggles become palpable, heightening the stakes and making the terror all the more impactful. Additionally, the film's shocking and unpredictable twists contribute to its lasting impact, leaving a haunting impression long after the credits roll.Overall, ""The Descent"" is a triumph in the horror genre, delivering a thrilling and unforgettable experience. Its combination of compelling storytelling, strong character dynamics, and relentless suspense cements its place as a standout among horror aficionados and general moviegoers alike.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Kick A$$ (Spoiler...Maybe),"I saw this movie last night at the last minute and I couldn't be happier. Sure hearing a couple of my girl friends scream and jump from their seats was worth the price of admission alone but the movie was surprisingly good. The movie looked mediocre when I saw the trailer and I didn't think much of it even as a huge horror fan. Honestly I didn't know what to expect when I went but as the movie progressed I became more interested. The cave really became an additional character, the element of fear instilled by being trapped somewhere underground and finding out there are creatures down there with you and needing to find a way out before they find you added a strong amount of suspense.The fact that it is an all female cast is interesting and does not take away from the film at all, so don't let that stop you. Sure I could tell when something was going to pop up ""out of no where"" but regardless the movie had its fair share of surprises. An eerie feeling was present throughout the entire film, which kept you on the edge of your seat. The ending as well as the entire film is open for interpretation and as someone who has seen both endings I can say that both are satisfying in their own way. All in all The Descent is worth seeing in the theatre for an awesome atmosphere (if you can't I would advise seeing it late at night in total darkness by yourself). Go with some girl friends who scare easily and watch them jump. The Descent contains action, suspense, jumps, and even some laughs but once it gets going it doesn't stop.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Descent is an amazing movie,"Horror movies always had a sweet spot in my heart ever since I saw ""The Exorcist"" at the age of 12 and didn't sleep right for the next few weeks! Unfortunely, horror movies have been downhill for the last 10 yrs or so and sometimes it seems this genre is completely lost. Nothing could be further from the truth, however, when you see ""The Descent"" A descent not only physical, but also mental as the characters experience hardcore fear. This movie is scary, really scary. It messes around with one of humanity's greatest fears (claustrophia) and the directing is just amazing. The plot is denser than it appears; a lot of the character development is essential and their behavior is extremely realistic (forget Hollywood's cool heroes with clean haircuts).

Nice Balance of Original Ideas and Reliable Conventions,"A tight-knit trio of outdoorsy ladies invite some friends along for a weekend of alcohol and spelunking, but ultimately bite off more than they can chew in an uncharted system of North Carolina caverns. Darkness is an essential ingredient of any good horror flick, and after a chamber collapses shortly into the expedition, there's no shortage of that. The tight quarters add an appreciable element of claustrophobia to the mix, too, which really heightens the tension when a creepy tribe of pale, man-eating creatures appear and begin picking off stragglers. It's a good recipe, with plenty of quality spooks, but the low visibility and lack of characterization for most of the supporting cast meant I was playing guess-the-victim during most of the hairier scenes.

"Two big flaws, otherwise a nice little feminist horror movie that makes you think","I went in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. The movie is gory, but the gore never seems gratuitous. Most importantly, it's a lot of fun to debate to what extent this can be considered a feminist allegory. There are the tried and true baptism and rebirth scenes, and lots and lots of penetrations and narrow tunnels, but besides all the cheesy overdone stuff, there is an underlying message about violence against females and the difficulty women have surviving in a male dominated world that tries its best to consume them or pit them against each other.The two huge flaws in the movie come pretty early on. In the first, two of the women accomplish a physical feat that requires superhuman strength. I won't spoil it, but it involves hanging by one arm from a rock (try doing it from a plastic ring for a while if you doubt this is difficult) while simultaneously setting climbing gear into the ceiling. It is not utterly impossible (almost, but not quite), but the nonchalant way in which it is accomplished by such obviously weak women destroys the credibility of the movie early on. I just assumed it was a dark fairy tale, and enjoyed the rest of the movie as an allegory.The second flaw is the reliance on the old cheap scare tactics of lesser horror films (the CG bats are laughable). The first four or five jump-in-your-seat scares are so by-the-books that everyone in the audience knows: A - exactly when they will happen, and B - that they will turn out not to be the creatures. Once the creatures show up, these silly telegraphed moments go away for the most part.Besides these two flaws, the film is entertaining, well-directed, and genuinely scary. Many viewers will comment on the lack of character development. It's not really an issue. You know all you need to know about the two main characters in the movie. There are two major plot twists which are very violent, the second hurts the feminist vibe of the movie a bit, but it also gives the film a little bit of a moral center to discuss in addition to the feminist angle.There are many ignorant male theater patrons (female as well I suppose) who complain that the stars are not ""hot"" and that there are no breast flaunting, hip-waggling, pelvis grinding moments. This is actually a good thing, but if you're going in hopes of some brainless T and A action, stay at home los lonely boys. Thankfully, the movie never stoops to flashing skin, at least not nubile female skin... there's plenty of pale cave-dweller skin.There are a slew of negative reviews lately that seem to be some kind of backlash against the critical praise that this movie has received. Make no mistake, this movie is not ""the next Alien"" or the greatest horror film of the decade, but it is worth watching on the big screen. The ending was altered significantly from the European version which is disappointing, but the movie retains most of its value even with its slight Hollywoodish sugar-coating.

WOW,"I'm at a loss for words, I wasn't expecting this movie to be sooo incredibly good. These actresses did a PHENOMENAL job, especially when portraying one's sheer will to live.

i think they all looked like chupacabre's,"i enjoyed the movie i thought it was good, but i think what interested me the most is deffinatley the creatures that were attacking the girls. they deffinatley were the main focus of the story that kept me with definite interest in the movie, mainly because i was trying relate something i could relate them to. but the main idea i had and stuck to was the fact that i thought they looked like chupacabres. no really, I've never seen a chupacabre before, but i really thought that if i ever did see one, it would hafta look like that! they even sounded kinda like a chupacabre to me... so i would like to know if anyone else shared the same point of view... this movie to me, really seemed like the closest creature that any cinema has ever came remotely close to as what i would picture of portraying a chupacabre... i think they all looked like chupacabres i guess is what I'm really trying to say.... anyone else agree?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grim-fest,"I saw this at a film fest, so I feel fortunate at having the opportunity to see it in wide screen, with the original ending, with a live audience. It is, for starters, grim The entire movie happens underground, and the exceptional set direction lends the feeling of utter despair. It's not unlike a sort of Aliens 3, set beneath the surface of the earth, and with an inevitably rising body count.The Descent falls into the same category as the director's previous film, Dog Soldiers - in which a British paramilitary force has to confront werewolves in a bleak forest. That's to say, The Descent is a genre film that takes its genre very seriously. True, not much here is new, and the film may seem overlong given the long underground sequences. But it's undeniably moody - and classy. With a more wit and a sharper plot, who knows how great this might have turned out?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good action packed horror movie,"The Descent (2006) lost count how many times. i have seen this and yet this movie seem to still make me jump.They were great build up in the movie, to create the tension for first part of the movie and when the scare start, they just don't let down.There are really great jumpy moments in this movie, which i really liked, there were very nasty scenes . like the broken leg. which i find hard to watch, yet i don't mind the gory scenes.The acting was really good from the whole cast!. I give this movie 8 out of 10.Also I am shocked with some of the bad reviews this movie is getting and kind of find some of the bad reviews a little funny, i guess we all have are own taste in movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A decent descent,"The Descent uses an old horror formula, but with a few twists, a little artistic creativity, and some clever directing, the movie succeeds where other horror films have failed. The tension is well orchestrated, and highly subjective, bringing a real sense of claustrophobia to the viewer. Some effort has been put forward to building a realistic, scary setting rather than an artificial fantasy world like that in 'The Cave', and with a lot of hand-held camera-work and minimalist lighting, The illusion is real enough to get the audience hooked.In the Appalachian mountains, six girls go on a cave exploration trip, deep under the earth. Soon the fun adventure ends, and a real one begins when they get lost, and find themselves stocked by strange creatures who are fast agile climbers, and vicious carnivores.The funny thing about The Descent is how the scares are quite predictable, but they make you jump anyway. Sometimes you know when something is going to happen, but you don't know what. Other times you know what is going to happen, but you don't know when. When the ending comes, It's quite obvious that there is going to be one last surprise, but it comes in a way that is not only surprising, but provides a clever bookending to the protagonist's journey, the journey into madness.If this is your kind of thing, I can assure you that you wont be bored. From the moment the characters make their descent into the inevitable, we the viewers descend with them.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
a fantastic horror film!,"The Descent follows a group of women who go spelunking in an uncharted cave system in the Appalachian Mountains. As they are crawling through the tunnels, the cave collapses leaving them trapped and soon to realize that they are not alone down there. The Descent is not particularly groundbreaking or original in regards to the plot, but it is executed with such perfection and contains all the elements essential to creating tension, suspense, and scariness.The Descent does an amazing job creating a pervasive feeling of dread, terror, and hopelessness that lingers through the entire movie's run-time, and giving you no time to catch your breath or relax. It is a non-stop thrill ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat with your eyes glued to the screen.In addition to a substantial amount of violence, blood, gore, and disturbing imagery, there is also a great amount of psychological tension including but not limited to: claustrophobia, nyctophilia, the feeling of being lost, isolation, hopelessness and internal conflict between characters.The characters are well-developed and interesting. They are not the disposable slasher movie teen idiots put on the screen simply to die; they are actually deeply crafted with varying personalities and the audience wants them to survive. The tension and chemistry between them helps to build an element of deep human drama that usually is not present in a movie such as this. This is all heavily supported by the great performances by the entire cast.The Descent uses so many great techniques to make it as intense and scary as possible.For example, the reveal of the monsters is from a shaky found footage perspective that puts you in the moment. Now a days there are entire movies that are found footage, but the Descent only made that one particular scene found footage and it was executed to perfection. The camera-work, lighting, music, sound effects, and special/practical effects all combine to create an effectively creepy atmosphere.In conclusion, the Descent is a horror-masterpiece that does everything right and is a must-see for any and all horror fans.It should also be noted that this movie has two endings, the unrated and the US cut version. I HIGHLY prefer the unrated version and I would strongly suggest watching that instead of the US cut.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still Getting Circulation Back In My Arms,"I went to go watch this movie on a night that it was dark and rainy (which is really odd, for I live in a desert).The movie started off a little slow, but it did an excellent job at introducing us to the characters and the bonds between them. I'm sure if they didn't do this, I wouldn't have cared what happened to them.Being claustrophobic and acrophobic (fear of tight spaces and heights) everything in the cave had me pulling at the neck of my shirt trying to breath.Then the horror started. It was bloody, but unlike some movies, it didn't seem to be overly gratuitous. No one got naked (which is too common in Americacn films)The only two things I would say would've made it better are : If I didn't go with a friend who grabbed me so tight in the movie that I lost Circulation in my arms ( I may re-rate it after I see it again without the grabber) If it had the original UK ending. Much better ending there IMHO.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
very nearly gave me a panic attack,"Don't watch Neil Marshall's The Descent if you suffer from claustrophobia. Just¬Ö don't. This film does for caves what Alien did for derelict space stations and what The Ring did for videotapes. Cleverly combining close quarters panic, the gnawing fear of losing your way in a near infinite set of tunnels and some visceral, throat ripping terror, it's one horror package that will leave you reeling. I believe this is the one that put Marshall on the map, and since then he's been doing mostly medieval style action adventure (he helmed the pilot for Game Of Thrones). This is his first, and most effective outing in a really solid career. The premise is simple: a group of girls decide to go on an excursion deep within a cave system in Eastern Europe. They run into a string of bad luck though, as they first find themselves hopelessly, sickeningly lost. Then the real fun begins as they realize they're not alone down there, and that something is hunting them. Terrifying subterranean creatures emerge like Gollum on bathsalts, fast, wiry, agile terrors from the deep that know the system inside out and prey on these poor girls one by one. Once they show up its a chaotic bloody free for all that will shred your nerves, but I almost found everything leading up to that even more scary. The slow buildup where they realize they are just so lost and may be stuck down there forever just puts a knot in your stomach and instills a hopeless dread that can't really be equalled by any monster or gory scene. Still, those things are pretty gnarly and provide more than a few wicked scares, especially when the girls first catch fleeting glimpses of them around corners and between cracks, dismissing them as tricks of the light. Marshall also employs cunning narrative tricks to perpetuate the lack of any kind of way out, one in particular that just curdles the blood in its ruthless, resolute sense of doom. The scariest film you will ever see set in a cave, and one of the premier fright fests ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tight, Sharp. Yarn","This film has polarised opinion quite sharply, and has inevitably been compared and contrasted with ""The Cave"", released at a similar time and with broadly similar themes. For me Neil Marshall has created an above average tale, which, whilst paying homage to the genre steers away from clich√©.The pretty much all female cast toys with the viewers stereo types. A girly, simpering whimpering band they are not. Dramatic tension between the characters is well developed ,and heroic deeds are just that, without the ""macho"" bravado that can bloat a Stallone style performance.Stylistically, those familiar with ""Dog Soldiers"" will not be disappointed or surprised. The ""b list"" cast pull together in true egalitarian style to play their parts without trying to steal the show - sometimes less is more, and understated horror is often the best.The transition from ""cavers lost in a cave"" to ""cavers terrorised by strange things"" is a bit ""clunky"". But it is a tribute to the film that it would have worked as a straight caving accident drama.At 99 minutes it just stays within its welcome - and has run its course. Non fans of the genre will not be converted. But fans will find this a welcome addition.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
finally an excellent horror movie!!! A must see...,"This movie came as a surprise to me.i thought it was going to be like ""The cave"", which was cool, but wasn't really all it could have been...too Hollywoody.Descent on the other hand, is scary, intense, graphically great, simple, actresses are good,the atmosphere is excellent...I think, that a big part of the suspense was that there are no guns, hi tech gadgets, no muscular men,...just skinny, but tough chicks!The story could happen in real life, not likely off-course, but possible, the ""bad guys"" are more possible than aliens, ghosts,...and are really well made. In one claustrophobic seen, i actually felt the panic of being trapped between tons of rocks,...scary stuff.oh yeas, the story: a few girls get together after a few years to get some adrenaline pumping with cave diving. One of them has been traumatized by an accident, where her husband and child lost their lives. The story more or less focuses on her and her acceptance with the death of her loved ones and off course the struggle of these girls in getting out of the cave system and escaping ""the ones"", who would rather have them for dinner...thats about it.to sum it all up: definitely worth seeing, and one of the best scary films I have ever seen!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very good,"Creepy eerie little horror film from England. It's about six women friends who decide to explore an unknown cavern that leads underground. While there that get trapped and find there is a race of cannibals down there too.That's about it for plot but this is still very good. We get to know and understand who the women are before they descend. Refreshingly they aren't all stereotypes--they are flawed but interesting human beings. Their dialogue is sometimes hard to understand (this was done in England and the accents are thick) but you can still figure things out. All the acting is excellent too.The descent down the cave is beautifully done--constantly being filmed from odd angles to keep the viewer off balance. Also we don't see anything more than the women see underground. They're surrounded by darkness and we're always expecting something to leap out. The film works beautifully in a dark theatre--it's like you're in the cave with them.The cannibals themselves don't pop up until an hour in--but it's worth the wait. The first views of them are downright terrifying (I yelled aloud at one) but then it doesn't work. For me they stopped being scary when we get good looks at them--they look like what they are which is guys in costume. Still the gore starts and it is STRONG. Blood flies and bodies are torn asunder. Most of the fights are shot in fast motion which, oddly, works. It all leads up to a silly ending. I know the American version has a different conclusion than the European version--we'll have to wait for the DVD to find out what it is probably.Still a good strong horror film. But DO NOT see it if you can't stand blood and gore--this is very strong stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Exceptionally good!,"Shocking opening scene. The film has stunning nature shots in the beginning. The cast is brilliant, and the film is interesting from the beginning, and never gets boring. Once they're inside the cave, some scenes really feel claustrophobic - very effectively done. I was nervous for every move the characters made, not knowing what might await them around the next corner. Unlike most horror movies where I jolt in my seat with fright because of a sudden blare of music and not because of what happens, this film delivers genuine scares, even without music. Now, that's the qualities of a real scare-fest! The second half of the film more than compensates for the lack of blood in the first half, loaded with blood, guts and gore so nerve-wrecking that I honestly found it difficult to watch some of the scenes. It was just that well done! Quite terrifying, actually, and definitely not everyone's cup of tea, so be warned. It is also nice to see how the weakest character becomes the strongest. Exceptionally well made film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I imagine that seeing this on a larger screen would have made this much more interesting and having surround sound would have made all the difference, but on a small screen, it seemed lost and out of place.There are times when the story just drags and seems too slow for a horror movie and then there are times when it's too fast, but overall, it's not bad, but there could have been more tension and a better sound track.Seeing this with the second one to follow, and without interruptions would probably be much more entertaining.Not a bad movie, but still a little slow, and not truly scary.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
pure adrenaline rush (and frickin scary too),"my buddy and i recently watched neil marshal's ""the descent""and i have to say we were impressed.unlike many horror movies, this one actually had good character development, crucial if you want the audience to have a vested interest in the characters and their fate.and the scenes in the cave are quite well done, showing the fear and panic of the characters.you really feel for them since you've had a chance to get to know them.once the action gets going, it grabs you by the throat and won't let go.we barely had time catch our breath before another intense action/horror sequence would bombard us.the tension at times was palpable,and once the creatures are revealed,they are truly terrifying indeed and you never know when or where they will show up.my friend and i both jumped several times throughout and it wasn't until the movie ended that we were able to take some deep breaths and sigh in relief, as our minds and bodies had been in overdrive.i thought the ending was good and unpredictable,which is rare these days.even after the movie ended it took awhile for us both to wind down from the adrenaline rush.this is a movie you might not be able to get through alone, so you are better of watching it with someone.be prepared for an adrenaline fueled thrill ride along with some genuine terror. you have been warned",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Like a Sci-Fi channel movie, but done right.","Sorry to those not in North America for the SciFi reference, but it's appropriate. The SciFi channel is known for these low budget movies that are based on a good concept and plot outline but end up being poorly executed. Right movie, wrong budget, actors, director etc.In the case of ""The Descent"", the basic plot, a group of women x-gamer types go spelunking and get more than they bargain for, is solid.

It even manages not to be overly predictable.For what it is, this is a pretty solid effort.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best horror flicks in the last few years.,"Like ""Open Water"" and ""Blair Witch Project"", this is a movie that holds more in its setting than it does in the fear factor. ""The Descent"" isn't your typical screaming, jump-fest, it's a film that creates the situation more scary than the atmosphere. However, what makes a movie like this work is the constant feeling that something will in fact trigger that atmospheric feeling that every horror tries to manipulate onto the audience. And even though there are certain scenes that have you jump out of your seat, this is not an exercise in just how many surprises you can take. It's an exercise in how long you can have your hands squeezing the seat before it starts to hurt.It is a movie that centers around Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) and her female friends who, every year, take a trip somewhere adventurous and explore. After Sarah's husband and child are tragically killed in a car accident, she suffers emotional pain but decides to bond again with her friends and do something fun to get her mind off of everything. This time, they decide to explore a deep cave. Of course, being a horror, the cave isn't really ordinary. In this cave, there are dead ends, rocks falling, bridges collapsing, deep holes, and-- oh yeah, mutated creatures. These deadly creatures hunger and without warning, eat the living flesh right off your body. Sarah and her friends must avoid all obstacles and reach the exit of the dark cave, before it's too late.Neil Marshall, previously famous for ""Dog Soldiers"", creates a movie so intense, so teeth clenching, you have no choice but to feel tense. His use of space and camera angles creates an almost surreal claustrophobic feel. There you put yourself in the situation, and as you imagine yourself walking through a dark cave full of monsters, you get more terrified. Never before has a movie put me in such terror without even realizing it.In the day and age where horrors are all the same, and where they're only made for money, a horror fanatic needs some sort of reminder that there are some movies that still excite. Being a huge fan of the genre myself, it was a pleasant treat, and definitely a scary one. Call it being biased, call it too early, but ""The Descent"" makes its way up into one of my favorite movies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A little disappointed.,"I had expectations on THE DESCENT being a really scary horror film with lots of gore, and tons of disgusting and super-scary jumps and stuff. But it wasn't.There are two things that are really bad with this film. First, it doesn't start until one hour into the movie. Somehow, the creators of this movie thought that it was a good thing to do a boring one hour, before the stuff kicks loose. I guess they wanted to present all characters and set everything up - however, that's where error number two is: we don't get to know the characters, and we don't get to understand or know any set ups.All people, including the leads, are totally nameless and faceless women, and when they're in the cave, it's so difficult to tell them apart that you just simply don't care. And yes, that's even though the director tried to use some clever color-tricks to save that problem. Which it doesn't.A movie with a bunch of people that you don't care about or care for, or even know who they are, is quite frankly a bit boring.The last half hour, though, and the ending, is nice. It feels like a totally different movie! It's action, it's suspense, it's a bit scary... and it's gory, violent and have some really nice scenes.Fast forward one hour into the movie - you won't miss anything important anyway!Set up as a normal film, and done in a proper manner, this movie could have been really really good. Now, it's a wasted opportunity.Don't believe the hype.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Can someone turn up the light a little?,"Many scenes are simply too dark to see what's happening. Sometimes that's obviously done for the storyline, but with a lot of females that look a lot the same in the dark, it's not viewer friendly! ;)The characters are again not too original. One hurt, one rebellious, not a surprise on that part. The storyline contains a few surprises, but not that big that anyone would remember them years later...But if you're afraid of heights and depths, dark and claustrophobic, this one gives you wet hands at some moments. It's clearly not a base jumping promotion or cave exploration promo video, on the contrary. Just give it a try if the top movies are rented out.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
This Movie was terrible and extremely stupid,"I don't see how anyone with any type of intelligence could think this movie was good or scary. The only scary parts were just parts that made you jump with things flying out of nowhere which has pretty much been done a million times in other movies. Other than that it was these stupid half-human cave dwellars trying to kill and eat these 6 girls. I normally like bloody and violent scary movies but this one was just plain stupid. The gore was fine but was obviously overdone for no apparent reason. Then there was a bit of a twist to the plot at the end and then the movie just ends without explaining anything about Sarah. We never find out why she has the problems she does, did something traumatic happen to her in the past? And then the movie ends without us knowing what exactly happens to her at the end. We never find out how these half-human cave dwellars got there or who they are, were they human at one time and adapted to being stuck in the cave? who knows.

OK horror thriller,"The maker of DOG SOLDIERS is back with THE DESCENT, about a group of 20-something gals who go spelunking only to run into bloodthirsty cave creatures. Sound familiar? It should. The same plot was used for THE CAVE, although that group was coed. And like THE CAVE, THE DESCENT is only partially successful. The spelunking sequences are tense and scary, but once the monsters appear, all the tension and scariness blow out the window. The monsters can actually be seen as interfering with the plot, as the group has become trapped far underground and must find its way back to the surface. Furthermore, once glimpsed, the monsters are just plain silly. However, I will give the filmmakers kudos for the gore level, which quickly escalates once the monsters appear. There's also a ""rebirthing"" scene involving the lead character that was virtually duplicated in the more recent APOCALYPTO (THE DESCENT is a 2005 production, so it is anyone's guess why the delay in getting it to the U.S.). See THE DESCENT (and THE CAVE, for that matter) for the spelunking scenes. Skip the rest.

Primal - This is Survival of the Fittest. Hunt or be Hunted.,"The Descent caught me off guard on how scary it is. Good horror movies are so hard to come by. What I most especially appreciated about this movie is how primal it is. The characters recognize what they have to do and take a stand against impossible odds. This is survival of the fittest. Hunt or be hunted. I compare this movie to the original Predator. Lost in uncharted territory and dealing with an unknown creature or creatures. The Descent forces its characters to enter a savage kill or be killed mentality 'descending' them towards madness.By the way, there is a sequel. I don't recommend it by any means. I actually knew it wasn't going to be worth watching after reading reviews on IMDb and rotten tomatoes but it was easily available on Netflix Streaming and my curiosity got the best of me. It ruins the perfect ending of the original. So, yea, don't bother with the sequel. Store it away with Alien Resurrection, Terminator 3 and 4, and Batman and Robin and act like it doesn't exist.-@Darryl_BrianMorallyOblogatory.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
An exhausting experience,"Neil Marshall's The Descent received wide critical praise upon it's release, some even toting this 2005 film as one of the best horror movies of the decade. While I did find some aspects of the film quite underwhelming, The Descent provided one of the most intense and uncomfortable film experiences I've ever had.While I myself am more a fan of subtle psychological horror films, ones that provoke thought whilst building the tension, The Descent was a nice change of pace. Of course we must get through the character introduction and scene-setting points in the story, but these sequences surprisingly didn't feel tiresome. All the characters we are introduced to are fairly interesting as they each slowly begin to generate their own personality traits and attitudes as the story progresses, only up until the bloodshed, but at that point, who the hell really cares, right? It's refreshing for a horror movie to portray the female characters as strong, independent and resourceful forces rather than the screaming bimbos we've become so accustomed to. Our characters aren't perfect though as they quite often play victim to the usual horror movie tropes and you'll find yourself yelling at the TV as characters make dumb decisions or have strange motivations for their actions.One issue that I had with The Descent was the ending. While the ending ultimately seems appropriate, it was still supremely unsatisfying. It's almost as if the writers wrote themselves into a corner and couldn't find a rewarding way to end the story. There were also some poor set and lighting work at times but it wasn't majorly distracting. The scenes of combat against the hellish creatures were incomprehensible most of the time and it was fairly frustrating as I attempted to make out what exactly was happening, only having to wait until the fight was over to see who won. These fight scenes don't make up the majority of the film, but the shoddy camera-work is very noticeable and surprisingly amateur.The Descent is an experience that will leave you exhausted. It's gruelling and tense almost constantly, merciless in it's depiction of claustrophobia and extreme violence. But once the initial waves of sickness and dread die down, the film finds ways to invigorate and energize the viewer. It's an experience you truly won't forget, but it's also one some may hesitate to return to.A no-nonsense, gut wrenching thriller, The Descent is guaranteed to satisfy any viewer's gore-driven fantasies , especially those who didn't realize they had any.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not horrible not a masterpiece. It was well worth the $1 at the discount movie house. I would like to see a little more answered. At any rate the movie can be considered scary in a real life kind of way. Being trapped in a cave and me being claustrophobic was enough to freak me out. Sometimes the camera work got a little crazy in a Oliver Stone kind of way and the creatures, well let's just say that zombies and bat people don't really do it for me. But it will work for October and getting in the mood for a creepy movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good film and better than the bog standard Hollywood fare we're used to,"Superior British horror movie sets tense claustrophia with old fashion suspense and comes out on top.There have been a lot of less than impressive horror movies in recent years, particularly out of Hollywood. Cabin Fever is a prime example of such a sub-standard flick and there are many more. One distinct advantage British horror has is a true grittiness to it, a kind of 'realness' which makes the characters a lot easier to identify with.In The Descent we follow the fortunes of an all female cave exploration team who are going on an adventure in a mountain range. The purpose of this expedition is to bring them all together after the hideous events of the previous year which are revealed at the beginning of the movie.It's not a particularly big name cast with perhaps Saskia Mulder as Rebecca who also appears in the BBC's Book Club the best known actress on display. Certainly the most recognisable. However, the strength of this movie isn't in its star acumen, but rather in its story telling and direction.The Descent is claustrophia in abundance; tight cave systems barely give room to breath, and the overwhelming darkness compounds it ten fold. In this movie, light is at a premium.As for the horror side of it, well let's just touch on the fact that there are rather unfriendly cave dwellers (Who it must be admitted look successfully hideous) who intend to make life difficult for our heroines. They also sound vile - a testament to the sound engineers and overall design of these characters.Gore levels are impressive without being over the top, and what would a horror movie be without its gore? On that note although this could easily be classified as horror, I would also class it under suspense and claustrophobic dark thriller.The direction is uniformly effective, but the insatiable darkness and occasional fast action do tend to make certain parts a bit confusing. It's a small price to pay for what is overall a very useful technique in terms of film making - although it should be added that it's quite unique as deployed here.Overall, this is a good film and worth your attention. It's certainly one of the better horror films I've seen for sure. The ending clinched it for me for sure.(Private message for IMDb - this review is being re-submitted under my proper id.

"This is a headline, and The Descent is an amazing movie","This is an incredible example of horror done right. The movie takes its time in the setup, yet still keeps you engaged. The Descent is not another crass film of two-dimensional oafs, but of well-crafted characters in a descent to the pit of despair.Cannot recommend this movie enough to people that enjoy dark (both meanings) horror movies. Give this a watch and it will pull you into their world. This should be watched in a dark room at night",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Richly Textured Psychological Horror/Thriller,"The reason to watch ""The Descent"" is that it is a well-crafted, richly textured, tense, arm-chair squeezing, and gratifying film that is probably not quite like anything you have seen before. You will experience a descent, in more ways than one.Its pace will not satisfy everyone. Just like the pace of ""No Country For Old Men"" or ""Unforgiven"" will not satisfy everyone. It takes time for the story to develop and the tension and horror to build. But, believe me, there is tension and horror.Part of this movie's triumph, is how it effectively it makes use of subtle glances and verbal cues that potently, yet subtly blend friction and even hostility into the movie.The score is mesmerizing as well, with deep swells that touch the inner parts of the being. As years have past, I have found the score to be one of the most compelling parts of the movie. It is satisfying and seems perfectly matched to the film.I have found that, like most good movies, ""The Descent"" has earned more of my admiration through the years. I enjoyed the movie ""Alien"" when it first came out, but I've only recently begun to appreciate just how good it is. ""The Descent"" has similarly earned my respect through the course of time. It's not as good as ""Alien"", but it certainly leaves a resounding impact on your emotions, such that upon finishing the movie, you feel overwhelmed, gratified, and realizing ... ""Wow, I just saw something really significant.""I don't know another horror/thriller that will leave you feeling quite like you will at the end of ""The Descent"".",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Best Horror Films of the Past 20 Years,"It'd been awhile since I'd seen this, but it's just as intense, suspenseful, and terrifying as the first time I saw it and that's no easy feat for a horror film. With most horror films, it's usually one and done, but this one still has tremendous power even during rewatches. I love the friendships between the women and the claustrophobic setting in the underground caves and that big scare where we first see what the women are up against is still brilliant enough to make you leap out of your seat.Be sure to watch the original version with the complete ending for the full impact.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Good movie, but copies an old radio show script","I enjoyed The Descent. But lets give credit where credit is due. The movie lifts/copies/is influenced (however you'd like to term it) an old radio drama episode written way back in 1951. Don't believe me? Check out the radio show Mysterious Traveler and listen to the episode ""Behind the Locked Door.""Now, as a classic radio show hobbyist, I can honestly tell you that several big time movies have copied radio shows in made in the past (The movie ""Arrival"" is a copy of an old radio show I listened to the other day), I don't necessary mind that. But the filmmakers should at least acknowledge the writers who first came up with the concepts.Enjoy The Descent for what it is, just keep in mind it's heavily influenced by something much older.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Thrilling,"This movie was surprisingly nice. Almost right from the very beginning it captivates you and keeps a firm grip on you, and doesn't let go before the movie is over.The cast is excellent and all do a good job at bringing their characters to life.What really made this movie interesting for me was the surroundings and the scenery. That was amazing, and it really added a lot to the sense of thrill and being helpless. This is one of those movies that you just have to see to know what I am talking about.As for the subterranean humanoid creatures, well... Nothing bad to be said about these. They were terrifying, deadly and very interesting. Their role in this movie was creepy and there was always a sense of dread and fear in the movie, and the way these creatures moved, looked, and behaved heightened the experience immensely.Don't do like I did and base your first impression on the DVD cover alone, because you are missing out on a great movie if you let this one slip you by. At first, based on the DVD cover alone, I thought this could only be another mass-produced mediocre scare flick with no substance and no quality. But I was wrong, dead wrong! This is one of the more intense and thrilling movies I have seen in this category.So immerse yourself into the depths and let the darkness swallow you up, this is one thrill ride you should not miss...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not scary, not gory and, worst of all, not well acted or written.","Neil Marshall's feature debut as writer and director, the generally excellent Dog Soldiers, was burdened with one flaw. In a movie about men, with some fantastic 'bloke' dialogue, Marshall proved himself to have a tin ear for female dialogue. The talented Emma Cleasby was burdened down with some awful lines that sounded like rejects from Rachel Weitz' part in The Mummy. They might have worked in that campy environment - in the grimmer Dog Soldiers, they were just clumsy.The Descent is that, multiplied by six female leads, none of them as talented as Cleasby.Marshall's sophomore outing is just that - juvenile, priapic and gormless. Sticking half a dozen women down a cave (try to work out which country it's set in and what nationality the disposable 'heroines' are supposed to come from - I dare you) he leaves them to get consumed by albino cave dwellers. Dependent upon lapses in narrative logic that will annoy the halfway competent film watcher and indulging in failures in basic caving protocol that make it completely implausible that the cast could find their way out of a land rover, it's more Elle than Fangoria. Everything is set up for these smug Prada-by-way-of-DMM yuppettes to get slaughtered, and then they descend into asinine bickering. You'll be praying for their deaths... and possibly your own, if it brings this fearsome drivel in to land quicker.It is ironic that several noted movie gossip sites that constantly criticize M. Night Shyamalan for the use of twist endings are lauding The Descent, when it has possibly the worst and clumsiest 'shock' reveal of the last decade. This is a new low in cinema because it shows that the once-critical audiences have now accepted pablum as worthwhile. Once upon a time, the benchmark trapped-in-the-wilderness movies were films like 2,000 Maniacs, The Hills Have Eyes, Cannibal Ferox and Deliverance. If this is getting good word, we need to reconsider the medium.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Descend to the depths of quality horror,"After a half-year of horror films that play into every clich√© imaginable, the movie-going public searches for a quality horror movie. The Descent, released to rave reviews in the U. K. last year, attempts to be no more than what it is ¬ñ a simple horror movie with a simple theme: six girls enter a cave; trouble ensues. While it recognizes its simplicity, The Descent offers more than most of the big-budget films of recent memory. It stands out amidst the remakes and goes back to the roots of horror ¬ñ tension and fear. Shauna MacDonald plays Sarah, a woman who is haunted by a horrible accident and decides to break from her depression by going spelunking with the girls with whom she used to adventure. In this group there's the lead daredevil, Juno (Natalie Mendoza) and her new prot√©g√©, Holly (Nora-Jane No one), Sarah's close and loyal friend, Beth (Alex Reid), and the newbies ¬ñ sisters Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) and Sam (MyAnna Buring). Following Juno, the girls explore a cave system in the Appalachian Mountains and everything goes wrong. There is a reasonable amount of buildup that some viewers may find dull, but it keeps the movie from being full of gratuitous gore and worthless attempts at scares. The cave monsters that arise and attack are quick and frightening, with a familiarity that brings memories of the creatures in House on Haunted Hill (1999). For a simple film reliant on many jump scares and some physical gore, there are still some complexities. The relationships and feelings among the girls only add to the viewers' enjoyment and the caves themselves force the viewers to empathize with the characters' feelings of claustrophobia, paranoia, and panic. The Descent was advertised as coming from the production company that brought us Saw and Hostel, and Lions Gate is definitely making its mark in the genre. The Descent fits nicely into the category and should not be missed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great cave diving horror,"This films has such a great mix of disturbing horror, gore and claustrophobia inducing closed in caves that there is something for everyone's taste but not for everyone.

The woman go off to dosome cave diving deep in the Appalachians. Beth, Sam, Rebecca and holly complete the crew but Sarah seems more than determined really to go. After a little exploration they plan on exciting the cave through another entrance shown on a cave painting. But little do the unlucky explorers realize the creatures that inhabit the place. The crawlers look like a mixture of something from the strain and a wendigo and I loved their design. The cast all did well and their characters were interesting enough that I felt for each of them. The ending however is unfair but really adds a punch to the whole film. Overall the descent is one of the best cave horror movies ever made.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A definite improvement compared to directors previous work. Could have been even scarier, but I'm glad it wasn't.","Sounds kind of familiar: a group of cave explorers goes on a cave trip in which they find out that they are the first people to ever walk through it. Then comes the line: 'I think I saw something' and we are off to a suspenseful, chasing blood fest. The directors previous film had a practically exact same plot, where a group of soldiers was hunted by a pack of hungry were-wolfs. The one thing I really 'hate' about horror films is when they're full of sudden scary scenes. This one is full of them.The film has a really good premise where there's a woman named Sarah that's full of grief for her lost family, especially her daughter. Her tragic loss resonates through her life and pushes her in extremely horrifying resurrections of that fatal event. This is the scariest part of the film. Now the director isn't really good in making the beasts in his films that scary. This time he merely succeeds in making it so, though it doesn't come close to the psy-terror of Sarah's odd syndromes.This time the boys are girls and they act like super-girls which is kind of a let down and looks like another Alien series recycle. I thought the film's plot would spin around Sarah's fears and make the rest of the team get swallowed in an endless series of devastating hallucinations. That would have been too much for my achy heart that doesn't handle horror all that good. So I'm glad that the creators choose a more empirical enemy. For horror fans: highly recommended........ - 4/5 .......",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror movies aren't what they used to be.,"This movie was only slightly better then ""the cave"" and by slightly, the gore was alright at times. But I do not remember much of it due to hysterical laughter at how terrible the movie is. Horror movies relying solely on loud noises and things jumping out to get a jump out of the crowd is not a movie worthy of the praise you guys give it.To start off with where they went wrong, the lighting team was terrible. If your in a cave, 2 miles under the earth, no light will shine on things. This includes some of the demons, random parts of the cave, and when stuff jumps out or is supposed to be scary.Next, nothing made sense, they go from one scene climbing something, and then the area changes completely. Water ceases to exist when you climb up a waterfall, ya know? The cheap scares throughout the movie where way overused, it seems as if they wanted to scare some random 10 year olds and make them scream.. all it did for the entire theater was cause laughter. Even until the very end, they use them.No real plausible plot or storyline is present within the movie.Plus, when you get a pick through the spinal cord, and voice box, you pretty much die instantly. However, this movie obviously doesn't believe in that and tries to make up for it with a cheap scare, and a storyline that would and should have never existed.I luckily had free passes, because I would have demanded my money back, and sued the producer for wasting 2 hours of my time, at 68$ an hour.Worst movie of the year.. most likely, will the general public love it, of course. Much like how many of the terrible movies now get acclaim from the awards. This wont be one of them, I hope.Good day. Time to see some real horror with Last House on the Left, 72' when the horror was real, not jumpy garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A tad overrated, but still a great movie","""The Descent"" is a slightly overrated if still enjoyable creature feature.**SPOILERS**After a terrible accident, friends Sarah, (Shauna Macdonald) Juno, (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) Beth, (Alex Reid) Rebecca, (Saskia Mulder) and Sam, (MyAnna Buring) decide to meet together to forget about the incident. When their friend Holly, (Nora-June No one) shows up, it's decided to turn it into a spelunking trip once they find a nice cave nearby. As they descend into the cave deeper, they suddenly learn that they've been tricked and are heading into a newly opened cave that has never been explored before. Stuck inside when a cave-in strands them inside, they try to find a new way out and are instead stuck in the dimly-lit tunnels with different fears about the situation putting them on the edge of their sanity. During their quest, they realize that they're stuck with a race of cannibalistic dwellers who figure them intruders and voraciously attack them, making them even more desperate to get out of the caves.The Good News: This one here wasn't that bad at all and had some good points to it. The fact that this one has most of it's time inside a series of caves which are on their own incredibly creepy, well-designed and perfectly capable of making up the required set-pieces in the film. These scenes are absolutely flawless, being appropriately dark and untraveled enough to appear that it manages to get some incredible tension out of these scenes. All of the cave-diving and exploration scenes are just perfection, as the lighting is just perfect to get that darkened, underground look and the design of the caves themselves are just excellent. They look incredibly realistic and original, giving them some very impression locations that are molded well with the action presented to give it something to be grateful of. The attacks here are great, as the creatures aren't that imposing but get their threatening nature from how their attacks are coordinated, simply rushing in and slashing and then using lightning speed to retreat or prepare for the next wave if detoured away. Their initial attack is a thing of beauty, making it due to the darkness of the time, the spectacular location it chooses and the voracity of what they're doing. That leads into another big area, their really brutal and gory encounters. There's a lot of flesh-ripping and tearing, some amputations, bites to most areas of the body as well as a brutal spike pierced through the neck. There's also the damage done to the creatures, which makes it pretty brutal and graphic when it wants to be. The last thing it gets right is a superb sequence at the end where the characters are forced to proceed in total darkness using the video screen from a camera to find a way out of danger, and this is played up magnificently and is one of the most original and creative scenes in the film genre. It's a high point in the film, which is part of all these that it gets right.The Bad News: This one here has surprisingly more flaws than expected. The main one here is the terribly slow-going opening to this one. It takes a really long time in the beginning to get going on the cave-diving due to a really long sequence where they're sitting around doing nothing for what seems like minutes on end with nothing to do for the entire duration. It's a seemingly endless parade of banter that really only seems funny to them is at times painful to sit through just hearing them go off on rants about whatever and hearing them all laugh at it when it's really not. It continues on for so much of the beginning of the film that it goes for what seems like forever and it makes for a period of time where there's nothing of interest in the scene. At times, the darkness in the cave is something to get over, since at times it works but others it's completely annoying and hurtful towards the film. That, coupled with the jump-cutting during the scenes makes them somewhat flawed. The other main flaw here is that the creatures look absolutely terrible. They look exactly like a small person covered in white skin and given fangs, which are absolutely the opposite of what fear-inducing creatures should be. It's quite hard to take them as serious threats when they don't look imposing at all, and are a really terrible design that won't get much attention. Otherwise, this one here is a really entertaining film.The Final Verdict: A little slow-going at the beginning is more than made-up for with a fun and exciting second-half, making this one really watchable. Give it a shot if interested in the subject matter, have a preference for these kinds of films or are in the mood for a classy creature-feature, otherwise heed caution with it.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is the best horror film in 2024,You might ask why 2024? It's 2024 and so far recent horror films are so predictable and so much cgi that it's not even scarry anymore. So I had to search for older movies that doesn't use cgi and jump scares when you least expect it. The Descent is both scary and entertaining. If you traditional jumpscares which is executed perfectly then this is the movie for you. I so wish we can go back to these types of horror films. No dumb characters and no dumb plots. There is The Descent 2 and based on the review it not good so I didn't decide to watch it. I liked my theory of the ending rather than the part 2.

One of the Best Horror Films of the Past Decade That Will Make You Never Want To Go in a Cave Again,"The horror film The Descent is written and directed by Neil Marshall and stars Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Jackson Mendoza, and Alex Reid. The film takes place in modern day and mostly in a cavern.Sarah's (Macdonald) husband and daughter died tragically in a car accident on the way home from a river kayaking trip with some other friends. A year later when Sarah is more stable her group of friends decide to go on an adventure like they used to so she could feel better and pretend things are back to normal. The group decides to go on a caving decision and Juno (Mendoza) does not tell anyone that the cave that they are going to had never been explored. Juno did this so that they can name the cave after Sarah. While exploring the cave it begins to fall in and the group becomes trapped inside. If that isn't scary enough they are being tracked by murderous monsters...Neil Marshall's screenplay is solid even though I have a few problems with it. What makes most horror movies great is the characterization in them. In this though all the characters are one dimensional, even Sarah. All I really know about Sarah is that her family was killed in a car accident and that makes her sad. But that is more than I know about the other characters. I did like though the idea of being isolated in a cave, that can be a horror movie on its own. But to be followed by monsters who try to kill you? That is just another layer of horror. The end of this film is brilliant as well and Neil Marshall should be proud of writing one of the best horror films of the past decade. Make sure if you watch this you watch the original uncut version though not the American one.The direction of this film by Neil Marshall was perfect for a horror film as well. Those shots in the cave where Holly was squeezing through the walls were just perfect to let the viewer know just how isolated they were. Marshall I guess got good performances out of his actors even though I never really knew them. The scares in the film were all basically jump scares nothing to keep you unable to sleep that night, even though there is a lot of psychological things you could be scared of during this film.The acting in this film was mediocre, nothing to write home about. It wasn't really that any of the actors gave bad performances it was just that there was not enough character for them to act off of. No one was by any means bad and everyone was believable when they were scared it was just no sense of character, so I cannot really judge it.Overall I give this film a 7/10 because it is a very effective horror film. If there was thirty minutes of the girls all in the cabin talking so the audience could get more of a sense of who they are I would probably have given this an 8/10. But my major complaint with this film is the lack of characterization so that is why I give it what I give it. If you like horror films you should definitely see this, especially ones when people are trapped in dark places with monsters lurching around all over the place.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lots of fun,"There are three types of horror. There's smart horror. There's fun horror. And then there's just bad horror. The Descent falls into the fun horror category. It's the story of a group of women who go spelunking in a cave in Chatanooga. They are supposed to be going a very well known cave of the area but the group leader, Juno, leads them to a completely different cave for fear that the other cave will be a tourist trap. In this new unnamed cave things begin to go horribly wrong. First they get trapped when a tunnel collapses. Then the become prey to a new breed of predator lurking in the cave. From here a disgusting yet exciting gorefest ensues as the girls try to escape from this underground nightmare.The Descent hones in on our fears of darkness, claustrophobia, and the unknown, then throws in flesh eating monsters just to spice it up. The Descent builds a lot of suspense for the first half of the film in some great scenes of quiet focused tension. Then it really switches gears in the last half when the monsters are introduced and they start picking people off. There isn't anything inherently wrong with this and honestly the last half of the movie is awesome. It is so graphic and so chaotic that you can't help but be entertained. The first half of the film keeps you enthralled with suspense while the second half keeps it up with grotesque thrill after thrill.You could say that the structure of this film is actually quite intelligent and works as a really impressive feat of horror. The entire first half is spent building suspense with no mention of monsters and very slight and very subtle hints that there is something else in the cave with these girls. The first half is quiet and tense, only to explode in the second half when the monsters are introduced. The same can be said for the camera-work. The direction of the first half of the film is excellent. The way all of the tight crawlspaces and bottomless pits are shot is incredible. You really feel like you are trapped with these girls and it honestly does bother you. Then the monsters are introduced and the direction changes its focus to pure action thriller. This really makes the film intense and exciting and the only problem is that there are many times where you can't really tell what is going on. The camera cuts and shakes too fast and the setting is too dark at times. This might be in order to cover up bad effects or poor makeup, but it really didn't bother me nearly as much as it does in other films.The Descent is undeniably missing some things like well developed characters and a sharp script. The script isn't terrible but I can safely say that dialouge is not where the film shines. There are plenty of lines that could have been worked out better and some that should have been left out entirely. It's like when a character throws a rock down a dark pit to see how far down it is. We all know why she did this but as soon as the rock hits the bottom another character says to her, ""Thanks. Now I know how deep it is."" It's little things like this that get in the way of the suspense being built here, but only temporarily. You can get around them pretty easily.And then there's the second half of the film where you can just see the perverse giddiness of the writers coming through. They have so much fun with the gory action of this film. I can literally see them coming up with this at the table with somebody saying, ""So she's running from a bunch of monsters and their all screaming at her. Then she falls into a pool of water and there's a monster in there too!"" Or, ""So she's crossing a pit and just as she reaches the other side there's a monster hanging from the ceiling and she stabs it in the head just as it slits her throat!"" I also imagine the phrase ""blood sprays here"" was tossed around quite a bit.But I digress. The Descent is an awesome film that manges to be suspenseful, scary, and a lot of fun. It's not for the squeamish or faint of heart, and especially not for those with claustrophobia, but luckily I am none of those three. Well, I take that back. After watching this film I honestly think I might be a little bit claustrophobic as there were some scenes in here where I almost had to sit up just to bring myself back into reality. Few films bother me like this, so kudos to The Descent for really freaking me out. This movie isn't much more than an fun gorefest, but it accomplishes what it sets out to do. Plus there are some great visuals the whole way through and the film actually scares you. I can easily and faithfully recommend this film to horror fans everywhere.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Neil Marshall's flawed opus,"I remember this movie quite well; partially, i remember it because myself and 2 others dropped ecstasy before going into the cinema (sidenote: unless you want to laugh your tits off watching an otherwise scary movie, i don't recommend that course of action. It's fun, but the rest of the audience will hate you).The preliminary setup to the horrifying predicament that the characters find themselves in is formulaic. It's one of those setups that frustrates the audience with face-palm moments and sets up one of the ensemble as the unlikable outsider. It introduces the central character with an event that should be horrific in itself (albeit, as i was off my face, it was slightly startling, transitioning to comical:'that'll teach her to distract the driver!' said one of my friends). The human failure that leads to the horror will feel instantly familiar to anyone who has ever watched more than one standard horror film or read more than one horror novel. It isn't ineffective, it's just one of those moments that makes you think: 'oh, here we go...'For me the problem was that the entire cast (coincidentally all female) ranged from indifferent to grating. You're clearly supposed to care about the consequences of the tragic opening sequence, as well as the conflict that results within the group from said tragedy; personally however, i found it relatively uninteresting and uninspired. Even as the horror began to unfold (and it is genuinely horrifying) i never felt truly invested in any of the characters. Clearly, Marshall's intention was to present a strong female character in the same vein as Siguerney Weavers Ellen Ripley, while at the same time exploring a new perspective to his movies by using a female ensemble, after having presented an almost all male ensemble in 'dog soldiers'. His cast in 'the descent' are intended to be shaped in very much the same mould, ergo they are strong, capable and confident until presented with a situation which they are completely unprepared for. The problem with 'dog soldiers' was that the cast were cartoonish stereotypes lifted from a 12 year old's fantasy, who managed, thanks to competent acting, to breathe life into the characters and overcome the insulting clich√© (besides demonstrating absolutely appalling soldiery and breaking nearly every rule in the book); by comparison, the cast of 'the descent' do not look like stereotypes (albeit this could be the result of a lack of female ensemble casts in heroic roles); they seem very credible as can-do adventure athletes and adrenaline-junkies. They come across as relatively well constructed and considered characters and even their obvious character flaws add strength to their believability (something the 'dog soldiers'patently lacked in my opinion). Unfortunately i never found myself emotionally invested in any of them.Marshall is genuinely capable of generating an effective, primal sense of horror, primarily through his use of the environment; this is possibly the best example of his skill. From almost the outset, darkness and claustrophobia produce a palpable sense of tension and dread that imposes on the audience even before the interaction with the actual horror element. Personally, i found the monstrosities of 'the descent' far more ominous than those of 'dog soldiers'. I mean, there is only so much believability to bipedal canines; evolved troglodytes however seem so much more disturbing conceptually, if only because they are unfamiliar to us and seem just a tiny bit more plausible. Crucially, the sense of horror is magnified by the sense of futility and inescapable doom, something that the situational environment enhances very well in this case. A good comparison is 'the cave', a Hollywood film with a much larger budget and better known cast, and which was released the same year. That film squandered what genuine opportunities it had generate authentic tension and horror and wasted its considerable resources to create an epic borefest. It was an example of essentially the same idea executed with 'all the gear, and no idea'.Marshall is a self-confessed cinema geek, and this movie illustrates that trait better than possibly any of his portfolio before or since. The film presents a series of subtle references to other movies which, amazingly, work well both to stimulate the observant and relieve the tension. The references are subtle and well executed, and add a level of charm to the film as a whole. They are also largely unexpected in this sort of film, and although fan-service is much more standardised in mainstream cinema as of this point in time, it feels quite original when remembering that this film was released in '05.The climax to this film is something i feel ambivalent about, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I personally don't ascribe the presumption of a dutiful, crowd-pleasing conclusion to a horror film, although some execute it better than others. Gut-punch endings in horror films can be both effective and satisfying (those who have seen darabonts 'the mist' know what i am talking about). This movie doesn't really come down in either camp. The ending feels inconclusive, which is possibly intentional; however, it doesn't entirely feel satisfying either. This is slightly galling because it seems to lead towards a conclusive closure and then leaves you with what feels like a strange species of cliff-hanger. Not quite the gut-punch, but not quite the rose garden either.This movie is genuinely horrifying in a way that few are. It is telling to me that neil Marshall has floundered in trying to replicate the effectiveness of this film in his later outtings. It is not perfect, but as a pure horror film it is possibly the closest that Marshall will ever come and a lot closer than many better known director have ever or will ever come.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Nice, but not too scary","Good movie. The atmosphere is well created from the beginning. I hate Sarah, why did she do that to Juno? It is not because of Beth, but for the brand from Sarah's husband. Even this may prove something between Sarah's husband and Juno. So what? She should broke Juno's leg on purpose? The fact is, it seems Juno and Sarah's husband had affairs. However, from Sarah's point of view, she should at least check with Juno first, what if Juno and Sarah's husband were together before Sarah's marriage? Anyway, there is no reason Sarah should do this. If they help each other, they may have some chance to get out. The only possible reason is Sarah was so scary that she lost her mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The only horror movie that actually got me.,"No Spoilers- I've watched just about every horror movie out there since Dawn of the Dead & Nightmare on Elm Street. I love zombies, monsters, slashers, ghosts- everything. This movie is the only one that actually got me to jump. It's the build up. The characters are sympathetic, but not annoying, and when you think you know where the plot's taking you - you're wrong. There's a generous body count and the ending provides an opportunity for multiple interpretations and a chance for discussion. That's the best type of movie in my opinion- one that lingers and makes you want to talk about it later. I've seen this one 3-4 times and that's probably the best endorsement I can give.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Into the Darkness,"The Descent, directed by Neil Marshall, is an intense, claustrophobic horror film that pushes both physical and psychological boundaries. The story follows six women who embark on a caving expedition that quickly spirals into a nightmare when they become trapped underground and discover they are not alone. With its raw atmosphere, unrelenting suspense, and deep exploration of fear, The Descent is a masterclass in modern horror, combining visceral scares with emotional depth to create an unforgettable experience.The cast, led by Shauna Macdonald as Sarah, delivers powerful performances that ground the film in authenticity. Macdonald captures Sarah's journey from grief to survival, making her a compelling and sympathetic protagonist. The ensemble cast brings realistic dynamics to the group, with each character's unique personality adding tension and complexity to the unfolding horror. The raw, believable portrayals make the group's terror feel real, heightening the stakes as they are forced to confront not only the external threat but also their own interpersonal conflicts.Marshall's direction is impeccable, using the confined, pitch-black cave setting to create an atmosphere of inescapable dread. The cinematography captures every shadow, tight space, and twisted tunnel with precision, intensifying the feeling of entrapment. The sound design is hauntingly effective, amplifying the subtle sounds of dripping water, echoes, and distant cries, which elevate the tension to unbearable levels. When the horror shifts from psychological to physical with the introduction of the cave-dwelling creatures, the scares become relentless and brutally effective.What sets The Descent apart is its exploration of psychological themes-grief, trauma, and the primal instinct for survival. The cave becomes a metaphor for Sarah's internal struggle, and as the group descends deeper, so does the tension, transforming the film into a journey through the darkest parts of the mind. Marshall expertly balances horror with emotional resonance, making The Descent more than just a monster movie but a deeply affecting experience that resonates long after it ends.In conclusion, The Descent is a high point in modern horror. Its combination of intense scares, psychological depth, and masterful direction makes it a relentless, terrifying exploration of both physical and emotional survival. For fans of horror, it is essential viewing, a film that immerses viewers in primal fear and doesn't let go.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Descent,"Ostensibly, ""The Descent"" is a fairly formulaic horror film where the entire cast gets slaughtered one-by-one by a group of killers. The visions and premonitions of protagonist Sarah are basic horror fodder as well, though they provide us with a brilliant ending-sequence where the vision of her daughter and the reality of her being trapped in the cave mesh in a stylish way. Nevertheless, this standard horror film works well because of the twisted psychological framework that exists in the background.By descending into the cave, symbolically the group of heroines descends into the subconscious, to find mankind's menacing prehistory lingering in the shadows. As the group of primitive cavemen attacks them, the facade of civilization and friendship dissolves, and symbolically these two conditions (conscious and subconscious, prehistory and present) mesh and interweave, to the point where the killer creatures are distorted mirror-images of the main cast.There's plenty of garish horror and gore, but director Neil Marshall has a few visual aces up his sleeve with the threatening night-vision shots (acting as glimpses into the subconscious) amidst piles of bones and with the creatures lurking in the background.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could have been brilliant,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked like the most terrifying movie I would ever see...but I also thought that it would be more of a psychological thriller than it was. I know that I am selective when it comes to horror films. I'm not into pure blood and gore, and I don't like zombie movies. This movie has elements of both which I find disappointing. The movie has a premise which is terrifying in and of itself--a group of friends trapped in a cave. Why bother with the creatures? The most frightening parts of the movie occurred in the first half, with the single most terrifying being the scene in which one woman gets stuck crawling through the tunnel. I had to remind myself to breathe during that scene. After the intense claustrophobia scene, the standard gory creature-flick feel of the rest is a letdown.I will give credit where credit is due, however, and this is why I have decided to bump the rating up to a 7. The characters of the movie are more well-developed than I am used to seeing in most American-made horror flicks. The subplots are subtle; no wasted time or energy, nor insults to the audience's intelligence with overly-dramatic scenes that pose as character development. The evolution of the character of ""Sarah"" is intriguing, and the end of the movie was both shocking and intelligent (for all my ""fellow American"" fans, I am referring to the original director's cut, not the American release).I am sure that many horror fans will enjoy this movie immensely. I, however, was hoping for something more. It could have been the scariest movie I'd ever seen if the creatures had just been left out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Scenic in fear, can do without the crawlers","If you are looking into immersing yourself in darkness, tight spaces, caves, heights, and horrific monsters, this is the film for you. The set design and cinematography are nearly flawless in creating the underground caves. Creating a labyrinth of horror seemingly endless with very little light casted. As much as I enjoy the concept of monsters in the horror genre and think that this would make a perfect film to video game adaptation, the film would have been much more terrifying if it didn't include the crawlers. The elements of claustrophobia, darkness, human stupidity, and desperation are enough to make ""The Descent"" a pinnacle film for survival horror.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Movie review:The descent,"The Descent starts off with a group of gal-pals going rafting.After that,a tragic accident occurs that leaves one girl's husband and child killed.Later,the girls meet up again,this time with new friends to go caving.This time,their expedition is going to be much more horrifying than ever...The descent starts off as a standard thriller as we see the accident,and get to know the girls a little better in the first half.The caving scenes are well-shot.They tend to be boring at first and you keep hoping something exciting would happen. And it does happen indeed! The second half goes on to be a horrifying journey as the girls find out that they are not the only ones in the cave...Scary and exciting,the second half makes you squirm as the girls run and scream and try to live...Overall the descent starts off rather boring and unexciting but its the second half where the descent shines where the girls have a horrifying encounter.Worth a watch,especially for horror fans!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Worth Watching!,"If you're like me, you've been screwed over by so many horror films that you don't know which way is up anymore.
They all just suck and fall flat compared to what we want them to be. But this movie--this film, this vision-- absolutely rocked.I loved the beats of the film--how every circumstance put them more and more in danger, and in some cases at odds with each other. It progressed so well. The tension, for me, successfully mounted.I did not love every element of this film. For my own personal taste there were too many false scares. If you've seen horror movies you know that the fakeout scare, in the first act especially, is extraordinarily prevalent throughout the genre. There had to be 3-5 of them in this movie. Maybe 1-2 too many. . .As cheap as I believe the fakeout scare tends to be within this category of film, it does lend itself well to a fitting ending (no spoilers) and you would still be well served to check out this flick.See this movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thrill seekers be advised...,"The Descent is written and directed by Neil Marshall. It stars Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, MyAnna Buring and Nora Jane No one. Music is by David Julyan and cinematography by Sam McCurdy.A group of adventurous ladies are always up for the challenges of nature, be it water rafting, climbing or cave exploring. When they go potholing in some out of the way Appalachian venue, they find a little more than they bargained for. In fact it's looking unlikely that any of them will survive the trip...Neil Marshall first came to horror fan's attention with the bloody and hugely funny Dog Soldiers in 2002, here his follow up forgoes humour in favour of an assault on the viewers senses. Chiefly what Marshall has done is craft a picture that plays on the basic fears of your average human being, the dark, confined spaces, and yes, things that literally do go bump in the night, all nicely bundled up in the most appropriate of subterranean settings. But to purely label The Descent as a shallow popcorn horror piece would be a gross case of misdirection, for Marshall has given the characters a back story to work from, we as the viewers get introductions to these game and able ladies, interesting character dynamics serving for preparation, so when they get down in the dark, we are with them too.Marshall knows his horror onions, he knows what works and he know what doesn't, after grabbing our attention quite early in the piece, he serenely goes about knitting the strands together to fully form his movie, he then of course knows that once we are in the caves, reality is the key, and here's Marshall's masterstroke. His use of lighting is first class, there is no light down there, we have to rely on Miners Helmet lamps, glow sticks, flares and even the video-cam viewfinder. Contrast the lighting work of that with The Cave that was released the same year, The Cave is lit up like Narnia on a snowy morning for crying out loud! Marshall is also well served by his sound department, trickles of water blending in with the sound of bodies scraping against rock, and of course something, somewhere, shuffling in the darkThe Descent ranks up with the very best of British horror movies, its build up and execution is first rate, and it pulls a neat trick of having an all female cast, of which Alex Reid and Shauna Macdonald are particularly impressive, the latter of which producing one of the best shows of grief shown by a British actress in many a blood red moon. American audiences have proved to be indifferent to it, though they have not been helped by having a different (weaker) ending to the excellently thought provoking one that Britain got. But a couple of nice homages aside (the score for example is a direct lift from Carpenter's The Thing), that are Marshall's want, The Descent is as fresh as a daisy; that is if your daisies are cloaked in terror! A brilliant horror picture, the most significant British horror film since The Wicker Man. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Leader of the Splat Pack,"Neil Marshall is perhaps not as prolific as fellow members of the so-called ""Splat Pack,"" (Alexandre Aja, Darren Lynn Bousman, Greg McLean, Eli Roth, James Wan, Leigh Whannell & Rob Zombie) but in my opinion, his two full-length films (""Dog Soldiers"" & ""The Descent"") have already put him at the top of that list. Marshall treats the genre with more maturity, I think, than most of the above directors, and his strong background in drama pays off. While I understand this genre is not big in character development, Marshall brings just enough to add dramatic tension between the characters and make us care about their fates (as with Sarah & Juno in this film).The special effects are excellent, the splatter is not crazily over the top, and the editing is smooth. It also looks like Marshall did some serious research in spelunking for this film, and cinematographer Sam McCurdy did an awesome job with the low lighting in the caves and conveying a sense of claustrophobia. I wish I could comment more about how he handles the subject, but I can't do it without spoilers.This is the first film of this genre (including ""Saw 2,"" ""Hostel,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" ""The Devil's Rejects"" and others by fellow Splat Packers) that I have given a rating above 7 (7.2).Without giving away too much, there are Cherokee legends and other Native American stories that do support the concept in this film...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Provides scares....but thats it ***SPOILERS***,"Let me start off by saying if you wish to go to a movie to be scared then go and see this movie because there at at least 10 scenes that will make you jump. If your looking for a detailed plot or developed characters this movie will disappoint. The plot never really explains itself and somehow it gives us ****SPOILERS**** evolved humans that cannot see, or throughout movies, Smell as you will notice by the fact they stand all over the people in the cave and cant detect anything. They can only hear the people, yet at numerous parts throughout the movie a character will be standing perfectly still and wont make a sound yet the monsters can see them? I thought they were blind? The characters are poorly developed and the actors that play them are even worse. The only decent actor in this movie was the mom, all the others were annoying and some of them just plain stupid. This movie delivers on the scares, but how its at 83% at rotten tomatoes is beyond me seeing as the movie itself was terrible. I do admit many so called horror movies of today lack the scares, e.g. Saw, but id rather see Saw 20 times than see this again.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It may be new, but it's one of the finest horror films ever.","A fast, jolting setup.. character introductions & conversations that felt quite natural.. fantastically well-done caving.. nasty monsters and nasty things happening.. and a brilliant ending.You need anything else? How about six good unknown actresses who feel like individual characters without any one being over the top. How about some devilishly good scares underground, with camera pans and lighting reveals that DON'T just turn out to be a cat or a loud noise. How about great gore without noticeable CGI. How about feral monsters that are just plain scary (not indestructible or supernatural, but like a very scary wild animal). How about really effective tension generated through the danger and claustrophobia of caving, before we even get to the nastiness.Sure, we know who's going to be left at the end of the film from about 90 seconds into the film (because of the characters), but it's not a problem - and the ending still delivers in spades. There's only one moment where I had to laugh at something that was 'over-the-top'. Script-wise I don't recall a single line out place, and not one ""come and get me, MF"" or ""We're gonna need a bigger boat"" sort of clich√©.Although its no-nonsense British charm means that it does stand apart from classics like ""TCM"" or ""The Thing"", it IS up to the same quality, and is undoubtedly one of the finest horror films ever.

Female Action Descents Into Malehood,"5 August 2006. Warning: Spoilers. A nice idea, but one that descends into something indistinguishable from other horror/action/thrillers. What begins uneven with a oddly, unnatural hospital scene where bystanders seemingly ignore this poor woman in agony, continues with a new idea of having sex somewhat strong female personalities with some abilities at typical male sports - rafting and cave exploration, and introduce a somewhat different dark, cavernous action thriller, with somewhat monster-type things thrown in. We have the typical stereotypical characters - the young brash funky kid, the macho-adventure seeker, the more humble hurt female, and the rest of the women bound for possible slaughter. There is an eerie resemblance with Silence of the Lambs with one of our strong woman running through the woods towards the beginning of the film. There is the Alien scene of water dripping and the face pointed upwards. There is a fascinating contrast to classic The Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959) with the underground, claustrophobic shots done with excellent effect in both movies. There is even the Alien scene in the director's cut with Dallas wanting to die at the end of the movie. Finally there are similarities to The Blair Witch Project (1999) with camera, photographic technique in places.Unfortunately for this movie, the intelligent, qualitatively superior female potential of this movie descending to the typical (unfortnately perhaps realistic) scene reminiscent from Aliens when the soldiers get trapped underground and almost seemingly go from crack soldier to blind idiots. Unlike the classic Alien and Ripley, the heroine, who is able to project both strength but presence of mind and humanity, this movie entertains the typical descent into hell and The Predator - the kill or be killed mentality - no questions asked. The movie tries, with good intention, but ends up somewhat manipulative, somewhat artificial.This is a watchable, but not more scary movie than any other. What is has going for it is its new, fresh, taking an old idea and making it better. Except, for example, the worn out ending shot. Six out of Ten Stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mediocre at best.,"This movie was hyped up to be one of the best horror films of this decade. I'm sorry but I have to disagree with this thought. The suspense was there, I will say that. This movie made me jump on a few occasions. But the plot was, to say the least, very typical. First off, I don't know about you, but it seemed as if the group of girls were being hunted by a pack of Golems. While it seemed intense at times, it became very predictable later in the movie. Move close to the camera...show an open space behind you...and BAM there is another Golem ready to pounce on the unexpectant victim. It became very reduntant. Cookie cutter if you will. Another bad point about the movie, well, I had no remorse for those who were killed. I mean, there was no character development whatsoever, other than the woman losing her daughter. I had little remorse for those that died. And lastly, was the typical ""I don't need this item so I'll leave it behind"" line. Cmon, I don't care how egotistic you are, you don't leave behind a cave map. That is just sheer stupidity. Now, for the positives, I would say the cinematography was pretty good, and the sound was excellent. But these elements could not make up for a movie, what I thought, was a typical ""run from the stalker"" type film. The plot was average at best. It could have included more depth, other than a few girls who go out spelunking because they wanna have some fun and end up getting chased by underground Golem's. Sorry about my reference to LOTR but they seemed so similar to Golem. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best Horror Movie of 2006,"I am a huge horror movie fan and what I saw was without question the most original and hard core horror film I have seen in ages besides ""Saw"", ""Hostel"", and ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose."" Neill Marshall wrote and directed a film about six women on a cave diving expedition that descends into the bottom of hell hence the name of the movie ""The Descent."" The film opens with three of the women on a white water rafting trip in the wilderness and the vacation ends in tragedy when Sarah's (Shauna MacDonald) husband and daughter are killed in horrifying car accident leaving her traumatized. One year later, Sarah and her friends, Beth (Alex Reid) and Juno (Natalie Mendoza, who could be the next great female action star) travel to the Appalachian Mountains and embark on a cave diving expedition. They are joined by a three other women: mother and daughter, Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), Sam (MyAnna Buring), and punk adventurer Holly (Nora-Jane No one, see ""The Magdelene Sisters""). As they go further and further down the caverns, they end trapped and lost with company: cannibalistic monsters. They are a few wholes in the movie, but it is immediately forgotten due to the amount of violence and gore and jump out of your seats surprises. Neill Marshall is a genius by sending his audience down into a dark, claustrophobic maze of rock, bones, and blood. You will be without question left speechless by the way he circles around the characters as they desperately attempt to escape.

An above average horror flick,"This is a movie by the same guy,Neil Marshall, that gave us ""Dog Soldiers"",a great werewolf movie.While ""The Descent"" isn't quite as good, the guy without a doubt knows how to make a movie.This movie is an England product and in fact it is a bit bothersome that the best of the modern horror movies seems to come from overseas these days.Maybe the US has enough horror these days without having to make movies,huh? Oh well as long as someone keeps making good horror movies....Anyway six women go into an uncharted cave in Appalachia and soon discover that they are not alone.They find themselves 2 miles underground with their original route no longer accessible.They battle with each other and the cave dwellers to try and find a way to the surface.What would live 2 miles underground in total darkness? It can't be anything good.This movie is well paced and well written and the acting is decent,although at times some of the actresses were emoting a bit too much.The gore is plentiful and the special effects are very well done.This movie will make you jump a few times.And I like that.The only downside to the movie I found was the darkness.Taking place in a cave there was a lot of darkness ,of course, and for me a dark movie has always been hard to follow even on a big screen in a theater.This movie was a bit hard to keep up with at times due to the lack of light,especially some of the fast paced fight scenes.I tweaked the brightness a bit on my TV and that helped some.Also some of the women have a bit of an accent that was hard to follow at times with the cave echo and the screaming.Even with six women there was no skin in this movie but the movie was so well done I didn't miss it much.This is a fairly original movie that will keep your attention throughout.For me a great a movie is one I'll rate an 8 or higher.I gave this a 7 because of the constant battle to see what was happening in the dark setting.While it may not be a great movie it is a cut way above most of the dreck that is called ""horror"" these days.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The movie did have promise with a good idea of being trapped in an unexplored cave, but once again, Hollywood sell outs by slapping in some supernatural nothingness. The movie was sloppy, it substituted ingenuity for squirty blood that looked all too fake.

Going down is  more fun then getting there,"Visceral horror movie delves deep into atmospheric terror as six female adventurers set off on their annual group expedition, this years trip being centered around the lovely cave expedition one member has planned. With a finely implemented pace, The Descent moves along with a stylistic and palpable urgency usually not found in the horror genre, especially in what devolved into a more generic one. What, for at least half the film, felt like an anxious buildup of suspense carried impressively by the claustrophobic design, sadly reared off course into a less gripping scenario of stalker-based antics, followed by your surefire balls-out showdown providing fans with their much needed and satisfactorily delivered gore fix. The atmosphere intensive and psychologically compelling buildup far outweighed the more generic follow through to me, however that is not to say that these later action scenes, though edited beyond some recognition, are not executed with the same artistic integrity shown throughout the impressive shoot. For many of the inevitable generic trappings the nemesis can be compared with, credit must given to Neil Marshall for imagining this particularly arresting set design in order to let his mechanisms convincingly thrive. The all female cast make the journey a little more unique, bringing some interesting, albeit underdeveloped characters with intriguing though undercooked subplots to the table, but it is surely the setting itself that wins the attention of most.. an outstanding horror backdrop, to play out some less outstanding actual horror.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Six women, one cave, plenty of nasty creatures and lots of blood, well why not?","I heard lots of positive comments for this one, so I decided to take a look. Why? Cause I like horror movies. My expectations were low cause it's been a while since I watched a really good horror movie of newer date. So I sat to watch this movie on my computer, all alone, in the dark. ""The Descent"" starts like any other movie and actually in the first 50 minutes (without nasty creatures) we are meeting all the characters involved in this movie. Six women who all love dangerous adventures, like rafting on wild rivers (beginning), climbing on high mountains (that picture) and finally going into caves. So our six ladies decide to go to this cave not knowing what might be in there. They all agreed to go on a trip because of Sarah, who had a terrible road accident a year ago in which she lost her husband and daughter. Sarah needs change and all other characters need adrenaline so the adventure can begin. But Juno, the bravest of them all, decides to lead them into cave that no one went in before.Neil Marshall directed this one after the success of ""Dog Soldiers"" and he's a classic example for the fact that good horrors could be made even if you don't have extravagant budget. What Marshall brings in new in his movie is great way of telling a story. First he starts slowly so he can introduce characters. Accident that happened to Sarah, friendship between Sarah, Juno and Beth and finally preparations for the trip. When they finally come into the cave strange things doesn't start to happen quickly. And then blast. Marshall hits us with that creatures, music, atmosphere and on top of all, with his directing. It is absolutely amazing how Marshall manged to film all that scenes in dark. Most of the movie happens in a cave and there isn't many light but Marshall succeeds on that field and he proves that one European horror can easily beat all those new American crappy horrors (there are few exceptions).Maybe at one point you will find this movie to bloody, that everything that happens to main characters lacks sense but I think that you can either like or dislike this movie. There is no middle. One thing you have to admit: directing was great, atmosphere was fine and gives you plenty of room to think about it. From Juno's accidental killing of one of the characters to the very end when Sarah stays alone in the cave and when she creates the picture of her dead daughter; and of course was Sarah to cruel to Juno. My favorite part was the ending, cause it was simply great to watch Sarah's dream and then the reality.

The best British horror film EVER!,"I literally ached when I left the cinema - I was leaning forward the entire time. It was so incredibly tense - not to mention claustrophobic, and lets not forget TERRIFYING! I have not seen a better British horror movie. Great location - fantastic idea, acted flawlessly and directed perfectly to bleed dry every last shock, scare, moan, and hard-hitting scene from the script. This is cinema that hurts but you're so scared you don't even notice until it's over!If you're looking to be traumatised by a film - try this one out - I really can't implore you enough, although not surprisingly it's not for the squeamish. We have an (almost) decapitation within the first few minutes and it's pretty relentless after that, and we haven't even got into the dark yet. Bloody terrifying! I'm still shaking - I have to see this movie again!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror that gets it right,"The Descent is the best horror film in ages, a horror film that gets it right by going back to basics. Neil Marshall's Dog Soldiers was an assured debut but this is better, a confident and serious approach to the subject. With nods to films such as Alien, Deliverance, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and even The Shining, The Descent delivers on every level.With a slow assured build up after the opening shock moment, as the group of girls venture deep into caves, director Marshall waits for exactly the right moment to deliver a shock moment that is guarantee'd to have you leaping out of your seats! From then on the action never lets up as the plucky females battle for their lives against the hideous and vicious creatures dwelling in the caves. With lashings of gore, violence and some nail-biting suspense, The Descent really delivers the goods.The relatively unknown all female cast are very good, especially Natalie Mendoza who plays the awesome Juno, and we do actually care for them thanks to the slow build up.So if you like your horror straight and serious, you simply must see The Descent. Check it out!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, but best horror-suspense movie since Alien? Hmmm","After seeing the reviews on Rotton Tomatoes for The Descent, I was pretty excited to check it out. After all, any movie touted as the best horror/suspense movie since Alien will definitely get my attention. I can't remember the last time I was so excited for a horror movie.So was it that good? Well it wasn't bad, but I was a little disappointed. The first hour relies on typical, cookie-cutter formulas to extract jumps out of the audience. The character development, however, was pretty good. Once in the cave, things got better, but still, what was all the hype about? The action sequences were edited too quickly, but the feeling of claustrophobia was superb. It was hard to tell who was attacking who at times. That alone was the biggest disappointment on The Descent. If the camera kept a little more still on the sequence at hand, it may have faired better in my eyes. The actresses were pretty good, especially for unknowns, but was I scared? No, not really. And the ending left a lot to be desired. I hear the original British ending was better. I guess I need to wait until the DVD to see that. Not a bad movie by any sense of the word, but an excellent horror/suspense movie? Well.....",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Neil Marshall kicks major butt,"I had already seen Dog Soldiers, and though it has its mistakes and lowdowns, it still manages to be a pretty decent horror/action flick. Way better than a lot of stuff out of the American and Japanese market. With The Descent, Neil Marshall is on my Top 5 Horror Movie Directors list. This one is claustrophobic, has strong female characters, the scary parts are truly scary, and you actually feel so into the film you can't escape its grip. People are always looking for a frightening horror film, and this one delivers on that department. It's almost like you're inside the caverns with all those girls. You've got the resulting tension from being trapped inside the cave. You've got the drama from Sarah's tragedy. You've got that awesome use of light where you can clearly see what's going on but still feel you're surrounded by complete darkness. And you've got the intense mutant sequences, with lots of blood and clever camera movement. The way Marshall portrays the mutants is incredible. The first time you get a glimpse of one them reminded me of the moment when you first see the aliens in Signs ¬ñat the children party. Truly frightening. Another added value is that the copies showing in Mexico City are the UK copies, with the complete ending, and not the happy thing they're showing in the States. That was a clever move from the distribution company.This movie is not as gory as everyone has made it out to be. It's gory, but not unbearable or anything. At least is way gorier than Hostel.See this one at the theater. The use of light is impressive, and it adds so much to the whole experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
too gory but effective,"Neil Marshall packed the story with impressive action scenes and unbearable tension. Everything is intelligently told except for the flaw of excessive bloodshed. Apart from that, the film is OK on many levels; original for starring an all-female team, it provides convincing roles for every character. But ""The descent"" is not merely action since the director and the wonderful actresses get to unleash properly, very properly, horrific moments and tension. The audience slowly realizes that they all gotta pay attention to the other gals and that enemies are not those terrible creatures. All things considered, not a must-see film but quite interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Two in a row from Marshall,"The Director Neil Marshall has done it again, after the excellent Dog Soldiers he has again shown the Americans how to make a great horror film. The Descent is a very clever film, it builds up the tension slowly then unleashes all hell on the viewer. It is a very jumpy film! and has a good storyline that will have you thinking long after you have left the cinema. It is probably the best horror film I have seen since .... well since Dog Soldiers! Marshall seems to have had a bigger budget to work with Descent and he puts it to very good use, the Crawlers are very well done without being too OTT. My one small complaint is although the darkness of the underground caves serves to up the tension in the film it is however hard to follow some of the action. I had a similar complaint about Alien V Predator but this film is far superior to that one. You may think thats not saying much but I think AVP was very harshly treated by the critics, but I do wonder what Marshall could do with an Alien film or a Predator movie. Has Stallone got a director for Rambo IV yet? This man could do the job! Is it better than Dog Soldiers? I'll call it a draw. Roll on the next one, a World War II movie? That would be great.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Genre Exercise that Pushes All the Right Buttons,"The Descent tells the story of six sporty women in their mid-twenties who venture into the Appalachian Mountains for a pleasant day of spelunking and catching up on old times. We meet the women a day before they set off for the cave: Juno, the alpha-female jock of the group, Holly, the rock climber punk, Beth, the smart one, Rebecca and Sam, the two sisters, and Sarah, who has become the quiet one since a car accident took the lives of her husband and young daughter a year earlier. The women spend a night drinking and reminiscing, and the next morning they hike to the mouth of a nearby cave system in the woods and repel into it. They run into trouble when they find out that they have descended into an unexplored cave, and that their only known way back out of the cave has just been blocked.The Descent is a minimalist horror masterpiece. Director Neil Marshall and cinematographer Sam McCurdy create an atmosphere of constant fear using simple yet utterly effective visual techniques. The cinematography is beautiful and scary because it exploits our inherent fears of darkness, claustrophobia and disorientation. In the cave, light is like a gift, and Marshall makes us appreciate it like the women do. Without light, we are left only with our own fears of what may lurk in the darkness. That's why this movie is genuinely scary. Marshall never compromises his visual style even though it is so simple, because he knows it works. Frankly, the film didn't have the option of using many special effects because of its tiny $6.7 million budget, but Marshall manages to create several memorably nightmarish images as well as a lot of deliciously gory violence.The Descent pays homage to genre classics like Alien, Carrie, Deliverance, and The Blair Witch Project (and even a classic outside of the genre, Apocalypse Now), by incorporating elements from each without losing its own stylistic focus. As a genre exercise, the film succeeds because it establishes a style and sticks to it. For lovers of horror, this is an absolute must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Somewhat Marred by Pacing,"I went into this movie knowing that there were going to be cave creatures (because of the trailer). However, what I didn't know was that they show up about halfway through the movie. The scenes where the creatures attack are effective, but there is such a long trip (no pun intended) to get there. I don't have a problem with movies that have a slower pace, but this one didn't need it as much as others. It wasn't as if it was long for the purpose of telling a story, but it was long just because it took them a long time to climb. My joke was that the first half of the movie is just them breathing, but its actually somewhat true. If there was more background about the characters, their relationship and the tragedy we see at the beginning, it would make us care more about them. However, there is only a brief scene at the beginning showing what happened. Before the cave crawlers show up, there is a lot of silence, breathing and squeezing through holes. After they show up, its a constant frenzy, although it does have an added element of tension that was hinted at in the first half. I feel like if the movie had maintained a balance of tension, story and background about the characters, it would have been better off. For what it is, it definitely does have some parts that are somewhat emotionally resonant and some parts that are very disturbing, but there is not enough story for how long this movie was.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody scary!,"Neil Marshall is a horror fan. This superbly crafted shocker smacks of being made by someone who has spent his life thus far absorbing the great scary movies of all time. The basic plot of a group of friends fighting for their lives against a terrible foe in an inhospitable environment is hardly new (Aliens, Predator, Deliverance, Wrong Turn, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre etc), but Marshall doesn't worry about that -- he's having too good a time using every technique in the book to scare the pants off us.The first half of the film starts as an adventure story -- 6 female cavers get trapped underground and have to find their way out -- but eventually gives way to pure horror when it is revealed that the ladies are not alone: blind flesh-eating creatures dwell in the cave and they're hungry! If tense, gruelling, nail-biting horror with lashings of gore is your cup of tea, hunt this movie down immediately.With Dog Soldiers and now the Descent, Neil Marshall has proved that he is a force to be reckoned with in the world of horror. I can't wait to see what he has in store for us next.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Being the movie is very dark, what you cant see at first is built up through your auditory senses just like the characters would have. This is why I'm recommending headphones",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Subterranean Movie?,"This was one intense movie. I can't remember a girl power movie this intense. I call it a girl power movie because it starred six women that were outdoorsy risk takers.They all decided to go cave exploring being led by Juno (Natalie Mendoza). They were supposed to be going to Borenham Caves but Juno chose to take them to a totally new unexplored cave. Of course they ran into some serious trouble and the worst of that trouble came in the form of some underground creatures.The movie took a while to get to the action and the meat of the movie. The time leading up to that point was usefully spent character building and taking us inside of a wicked cave.It was nice to see the women in a strong role. Their fight and will to survive wasn't absurd to the point they were pulling off supernatural feats. It was just as it should have been: they fought with everything they had as far as energy, fortitude and weapons and they didn't just roll over and die. And at the same time you understood that they could fight because they were already tough, they didn't just morph into badass chicks simply because they were in a life or death situation.""The Descent"" was a great addition to the horror genre. This wasn't so much scary as it was an edge of your seat thriller. There were losses and triumphs and some internal conflict between the girls but I was totally dialed in to the action.

Claustrophobic horror with tonnes of potential,"Being a huge horror fan, 'The Descent' is a film that comes up again and again on ""best of horror"" lists on all sites across the internet. Whilst I do understand why, I think that 'The Descent' is generally overrated and accredited far too much within the horror genre. In this review I'll attempt to give a balanced analysis that covers all bases without revealing any major spoilers (although there will be minor ones that are in-keeping with what can be learned from reading summaries and watching trailers).'The Descent' has a lot of promise, that much is true. The cave setting makes for a very claustrophobic and apprehensive mood which is definitely one of the strong points of the movie. There are definitely some very tense scenes that are incredibly boxed in and create a sense of panic that would not be as keenly felt in a different setting. The setting also allows for some interesting lighting, which further adds to the atmosphere whilst not relating too heavily on night-vision cameras (which is a trait of horror movies I dislike).The movie is held together by a rather strong cast of female leads - Shauna Macdonald (Sarah), Natalie Mendoza (Juno), Alex Reid (Beth), Saskia Mulder (Rebecca), MyAnna Buring (Sam) and Nora-Jane Noone (Holly) - who don't over-act and play the characters reactions and behaviours convincingly. Although, the characters are completely lacking in any real substance or backstory (with the exception being Sarah and Juno who have a small amount of story invested in them), they're a pretty bog-standard set of characters for a horror movie. All of the characters do seem to suffer from the typical horror cliche of having complete lapses in logic or reason whereby they make ill-advised decisions that will have you screaming at your screen, but often these kind of silly decisions are necessary to put the characters in the kind of life or death situation the movie relies on. The relationships between the main characters are average, but more time could have been invested to creating more established friendships and interesting dynamics which would've raised the stakes and made me feel more invested.Whilst the setting and cast are adequate, the plot itself is weak. The writers seem to over-invest in Sarah's (Shauna MacDonald) trauma which takes place at the beginning of the movie and her strained relationship with Juno, when ultimately this sub-plot and attempt at character development adds nothing to the overall story and seems totally out of place. It feels that it's been thrown in there so that it isn't JUST about the cave monsters, when in reality, it is just about the cave monsters. By investing much more time and attention to the character's development and relationships with each other, it could have been a lot more interesting and there could've been a real story that people could get on-board with.There are certainly scary moments in there or rather jump-scare moments, but the build-up is lacking. For the first 40-45 minutes not much of anything happens at all, but the mood is set and the apprehension is built. Unfortunately, any build-up is very abruptly ended and after that there doesn't seem to be any sense of pacing. It's erratic and frantic, and seems to throw those over-used jump-scares in there at any given opportunity. For those that are seeking a genuinely scary movie, this doesn't deliver on that. I can imagine it would be much more effective in the cinema when it was first released since the emotion of physically being there would have been stronger and the noises would have been louder, but for home viewing, not so much.What lets this movie down the most is definitely the addition of the cave creatures. Some would ask how I can possibly say that when the entire premise of the movie is built upon the creatures, but it's this that makes the movie feel cheap and unsatisfying. Whilst the idea that there are cave dwelling creatures that lurk in caves where no human has ever been is chilling and a possible reality, the execution is poor. For starters, whilst the audience know from the get-go there's creatures in the caves based on the synopsis, the appearance of them is incredibly sudden and destroys any sense of mystery almost immediately. Secondly, the appearance and general functioning of the monsters is completely inconsistent. Whilst the characters establish rather quickly they hunt by sound and are completely blind, apparently that means that the creatures can't hear heavy breathing and gasping less than a foot away. Unlike other reviewers, I do think the creatures are scary looking, but the writers did lack in imagination when designing them and are as others have described, they're essentially bad Gollum lookalikes. Furthermore, the attempt to villanise the creatures falls short because what exactly have they done wrong? They're primal cannibal creatures that hunt prey that has wandered into their habitat. If the women had wandered into a jungle full of tigers, the result would be exactly the same. Why exactly should we root for these women to survive or kill these creatures besides the fact that the women happen to be human? The stakes just aren't there for people to invest in or root for the characters to survive over the creatures. Also, towards the end of the movie there is too much reliance on the creatures and unnecessary violence and gore ensues which really does nothing to scare or interest viewers. In fact, it's at that point that the movie begins to lose me.I saw a suggestion that this movie would have been much better if the creatures had been removed and the plot of the movie had instead been solely focused on the six women and their relationships with each other, becoming a psychological horror of sorts where the women are killed one by one and it is one of them that is doing it and it is the audience's task to guess who and why. I agree that this would have made for a much more interesting story. Not only would it have made the characters themselves more intriguing, but it would've vamped up the confusion, anxiety and fear ten fold whilst also giving the audience a mystery they can invest in that would keep them on their toes. It would have also provided an opportunity to develop a rich backstory for the characters that provides an interesting motive for the killer.Overall, 'The Descent' has a lot to offer and the potential to be a great horror, but unfortunately, the lack of plot and inclusion of cave dwelling creatures that results in pointless gore and violence, means it falls short and fails to deliver a memorable viewing experience or leave the viewer feeling anything other than relieved it's over.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

In fact, we were scared out of our seats the whole way through.The Descent was not playing very often in my area and then it dropped to one theatre so I imagined it must be mediocre but it is NOT.

"the decent horror of ""the descent""","Six thrill seeking friends explore an uncharted cave system in the Appalachian Mountains only to find themselves trapped without a map in ""The Descent"". As the all-female cast traverse into the bowels of the wilderness, or the metaphoric equivalent of Mother Nature's womb, disaster begins to strike at every turn. The film builds with a well-plotted tension rarely seen in modern horror, but unfortunately it falls apart in the latter half regardless of how deliberately orgasmic the young women's screams sound. There is a fine line between satisfying the audience for the audience's sake and by virtue of spinning a worthwhile tale. The early strengths of ""The Descent"" are squandered by uninvited guests, so to speak. No matter how much the filmmakers might believe otherwise, the heightened dangers discovered in the second half actually detract from the frightening, claustrophobic, man (or woman) versus nature realism it sets up with such skill.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

the descent: creeeeeeepy!!,"Hey all; just want to tell you people to go see the descent; a well made low budget movie! u all know the plot already, a person does not read this without some info on the storyline, so let me just get down to business.pro's - suspense: it will make you squeeze your girlfriend or boyfriend so hard they are gonna get bruises all over! This is one of those movies were you are spooked as to the point of being uncomfortable. you will laugh out loud with relief and admiration when each excited moment has passed and the characters have a little breathing room. until the next horrible scene, that is....set dressing is awesome; the light play from the torches and flashlights are in perfect equilibrium with the viewer's anxiety. Also you get a nice believable idea of what it's like to go spelunking. just kidding lol. i hope..characters: the all women ""talking"" cast is interesting and well chosen. All women seem to have some skeletons in their closets and yet they don't waste much time exploring these sleep-inducing facts and get down to the nasty parts without leaving you wondering who these girls are. nicely done; i'd say balanced is again the word here.characters: the non-speaking cast is much nastier looking and more terrifying than their female counterparts. They are very, very well done. Thats all I'm spilling about that! don't wanna spoil, uc? CONS - The script is not as natural as it could be and the same goes for the storyline. Identifying with the characters requires the viewer to feel that the actions of the characters are in their mind 'logical'. This is not always so, especially not in some critical points during the movie.The ending could have had more to it.The action scenes are certainly good but could have been better, smarter. especially the under water scene could have been more suspenseful (or deleted), and the dream scene is just kind of dumb. Also, the very gory death in the beginning is not useful other than setting the tone for some disgusting images later on.Over all this movie is very well made, with a talented picture all over!! must see for horror and suspense geeks.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good film but needed direction towards the end!!!!,"This movie did have a lot of good points, it used every horror movie tool which made for a very entertaining experience. The atmosphere was definitely set from the beginning, very jumpy and fast paced. Some of the scare tactics were exactly where you didn't expect them and the moments between where tense. Overall I enjoyed watching the movie but a couple of things threw me off. First off the friendships weren't exactly affected which was kind of misleading as this was mentioned in a few reviews I had looked at, even the back of the box said they slowly suspect each other which in my opinion happened once briefly I really expected more conflict in such an enclosed and claustrophobic atmosphere. The ending was such a disappointment, it didn't conclude anything, just left the whole thing open for a possible sequel. It felt like the movie ended with no direction, just giving you the main plot throughout and then stopped, absolutely no questions being really answered. Don't expect any bubbling queries to get closure what you learn in the first 40 minutes is all you'll learn!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The beginning of the movie was the highlight and from then on things went from semi-realistic to absurd.It seems that the writers imagination, which was somewhat disjointed, went from one idea to another with no link up, or no lead in. I understand that to be able to enjoy a horror that you need to somewhat suspend disbelief, but this movie takes that too far. The characters lack personalities and depth. They are portrayed in a rather two dimensional way which goes from one side to a complete opposite for no particular reason. You feel nothing for them and in the end aren't particularly worried what happens to any of them.Having watched various horrors throughout the eighties to present day I have to say that this is typically average for this decade, so far. It is on a par with modern day 'so called' horrors, but don't expect something different or original.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Bit Difficult To See But Good,"This movie is a bit difficult to see and follow in many parts due to the darkness and poor lighting, which leaves you asking ""what just happened?"", and thus there are bits that don't seem to make sense. And it wasn't as scary as they say it is either (I didn't find it scary at all). But all in all it was a pretty good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best horror movie in years,"Forget crap like Saw or any of the remakes that are being spewed out by Hollywood. The Descent is easily the scariest horror movie that has come out in ages. It's claustrophobic, gruesome and depressing. Neil Marshall really knows how to handle a movie well. Even the scenes when they are just caving are tense and exciting.Six friends meet up in America to go caving. Sarah, Juno, Holly, Rebecca, Beth and Sam. After a long hike, they reach the cave. They descend into the cave and begin exploring. But when there is a cave in everything goes dreadfully wrong, especially when they find out they're not alone...And boy, when they find out it is one of the scariest things ever filmed. The Crawlers are very creepy, vicious little creatures. They bite, tear and eat their victims. They are made all the more mysterious because they are mostly kept in the dark. This is where the film succeeds. The use of camera angles and lighting are perfect and make the film that much more intense. All the women can act and make us feel the right emotions for their characters.For all horror fans that haven't seen this, you MUST! This is comparable to the almighty Alien. That's how good this is. See it if you haven't! 5/5.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Aside from the ending,"Before I saw this movie, I had heard that it was really good. So I went in expecting a good movie. And although not what I expected, it was still really good.It's almost like I got to see two movies for the price of one. The first half, is like watching the movie Catacombs. It relies on claustrophobia and darkness to frighten us. Which is good, I like that. I'm not very claustrophobic, but I can feel for the characters. The second half, is more like what I was expecting. With the monsters and more jump scenes. But I liked that too, because the jump scenes weren't overused, and the creatures were crazy looking without going overboard and becoming unrealistic. Giving us more of a unrealistic scenario while keeping it within the realm of possibility.The plot was really well done, and although not very complicated, it makes for a good story. The characters were also well done, they sounded and acted pretty realistically. And you started to feel for most of them. I did think that some of them didn't really get enough screen time, and at some points it felt like the director expected us to. Using them as plot devices like we knew them really well.Overall, I think the duel identities this movie wields is what made me like it a lot more than most movies in the genre. Because it didn't run out of ideas or overuse any. It was able to keep things fresh for most of the film, and although not necessarily unpredictable, it didn't scream what was gonna happen next either.However, although the movie was good, there were a couple of things that bugged me. Most of all, the ending... I don't want to spoil anything, but anyone who has seen it will know what I mean when I say, there just isn't any justice. Ending aside I thought it was a great film. And though I'll probably sleep soundly tonight, I think it did deliver on thrills.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A near-masterpiece of slowly mounting horror and tension.,"This is a truly remarkable film. The opening is full of subtle tension and the first shock of the movie is timed impeccably and executed very believably. This early first dramatic moment is essential in reminding the viewer that this is a horror film and creates a sense of anticipation that will be sustained throughout the rest of the film's introduction. The remaining half hour or so of introductory and character-building scenes is occasionally punctuated by a cheap shock - something which I think undermines the overall slow mounting tension of the rest of the film.The film's strongest point is the way it portrays the fear of the unknown, of darkness and of confined spaces. Soon, these mundane, but very effectively conveyed, fears are eclipsed by the first glimpses of the lurking horror. This quickly brings on a change of pace and character in the film, with the amount of gore increasing considerably, though the fact that everything is shrouded in darkness mercifully hides some of the horrid details (though perhaps they are more strongly pictured in one's inner eye than when shown explicitly). The last part is composed of action-packed scenes punctuated by brief delirium, terror and anticipation. The final crescendo is triply surprising, though there is another cheap scare that almost destroys the cumulative effect.The characters are very strong for this type of film and elevate it to something above almost any other horror film you might have seen of late. The musical score works extremely well with what is going on. The photography, camera angles and camera movements are executed flawlessly.Apart from a slight overindulgence in shock scenes, which might merely be a matter of taste, and the fact that a few times the movie makers seem to underestimate the audience's intelligence, the movie is well worth watching. As an extra plus, for once the interactions between characters are important and add substantially to the tension.Some very minor spoilers follow.Firstly, the shock scenes. I am not sure why they had so many of them, but it appeared as though they felt that they just felt they had to maintain the interest of the more gaze-wandering part of the audience. On the other hand, some of the shock scenes were very realistic and useful. One such scene was the one with the crows over the corpse of the deer. Since I have once encountered a similar scene while walking around in the woods I could empathise with it quite a bit, though I must say it is not nearly as horror-inducing without the stench. But it does foreshadow the hidden threat very effectively.The cave system itself is depicted wonderfully; it gives one a sense of awe in its juxtaposition of large and small dimensions. The climbing scenes are extremely believable as far as my limited experience goes, and the dangers of wandering around in dark places are portrayed nicely, though I am not sure it is possible to get severe rope burns while wearing gloves.The creatures themselves are wonderful, though I would have preferred them to be almost completely silent minus gnawing and rending sounds, as were the monstrosities in the very similarly themed Lurking Horror.I think that sums up my complaints. Do watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Neil Marshall has proved that the horror genre is not dead.,"I can only say that the amount I paid to see The Decent was completely worth it. It has been a long time since I have been made to feel so edgy whilst watching a film. I found myself at times huddle low in my chair as a result of sheer tension and pure entertainment at it's best. Not only is The Decent one of the best horror movies I have seen it is one of the finest films I have seen too. The Script is flawless, the acting is superb and the set...unbelievable. The Decent will (without doubt) become a classic film that will stand the test of time. Move over Romero, Craven & Carpenter...There's a new Marshall in town and he don't take no *beep*.""They think it's all over...It is now"" Dog Soldiers.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Are you afraid of dark caves?,"I had heard and seen bits of Descent (2005) earlier and I was really intrigued. I was waiting to watch it again, properly this time and got the opportunity today. Descent is cave exploration gone horribly wrong but its more than that. Its about 6 friends and how humans in general react when there is danger and pandemonium ‚Äì some of us become extremely selfish and just think of ourselves and some of us show the stronger side of our personality by supporting people we are with. The movie shows how bonds between friends are broken and how they are formed. It shows levels to which one can reach to survive.Descent is a British movie mainly about 2 women ‚Äì Sarah and Juno. Sarah goes through unimaginable trauma at the start of the movie and after a year goes to explore the beautiful Appalachian mountain range caves in North Carolina, USA. The movie's locations and tone from the get go show a gloomy and brooding side and sucks you in. It isn't long before the 6 go into the cave and get trapped as a part of the cave collapses. They realize that Juno and another friend got them to a cave that is not on the system and panic sets in. And while they are trying to figure out the way out, out come the creatures ‚Äì the humanoids.These nasty beings look like humans but are some kind of mutated beings who have adapted themselves to the pitch dark and the intertwined cave system. They feed on anything that moves ‚Äì they are blind as a bat but have a keen sense of sound. The rest of the movie is about how the hunting begins and how the 6 women react to the brutal killings. This is when Sarah finds out about Juno cheating with her husband and is devastated and you see a different side of the kind, gentle person she is.Descent is gory, violent, claustrophobic and almost unsee-able as the lighting used is extremely low but that's the beauty of it ‚Äì its riveting and as a viewer you are looking at all corners of the screen to see where the attack might come from. The performances are great and the personalities come out really nicely. The movie doesn't waste anytime in getting to the horror of what the 6 friends endure and is set at a good pace. The music is great too.The only complaint I had was that it was nothing new. Maybe because I saw it this late, I was reminded of many such movies ‚Äì The hills have eyes, Jeepers creepers and many such ones. I give it a B+.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hard to find worst, sorry for all fans","The Descent.... :(When I saw the first scene, I said to myself ""whoa, this movie is going to be great""But then... what a deception, nothing really happened, no... nothing.. it was like the movie The Cave (2005), but even worse!I've tried not to stop it, it was hard, and I was relieved when it finally stopped. If you want to see a good horror movie, or whatever is this one, I'm sure you can easily find a better one.

Atmosphere!!    the best?,"Out of all the horror films I've seen, and that's a lot, this movie seems to capture that one thing that so many films seem to pass by, Atmosphere! This film brought two others to mind while I was watching it, Aliens and the Thing, these two movies set the bar when it comes to atmosphere, and this above all others is key to a great horror film. Neil Marshall seems to be a master of this, in an era when great horror films are tough to come by. From the very beginning this movie grabs you by your collar and doesn't let go. It seems to place right in the mix of everything that is happening, and emotion, what was the last horror film anyone has seen that had emotional attachment to its characters? As in Dog Soldiers, Mr. Marshall somehow builds a relationship with the characters without spending too much time doing so. So far in two films, Dog Soldiers (the best werewolf movie in my opinion), and the Descent (one of if not the best pure horror movie), Marshall has delivered sheer perfection. I applaud him in is efforts to show people how to make a great horror film, using real emotions and atmosphere, not just settling on the cheap ""jump"" thrills, though he mixes them in, its always at the perfect time and doesn't feel out of place. I could only hope that more film makers take a look at what hes done, and attempt to take some things from him. Congratulations Neil Marshall, you have become the horror master in my eyes! p.s. looking forward to Doomsday!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic horror,"I'm not going to write out huge texts this time, I watched the film 'The Descent', a classic horror film, I've already seen it once. The film is about a group of women descending into a cave in the mountain, and there are all sorts of funny things happening there, hello claustrophobes. There are quite delusional and illogical moments, but in general looks good, and leaves a pleasant aftertaste, and this is one of the most important things in films in general, 6/10.+ For the unsophisticated viewer, I think it will be scary and suspenseful enough, and there are some yearly screemers, though not all of them.

OMG!!! Pretty good movie!,"Yeah, after seeing this movie in theaters, I have rented it several times...yeah...I used to be an avid caver, so upon hearing of this movie, I was happy. Going into it I thought that it was gonna be a horrible movie but those type of movies are fun on dates, cause you can make fun of them...boy was I wrong.1) First off, the entire cast are a bunch of hot chicks, especially the Asian girl, Juno.2) Next, it shows the beauty of the Appalachian's. I lived in Blacksburg, VA for about 6 months and I think that outside of the town was gorgeous on overcast and rainy days. The movie reminded me of it sooo much.3) Drei, someone actually taking a BMW off road, AMAZING! I hate SUV's cause probably on 10% of people take them off road, but this movie took a high-end brand SUV and took it into the wilderness. That made me smile.4) The movie didn't just start killing people right away, it gave each of them personalities and stories.5) It leaves you wondering what happens to Sarah after the end. Does she snap out of her delusion and escape, do the freaks get her? (prolly the second choice of course.) 6) I don't have a number six...or do I...Anywho, I liked the movie.

"Great cave/horror film, maybe the best yet.","This film gives off a perfect sense of loss and survival while still being terrifying as it gets. It is beautiful at times and creates a hero who is doomed throughout. If you are adventurous and feel that you have to risk the dark to see the light then this movie is definitely for you. The characters are well in depth for a horror film, and the actors are definitely capable of playing the part. The situations are realistic and believable even the creatures they encounter seem to have a purpose for survival and a background that goes back to cave drawings, perhaps older than humans. this movie gives you a whole different reason to fear the dark and the things that don't rely on light to see. good luck, bring a your blanketIf this isn't the best cave survival horror flick please recommend one better.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The best horror film in years,"If you want to be scared, ""The Descent"" is a movie for you. This movie is unlike recent horror movies. The recent horror films all seem to rely on either jump scenes or abundances of gore. In ""The Descent,"" Neil Marshal has created a film that actually successfully mixes both gore and jumps, and at the same time gives you a feeling of tension throughout the entire movie. It would not be strange to say that this movie is the best horror film in a long time. Some people may even call it one of the scariest films ever.A tragic accident occurs, leaving Sarah very traumatized. One year later, six female friends reunite for a caving expedition. Their adventure soon goes horribly wrong when a collapse traps them deep underground. To make things worst, they discover that some bloodthirsty cannibalized creatures are hunting them. As their friendships deteriorate, they find themselves in a desperate struggle to survive from not only the creatures but each other as well. Can all of them make it alive or will they all end up being snacks for the creatures?This movie is intense. It starts out a little slow, during the first twenty-five minutes, in order to show a little character development, but after that, the roller coaster ride begins and it continues until the end credits. If you pretend that you are in the exact same situation as the females, you will relate to the characters and feel very claustrophobic. The feeling of claustrophobia will make you cheer for the females to escape this cave. Of course, their problem is not just exiting the cave, but also escaping from these cannibalistic creatures that live in the cave. Those creatures do not show up until about fifty minutes into the film but once they do, ""The Descent"" turns a completely new direction.Since this movie is an all-female cast, surprisingly, it does not settle on the sex and nudity factor at all. Usually you get a movie that is mostly male dominated or else you usually get something that features the females in very limited clothing and many close up shots of their butts and chests. These women did not just run around screaming throughout the movie, they were tough and could easily take care of themselves. It is weird to see a horror movie that does not feature a women's sexuality. While the women were still very attractive, their looks were not the focal point of the movie.Overall, ""The Descent"" was an amazing horror film. There is nothing to complain about in this film. It does not feature many of the typical horror movie clich√©s you would see in modern day horror films. It does its job in frightening the heck out of you. After viewing this movie, many people will probably take spelunking, or cave diving, off their ""things to do before you die"" list. ""The Descent"" is one of the best horror films in years. ""The Descent"" is extremely recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Solid British Horror.,"Very rarely do I write a review about a film, but this one really justified me doing so.I'm going to say out-right that I loved this film. I'm not a horror fan by any means, finding all the recent British crop such as 'Creep' and Hollywood's ""Boogeyman"" very poor. This wiped the floor with them.Set in an intricate cave system, the story follows six women getting trapped and trying to escape, but they are not alone. The first act follows the women from their arrival at a cabin in the middle of nowhere to the titular descent, and once down there the film really moves up a notch.This film will make you jump. One scene involving a view through a video camera made me leap out of my seat, which was a first for me, it was brilliant. The gore is strong, yet not overdone, and the characters all mostly fleshed out.The acting is strong and interesting, and the idea is a very unique spin on the trapped cave adventures. I felt it was much more interesting having the group all female.This is the second film I have seen by director Neil Marshall, after the excellent 'Dog Soldiers' and hopefully he will now get a shot in Hollywood. He's very much earned it. If I was to write a horror right now, he would at the top of my list for directing. Capable and imaginative, the man knows how to shock and create tension. Superb.The film does lose two marks for the first act. It's acceptable, but you just wait for them to get into the caves. The ending was also not too clear, but that leaves the audience to interpret for themselves, an interesting move.Overall, the best British horror since ""28 Days Later"", and certainly on par, if not better when down the caves. If directors like Marshall keep producing films of this quality, perhaps their is hope for the industry yet.-Stu",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie was awful!!!!,"After about 45 minutes of virtually no character development, and a feeble attempt for a plot. Our ""stars"" stumble upon some half-ass creation. Terribly predictable, a sorry excuse for symbolism and when some of these chicks seem to develop into super-humans with army skills and supreme killer instinct, that just about did it.

What a BAD Movie!!!,"I'm still stunned by all the positive comments I read about this movie. I don't normally watch horror movies, but I read the reviews and saw the previews and thought, ""This is definitely a huge cut above the rest"". Being a collector of DVDs, I actually bought the film. If I can't find anyone to 'give' it to, it's going in the garbage. The introduction, or pre-horror, part of the movie was really drawn out and, quite frankly, one that didn't really draw me or my partner, into the movie. I actually thought the premise for the movie was good, but poorly executed. The tension build up was quite good although when it got to the d-r-a-w-n out horror part, I'd lost any 'caring' for the characters and couldn't wait until the end.

I thought this was going to be an edge of my seat, shockingly scary horror flick, but to my amazement it was an incredibly well crafted film! I was into to the story line of the film from the very beginning. The cinematography was so well done and unconventional to most scary movies where you can tell whats coming by the music or sudden calm before a strike, but this film really kept you guessing when you were going to jump out of your seat, and combined fairly blunt scenes where it eases you into the frightening parts that still makes the hair from my neck down to my ankles stand on end.

3 Words:  Heart Stopping Terror.,"The Descent is a rare gem. It's not scary -- it's not horrifying -- It's absolutely terrifying.Within the first twenty minutes of film we have been sucked into the claustrophobic depths of hell and propelled on a roller-coaster ride that will leave you shaken and crying for mommy. No other horror film has so adeptly integrated fast-paced visuals, creatures that you wished would just die they're so hideous, and plot points that will leave your jaw hitting the floor. There should be a disclaimer at the beginning of this film to warn people who are elderly or on heart medication. But don't take my word for it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing!,"THE DESCENT completely and honestly exceeded my expectations beyond anything I could have possibly expected. The previews were so-so, but the reviews from horror fans were almost too great to ignore. As the movie's time in theaters came to a close, I wasn't sure I would get a chance to catch this flick. Luckily, STEP UP was sold out, and my friend and I saw this together. THE DESCENT is a classic. No questions asked.The characters are fleshed-out and believable. The story is intriguing and really sucks you in. The gore fits so perfectly into the film, and the scares don't feel fake or manufactured. Not much more can be said without spoiling the movie.It's one of the best horror movies around, and most definitely one of the best horror movies ever made.Somewhere along the way, THE DESCENT also manages to be pretty damn original. So if you're looking for a good horror flick, THE DESCENT is a must-see. By far the best horror film ever made, even a lot of the older classics. THE DESCENT is my favorite film of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unexpected good,"I read on IMDb a good comparison about a roller-coaster. The beginning is an introduction, but you constantly feel the tension, like you're going up on the roller-coaster. And then the movie really starts and you go down the roller-coaster real fast. The Descent is a movie which lets you think getting lost in a cave is scary, but becomes real horror. The movie uses some classic tricks and borrows from movies like Alien, Predator and Pitch Black but it works beautifully. It is a very exciting, scary movie, where the animal instincts of the women rise and where everybody thinks about themselves. It has a psychological element that doesn't quite work, but who cares? The movie just keeps on riding the roller-coaster and even when you think the ride is over it is just not quite yet. For a scary claustrophobic night which will give you the creeps, the descent is the perfect movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Average at best,"Sadly I think I was built up to think this was going to be a good, scary, creepy film. Unfortunately it was none of the above. Whilst I wouldn't go so far as to call it a bad film I can't bring myself to say it was good either.It certainly has some good moments, but sadly it has a lot of dull moments as well, some people will prefer the pace of the first half of the movie, others like me will prefer it when it picks up a bit in the second half.I think one problem was having too many characters, none of which we really get to know and therefore care about, I found it hard to care about the fate of these complete strangers. This is particularly odd as, like I mention above, the first half of the movie is very slow moving and should have been used as a chance to really get to know the characters. But to be honest I couldn't tell one character from another throughout the movie. I would have liked the movie better maybe if they had given us 3 or 4 characters and built them up with individual personalities, it seemed to be like they were only 2 different personalities out of all the characters.The second problem is, well quite frankly it's not scary, not necessarily a major problem for some movies but for a movie that had a small budget, not exactly great acting and a one sentence plot outline, it was obviously relying on being scary to get by. And thats where it falls down, yes there are a few scattered jump moments, but most of them are fake moments if you like. (sort of like the old classic, hear a noise then a cat jumps out type moments) When it actually came to the crunch the bits that should have been scary simply weren't.Rent this when it comes out if you like potholing, or are looking for a non-scary thriller, but if you are looking for a decent thriller or horror I wouldn't bother.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scared the Heck out of Me,"Six girls in their early twenties go on a caving expedition in a previously unexplored cave. When the entrance to the cave collapses, the girls must try to find another way out. However, it soon appears that they are not alone in the cave.This movie appealed to me for several reasons. First of all, it really scared me, which most horror movies unfortunately don't do. This movie brought to me some pretty vivid images that stuck to my mind for hours after watching this.Secondly, the movie went straight to the chase. As movie watchers, we are often subject to movies moralizing over certain questions, as e.g. religion and political issues, even though these issues are not part of the plot of the movie, and this moralization can sometimes be quite irritating. British-made ""The Descent"" didn't have any of this. It is clear already from the beginning that the director has one single goal¬ówhich is to scare the heck out of you.Thirdly, I'm very glad that the ""hero"" in this film isn't the average Hollywood hero who has some kind of weakness that he/she manages to overcome in the end of the film. The characters in ""The Descent"" are characters you could find in a good novel. None are pure good and none are pure evil. You actually have to use your brains in order to make up your mind what to think of them.The minus with this movie was that the plot was too thin, and even though a horror movie's main goal is to scare people, there should be a good story behind it. Since I all the same was thrilled from beginning to end, I only remove one point from the total score and give it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing horror,"When i give this movie a 9,it's for being a superb horror flick, irrespective of how good it fares as a complete movie - i'll leave that upto you. Yes, there is fiction, there are imaginary creatures (i hope they are :P ) but the thrill, the chills, and the kills are so very real that they make you jump out of your seats till the very end. The very beauty of good horror is in startling the viewer when he's least expecting it, and The Descent does a good job of it! Another plus point is that the horror is created in a situation that is totally new (atleast to me)- the darkness, the water, and the constrained paths all combine together to add to the horror. It's gory, very gory, but the grit and determination of the characters seeps into you till the point when you yourself want to take a pickaxe and join them in their crusade against the god-knows-what-they-are-called! Definitely not for the weak-hearted! If you want to get the best out of it, do what i do with every horror flick: rent a DVD, pump up the volume, lock yourself in your room, turn off the lights...and let the scares begin !!!! You'll have the scare of your life, I guarantee !",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
My fave horror,"I love this movie - the strong female cast (personal faves Shauna McDonald and the VERY hot Natalie Mendoza), its a wonderful and believable story, and the monsters almost have a credible origin.The ending is fantastic and Neil Marshall has a habit of making full on gory films however with a ton of fun as well.Very disturbing - in terms of both the horror and the behaviour of some of the characters towards each other.Watch the making of - where the actors all see ""Scar"" for the first time - their genuinely terrified reaction is priceless.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent Film and Very Scary,"Neil Marshall has done it again! Dog Soldiers was a masterpiece - a werewolf and soldiers film for the boys. The Descent is a film for the girls. Actually, that's not fair. This film is fantastic! Like Dog Soldiers, it doesn't rely on a massive budget. It relies on a good story to do the job.The Descent tells the story of a group of girls who go exploring an uncharted cave and find something that they don't really want to encounter. I'm not going to say anymore because that's all I knew about the film when I watched it and I thought it was brilliant. And the ending is superb.When I write a horror novel I want Neil Marshall to turn it into a film. He is a genius.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A few flaws but a very entertaining scare fest!,"When I saw the trailer for this film at the cinema, I thought it looked quite interesting. But the main reason for watching it was because on the trailer on the TV, it said that the film magazine 'Empire' rated the film five stars. I still have to actually see if this is true or not. And did it deserve five stars? In some cases yes.The story was a very good one but confusing in some places. Six women go on a caving trip and get trapped in by a rock fall. Nothing out of the ordinary I hear you say. But in this deep and mysterious cave with them are evolved humans, humans that want to kill and eat these women. A thing that I find very strange to see is that the cast are mostly British women, and genuine British women also, not Americans trying to put on an accent. This impressed me quite a lot. But a couple of confusing parts put doubt in my mind a bit whilst watching the movie. Did one of the other women cavers have an affair with Sarah's husband? And what was the whole deal with the chain saying ""Live every day""? This seemed to have a big effect on the film in some way, but I couldn't pick it out. But one thing that I do applaud about the film, was the fact that Sarah's dead daughter did not mix with the film too much. I thought that the ending would be that either the deceased daughter would turn out evil in some way, or that she would help her mother escape.The acting was quite good throughout, apart from a couple of scenes. Especially the scene when Sarah first saw the blood thirsty human, the acting went into a downward direction. But, where the acting failed, the scares succeeded. This film was absolutely petrifying to say the least and well pulled off. The fear that you are trapped in a dark, wet and unknown cave is bad enough, but the addition of murderous humans at every turn really is ghastly. The amount of times I jumped was amazing.The killers look a lot like Gollum from The Lord of the Rings trilogy. And the fact that they live in the darkness underground, suggests to me that the writer has watched the trilogy too many times. In a few scenes near the end, Sarah has the look of 'Carrie' from the horror movie. I do not know if this was meant to be, but it struck me for a second. Also, the fight scenes were a bit hard to make out as the camera was very shaky and it constantly kept switching angles. This hurt my head a bit. There was quite a poor display of CGI also, especially with the appearance of the bats and when the women were abseiling down the hole. When the credits came up, it said that one of the killers was called Scar. I thought that this was very peculiar indeed, as not once throughout the movie did anyone mention its name.Overall, this movie was a great movie and well worth watching. But expect to be frightened severely, as this film will hold you and never let go.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nice Piece of Original Horror Storytelling,"I write this in August of 2006, and unless this movie is total fluke, I anticipate to hear more of Neil Marshall. Good reviews and a nearby theater with decent parking lured me out to THE DESCENT and I'm glad I saw it. Despite an opening that too heavily resembled FINAL DESTINATION and it's offspring, this movie picks up a completely original concept and runs away with it. If you've seen the trailers or read most of the reviews, you already know it involved both getting stranded in a cave and monsters. What you can't anticipate is that it also bothers to invest in its characters enough to evoke something more like ALIEN and less like, well, anything less well done.I've heard the British ending is more ambiguous than the American one. From what I've read (I'll spare you the spoiler) it's not so much ambiguous as it is unfinished. The American ending is more definitive, a much needed feature to a film so thrilling. When you're gasping for breath, you want to know it's all over, finally.I walked out with my friends and we agreed (1) we had no interest in spelunking and that (2) picking apart certain logical fallacies in this movie was folly. Sit down, scare it up, and walk away thrilled, and yes, perplexed. There's a twist at the end, but it's not a ""who lives and who dies"" kind of twist. It's a bigger, moral dilemma, and an interesting choice for a genre so content with killing whomever it likes.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fabulous,"There's a dark place in everybody's deep mind, when it comes, what will you do? This movie gives us an answer.It isn't just tell a story about six females' venture, it's more about how people discover themselves. At beginning, Juno is the most brave girl among the six. But after she hurt Beth by accident, she escaped,even not said ""sorry"".What am I gonna to do if I'm in her shoes, I don't know. WHat I do know is I'll never leave other people if she's helpless. The leading lady Sarah is my favorite part in the film. She overcame the dark, she rescued herself. I wonder if the director give us a more shining end , this movie would be perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely Amazing!,"The Descent is one of the most amazing and goriest movies I have ever seen in my life. If you are a huge horror buff, or even if you are the slightest horror buff, you will like this movie.The Story: Six women go cave exploring one year after an accident of one of the women. They try to regain what they back one year ago. This movie has claustrophobia, jump scenes, scares, blood, and really cool monsters! The Acting: Wow! All six women are fantastic. I really liked Natalie Jackson Mendoza.The Direction: The direction was great. The director did very good on this one.The Look: The look is great! It has amazing cave shots, tight spaces which make you feel like you are there, and lots of other stuff.The Gore: I give the gore 8/10. It's pretty gory. Lots of ripping apart, broken limbs, decapitations, and a huge blood pool.So overall I give it 9/10. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Super movie !!,"This movie was incredible. I recommend it to anyone who is sick of the standard horror movie formula. There were about a dozen cave movies released very close to the time this one was. This is the best one. This movie was really scary. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 because I have seen no horror movie in recent memory that has broken the chain of repeditive formulas, so well. I especially recommend this movie to women, whom i think will like a horror movie that is really a horror movie and not a skin flick made to please male movie viewers.To all that may go to see this movie pay close attention, or you might miss something. Grats to the cast and crew and all the people that made this one its a winner, and not buried in over rated under talented actors, and actresses.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Awful, plain awful...","This film looks excellent from the trailer, but it could be one of the worse films I've ever seen.I am not going to give anything away about this film, mainly because there is nothing much to give away! This film is seriously lacking in a proper narrative, or any motivation for the characters being in the situation they find themselves in. As for the ""creatures"" that appear in the film, again, there is no reason for them being there, and no explanations of why.A very poor film, and a complete waste of money! I like films that are gripping, and the ability for a film to be gripping comes from its ability to make the characters believable, with explanations of their background and why they are in the situation they are in. This film does none of this, making it very bad!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
